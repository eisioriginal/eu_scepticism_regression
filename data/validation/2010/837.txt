 As it stands, the management of intergovernmental agreements between individual Member States and third countries is more complex than ever before. Not only do we not know their exact number, but since there is no obligation to inform the Commission and the other Member States, we find ourselves faced with agreements that contradict or are incompatible with EU legislation on the energy market. Consequently, a set of regulations that brings about a clear break with the past seems equally urgent. Hence, legislation should require final agreements to be notified to the Commission and made subject to its approval. Moreover, it would be a good idea if the Commission were to be granted an ex ante
 compliance check, thus avoiding any time and resources being wasted. Unfortunately, however, this approach – which is the only option that is really compatible with the very idea of the EU – is once again being steamrollered by the interests of the Member States and their desire to act freely in delicate areas like the energy sector. It is nevertheless regrettable to note that the moderate and conservative forces of this House have also taken the same position, while they should always seek to ensure that EU interests take precedence.

 The quality package proposed by the Commission aims to establish a coherent legal framework for the EU’s policy on agricultural product quality. The proposal is, overall, worthy of support, thanks especially to the changes and amendments made by this House. Specifically, it is of the utmost importance to recognise the role, importance and responsibilities of producer groups, which can and must play a crucial role in product protection and marketing according to the established standards, thereby limiting the risks of abuse or, even worse, counterfeiting, as far as possible. I feel compelled, in particular, to highlight the changes made regarding the traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) scheme. In this case, the Commission’s proposal seemed incongruous and detrimental, especially the idea to abolish TSGs without reservation of the name, forcing associations to repeat the whole bureaucratic process to get new recognition. Thanks to Parliament, good sense prevailed instead. We believe that the introduction of a simplified procedure for TSGs registered without reservation of the name can ensure their survival and, above all, extend safeguards and reduce counterfeiting, benefiting producers and consumers alike.

 The management of highly migratory fish stocks calls for the constant cooperation and direct consultation among the countries whose fleets exploit such stocks, avoiding the risk of unilateral action that could be potentially harmful to long-term resource sustainability. Moreover, the EU has the responsibility to ensure that this cooperation requirement is respected and that Member States do not take unilateral action in disregard of the general interest in the conservation of the marine ecosystem. However, beside effective measures, in order to fulfil this task it is necessary to endow the EU with appropriate monitoring tools. As with other sectors, unbridled competition among the Member States may have adverse consequences. I have thus chosen to support the measures in the directive, in particular those designed to impose quantitative restrictions on EU fish imports, in cases where the fish is caught from stocks of common interest under the supervision of a third country. Similarly, I welcome the introduction of tools that can ensure that such measures are effective, proportionate and compatible with international legislation, as well as meeting environmental, commercial, economic and social standards.

 The report is one of the cornerstones of the reform of the common fisheries policy in that it increases the sector’s competitiveness, particularly for producers. It also includes aspects of prime importance for the health and confidence of consumers in the sector. In this respect, safeguarding the interests of consumers and satisfying their demands for clarity and transparency should be the goal of our common policies, because they can become a way of encouraging people to spend. This is all the more important during a slump in sales, when all the indicators show that people tend to purchase goods in a more conscious and informed way, which means they look for quality. That is why we are firmly convinced that the product packaging should show not the date when the fish were landed but the date on which they were actually caught. The landing date, however, which is supported by the moderates and conservatives, is not only misleading for the consumer but also unduly favours large fleets that are able to stay at sea for several days over smaller vessels that can only stay at sea for a few hours. Once again, we would have expected a more rational attitude from the moderates, who seem to have given in to the interests of the larger groups. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 Negotiations on energy efficiency measures are proving increasingly difficult and complex, particularly because of some large Member States which are not always fully prepared to support ambitious agreements and perspectives which, in the short term, may give rise to costs and negative effects on their competitiveness. In this case too, despite some improvements, we are faced with a directive which, although it contributes to achieving the 20% energy efficiency target by 2020, will not be sufficient in itself (a result between 15 and 17% is estimated). In our view, there will thus have to be an increased commitment to ensuring that long-term perspectives and requirements find a way to establish themselves in the face of the selfish interests which, in the short-term, can have a strong influence on Member States’ governments and, in particular, at a time of acute economic crisis. A structural and lasting solution to this crisis must instead be sought in measures that address and solve the roots of the serious issue of energy poverty. We need to think afresh about the way out of this situation. It is not possible to return to the production and consumption models that preceded the crisis and therefore we need to be ambitious and courageous in order to create new opportunities and new jobs.

 I chose to defend and strongly support Mr Färm’s report because – in addition to its content as a whole – I would argue that it represents an extraordinary turning point both in the relationship between institutions and for the future of EU economic policy. For the first time, the European institutions have paved the way for testing project bonds, or rather for one of the instruments for which Parliament has often expressed its support. While noting that unfortunately, the conditions needed to actually start implementing European bonds in a fuller and more forceful way still do not seem to be in place, today’s report opens up the possibility of testing the will of other European institutions to following the declarations. Implementing connecting trans-European infrastructure is of key importance strategically and therefore lends itself extremely well to testing the issuance of bonds intended to finance infrastructure projects. I fully support this report, and I hope that other European institutions agree that we need to find new ways to finance strategic investments in order to relaunch the European economy.

 The entire Mediterranean basin shares the same natural environment, and its shores are connected by the same history and culture. Significant opportunities exist in southern Europe, which cannot be seized without coordination or vision. The ‘Mediterranean climate’ results in similar ecotypes: the same types of agricultural product are produced and form a single, albeit diverse, range of products. Likewise, environmental problems are the same all over. Mediterranean biodiversity is particularly abundant, but also under serious threat. Appropriate, synergistic responses are called for. Within the EU, the Mediterranean area is unstructured and its performance in terms of cooperation and interconnection is very poor. Moreover, outside the gates of the EU, those populations living in the Mediterranean region have very low standards of living, despite last year’s events. The development of these societies is an essential requirement for them, and an opportunity for Europe as it could capitalise on greater security, more ‘sustainable’ control of immigration flows and direct participation in this growth area. This would positively impact on the performance of its own economy. For these and many other reasons, it is important to support the establishment of a Mediterranean macro-region.

The adoption of this regulation sends a clear signal of support for the safety of the millions of European workers and citizens who travel every day on Europe’s roads. Thanks to Parliament’s hard work, significant amendments have been made to meet the demands voiced on many occasions by trade unions, workers and many small enterprises: the introduction of tachographs for all heavy goods vehicles weighing in excess of 2.8 tonnes and the introduction of weight sensors are two clear examples of the good work done during recent months within the committee and then in the Chamber. Too often, the needs of the market and strong competition between operators adversely affect working and health conditions for lorry drivers, and also seriously jeopardise the safety of the millions of European citizens on the EU’s roads and motorways. The balance that has been achieved in this regulation between the needs for security and control and the flexibility to be given to self-employed workers and small enterprises is an excellent outcome, and has therefore been broadly supported by the majority of MEPs.

 It is evident that it will be difficult to achieve the Europe 2020 goals on employment rates, and yet, in the serious crisis we are going through, the strong and effective effort needed to reverse this trend is missing from national reform programmes. Commitment to younger generations has shown no sign of a turnaround, and yet in the discussion on future cohesion policy the Union has the opportunity to specify and introduce performance mechanisms into the regulations being examined by Parliament so that every euro spent under the new multiannual financial framework (MFF) is aimed at creating new, good-quality youth employment. A European investment strategy should be launched, centred on infrastructure modernisation, human capital and laying the foundations for a sustainable economy. To finance this initiative, the Union must add additional resources to its budget: these exist and mechanisms must be found to make them available. It is therefore necessary to introduce a tax on financial transactions, to set up an EU-wide strategy to reduce fraud and tax evasion and to allow Eurobonds to be issued. Without these tools, the risk of an irreversible decline and marginalisation of Europe’s economy and policy on the world stage will become more and more real. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 I decided to vote against the report by Mr Gauzès because, once again and for the umpteenth time, it employs a rationale that I did not and do not think is valid and that, as time has gone on, has played a crucial part in the worsening of Europe’s economic and social situation. I have fought and I contest the theory that the underlying cause of the crisis is to be found in the high number of countries that have been unable to put their budgets in order. On the contrary, the facts demonstrate that this is a crisis of growth and of a lack of investment. Confronted with this reality, the recipe put to us once again is mistaken and will once again prove to be counterproductive. In the past, we have fought hard against this outlook, opposing and voting against the ‘six-pack’. Since then, faced with a deterioration in the economic and, above all, social situation, rather than championing a change of direction and a radical change of gear, we have been going backwards, casting out the economic analyses which, in reality and in contrast to those from the right which have put us in this situation, we know to be right and potentially capable of putting a stop to what is becoming an irresistibly slippery slope.

 I decided, albeit reluctantly, to vote against the report because I think it is totally insufficient and inadequate for dealing with the pressing and mounting problems that this social and economic crisis has forced upon us. I decided to vote against because I think the growth measures that the report introduces are completely insufficient. Without even considering that the golden rule, albeit in a minimalist and even innocuous form, was rejected, the other growth measures also do not seem much compared with the straitjacket of austerity and the blind respect of budgetary restraints. The redemption fund, the groundwork for eurobonds and Heading 3 have been approved by a very narrow majority, due to the staunch opposition of conservatives, who, having obtained approval for austerity measures, have done everything to boycott all references to investment. That says a lot about what the Council’s attitude will be. We must find the courage to relaunch our ideas and initiatives with fresh vigour. If not, we will be complicit in the vacuity of the conservatives and their inability to improve Europe’s future prospects. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

Madam President, that the situation is dramatic is there for all to see. Add to this drama the fact that there is a clear gap between what we say, denounce and debate in this House and in the other European institutions and what we tangibly do for the younger generations in Europe. It is this gap that we have to close; this is the effort we have to make. In this regard, I propose two questions and two corresponding suggestions. The first is this. Can we bring in a constraint, even a legally binding one, such that in the coming years or months, every euro spent must be on policies for youth employment, thus creating the conditions for a true European platform/plan for youth employment? Let us not forget that the resources at our disposal are very limited. The second is that in the coming weeks, project bonds worth EUR 230 million are due to be issued. Can we give priority to projects which are able to increase youth employment in the short term? Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 The report proposes to help the Member States most affected by the financial crisis and unable to guarantee the necessary private funding for completing revenue-generating infrastructures. Private partners are not in a position to invest due to liquidity problems and the difficulties in accessing loans, so part of individual Member States’ financial allocations to the Commission is to be transferred in order to create a fund to cover the risks linked to the loans. This means that, in order to allow the completion of ongoing works, some Member States will in fact deprive themselves of part of their allocated funds. As far as we are concerned, while we support the instrument, we should have preferred intervention of a more structural nature for dealing with the endemic lack of liquidity in many Member States, in order to improve expenditure performance and avoid having to resort to drastic measures that could reduce resources. In this regard we are convinced that these difficulties could be overcome by introducing a derogation from the Stability and Growth Pact, in order to allow the national cofinancing of projects considered particularly important for economic recovery and job creation.

 The resolution retraces the link between effective measures to stimulate growth and defining a clear and united EU strategy for halving tax evasion by 2020. Lost revenues caused by the underground economy has pernicious effects on the European economy and a negative impact on the amounts invested in growth and employment. By recovering these lost revenues (20% of public spending and some 105.8% of total health spending), governments could wipe out their public debt in eight or nine years. At the same time, they would be able to increase public investment, helping towards the achievement of the goals of the EU 2020 strategy. We therefore welcome EU-wide initiatives and strategies that will cut back bilateral agreements and bring an end to banking secrecy, accelerating the exchange of information. Combating tax evasion must become an absolute priority for the EU. So far, much has been said but little has been done; now is the time to take incisive action. Paying taxes is a basic civic duty and a matter of social justice that can generate the funds required for leaving the crisis behind and reviving the real economy, without once again heaping further burdens on workers and the most vulnerable sections of society.

 The updating of Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 and Regulation (EC) No 987/2009, which we are approving at first reading today, thanks to the agreement already reached with the Danish Presidency – needed to reflect the changes in the legislation of Member States on social security and coordination of social security systems – is a text that is widely supported by this House as it has succeeded in accommodating the positive needs of the sector trade unions. The clarifications regarding some fundamental concepts in the aviation sector will help and will protect airline employees against the risk of frequent changes of legislation applicable to their contract due to work patterns in the industry and seasonal demand.

 The report deserves to be supported, especially because it underlines the fact that cohesion policy – by its very nature – has to take into account the specific characteristics of regions and of outermost regions, but, more generally, that it has to take into account all specific features. The very existence of funding for the ‘cohesion’ of regions with different levels of development in fact presupposes the need to operate in situations that are structurally diverse, in terms of their geographic features or socio-economic gap. To deny this basic fact would be to deny the very aims of cohesion policy, and the report also needs to represent a reminder when the regulations for the future 2014-2020 cohesion policy are being defined. Alongside the need to focus efforts on objectives that are considered to be fundamental, it is important to remember that, in order to achieve these very objectives, the different starting conditions of the areas in which the instruments are actually operating have to be borne in mind. If this is not done, efforts could be not only in vain, but even counter-productive. In addition, the report is also an opportunity to reiterate that future funding must absolutely not be less than at present. We can only get through the crisis by revitalising investment and, even more so in disadvantaged areas, the EU institutions have a duty to prepare the ground in order to make this possible.

 The necessity for the international economy to orient itself increasingly towards a system of production based on the reduction of carbon emissions is one that is being imposed on us by the ever more imminent risk of irreparable climate change, as well as by the need to move our system of production gradually away from the consumption of finite resources. Given all that, the obstinacy with which the forces of the right have wanted to put forward the nuclear option again seems simply incomprehensible, and in many ways also outside time and history. It is outside time and history, as are all recommendations on the safety of nuclear power stations, which have several times been served up to us and promptly been refuted by the facts. It is still more unthinkable in a country such as Italy, where almost 30 years after power stations were decommissioned, we still have waste heaps that have not been disposed of and where, not long ago, a new referendum firmly rejected the reintroduction of nuclear power. We therefore demand that a correct objective, the reduction of emissions and the transition to an economy based on renewable sources, should not become the pretext for allowing a means that has proved to be unsafe and dangerous, and one which Europeans have for this reason chosen to replace, creep in again by the back door.

 Since it marks only the first step in the long and tortuous route to the adoption of the 2013 EU Budget, the adoption of the ‘general guidelines’ has to be the occasion for strongly emphasising the role of Parliament in future negotiations, especially with the Council, with the powerful aim of influencing the guidelines to be adopted by the Commission in its draft budget. It must be clear here and now that the budget approach cannot avoid the urgency of restarting sustainable growth and quality employment, in line with the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. The European Commission and the Council cannot continue down the path of austerity that leaves no margin for the requirements of economic growth capable of generating new jobs. We have the duty to identify measures supportive of growth and employment and finally go beyond the mere requirement of balancing investment and austerity. For our part, moreover, there is a pressing need to draw attention to the worrying payment situation: we must not allow a repetition of what happened in 2011 and 2012, and the Council can no longer purport to decide a priori
 the level of payments based on political considerations, without taking into account the repercussions on past commitments. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 The vote on this own-initiative report gives us the chance to emphasise the need to plan and open a Commission initiative to re-launch the Statute for a European cooperative society as soon as possible. We have to see the adoption of this report as an incentive to take action in the shortest possible timeframe and not fail to grasp the important opportunity provided by the UN having declared 2012 to be the International Year of Cooperatives. The fact that only 17 cooperatives out of around 160 000 in Europe have signed up to the Statute shows the urgency of intervening to make the Statute more attractive, though without losing sight of its most important and positive aspects. The value of cooperatives in the European economy is common knowledge and, during our debate, it became clear just why cooperatives have managed to withstand the economic crisis better than other business types. It is therefore our duty to support them and to work vigorously and consistently to promote the European cooperative society as a positive framework for the development of European cooperatives.

 It is universally accepted that, during this prolonged economic crisis, the EU institutions should lead by example in implementing austerity and rigour, starting by freezing their administrative budgets. This should be done in a manner that is both effective and tangible, so as to be credible as regards the sacrifices that we are asking our fellow citizens to make day after day. Making savings, strengthening interinstitutional cooperation, sharing best practices between institutions and modernising policies on human resources, technology and environmental policy can, and must, become strategic objectives for the European Union institutions. This vote allows us to stress once again and with greater clout the fact that we must counter the need for drastic cuts in unproductive spending by multiplying our efforts to free up and make as many more resources available as possible so that we can get the global economy back on track as soon as possible and return hope to those who now easily succumb to the sirens of populist, anti-European sentiment. Citizens’ opinions of the institutions that govern them depend on the institutions’ ability to come across as sensitive to their needs and to the current difficulties, and, most importantly, the ability to put together suitable policies in order to ensure that we recover from this crisis as soon as possible.

 Parliament’s confirmation of the guidelines for the employment policies of Member States adopted by the Council in 2010 is an act that is not completed by a mere formality, even if the committee responsible voted to follow the simplified procedure. We have had the opportunity to hold another debate on the initiatives Member States will have to adopt in order to achieve the Europe 2020 strategy objectives, and to respond, in particular, to the by now unsustainable unemployment situation that young Europeans, more than anyone else, are facing. Opportunities such as this, and the Annual Growth Survey and its transformation into ‘annual guidelines for sustainable growth’, on which we are being asked to vote, allow us to make the future of the young generations of Europeans the focus of our debate and to play an active and immediate role in the interaction between Member States and the European Commission.

 The report follows the controversial confirmation of the European programme for providing aid to the needy. The text is a compromise between those who were in favour of the programme’s continuation and those who wished to see it come to an end. Therefore, the compromise reached avoids the risk of a sudden end to the programme which would have threatened the survival of that sector of the population which is dependent on this food aid. Recent statistics have shown that the crisis is affecting increasingly large and central areas of the continent. This means that increasingly wide sections of the population in rich countries risk finding themselves in poverty. In this context, the attitude of those who, in the name of futile austerity, insist on rejecting such important interventions which have such a limited impact on the EU budget seems increasingly short-sighted and counterproductive. This compromise is very welcome and a new agreement to guarantee the programme’s funding for the future would be especially welcome. In any case, the hope is to investigate the possibility of strengthening the campaign against food wastage, with a programme capable of using recovered food through distribution and rational use, and redistributing it to the weakest and most at-risk sectors.

 The crisis has highlighted the lack of direction in the dairy product market, making regulations to stabilise farmers’ incomes and improve transparency in the trade a matter of urgency. The long period of fixed quotas and high institutional prices, which created guaranteed outlets, has paralysed the market. The participants in the production chain have not been forced to respond to market indicators and had no incentive to innovate and increase productivity. However, we need to do the best we can to secure a smooth transition to the complete abolition of quotas, avoiding an overly inflexible and abrupt effect that could increase the risks faced by the sector and producers. Accordingly, the switch to advance contracts for the delivery of raw milk between producers and dairies looks to be capable of re-balancing bargaining power, particularly because it allows for joint negotiation of conditions through producer organisations. In the same vein, we welcome the possibility of planning and managing the volumes of certified quality (protected designation of origin – PDO) dairy products, as requested by Parliament. Consequently, it is essential that the urgent reform of the system does not cause problems for producers of the very best of the EU exports. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 I should like to point out the most positive aspects of this report, which offer a good rendering of Parliament’s position on the growth and employment survey. It is very important that the Commission, the Council and the Member States take all necessary steps to ensure that the headline targets of the Europe 2020 strategy are met on employment, education and poverty reduction. In particular, the level of youth unemployment in Europe means that specific measures need to be taken as a matter of urgency and the report puts forward a helpful method to support young people, ensuring that every young person in the EU is offered a job, an apprenticeship or additional training after a maximum period of four months’ unemployment. In terms of instruments capable of providing for financial cover, the report also calls for the introduction of a tax on financial transactions, which the report claims is one issue where the EU cannot remain inactive and to which Parliament must offer robust support. Lastly, it is important to strengthen Parliament’s role in identifying instruments for growth, which is the reason for the clear request to the Commission to transform the Annual Growth Survey into Annual Sustainable Growth Guidelines in future years, thereby allowing us to propose amendments.

 By adopting this report and the corresponding report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs (EMPL), Parliament has taken up very clear positions vis-à-vis the Commission and the Council with regard to the policies that must be in place as soon as possible in order to boost growth and employment. Too many Member States have lost sight of the headline targets of the Europe 2020 objectives on employment, education and reducing poverty. They have focused solely on the sovereign debt crisis and remained blind to the fact that only medium- and long-term measures capable of fuelling growth – namely, education, research, innovation and energy – can provide the answers to the tough period that the Union has been going through for too long. The call for the introduction of project bonds to finance key infrastructure projects, as well as the call in EMPL’s report for the introduction of a tax on financial transactions are useful proposals that can no longer be delayed, and Parliament is ready to get behind them. Lastly, the proposal on making the Annual Growth Survey subject to a codecision procedure does justice to the fundamental role that Parliament could have in the debate on the future of European growth and identifying development policies.

 The directive is certainly progressing towards better management of humanitarian funds, starting with improved transparency and more vigorous checks to prevent fraud and corruption. Above all, it is essential to take action to remedy the general character of the reports submitted, from which it is particularly difficult to obtain sufficient information on the results, output and outcome of projects. Furthermore, I welcome the report’s strong emphasis on the need to create continuity between emergency interventions and development programmes. In particular, it might be worthwhile considering a period of cooperation between emergency bodies and development bodies by implementing some form of transfer of deliveries. It is only with difficulty that those who effectively manage emergencies then also prove ready to deal with the problems associated with development projects. It is vital to go beyond the current system which risks creating discontinuity, cancelling out or undermining the potential long-term results. Lastly, the call for greater visibility for actions, not for ‘publicity’ purposes, but to enable better streamlining of interventions, is valuable and should be supported. This is why I voted in favour, and we must hope that account is taken of the recommendations contained in the report during the process of reform of the framework partnership agreement (FPA).

 A regulation defining collective redress is not only desirable but it is also urgent and cannot be delayed, especially when we consider that, in the majority of cases, the ‘collective’ victims come from the weakest sections of the population, both in terms of education and from an economic perspective. This implies that, in the majority of cases, the infringements perpetrated against these groups go unpunished due to economic barriers (the cost of an individual case being disproportionate to the possible compensation) and psychological ones (fears about the length of procedures) and difficulties in accessing the necessary information. Vice versa, bundling the claims would not only strengthen their legal position but would also make it possible to simplify the processes and reduce their costs. On the other hand, there remain quite a few problems, both with regard to the different jurisdictions in individual Member States and to the need to curb misuse of the instrument. In any event, it is advisable for the EU to have a common horizontal approach to the issue, without following the US class action model and without amending national laws, and to establish a horizontal reference framework instrument that enables citizens and companies to enforce their rights under EU legislation.

 First of all, I must point out that I intend to vote in favour of the resolution, even if only in order to maintain the unity of Parliament and to strengthen the position of its President within the European institutions. In this sense, I appreciate the reference to the failure to involve the President of Parliament in the informal meetings held as part of the European summits, an infringement of rights that should be quite rightly condemned and deplored. The problem is also one of defending and reinforcing the positions of political groups fighting for a united Europe, which are confident that the crisis can only be satisfactorily resolved if tackled in a unified manner and if the risk of nationalistic, egotistical breakaway tendencies is prevented. Every day, these groups, particularly in some areas of continental Europe, have to deal with demagogical and populist propaganda that denigrates the EU and its institutions. Our vote is also one of support for these forces. However, it is also important to emphasise that Europe cannot be bound up and represented only by the austerity measures in the ‘six-pack’, a measure we opposed because we felt it was wrong, and which we still believe to be both incomplete and inadequate. We are therefore voting for a strong and united Europe that will once more combine growth and social equity. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 The report results from complaints submitted by European citizens and shows how weak the role of the European institutions and their directives can be if they are not adequately backed up by a comprehensive monitoring network. Accordingly, the report primarily represents an extraordinary demonstration of how a democratic process originating from the grassroots can work and bring results. In particular, the report highlights the serious delays in implementing the Waste Directive in some areas of Europe, as well as numerous violations of it, including: excessive dependence on landfills, in breach of waste disposal policies; a lack of transparency in procedures for assessing the impact on the environment; and the inaccessibility of information for citizens. In any case, the recent issues affecting Campania – one of the regions discussed in the report – have shown that tangible results can be achieved if the EU method is pursued to fruition, using all the available – and perhaps coercive – tools, making it possible to overcome flaws and structural shortcomings. The role of citizens and their petitions is to be welcomed, but even more so the ability of the European institutions to fully comprehend their strength and their role. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 The growing number of countries with which the EU has reached an agreement on the protection of geographical indications (GIs) must be welcomed. The results of this go well beyond economic figures and reflect on the prestige and good name of the outstanding products of European agriculture and foodstuff production. All too often, instances of vacatio legis
 enable the international distribution of brands that fraudulently imitate the packaging of GI products, even though they do not match their characteristics. This is misleading for consumers and hurts both the profits and the image of businesses that strive every day to keep up the quality standards of protected goods. Recently, a striking case involved the exportation to the United States of fake San Marziano tomatoes. Even faced with the evidence of this abuse, the Commission admitted it could not step in because there is no bilateral agreement in place with the US for the protection of registered trademarks; for the right to protection to be granted, we would have had to appeal under the relevant US regulations. This is a paradoxical situation, which needs to be sorted out in short order. By voting in favour of this recommendation, we want to take the opportunity to ask that the time required to manage these agreements be cut down. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

The exponential growth in waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) means that hard-hitting changes to the legislation governing its recycling and production cannot be put off. The growth in the sector is directly proportional to the effect on the Europe 2020 objectives for a resource-efficient economy: to achieve this, national legislation is no longer sufficient; what is needed is systematic European legislation. In line with these objectives, in addition to avoiding further damage to the environment and in order to hold on to precious resources, what we need are high collection rates, appropriate recycling standards, targeted action against illegal exports and a fairer distribution of responsibilities and costs between producers, consumers and public authorities. Parliament’s amended text seems to be in line with these requirements and, in addition, puts forward two particularly sensitive aspects that deserve attention and support. Firstly, it includes eco-design, not only with regard to energy consumption standards, but also with regard to a simplification of the procedures for dismantling or recovery of raw materials. Equally important is the requirement for the costs incurred in the recovery and treatment of raw materials to become an integral part of the product’s price, so as to form an incentive for the purchase of products with lower impacts. I voted for this recommendation for these reasons. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 The report is part of the debate on the CAP 2020 reform, seeking to guide its content, in order to better adapt it to the significant challenges that farmers will face, and seeking to turn those challenges from potential risk factors into opportunities to advance the process to transform agriculture in an environmentally sustainable and energy-efficient way. To achieve these results, without jeopardising the survival of a large portion of small operators, especially those located in the outermost areas of the continent, it is necessary to take action on those levers that make running farms economically sustainable. The report sets out actions to eliminate distortions which, upstream, limit farms’ profitability. All Eurostat findings come together to show the disparity between the increase in input costs and that of farm gate prices. The report, which I voted in favour of, has the merit of precisely indicating the sectors for action, both hoping for an enhanced and more constant commitment to tackling the formation of cartels among suppliers of the main inputs (seeds and fertilisers), and setting out an environmentally sustainable and economically beneficial transformation of resource supply systems.

 That the level reached by the data on food waste has an ethical significance, as well as a social, economic and environmental one, is no longer surprising. Yet, despite the ever increasing amounts – according to Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) estimates, it may even reach 50% of the total produced – of goods lost along the entire food chain, in Europe, there is still no clear, unambiguous and uniform definition of the concept of ‘food waste’. As if that were not enough, just a few months ago, we had to fight a fierce battle to refinance the fund for the distribution of food to the needy. In contrast to this is the data, deplorable in many ways, according to which Europeans and North Americans waste up to 115 kilograms of food per capita. This situation is no longer acceptable but, at the same time, it is hard to resolve. One of the main virtues of this report is that it does not reduce the problem to its most obvious manifestation – waste generated by the end consumer – which, however deplorable, is but one part of a broader and more complex problem. Conversely, we need to identify intervention strategies tailored to the specific causes of waste for each of the five sectors (production, storage, processing, distribution, consumption) that make up the food supply chain.

 The work carried out at the conciliation table by the European Parliament delegation is both praiseworthy and positive. The financial conditions of Member States meant that no more could have been achieved. Yet difficult times like these require the will and the courage to make innovative political choices that in some ways represent a break with the past. The conservatism of some Member States (especially, but not only Germany) is dangerously slowing down the process leading to the introduction of measures which, conversely, increasingly appear to be both urgent and unavoidable. At the same time as the budget lines were being approved, not without difficulty, the Commission was beginning consultations about the eurobonds, which were met with a negative reaction by some national governments. However, eurobonds are just part of the possible solution. In the 2012 budget, the evident widening of the gap between commitments for appropriations and payments is symptomatic of how the current system of delivering EU resources is inefficient and inadequate, and that it is therefore time it was changed to reflect an actual system of own resources based not only on the tax on financial transactions (TFT) and a new value-added tax (VAT), but also on a new way of taxing energy sources.

 The need to introduce a framework of legal certainty that would oversee a common practice, in other words, the use of a financial instrument which was included in the previous general regulation and not in Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 and which has continued to play an important part in the management of unit trusts, is in response to clear evidence of its functionality. It is no coincidence that Member States have continued to use them, even in the absence of clear indications. It was therefore certainly urgent to clarify and increase the transparency of procedures. However, we wish to express particular support for the provision for re-use of the reimbursed assistance, which would be managed in a separate account and used for the same purposes. This instrument would guarantee suitable and effective reinvestment of the funds, and could also be a way to alleviate pressure on cofinancing by Member States. Overall, the granting of repayable funds and the setting up of a special credit line for individual beneficiaries to use both seem to be moving towards an expansion of the range of funding possibilities, which is all the more important at a time of serious financial difficulty for many Member States. For this reason, I have to support this report. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 There can be no disagreement with support for a measure which represents a real and substantial breath of fresh air for Member States with the greatest economic and financial difficulties. In the same way, there can be no opposition to backing a measure which represents an attempt to maximise the use of European funding, avoiding the risk of funds not being spent due to a lack of available funds on the part of Member States, and of a consequent further deterioration and weakening of economic and social conditions. Although limited to Member States that have had access to financial stability mechanisms, the measure should therefore be supported and approved without further ado. However, this does not mean that we should not draw attention to the fact that it is a demonstration of the failure of the stability pact and ‘six-pack’ as wished for and approved by the right-wing majority in the Commission and Parliament. More specifically, this ‘contingent’ action restricts itself to mitigating the effects, which are, by their nature, ‘structural’, of the vicious cycle created, in particular, by the failure to exclude appropriations for investments from the rigid criteria of the stability pact, also because of the failure to introduce a golden rule on investments. Stop-gap measures are welcome, provided we are aware that the strategy pursued was wrong and that corrective structural measures are urgently required. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 In the European collective mentality, the image of literacy as a goal to achieve suggests areas outside the continent or, at the most, limited, peripheral areas. However, it is also a problem in ‘western’ and ‘industrialised’ areas. It is no coincidence that recent studies have shown that in Italy, 71% of the population is below the minimum comprehension threshold of an average difficulty text. Despite these statistics, no coordinated policies to tackle the problem have been found in the individual Member States, which will make it difficult to achieve the target set for 2020. It is important, in line with the European platform for tackling poverty, to underline that there is a need to coordinate the two areas of action, creating a synergy able to reverse the rate at which ‘poverty’ affects the percentages of early school leaving and, more generally, of poor school attendance. National governments, in the grip of the financial crisis, have almost all reduced educational funding. This risks boosting the vicious cycle of ‘low school attendance-unemployment’. This is why it has become so much more important for the European institutions to take action and provide support, through the targeted use of Structural Funds and implementation of alternative financial instruments.

 It would be unthinkable, including in terms of the developments under the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), not to support the association agreement with Ukraine, which, moreover, has a fundamental strategic role in such an essential sector as energy resources. However, the well-known political and judicial issues cannot be considered of secondary import. Hence, as Ms Tymoshenko herself said recently, we need to strengthen the political significance, which must go hand in hand with the economic and commercial aspects of the agreement. As the document under scrutiny suggests, this must become the mechanism for incentivising development and the onward march of reform. This is by no means an easy path, as the rejection of the amendment decriminalising the abuse of power and the continued imprisonment of Ms Tymoshenko and other opposition figures show. This is not a matter of meddling in the domestic affairs of a sovereign state, but of shrewd and active supervision of the personal and political freedoms that are basic conditions for rapprochement with the EU. Support for the agreement must therefore be understood in this light, without losing any respect for the rights of minorities and democratic principles, which are, in any case, well expressed in the document itself.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, policies to tackle new and old forms of poverty, which, unfortunately, are on the rise in today’s Europe and in the Europe of the crisis of recent times, along with one-sided austerity policies, above all, on the part of the Member States, require new financial commitments and new resources not only with regard to the European budget, including within the framework of financial prospects, but also with regard to European policies – as just mentioned – from the European Social Fund to the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), as well as to the budgets of individual Member States. Above all, as regards individual states, we should utilise the European Semester to monitor year after year, in practical terms, the policies they dedicate to this fundamental challenge. In order to give credibility to the objective to reduce poverty and social exclusion for around 20 million European citizens, it is necessary to have coherence between the enormous resources that Europe and the States should make available and the concrete policies that we can put into practice. It is calculated that around EUR 2 billion are needed between now and 2020 in order to realise the objectives that we are proposing. The challenge that we as the Committee on Budgets are identifying and focusing on is this: coherence between the financial resources that we make available and the policies that we put into practice. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D
),

In the context of the very broadest aims of the Europe 2020 strategy, the European platform against poverty and social exclusion should be thought of in view of the unique characteristics of what is an intrinsically complex, multifaceted and multiform phenomenon which, as the economic crisis has made itself felt, has taken on even more striking and worrying dimensions. The gradual increase in the number of areas affected, or at risk of being dragged into a state of poverty or ‘severe material deprivation’ as a result of the financial crisis, means that we have to strengthen and differentiate our responses. Vice-versa, we are watching with concern at the distortive effects which, in this sector too, may be caused by the reckless decision not to exclude investment from Stability Pact funds. Even in a context of scarce financial resources, the platform offers a positive message that is in line with the need to develop specific, Europe-wide, socio-economic initiatives, moving beyond mere emergency action or temporary support and thus heralding a genuine reversal of this trend. Specifically, it highlights the importance of launching a much sought-after global initiative to bring in a guaranteed minimum income rule, which – if it can be adjusted to and made compatible with economic development – will help reduce and prevent poverty and social exclusion.

 Demographic change, as underlined in the Fifth Report on cohesion, poses one of the central challenges for the future of the European socio-economic system, and it is a challenge with a wide territorial context that cuts deeply into the management of services and infrastructures. Without in any way detracting from the task of individual Member States, this challenge, which could also become an opportunity, directly implicates European institutions and, in particular, regional development policies. These policies are characterised by different strategies that are adapted to guaranteeing the demands and needs, respectively, of areas with populations on the rise and in decline, as well as the varying needs of urban and rural areas. In response to these challenges, European Funds (both the ERDF and the ESF) can be used comprehensively to ensure that equilibrium is restored to demands and, to this end, we should welcome the prospect of also making use of specific demographic indicators to assign European funds as well as to redistribute finances at the level of individual States. I express my vote in favour in the hope for policies capable of correlating the effects of demographic change with the fight against old and new poverty. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

The exhaust emission limits for agricultural and forestry tractors were changed in 2005. When that change was introduced, the requirements were also applied in full to agricultural tractor engines without any specific impact assessment concerning the technical feasibility of doing so. However, there have clearly been difficulties in applying the measure to tractors – generically called ‘narrow-track tractors’ – used for automated cultivation procedures on terrain which presents certain distinctive features, such as orchards and vineyards. The technical impossibility of installing compliant engines, whilst maintaining the tractors’ operational functionality and manoeuvrability, if not corrected, would cause serious difficulties to some of the most advanced and productive agricultural sectors, further exacerbating the effects of the ongoing economic crisis. In complete compliance with the European policy to fight for emission reduction, which needs to be developed, the current unusual situation in the economy in general, and the sector in particular, fully justifies the decision to postpone the application of the standards for three years. This will allow the parallel development of the essential design and technology necessary for the application, also to narrow-track tractors, of after-treatment systems able to guarantee compliance with emission restrictions, without compromising operational requirements.

 The procedure which began with the publication of the Green Paper on the future of value-added tax (VAT) has to be supported. The need to restructure the system rules out any further delays, as the mechanism introduced on a provisional basis has proved to have numerous shortcomings, particularly with regard to the risk of fraud. The hope for the future is that a new VAT system, together with the taxation of financial transactions, will, as the Commission claims, become an important own resource for the European budget. In the meantime, we invite the Commission to act quickly and to continue along its chosen path to the end, actively encouraging Member States to put in place all the necessary preliminary conditions in order to avoid multiple and overlapping elements and to allow for smoother bureaucratic procedures and reduced administration costs. In times of trouble, it is important to devote significant energies to fighting the waste of resources caused by evasion and fraud. Therefore, I support the report by Mr Casa, and hope that in its proposal, the Commission will take due account, above all, of the call to adopt mechanisms to make cross-border fraud control less random, by making optimal use of mechanisms that have already been tried and tested in individual Member States, or by using all the resources made available by the latest technology.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the structure of the cohesion policy we are debating today is very commendable. I would like to focus these few comments on three issues. Firstly, I consider cohesion policy to be one of the fundamental tools for reducing imbalances between and within Member States. It is therefore also one of the fundamental policies for combating the long economic and financial crisis that we have been experiencing for some years now. Secondly, I think the idea of involving new regions and citizens in cohesion policy is a sound one. However, we would do well to discuss these issues with a clearer idea of how much this new policy will cost, what effects it will have on general cohesion policy, and how we are going to distribute the resources in the context of the reform of the financial perspective from here to 2020. Finally, I think the central role of the urban issue in cohesion policy is decisive. It is important to have made some progress in this direction with Mr Vlasák’s report, with which I strongly agree, and I believe that this report will allow us to better define the legal framework of the urban issue and also to introduce tools such as the municipal operational programmes as operational programmes capable of giving a new quality to cohesion policy. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are about to vote on a highly important strategic document that provides a solid framework of reference for financial perspectives after 2013. It begins with the request for coherence between objectives and instruments, and between the new role that the European institutions must perform – in the light of the Treaty of Lisbon and the recession – and the resources that, together, we decide to invest. Such coherence also implies a serious response to the demand for innovation from the public, from the recipients of EU policies, and from Europe’s social groups and industries. We did the same for cohesion, which is a crucial issue for deciding what we want the European Union to be in the coming years. Experience shows that cohesion is now a vital nexus of the European project, and an important asset for everyone to safeguard, protect and renew. On this front, the effort made on the idea of introducing an intermediate category of regions is particularly important, above all, because in a number of cases, the years of recession that we are emerging from have intensified internal divisions, further increasing the importance of effective and adequate support for less developed regions in Europe, combating wastage and bringing development policy sharply into focus. However, I maintain that the challenge of intermediate categories and the safeguard clause is one that we must take on in order to begin a new phase in Europe’s cohesion policy and also to realise, within the cohesion policy, the more balanced and sustainable development that we want to assure for Europe over the coming years.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Ivan. The report lists the innovations introduced in the changes to control and reporting systems. These too bring out a greatly varied picture, especially in terms of Member States’ reporting of irregularities and fraud. The report repeatedly highlights the unusually low levels of fraud and irregularity reported by various countries in relation to agricultural expenditure, structural funds and pre-accession funds. It is here that we really must have some clarification on the statistics which have been submitted. The context is made more complicated by the unresolved inefficiencies in recovering losses. In any case, one figure seems clear and confirms a long-running trend. The struggle for legality and transparency in the expenditure of European resources, in comparison to tax avoidance and evasion, cannot yet count on the full collaboration of Member States and governments with the European institutions. In this light, it seems that the calls for reform of the EU’s public procurement rules and the need for what I would call a public European register for the beneficiaries of EU funds are timely. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the economic, social and financial crisis of the last few months and years, the new Treaty of Lisbon with its new powers, and the challenge we have set ourselves with Europe 2020, require the mobilisation of massive new financial resources. The paradox we are witnessing, including in this debate, is that right now, both the Commission and the Council appear to be silent and incapable of deciding and making choices. However, we know that if we want to come out of this difficult economic and social phase, if we want to address the major issues of the environment, the development of cohesion policy and agriculture in the coming years, then we need to invest more heavily in Europe and Europe’s function, and hence its essential function, which is to say, its budget. To do so, we must not be afraid to discuss, even at a time of budgetary restrictions, the idea of investing more heavily in resources and to have the strength and ability to develop debate and discussion that tackle the issue of increasing resources and that of more effective and flexible use of resources. This is the challenge we face. Andrea Cozzolino,  
rapporteur. 
− (IT) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when the Treaty of Lisbon is giving Europe a more incisive role in the lives of millions of Europeans, the challenge of transparency and legality is crucial. Hence the report that we are presenting is the result of a highly coordinated effort. The work was confined, first and foremost, to the scenario outlined by the Court of Auditors, whereby the financial impact of irregularities fell from more than EUR 1 billion in 2007 to EUR 783 million in 2008. The fall concerns all spending areas except direct expenditure and pre-accession funds. Areas of major concern still exist in relation to the Structural Funds too. However, absolute amounts and values alone do not tell us where the urgent problems are hidden and where the situation is under control. Our analyses and meetings over recent months have led us to prioritise two requirements. Firstly, the urgent need to make the Member States more responsible for identifying fraud and irregularities, and for sharing the information needed to combat fraud, waste and distortions in expenditure and in the collection of taxes. Secondly, the importance of presenting proposals and working hypotheses in order to make it easier to implement measures in the Member States, with administrative procedures and management strategies that give priority to the quality of the projects and to their impact on the living and working conditions of European citizens. In order to achieve these objectives, we propose that Parliament insist on certain priorities: firstly, we propose that OLAF draw up 27 profiles, analysing with due care and attention the strategies followed by each individual Member State in combating fraud and irregularities in the use of European resources, with a precise map of the authorities responsible for performing checks in each individual country and data on the quantity and quality of the checks performed and on their effects. Secondly, reducing the number of irregularities and significantly improving the regulations. We are embarking on a legislative and regulatory simplification programme, intended in particular for the Structural Funds. Moreover, the fight against corruption, financial crime and breaches of public procurement rules must be stepped up. In this year’s report we have made progress on this point with the support of the entire committee. Thanks to an intense, concerted effort, proposals have been drafted on the main problems in this area. From the relationship between the EU and tax havens, to the databases on beneficiaries of European funds, the report makes a practical contribution to increasing the transparency of expenditure and to strengthening the anti-fraud and anti-corruption strategies. Lastly, with regard to OLAF, it is crucially important to guarantee its full operational independence, the full cooperation of the Member States and an appropriate human resources strategy, which it most definitely needs. We must keep the debate alive and kicking in Europe so as to establish the role of a single European Prosecutor. To conclude, I believe it is vitally important to fight together for the transparent and efficient management of European resources. In this regard we must ensure that the problems that do exist are not exploited in any way in order to call into question instruments of fundamental importance to the European project, such as cohesion policy and development aid. Rather, we must look clearly at the problems, at the distortions that still exist in the various European spending areas and use these data to take new, determined steps forward, thereby making the management of our finances more efficient and transparent. I believe that, by making this effort, the various European institutions really will make progress in the construction of a Europe that is stronger, more integrated and able to better satisfy the needs of Europeans. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been stated, the European Court of Auditors 2008 report first and foremost gives us some positive news: the percentage of EU expenditure, characterised by high levels of irregularities, has gone down from 60% in 2005 to 31% in 2008. This is a significant result; it signals a positive approach that we must continue to follow. As far as the Structural Funds, and more specifically cohesion policies, are concerned, there continue to be problems and difficulties. I believe that we should focus our attention on these areas in the coming months and years. With regard to the Structural Funds, when compared with the Court’s analysis of the period 2000-2006, the management and monitoring systems for the period 2007-2013 are giving rise to stricter regulations and greater reliability and transparency in terms of expenditure, as well as to greater accountability on the part of the Member States. The Court of Auditors strongly emphasises the need for greater simplification. Therefore, much work needs to be done in order to further simplify the rules. Quality of economic growth and transparency in the use of Community resources are two objectives of the same battle which we need to wage. I believe we need to do this by also making our debates concerning ourselves and, above all, concerning the citizens, more public. Cohesion policies, the Structural Funds and regional policies are, and will, remain a crucial element of the European project. They have given substance to the European Union’s fundamental values. We must work together to guarantee efficiency and transparency in the coming years. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the focus is usually on the pre-summits when the summits themselves count for nothing, but in this case, we are forced to focus on the post-summit because we had understood that something important had happened. Mr Van Rompuy, if you had gone into a national parliament in any country in Europe and made the speech that you made here today, I think people throughout Europe would have understood precisely the opposite of what they had read in the newspapers three days ago, that you had made Europe take a giant step forwards. I think it is essential to come here to this House not only to tell us what happened at the summit, but also to say what the Council intends to do after this summit. If you do not tell us that, you will be throwing away the chance to tell the European public that we are working towards a united Europe and to getting a step closer to rescuing the countries in difficulty. In your reply, Mr Van Rompuy, I would also like you to tell us exactly what you think of the position taken by the Dutch and Finnish Governments. It is your duty to say what your thoughts are on that, because otherwise we will have the impression that the Council ended with a statement that does not correspond to any genuine political will. You should be very careful about this, as I hope not too many journalists heard it, because you know how much influence the media has these days on the fate of countries and the evolution of their spreads.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, you were quite right to say that this is not a perfect agreement, Ms Malmström. If we at the EU had done it ourselves we would have done it differently, but this is not a directive, it is an agreement between parties. An agreement is always better than no agreement though, and this one does help us to move forward. It will also enable further improvements, because each year a European agreement – not secret agreements like those made with all Member States – will return to Parliament and be verified by this House. Therefore, we have to acknowledge a political fact: through this agreement, Europe is negotiating with the US and comes directly under US jurisdiction.

 Mr President, the conclusions of the European Council were not what we were expecting, given that the Treaty of Lisbon does, in fact, provide the elements and possible coverage to put forward credible solutions. We had called for Eurobonds and a financial transaction tax, an increase in the bail-out fund and a review of the role of the European Central Bank. As you yourselves have said this morning, however, nothing was decided on any of those points. The Council’s response was budget discipline to curb the erosion of financial resources, but without investing in growth. This was a meagre outcome based on an agreement among 26 countries, reached after a tortuous procedure, which we have always rejected. Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, by excluding the Commission and the European Parliament, the Council chose to add a democracy deficit to the budget deficit. We have a two-speed Europe, Mr President: the Europe of the Member States and the Europe of the people. Parliament supports the Europe of the people, and I call on President Barroso to have the Commission side with us. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have understood that there are countries in the Arab world and in North Africa that need us. Public opinion demands that Europe be in touch with this wind of liberty, this eagerness for dignity, and it is a demand that is made of us and when I say ‘us’, I mean Europe. It is right for Europe to ensure that the international community is present, but that demand, the demand from these countries, is to ‘us’ directly. We can rightly undertake every diplomatic effort so that the international community intervenes, but it cannot intervene if Europe does not have a policy for the Mediterranean. We must strengthen this will to have a policy for the Mediterranean. It is said, and has been said very well, during the debate on the Syrian issue: ‘let us meet Turkey’. However, Baroness Ashton, we must have a clear idea of our relationship with Turkey, and it cannot be an intermittent relationship. One day, we want it to be close to us and the next, we do not want it close to us; this is not feasible. Europe needs to be clear on its relationship with Turkey and today, we understand how important it would have been in the past to bet on Turkey … (The President cut off the speaker) David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, to question Schengen is, in our view, to question Europe. If Europe is going to be even weaker, as right-wing governments desire, it will be increasingly tempting to ask ourselves whether remaining in Europe still makes sense, as the Italian Interior Minister, Mr Maroni, has done. The answer, however, is greater involvement of EU mechanisms. In essence, we need more Europe, not less Europe, and the Commission needs to say so more forcefully. The best of Europe was shown on Sunday night when, in an extraordinary chain of human solidarity, the people of Lampedusa saved 500 shipwrecked people who were heading towards certain death. The worst of Europe, if the news carried by The Guardian
 is confirmed, would be NATO military forces who do not intervene to save men, women and children adrift. If we are sure about which of these we prefer, Mrs Malmström, then during the European Council in June the Commission will have to convince Member States to formulate a European policy on immigration, because Europe à la carte
 would be tantamount to the collapse of the European dream. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last night, there was another tragedy in the Mediterranean. Immigrants from north Africa died trying to reach Italy and Europe. There are 130 missing and 20 bodies have already been found. When it comes to immigration, we must never forget that we are talking about men, women and children, not just numbers. There must be no more reticence; the Council and governments must act. Civil and democratic Europe must show its sorrow and, for this reason, Mr President, I ask you to invite the House to observe a minute’s silence in memory of the victims of immigration.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow’s vote is one of the steps which will soon lead to the accession of Iceland to the European Union. Iceland has made significant progress, as Mr Preda said. I will mention a few examples: the strengthening of judicial independence, a special commission of inquiry to investigate and analyse the processes that led to the collapse of the Icelandic banking system, the creation of a joint Parliamentary Committee between the European Union and Iceland, the situation regarding entry into the euro area, increased experience in the renewable energy sector. The very thorny issue of ‘Icesave remains open, and on Saturday there will be a referendum which will bring Icelanders to the polls. Although the outcome of the referendum is a matter of debate, I think it has very strong democratic value because it gives the people of Iceland a sense of responsibility and involves them even more in this delicate stage of negotiations. Although the first referendum did not bring a positive result, the Icelandic Government has worked hard to create a broad coalition capable of explaining to citizens the reason for Iceland’s commitment to reimbursing the UK and the Netherlands for the damage they suffered. Europe’s role at this time should be one of patience and respect, without exerting excessive pressure which might cause some sort of self-defence and closure in Icelandic society. With regard to fisheries and agriculture, I believe that Europe and Iceland must find the best solution to meet the criteria established in the Treaty and to preserve the Icelandic economy, ecosystems and the country’s specific characteristics. The accession of Iceland to the European Union will mean that Europe moves towards the North Pole, with significant positive effects in the political, economic, environmental and scientific fields. It is clear that belonging to Europe, sixty years on, is still an attractive possibility. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, you must have realised that this House enjoys plenty of solidarity, but this is not enough. To introduce and empower a European immigration policy, we must do together what others cannot do, in other words, achieve the consensus of governments. Take your proposals and put them before the Council. We shall support you, because you must have realised, apart from some xenophobic remarks, that you enjoy great respect and great solidarity in this House. Parliament will reaffirm this tomorrow, saying no to the refoulements
, yes to the implementation of Directive 2001/55/EC and yes to the implementation of Article 25 of that directive. Tomorrow, we will do our bit in Parliament. However we need others to do their bit; for governments to be much less selfish; for us to be seen sponsoring the solidarity needed to implement a European policy.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Mediterranean has made a dramatic return to the global political agenda and Europe has found out that it is very weak indeed. We failed to invest in a neighbourhood policy with the Middle East and the Maghreb, we did not give our backing to an area of free trade or a common immigration policy and what is happening in North Africa is having an effect on the Middle East, where the peace process has stalled. Baroness Ashton, Europe must help Israel and the Palestinians to restart negotiations on the basis of proposals that are now supported by both the Council and Parliament. The changes under way also affect Israel and, by investing in change, we can bring together security and peace. Europe must exert pressure on Israel to weaken its grip on the occupied territories and to halt the settlement policy, which is a necessary condition to restart negotiations. As we are currently seeing, these days, nobody is impervious when the desire for freedom explodes like this. Any further delay in resolving the conflict risks compromising Israeli and Palestinian hopes of reaching a fair solution and compromises the future of such a fragile area of the Mediterranean and the Middle East.

Madam President, once again, we have witnessed the inability of the Italian Government to protect the pro-European reputation of Italy and the interests of its businesses on a crucial point such as the adoption of the European patent. Twenty-five countries out of 27 and the overwhelming majority of Parliament support a proposal that regulates the field of patents and that has a real effect on the most innovative enterprises and those that are most orientated to international markets. By ruling ourselves out of this decision, we in Italy will expose our enterprises to the risk of not being suitably protected in Europe and across the world. It is quite incredible that a government that does nothing to spread Italian culture throughout the world, that cuts funds to cultural institutes and fails to value the language of the country that is host to the largest number of World Heritage Sites, can ride roughshod over the language issue while our enterprises have actually always asked for patents to be drafted only in English, which is now the lingua franca of the global economy. However, we have reached a result that allows anyone submitting patents to do so in their own language. Madam President, there was nothing that made it compulsory for Mr Barnier to force this through with such a hasty vote before the opinion of the Court of Justice which, as we know, will be expressed during the first week of March and will deal mainly with two crucial points: the use of one’s national language to defend oneself before the European Union Patent Court and the very legitimacy of creating a patent court. As we well know, these are important issues to resolve before taking any decision. Hence, the Italian delegation of the Democratic Party (PD) decided to abstain. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are pleased to have this debate with the Commission on the North African migration crisis. We have seen these people arrive in Lampedusa only to find no facilities able to receive and identify them. In fact, the Italian Government dismantled the existing reception centre and reduced the facilities there some time ago, under the banner of ‘Zero immigration’, thus preventing Italy from being able to tackle illegal immigration. We know that this problem concerns Italy, but it also concerns Europe. Considerable financial investment is needed to solve it within a coordinated policy framework, while complying with international treaties and ensuring that refugees are protected. In your response, Commissioner, I would like to know precisely when the Italian Government asked the European Commission to intervene, because there have been certain controversies, of which you are well aware.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are here today in this Chamber to remember that the European Parliament and democratic institutions must protect and support the relatives of the victims of terrorism and provide the sense of justice that European public opinion demands. In the resolution we have tabled and are shortly to vote upon, we point out that relations between Brazil and the European Union are based on mutual recognition and respect of the rule of law and of fundamental rights. There are therefore no question marks over our friendly relationship with Brazil. I should like to point out that, in Italy, the defendant, Cesare Battisti, has been found guilty of four murders. Although a fugitive, Mr Battisti had the legal assurances in his trials – which were all conducted in the presence of his defence lawyer – that the Italian justice system had run its course, with all levels of justice exhausted, and that they sentenced him to two life sentences. Mr President, even France – where Cesare Battisti had previously fled – decided back in 2004 to accept Italy’s extradition request, recognising his crimes and the corresponding sentences, because Cesare Battisti is a criminal who must be brought to justice. Brazil’s contradictory behaviour is difficult to understand, not least because the Brazilian authorities have not officially recognised him as a political refugee, which is one of the reasons to suspend the bilateral agreement between Italy and Brazil regarding extradition. This is why the decision of the Supreme Court seemed incomprehensible to the victims’ families and the wider public. Mr President, we are representing a Europe of rights and of rights for all. The victims have the right to know that those guilty of such heinous crimes will serve their sentence in the prisons of their own countries. David-Maria Sassoli,

Mr President, the situation is very serious. We think that this issue – which is also being trailed by Europe’s media – ought to be dealt with by the European Union and by Parliament, as well as urging the Commission to look into it, since it is a real humanitarian emergency. In this case, the Member States must do everything to try and help these refugees to leave that territory and we think that they could be accepted in European states. We call on the Commission to do everything possible to carry out this action, including using the funds available through the European Fund for Refugees. David-Maria Sassoli,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to add a paragraph to the resolution, which we feel is important and will not affect the structure of it too much. It concerns paragraph 9 of the joint resolution. I shall read it: ‘invites Member States to tackle this humanitarian emergency through the voluntary resettlement in the European Union of all the asylum seekers involved in this crisis; asks the European Commission to coordinate this operation and use available funding through the European Refugees Fund’.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last week we witnessed a disconcerting spectacle in the new body over which you preside: Mr Sarkozy and Mr Berlusconi called into question the treaties signed by their countries. We realised that the French President and Italian Prime Minister, in serious difficulty in their countries, wish to have a Commission that bends to their will. The former refuses to accept criticism, and the latter even wants to deny Commissioners the right to speak. We must remember, as Parliament has reminded us, that the Roma are European citizens on European soil. The treaties must be upheld. We have the instruments to do this, and we must not be afraid to open infringement procedures too. Moreover, if we do not defend the principles of European integration, how will we be able to agree on strategies to emerge from the economic crisis? The forces on the ground, Mr President, have had their say. Parliament, its Presidency and the Commission must respond to the populism advocating a fear-driven Europe with an enhanced social Europe and enhanced citizenship, and we believe this to be the challenge that this political generation must meet. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, for the second time during this parliamentary term and in this House, we find ourselves discussing the problem of press freedom. This shows, Commissioner, that it is a keenly-felt problem; it is a major problem in the eyes of the European public. I would remind you that, in May 2004, Parliament issued a resolution calling upon the Commission to take action to protect media pluralism and press freedom, but we have not heard the Commission speak up in all these years. As you know, the problem is now growing. The issues concerning Italy, Romania and Hungary are different but their background is the same. As you are well aware, Italy continues to experience a serious conflict of interest that is exacerbated by government occupation of the public broadcasting service. In Romania, the press is actually considered a threat to the nation. In Hungary, the government wishes to put journalism under scrutiny. The European institutions naturally cannot condone any government influence over the media. Freedom of information is not a commodity that can be evaluated only in accordance with market criteria. Rather, it is the public’s right to form its own opinions about politics, the quality of governments, and public life. There can be no more excuses for the European institutions; the Commission must take decisive action to reinforce common European standards. Your intervention, Commissioner, could offer European citizens the certainty that Europe is an area of rights and freedom. David-Maria Sassoli,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, members of the Council and of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, clearly, the start of accession negotiations with Iceland represents another step forward in the European integration process. We are talking about a country which has signed European partnership agreements for years, which has been a signatory to the Schengen Agreement since 1996, and which is one of the founding members of the World Trade Organisation. So far, Iceland has demonstrated that it meets many of the accession criteria, though there are some aspects that still need to be improved. I refer to the judicial system, mentioned by Mr Preda: it is important for Iceland to adopt clear mechanisms in order to ensure the independence of the judiciary and to resolve the problem of appointments of judges, prosecutors and supreme judicial authorities. The Icelandic Government must work harder: it is the Icelandic people who must be convinced about wanting to participate in the European challenge. There are, of course, some issues that still need to be defined, and one of those is whaling. The conference in Agadir on 25 June confirmed the moratorium on whaling, and Iceland must act in accordance with this decision and stop whaling even for scientific purposes, since it is often a cover for commercial whaling. Lastly, there is one point on which I think greater conviction is needed by Parliament and that is the Icesave issue, which has highlighted the need for a solid law on conflicts of interest in that country. Madam President, the negotiation stage can begin in order to reaffirm that Europe is not a geographical area or a closed system, and that, if they so desire and if they conform, the countries neighbouring Europe can participate in the development and the construction of the European project. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis is deep and Europeans are asking us for one thing: to put politics back in charge of the economy. This is the responsibility that we must take on by revitalising the Community method, safeguarding our currency and promoting measures to protect our citizens and provide employment. Making the financial markets accountable is a moral, but also a political duty for us, and Europe must speak with one voice at the forthcoming G20 summit. This is a problem that you, Mr Barroso, must address. Your Commission must endeavour to keep the governments at arm’s length and convince them that no one will emerge from the crisis on their own. United, Europe will win, or divided, it will fall. You must be like an orchestra conductor, Mr Barroso, making all the musicians play the same tune. What should the music score contain though? Firstly, regulation of the financial markets and the rating agencies, economic governance of the euro area, taxation of all financial transactions and investments for growth, and not just budget cuts. A striking example was your Commission’s positive opinion, according to the Italian Government, of Italy’s financial package, a package that will bring the local authorities to their knees. No one has ever achieved growth on the basis of budget cuts alone and today, what we need is growth. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteur, Mr Cashman, for the work he has carried out, and for reminding us of the importance of the New York summit. Europe has a great opportunity: that of presenting itself as a world partner for development. The information we have is still alarming: in 2009, a billion people suffered chronic hunger, and this figure has risen today with the economic crisis. We must add to this the damage caused by climate change, a factor that continues to magnify the problems that we have been trying to keep under control. We must recognise that the targets we set ourselves in 2000 were certainly ambitious and could only have been met by donor countries. In the light of these commitments toward developing countries, it is sad to see that some European countries are falling so far short of their agreed commitments. It is disappointing, for example, that my country – Italy – is now contributing a distressingly low 0.16% of GDP. We must introduce a binding commitment for all countries to reach 0.7 % of GDP by 2015, as established by the European Commission. All countries must feel it is their moral duty and political obligation to uphold this commitment. The outstanding work by the rapporteur, Mr Cashman, enables the European Parliament to play a key role in defending people’s dignity. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a Europe of the people and not a Europe of the States. The crisis we are experiencing is the crisis of European policy’s inability to govern the market. In order to save the euro, political institutions need to be strengthened and intergovernmental logic needs to be left behind to allow for European governance. This is not rhetoric because a few minutes ago in Berlin, German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, sounded the alarm stating that the euro is in danger. Voicing alarm without indicating strong and convincing measures risks further weakening the single currency for investors and the market and making all of Europe weaker. Imagine the response of the markets in the coming hours, considering that just minutes ago, the euro collapsed again. When we exit the House, Mr President, we may find ourselves poorer and more insecure. New European governance alone will allow us to defend the single currency, promote growth, employment and social inclusion. We must discard the old approach of coordinating national policies and equip ourselves with strong decision-making instruments. New European governance must assure three levels of intervention: a policy for growth, suitable financial instruments and emergency management. The EUR 750 billion rescue package was important but we have realised that it is not enough. Today, we need a strong political initiative that can guide the market to allow for greater mobility of the resources. The monetary and budget policies have proven inadequate in assuring productivity and competitiveness. We must not be afraid to invest, above all, in Community interest projects such as infrastructure, energy, the environment, knowledge and human capital. Mr President, Parliament has a great responsibility: to reinforce the capacity of Member States to leave intergovernmental policy behind and launch European spirit anew through its own independence.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a moment ago, a disgraceful speech was speciously made in this House against the President of the Italian Republic. I believe that the Bureau of this House should not allow people to bring national political issues into it, particularly when dealing with institutional and political matters of great importance. I would remind you – and remind all fellow Members – that the Italian Republic is not for sale, and that the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, is the guardian of the Italian Constitution. On behalf of the Italian delegation of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I call on the Bureau of this House to be more vigilant with regard to the topics debated and the speeches that are made. I am sorry that President Buzek did not intervene to stop a speech that attacked the President of the Republic, who, just one week ago, visited the European Parliament.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Italian police force last night arrested five people who were planning a mafia attack on one of our colleagues, Mr Crocetta, a Member of this Parliament and a former mayor of the Sicilian town of Gela. According to the magistrates, the attack could have taken place on any given day, starting from today, 20 January. I would remind you that the Belgian authorities have yet to provide a suitable escort for Mr Crocetta, who has been under protection in Italy for some time now, as Parliament’s Presidency is aware. I would ask the Presidency to show solidarity with our colleague on behalf of this House and of the European Parliament and to take action to ensure that Mr Crocetta receives adequate protection in his role as an MEP.

 Mr President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, the enormous tragedy that has struck Haiti requires an immediate response and many aid and rescue activities are under way, carried out by individual Member States, even if there is a good deal of competition between European countries. The new Europe with its High Representative ought to be capable of providing its own aid to the people who are suffering. The earthquake, moreover, has struck the poorest country in the western hemisphere, where 80% of the population live below the poverty line and 54% live in absolute poverty. Within this emergency, however, there is another: the emergency involving the children, the weakest sector of the population, who have been left with no family, no protection and no State. I would therefore like to call upon the High Representative for Foreign Affairs to examine actions intended to allow Haitian children up to the age of 10 to be taken in and looked after by European countries. Lady Ashton, Europe can take them in and offer them adequate living conditions; I mean for a limited period, until the conditions are adequate for them to return to their own country. All this could be organised, all this could be easy for the European countries, and it would be a fair way to respond to the need for solidarity, but also to avoid speculative and illegal actions being taken at the expense of children. We are talking about children, the most precious resource that we should protect in Haiti. David-Maria Sassoli,

Madam President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, our group is very worried by the situation in Yemen because there is a global threat there: the failed attempt to blow up a US aircraft, the threats directed towards foreign embassies and the intensification of attacks by al-Qaeda, the most recent being in Afghanistan, must be taken very seriously. Unfortunately, Yemen’s domestic situation does not help, and we should bear in mind the fact that it is one of the poorest countries in the world, with serious water shortages, high unemployment and an economy heavily dependent on revenue from oil and gas, which it is estimated will be exhausted within the next 10 years. I therefore believe action by the European Union is vital, in the shape of close collaboration between the European Commission, on humanitarian aid and development aspects, and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs, in relation to common security, collaboration with police forces and border control. I must also mention our concern over the clamp-down on representatives of the political opposition in that country, journalists and human rights defenders, which the humanitarian organisations operating in Yemen have been speaking about for a long time. Baroness Ashton, I therefore consider it a priority to ensure that humanitarian organisations can enter Yemeni territory and work in complete security. I also hope for an effort by the European Union to ensure that Yemen abides by the commitments made in 2006 at the international donors’ conference, namely to step up the process of political and economic reforms, to increase democracy and people’s living standards. Since the September 11 attack, we have realised that making at-risk areas secure depends on how much we are prepared to gamble on better living conditions. Baroness Ashton, democracy starts from here, from the ability to close the gaps between the rich countries and the poorest countries. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are preparing for the Copenhagen conference with a resolution showing our awareness that in order to tackle policies to combat climate change, it is necessary for all the geographical areas of the world to be involved. Also, it is the responsibility of the industrialised countries to establish with developing countries not only targets to be reached, but also the resources to be used to reach them. On this aspect, good work has been done in Parliament. The resolution sets out specific instruments and it is important that we have quantified the actions. The figure of EUR 30 billion proposed by us between now and 2020 can be viewed as an important figure, although it is a minimum, for supporting the initiatives of developing countries. Yesterday Mr De Boer, the United Nations negotiator, asked for USD 10 billion between now and 2012. After the choices made by the United States and China, it falls to Europe to take on new responsibilities and lead the fight against climate change. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to thank the Swedish Presidency for the work it has done and for having succeeded in putting in place the conditions for the final ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon. We sorely need the new treaty because it offers us the possibility of strengthening, of extending powers, for example, the powers of this Parliament, and of two new figures, who can represent political and institutional union. We therefore hope that the Council will be able to interpret the requests of the great European political families wisely, so that at the next meeting, an authoritative and strongly supported decision can be taken on the appointment of the persons called upon to occupy the new institutional positions envisaged by the treaty. What do we need? We need a President of the Council who is capable of guaranteeing consistency and continuity. We need a High Representative who, on the strength of his or her experience and authority, is capable of guaranteeing Europe a leading role in a multipolar world, and who, at the same time, will act as a link between the intergovernmental and the Community dimension of the Union. And then we also need a college of commissioners that is strong, united and balanced in terms of politics, geography and gender. It is particularly significant that this is happening 20 years after the fall of the Wall, the wall that divided Europe, and all this can rekindle hope in a united, strong Europe that will continue to drive the demands for solidarity and justice.

Mr President, in accordance with Rule 147 of the Rules of Procedure, I should like to remind you that, in the debate on human rights in the world in 2007, this House decided not to do as the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) proposed and make reference to persons who represent high civil or religious institutions for the purposes of strengthening political arguments. We therefore ask you to adopt the same measure with regard to the amendments to our resolution tabled by the PPE Group, which make explicit reference to the President of the Italian Republic, Giorgio Napolitano.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, every one of us is influenced by the circumstances in which we live, and you too will have been told before coming here to Brussels: ‘remember that you have a big responsibility, that we have a big responsibility’, that of making your country better. We know that our countries will be better if Europe is stronger and is able to respond with a sense of fairness to its citizens’ expectations. We are obviously aware that this is possible if we all act together; if we are able to pool our most precious resources, our Constitutions, that set of values and of legal rules, of rights, that are Europe’s true assets. So many controversies plague my country, but I would like straight away to reassure everyone that we are talking about a great democratic country, which has a great Constitution. Yesterday was a very important day for we Italians, because the Constitutional Court, faced with confusion and requests for impunity, reaffirmed a simple and time-honoured principle – that all citizens are equal before the law. However, we know that even great countries can go off course, can mix up public property with private interests. Nonetheless, we cannot allow the Member States to become weak. The right to independent information, without pressures or conditions on the part of government authorities, must be guaranteed, and this is a public good, a good for everyone, in every country. This good must be protected without hesitation by the Union. We must endeavour to provide common rules, to set limits beyond which information is no longer considered to be independent. There is an urgent need for the Union to intervene, to adopt a directive that lays down guidelines on pluralism and on the protection of a good that must be available to all. Mrs Reding, never forget that we are a Parliament and not a museum where things are left to moulder away. David-Maria Sassoli,

 As I was saying, I am glad you asked me the question because it gives me the opportunity to say that the directive that we are requesting from the Commission must be for all Member States. This is not an Italian issue: this is a European issue. I would also say that we want the question that we are to submit at Strasbourg to be amended. We want it to cover the debate on pluralism in Italy and in Europe. Thank you very much for your question. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Barrot, Mr Billström, ladies and gentlemen, we called for this debate to draw the EU’s attention to the grave violations of fundamental human rights taking place in Italy. Since May, over 1 000 migrants have been picked up at sea by the Italian authorities and handed over to Libya in the course of informal and indiscriminate refoulements without identifying the people, giving them the right to appeal or access to asylum procedures, with the danger that they will be subjected to inhumane and degrading treatment in Libya. As Commissioner Barrot confirmed when he asked Italy for details, we believe that these practices violate the fundamental principles which underpin Europe. This kind of action is compatible neither with the European Convention on Human Rights nor with Community law, particularly the Schengen Borders Code and the Repatriation Directive, nor with Italian law. Yesterday, the United Nations called on Italy to comply with international law and, also yesterday, 24 Somali and Eritrean refugees turned away by Italy lodged an appeal against Italy at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg for violating the European Convention on Human Rights. Moreover, ladies and gentlemen, illegal immigration in Italy has become a criminal offence, an aggravating circumstance. The mere fact of being a migrant entails discrimination and inequality, and gives rise to harsher punishments for the same crime. The fact of being an illegal migrant, as were the families of our Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Greek and Italian communities, blocks access to fundamental rights and to the most basic care, including health services, for fear of being reported. This is happening in Italy, Mr President, and has also been denounced by legal and constitutional experts and secular and Catholic associations. What does the Commission intend to do to end these violations? Parliament has always supported the fight against illegal immigration, but only in compliance with fundamental rights. We would like to know, Mr President, whether the Commission intends to take action on Italian legislation and examine the Italy-Libya agreement. Twenty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, we cannot allow certain governments to build new ones. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, your speech today, Mr Barroso, has not changed our opinion. Our view remains strongly negative. Throughout the years of your presidency, the Commission has shown itself to be incapable and lacking in autonomy. This was the case for the financial crisis and the same holds true for immigration policy: the safeguarding of fundamental rights and compliance with Community law must represent two sides of the same policy. You said in this Chamber that you intend to appoint a commissioner for justice and rights and a commissioner for internal affairs and immigration. Do not do that, Mr Barroso: immigration and rights must stay together so as not to endorse xenophobic policies. You have a majority here in Parliament, a right-wing majority, and clearly we are unable to identify with this majority. I understand the difficulties of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and the Democrats for Europe but, Mr Verhofstadt, do not tell us that the coherent approach that you called for in order to emerge from the crisis consists of the speed with which the Barroso Commission will be formed. It is obvious that we cannot identify with this majority. Our positions cannot be reconciled with those who do not resolutely fight for full and steadfast freedom of information, with those who do not fight to safeguard rights, and with those who view Parliament as a mere forum to represent national governments.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we have recalled in this chamber, next December the United Nations agency responsible for communications technology and information will meet in Dubai for the ITU World Conference on International Telecommunications. The aim is to renegotiate the International Telecommunication Regulations (ITRs). We cannot forget – I am pleased at the words used by Commissioner Tajani – the work that has been done so far, which cannot be up for debate, nor can we allow the authority of the European Union to be bypassed by a supranational organisation such as the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), to which, as we know, hundreds of States around the world belong, many of which are renowned for having problems linked to democracy, transparency and freedom of expression. We are not mistaken therefore in thinking that the pillars of the internet – in other words, freedom, participation, openness and innovation – are under threat. I believe it is necessary to safeguard the role of the internet and, more importantly, the role that the internet can have in reviving economic growth, as well as guaranteeing opportunities for all. Therefore, I hope the Commission will endeavour to ensure that in Dubai, Europe presents a united front and speaks with one voice. There are many controversial proposals on the table for the World Conference on International Telecommunications, particularly those that propose changes to internet governance that call into question the neutrality of the internet, with negative repercussions for consumers. The freedom of the internet or, more specifically, the freedom of expression and data protection, are therefore at risk. What some States have proposed would entitle a government to monitor not only the communications of its citizens, but even the data exchanged over its networks. It is a very small step from here to the curtailment of freedom of expression and censure, therefore I believe it is contrary to the fundamental principles of the European Union.

 I welcome this regulation, which aims to establish a series of harmonised standards on the production of agricultural and forestry vehicles. It is an excellent legislative text, in which there is the proper balance between the need to guarantee a high level of safety on the road and at work and to protect the environment. Adapting to safety standards is not just an obligation; it is an absolute necessity. This regulation moves things in the right direction, since it covers every aspect of operational safety in tractors, both as regards their movement on the road and in the performance of agricultural work. The proposed regulation significantly simplifies current legislation on approvals, replacing 24 base directives and approximately another 35 amending directives. The regulation was needed in order finally to harmonise the market for the agricultural and construction machinery sector too. I am delighted that the proposed approval at European level for all categories of vehicle takes account of cost-benefit considerations, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises.

 I voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a directive on consular protection for citizens of the Union because I believe that citizens who are abroad but whose own country is not represented should receive assistance from the diplomatic services of all Member States. Not only that, but the level of protection should be equivalent to that guaranteed by the Member State in question for its own nationals. Facilitating cooperation between diplomatic services locally, coordinating emergencies, giving out information to citizens including on the websites of the Commission and the Member States, should be objectives that the European Union should soon be able to guarantee for its own citizens.

 I warmly welcome the excellent report on passenger rights in all transport modes, which provides for clear and accurate information, transparency in ticket prices, assurance in the event of airline bankruptcy, the creation of a centre for claims and an EU-wide free direct line. Particular attention is paid to the needs of persons with reduced mobility who may, at times, be forced to pay in cases where there are inadequate facilities, and to the development of intermodal transport. I am also pleased by the inclusion of the request that the Commission should address the proliferation of unfair clauses in air carrier contracts, such as the unfair requirement that passengers must use both parts of a return air ticket in order. When the rights of passengers using coach/bus transport, dating from 2011 and not yet entered into force, are adopted, the European Union will have an integrated set of fundamental passenger rights in all transport modes. Even though the Commission takes the view that it is too soon, at this stage, to provide a single regulation covering passengers in all transport modes, I hope that Parliament’s requests will be heard by the Commission, since unfortunately we still see cases in which the rights of European travellers are inadequate.

 Mr President, could you please state clearly which article and which amendments we are voting on? After the first block, the second block and the subsequent articles lapsed. As you only said ‘five amendments’, it is not at all clear which ones you meant. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the Sehnalová report on the establishment of the security system known as eCall, as I believe it is an excellent means of preventing road accidents and more. Thanks to this system, it will also be possible from now on to reduce the congestion caused by accidents, thus preventing more accidents from occurring. I regret the delays and the lack of progress in the voluntary deployment of eCall to date and I hope that all parties involved will act simultaneously in order to establish this service. I also believe there must be coordinated awareness-raising campaigns concerning the eCall system and its benefits for European citizens, with the aim of increasing both the understanding of, and the demand for, the service.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs who worked with me to draft this important recommendation, the secretariat of the Committee on Transport and Tourism and the secretariat of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament. After almost two years of lengthy and difficult negotiations with the shadow rapporteurs, the Council and the Commission, Parliament has managed to make considerable progress, in particular, by guaranteeing greater competition between rail operators, oversight by a strong, independent national regulatory body that ensures fair competition, the requirement, for the first time, to handle complaints within a set time ranging from six to a maximum of 16 weeks, the creation of a European network of national regulatory bodies and a rendezvous clause for the establishment of a European regulatory body. Moreover, the new rules – which should also lay a solid foundation for the financing of infrastructure thanks to contracts of a minimum of five years – and the agreement that we secured to strengthen the current rules and to create a single European railway area should offer all railway undertakings fair access to a wider range of services, such as maintenance and station services, including ticket sales, in addition to providing equal access to the rail network. In particular, with regard to the regulatory body, a key element of the railway recast, the new rules lay down more stringent requirements for the appointment of its staff and in order to guarantee its full independence: cooling-on and cooling-off periods and a declaration of interest that the regulatory body’s members must submit. The recast also provides for the regulatory body to make recommendations to licensing and safety authorities to prevent, for example, safety rules being used to limit access to the market. The recast will extend the regulatory bodies’ powers to ancillary rail services and to overseeing the separation of accounts. It will be made clear that regulatory bodies must review both the draft and final versions of network statements, which are an essential instrument to ensure that all the operators are aware of the market access conditions. Furthermore, in addition to acting in a limited timeframe in the event of a complaint, regulatory bodies will be able to intervene with regard to the introduction of mark-ups on the direct costs of infrastructure managers, control the criteria for the introduction of booking charges and regularly consult railway users. Thanks to Parliament’s involvement, we have also managed to obtain a network of regulatory bodies: the content of the information will be exchanged in a clear manner and will be guaranteed by the Commission, which will be required to evaluate how efficiently the regulatory bodies are cooperating with the new network and to propose supplementary measures to ensure a more integrated oversight of the European rail market, with the hope that in the future, a European regulatory body can be established. With regard to financing infrastructure, the multiannual contractual agreement no longer has a minimum duration of three years but five, and there is a provision requiring Member States to make good the deficit in the infrastructure manager’s accounts every five years at the most. A requirement has also been included … (The speaker interrupted her speech
) In order to have a single rail market, we need to provide non-discriminatory access to the market. Therefore, even if the separation requirements for service facilities have not been imposed on all kinds of infrastructure, the opening up of the services market is far-reaching, with an extensive list of essential services and non-discriminatory access to infrastructure and services. A ‘use it or lease it’ clause has also been included for services that have not been used for at least two years instead of three. With regard to charges, in particular, noise charges, we have reached a compromise that is optional for Member States – although it will be mandatory to comply with the applicable EU rules – that envisages a bonus system to facilitate the retrofitting of trains. As for the European Train Control System (ETCS), a compulsory system is planned for all Member States that must be implemented on European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) lines: the introduction of a bonus-malus system for trains equipped with ETCS systems in accordance with common criteria set out by the Commission. The differentiation of charges will be completely revenue neutral for the infrastructure manager. Despite my firm belief that there needs to be separation between infrastructure managers and railway undertakings, we have reached a good compromise on separation that provides for transparency of financial flows between infrastructure managers and railway undertakings in integrated companies, as well as a rendezvous clause for the presentation of a legislative proposal on separation and on the opening of the domestic passenger market by the end of 2012. I would like to remind Members that tomorrow, during the vote, amendments could be tabled. Should any of these amendments that are not part of this document receive majority support and be accepted by Parliament, the document would end up in conciliation. This would delay further still the opening of the debate on the fourth railway package. I therefore appeal to my fellow Members to understand the importance of adopting the railway recast tomorrow, so that we may then continue to work on the fourth railway package.

 I congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Ţicău, on her work. Certainly, the installation and use of a tachograph, if used correctly, can be an excellent tool to improve road safety and the working conditions of hauliers, while at the same time satisfying their legitimate needs for privacy. To protect drivers, more stringent rules on driving times and rest times are, of course, necessary. I therefore welcome the new rules that aim to improve tachograph functions, such as the use of wireless communications for roadside checks in order to lower the number of vehicles stopped, as well as the provisions on the training of control officers. With a view to ensuring road safety in the European Union at all possible levels, it is of prime importance to affirm a clear and full principle of co-responsibility, and I therefore consider positive the compromise obtained by the rapporteur whereby the parties concerned must carry out regular checks in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(4) of Regulation (EC) No 561/2006. With regard to the installation of tachographs in all vehicles which are not exempted, I would ask that we bear in mind that the obligations arising from compliance with the procedure must not overwhelm small and medium-sized enterprises with financial burdens and red tape.

 The recasting of Directive 2006/54/EC on the implementation of the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation has led to changes in the sector, but much remains to be done to reduce the gender pay gap. That is why I voted for the report on equal pay for male and female workers for equal work or work of equal value. I believe it is right for the European Commission to put pressure on the national governments to adopt measures aimed at reducing the gender gap and also to provide for sanctions in cases of infringements of the principle of equal pay.

 All consumers are susceptible to becoming vulnerable over the course of their lives, whether as a result of endogenous causes inherent in the person and the person’s cultural, psychological and physical situation, or due to exogenous causes inherent in the objective difficulty of accessing information. Hence, there is a need for greater special protection for vulnerable consumers that takes their individual requirements into account. Disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility require particular attention, especially as regards transport, and passengers’ rights must be improved by ensuring that information and fares are transparent when a ticket is purchased.

 Today’s vote on the progress made by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia takes into account the difficult challenges that the country has faced. Even if much remains to be done, I am pleased with the progress achieved in the social sphere and in the fight against corruption, when you consider that the country has moved up 40 places in the Transparency International anti-corruption index over the last five years. However, the recent serious episodes of violence are a matter for concern, and are the worst since 2001 when the country was on the brink of civil war between the Albanian Muslim minority and the Macedonian Orthodox Christian majority. In accordance with the 2011 progress report, I deplore the risk that the forms of power sharing could institutionalise the ethnic minorities and transform the country into a two-nation state, putting democratic principles at risk. I hope that the freedoms and fundamental rights established under the rule of law will be respected. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of piracy is not a new one here, and was dealt with by this Parliament in the 2009 resolution. Everyone is aware of the events involving two Italian soldiers, who were arrested for causing the death of two Indian fishermen. In this regard, I welcome the assurances of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Baroness Ashton, who has said she has been monitoring the case closely in order to bring it to a positive conclusion, and that the incident should be put, to quote her words, ‘into the broader context of international cooperation on counter-piracy and, more specifically, on the issue of regulating the protection aboard ships’. However, the episode forces us to reflect on the fact that the phenomenon of piracy in the Indian Ocean or off the Somali coastline is still an extremely serious problem. As part of its defence and security policy, the EU launched the Atalanta mission in December 2008 and, in the last few days, its extension to 2014 was approved, but the number of ships involved has fallen dramatically, from 35 in 2009 to 10 in 2011. As we know, the EU intends to exercise greater coordination over the naval forces and military personnel on board civilian ships belonging to Member States patrolling the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean. Do we therefore feel that it is useful to establish common rules of engagement? Generally speaking, what other coordinated initiatives does the EU plan to adopt to protect merchant ships from attacks by pirates? In addition, what measures does it intend to take against third countries that fail to safeguard merchant ships crossing between the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean?

 I voted in favour of Mr Schmidt’s annual tax report, which calls on the Commission to make proposals that will contribute to European competitiveness by eliminating distortions of competition which arise from the various taxation systems still in place. In terms of cross-border issues, the differences in the tax ‘excises’ on a number of products, such as fuel, drinks and cigarettes, can easily create cross-border competition distortions. The current economic and financial crisis has led to a significant rise in public debt in Europe, the reduction of which requires both expenditure restraint and tax increases, as well as streamlining of tax systems. Accordingly, we need to adopt measures that can make the national tax systems more favourable to common growth, ensuring that tax differences do not give business in one country an undue advantage over competitors in other countries.

The White Paper on Transport aims to improve the quality of transport in Europe. Mobility plays a key role in the internal market as it is a prerequisite for development and economic growth. While, on the one hand, the challenge is to develop sustainable transport, on the other, we must aim to build an efficient intermodal transportation network. Much remains to be done to ensure that the transport system is truly competitive in all areas and there are many issues and difficulties, especially in the road transport sector, which, in some countries, is one of the cornerstones of production and the economy. In this regard, I would like to see the creation of an authority responsible for road transport, which would be able to promote the harmonisation of Member States in this regard: for example, with respect to environmental sustainability, safety, training and professional certification, and which would supervise the process of liberalisation and resolve the challenges of the sector, in a manner similar to what is to be done in the railway sector.

 I voted in favour of the report on modernising customs because I think we need to simplify customs legislation in order to improve and influence competitiveness. Customs play an essential role in ensuring efficient safety checks and contributing, above all, to the fight against fraud. This, however, requires efficient IT systems so as to ensure product safety and to block the sale of less safe products. However, I did vote against the parts referring to non-preferential origin of goods, not because I do not support the principle, but because I think the reference to the definition of the product origin should not be in this report, which aims to establish criteria for improving customs competitiveness.

 I have voted in favour of this report which seeks to lay the groundwork for future debate on the reform proposal that the Commission is due to present in December, and that aims to simplify the process of working abroad for doctors, engineers, dentists and other professionals. If, on the one hand, professional qualifications should be recognised quickly by other Member States, on the other hand, the reliability and safety of their services should not be compromised. To this end, one notes that the professional qualifications of tour guides could cease to be recognised as, following the revision of Directive 2005/36/EC, their profession would be confused with that of travel couriers or tour representatives who would be able to conduct guided tours in all 27 Member States.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before beginning with a brief description of my report, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs who worked with me on the revision of the railway recast. I would particularly like to thank Mr Kuhn, Mr Tremosa i Balcells, Mr Zīle, Mr Cramer and Ms Wils. I would also like to thank the Chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Brian Simpson, the parliamentary group coordinators and all of my colleagues for the extensive debate we have had on a report that was particularly complex but also, I believe, important for the implementation of the railway system. It is a recast of the first railway package, which has not been correctly applied since its entry into force, and, in fact, 13 infringement procedures against Member States relating to implementation of the first railway package are currently under way. The objective of the railway recast is to achieve a single European railway market. It is an ambitious objective because the rail system is the most outdated transport system, which has not managed to catch up with other modes of transport. For example, the average percentage for rail freight in European countries is stationary at around 6-7%, while only 11-12% of passengers travel by rail. Therefore, it is clear that rules need to be harmonised, and that new systems and new elements need to be added and strengthened to ensure that railways can develop properly, particularly where they cross borders, which is the most problematic part for European integration. The creation of a single European market is therefore necessary, just as it was for the air transport sector. The creation of a single market will mean that citizens can use trains that can run throughout Europe, with better fares and a service on a par with that of other modes of transport. Currently, few trains can travel outside national borders. Now the aim is that they can compete with each other throughout the whole of Europe, something which – as I have said – is not the case today. The objectives which the first railway package attempted to deliver are therefore the aim of this recast and of all the measures for unification of the rail system that will follow. This means that, starting with the railway recast, some rules need to be revised. One of the most important points that we have discussed at length, and which I believe is also the key product of the railway recast, is the provision of a national regulatory body, a network of national regulatory bodies with clear responsibilities, a strong national regulatory body with resources like the energy regulator, which could – as many hope – allow us to have a single European regulatory body in the future. We have tried to provide clear rules for transparency and separation of the accounts of the infrastructure manager and the services manager, by prohibiting cross transfers between the network and the services manager as happens in the case of many holding companies, for example. We have tried to maintain the separation of accounts that has been in force since 1991, according to which public funds for infrastructures must be used solely to improve infrastructure and not to finance the business of transport companies, also because these subsidies prevent fair competition between all the service operators. As rapporteur I would have liked the railway package to be more ambitious. I would also have liked there to be a total separation between infrastructure and service operators. However, we have been given a commitment by the Commission that this will be put in place by 31 December 2012. Other important provisions concern ease of access to infrastructures, which is essential in order to guarantee that all new operators can use network services, and in addition to total separation, the Commission has made a commitment to present a proposal for national market liberalisation by 31 December 2012. We have also included benefits for operators that introduce significant technological innovations to reduce environmental impact, and we have included the possibility of an improvement in the sector by allowing 7-year instead of 5-year strategic plans as previously. Finally, we wanted to guarantee compliance with laws governing employment rights and safety in the workplace, and to maintain the right to strike. Debora Serracchiani,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is true, as my colleagues who have already spoken have said, that this proposal for a directive has been a very complex task, involving 724 amendments leading to 18 compromise texts. These compromise texts include Article 7, mentioned by the Commissioner, in which Parliament invites the Commission to make a proposal for national market separation and liberalisation by 31 December 2012. None of the proposals are in any way premature – instead, there is a clear invitation with an equally clear and precise direction. If this direction had been present from the start, it would probably have helped with the management of this extremely long railway recast. In the meantime, my assistant has had a baby, so this really has been a long and complicated gestation period, but I am sure that we understand the importance of expanding the railway system. We have said that we need a competitive railway system. In that case, we need to have rules. We do not necessarily need many rules, but they have to be clear, and to be complied with by everyone. We know that there is a problem of free competition on the railway market, particularly with regard to freight transport. The ambition of the railway recast is to create the single European market. Therefore, we are issuing a strong invitation to the Commission to make a clear proposal before the end of next year and, given that next year is so close, we propose that work should begin so that Parliament can fulfil its own legislative role, also because the text very recently issued by the Council is extremely cautious, including with regard to the proposals. Therefore, we hope that Parliament will give us a clear and full mandate to carry out a complete negotiation process that will truly open up the single European market to all the expectations to which – I am picking up on the shout of pain from Mr Cancian – we must provide a response.

I voted in favour of the report by Mr Kósa, which highlighted the physical and social obstacles that unfortunately still exist in many Member States and that restrict the lives of 80 million disabled people living all over Europe. To date, however, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has not yet been ratified by all the EU countries. Out of 27 Member States, 11 still have to sign, and even where ratified, implementation is still deficient precisely in accessibility to spaces and buildings. According to the EU 2020 strategy, one of the most important objectives is to increase the rate of employment. This requires removing all the barriers that hinder the access of disabled people to the labour market and developing national policies in line with the European Commission’s European Disability Strategy, including simple access to public and private transport. Social inclusion and employment must also play a bigger part in strategies and in European funding. Finally, I agree with the rapporteur on the need for a European mobility card for reciprocal recognition of care for people with disabilities, which would guarantee travel on any means of transport for all.

I voted in favour of the report on road safety by Mr Koch because I think that this issue has an important role to play considering that around 55% of fatal accidents happen on rural roads, 36% in urban areas and 6% on motorways. Over the last three years, road accidents in the capital cities of the European Union have caused an average of 1 845 deaths each year. Many of these victims are pedestrians, cyclists, elderly people and children. In order to reduce the number of deaths caused by road accidents, common and harmonised restrictive measures are needed across Europe, including the creation of safe road-traffic infrastructure, respect for driving and rest periods, and the establishment of safe parking areas for lorry drivers which are in line with the minimum social standards. I support the creation of the office of the European road safety coordinator by 2014, with particular responsibility for opening an investigation on the effectiveness of road safety policies in large and medium-sized urban areas and on the necessary elements for once again making travel safe for all citizens.

 I would like to thank Mr Fidanza for his constructive work. Tourism has enormous potential for achieving certain important EU objectives, such as sustainable development, economic growth and employment, as well as socio-economic cohesion. In recent years, growth in employment in the tourism industry has been considerably higher than in other areas. Indeed, the EU tourism sector generates more than 4% of GDP, with around 2 million businesses providing work for approximately 4% of the total workforce: around 8 million jobs. Therefore there is a clear need to support the sector, including by improving training and recognition of professional qualifications. At European level, the Union must put in place an integrated strategy with clear, high-level objectives, with effective, targeted measures that promote innovation and improve the quality of tourist services, providing, for example, ever greater accessibility for persons with reduced mobility. I support the creation of a European quality label and the idea of diversifying tourism through the promotion of culture, history and religion, and I would stress the importance of promoting tourism by giving due importance to Europeans who have spread European culture beyond this continent.

 In recent years, many businesses have been encouraged to invest in Libya. The serious instability and the political and institutional crisis that has affected several countries in North Africa, especially Egypt, Libya and Tunisia, have forced many European businesses to abandon Libya, leaving behind moneys owed to them, equipment, and so on. Council Regulation (EU) No 204/2011 of 2 March 2011 concerning restrictive measures in view of the situation in Libya, establishes that funds may only be used for humanitarian purposes and not to pay monies owed or damages suffered by businesses/companies that had been operating in Libya. As a result many European enterprises, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, are struggling to collect monies owed for the provision of goods and services in Libya. While on the one hand Europe must guarantee support to the Libyan people and contribute to the country’s reconstruction, on the other I believe that it must ensure that European companies do not suffer serious, irreversible damage due to a loss of liquidity resulting from uncollected moneys, and therefore it must guarantee their survival.

 Madam President, the new Hungarian constitution limits the possibility of intervention by supervisory bodies such as the constitutional court, and increases the powers of the executive, thereby bringing into question the normal system of checks and balances. Social rights have been negated, the state only providing subsidies to the needy if they agree to do community work. Finally, the right to self-defence has been sanctioned and weapons may be kept in the home even without a licence. The right to abortion has been banned and highly discriminatory laws against homosexuals have been introduced. All of this goes against Directive 2000/78/EC, which establishes a general framework for the fight against discrimination. I therefore ask the Commissioner what action she intends to take, in view of the fact that the fundamental rights in the new Hungarian constitution are hardly compatible with those of the European Union and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.

I thank the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, for his excellent report, which fits in with the recent debate on the implementation of the Schengen Agreement. The existence of effective controls along our external borders must be an important factor inasmuch as the security of the Schengen area depends on the efficiency with which each Member State controls its external borders. Although some problems remain unresolved, Romania and Bulgaria have proved to be sufficiently prepared to apply all the requirements of the Schengen acquis. We have discussed at length the practical efficacy of the state machinery of these two countries, as well as their levels of corruption; nevertheless, I believe that the application of Schengen should leave this out of consideration, given that – just as happened with the other Member States – it is sufficient to base a decision only on the efficiency of border controls and the preparation of police forces. Adding further requirements would create a precedent of discrimination which has not existed before, not even after the great enlargement in 2007. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 The arrival of streams of immigrants to Lampedusa in recent days shows that the immigration crisis is an ongoing issue that requires immediate action. We clearly need improved governance within the Schengen area, as established by the Commission Communication of 4 May. To this end, the solidarity mechanims must be strengthened in terms of redistribution of asylum seekers, organised mobility and new partnerships with third countries. Revising the mechanisms for applying the Schengen acquis
 must not be seen as an excuse to limit at will the right to free movement, but rather as a stimulus for new opportunities. I hope that concrete proposals will be made very soon to combat prejudice and discrimination, to combat lawlessness and to promote human rights, human dignity and peace. Governing immigration effectively and encouraging peaceful coexistence must be the daily commitment of a good policy that aims to promote development and security. Returning the massive flows of people to their countries of origin does not help maintain the distance between Europeans and immigrants. If anything, it risks increasing illegality, insecurity and economic costs. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 The nuclear accident at the Fukushima power station has caused an enormous disaster, with the radioactive contamination also affecting many people who were in the vicinity of the power station and who suffered injuries. Many hospitals are refusing to admit and treat them due to the risk of contamination. Although the Japanese Prime Minister has announced that the Fukushima power station will be decommissioned, the situation remains unresolved: the cooling system for one of the reactors is out of use and a considerable amount of radioactivity is being released into the environment. In the light of this, it is important to ensure that all the necessary humanitarian and financial aid is provided and to lay down international safety rules that are as reliable as possible, in order to prevent other disasters like that in Japan in the future. For this reason, I voted against the resolution, because it omitted the amendments calling upon the Member States to draw up possible strategies for abandoning nuclear power and immediately to inform regional and local cross-border authorities of their national programmes if their implementation could have a cross-border effect.

In the wake of recent events in south-eastern Europe, we must revise the European Neighbourhood Policy in relation to the southern partner countries by providing the means and assistance necessary for a genuine democratic transition and establishing the foundations for deep political, social and institutional reforms. It is important that the policy review give priority to the criteria of an independent judiciary, respect for basic freedoms, including freedom of the media and the fight against corruption, but it is also necessary to reconsider and to examine carefully the EU’s Mediterranean strategy in order to strengthen political dialogue and to support all democratic and social forces.

 Following the earthquake on 11 March, the consequences of the crisis in Japan for nuclear safety and the global economy have shaken the European Union, which is already grappling with instability in North Africa. I welcome the decisions taken at the special meeting of energy ministers, held in order to examine the implications of the accident at the plant in Fukushima, and trust in the determination of Member States to carry out stress testing of nuclear power plants in the European Union to be extended to non-European countries, and especially neighbouring countries. In this context, and giving due importance to the nuclear moratorium decision taken by some Member States, and the fact that public consultations on energy development are imminent, it is important that the Commission should report on the safety situation in European nuclear power plants that could affect neighbouring regions of Member States if an incident occurred.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the resolution on Turkey because the constitutional reform that took place 12 September last was unanimously recognised as an important step forward made by Turkey in relation to Europe. Naturally, there are still many more steps to be taken and in this vein, I would express my concern over the numerous arrests of journalists. I would like to underline that Turkey is the seventh largest commercial partner of the European Union, that the European Union is Turkey’s main commercial partner, and that trade – which has been carried out correctly for centuries – has favoured interpenetration and the peaceful acquaintance of one people with another. I therefore applaud the notable progress made in terms of getting started on connections between the European Union and Turkey, in particular, through the motorways of the sea that cross the northern Adriatic and the northern Tyrrhenian seas, which now see a flow of more than 250 000 truckloads per year in both directions, together with an important heavy-goods railway freight link from ports to destinations within Europe. In this way, it was possible to get rid of a significant amount of heavy goods vehicles on the road and I hope that this continues. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the reports on equality between women and men and female poverty in Europe and I am delighted that this has been debated on the very day that we celebrate the hundredth anniversary of International Women’s Day. Notwithstanding Directive 2002/73/EC on equal treatment between men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training, promotion and working conditions, further efforts still need to be made to achieve proper transposition. Suffice it to say that, although the level of female education has increased significantly in recent years and the number of female graduates is now higher than that of male graduates, women remain concentrated in traditionally female sectors and are frequently paid less and occupy fewer positions of responsibility in all spheres of society. The lack of access to support services for their dependents, such as children, the disabled and the elderly, to adequate leave schemes and to flexible working arrangements, all impede women from working. I would like to close by remembering the women of the world who are fighting for the most basic of rights and I would like this House to express its solidarity with the Iranian feminist associations that are today taking to the streets, inviting women to demonstrate without the hijab

 We hope that Croatia makes fast progress in the negotiations for EU membership. Speeding up Croatia’s accession is crucial if one considers its strategic geopolitical position as a gateway to markets in Central Europe. Hence the need for an integrated development of ports and connections to the European corridors, especially in view of the fact that Croatia will enjoy a significant flow of EU funding, of which 60% will be allocated to infrastructure. For this to happen, Croatia should continue to adopt the necessary reforms. In particular, it should strengthen public administration and the judiciary, fight corruption and ensure full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. I welcome the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Croatia on the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction. I am disappointed about the situation of the Croatian shipbuilding industry, a sector that was once the pearl of Yugoslav industrial exports, but which is now in almost total ruin. I hope that the Croatian Government is able conclude the restructuring process as soon as possible so that it can also close the chapter on competition. In particular, I emphasise the importance of the accession of Croatia in relation to the integrated maritime policy in the Adriatic, which will soon officially be an almost completely European sea.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, should like to thank Mr Cancian for his efforts in obtaining this difficult compromise. Thanks to this regulation, bus and coach passengers can enjoy rights similar to those of passengers on other modes of transport, such as trains and boats. The regulation, which applies to all national and international services wherever the distance to be covered is equal to or greater than 250 km, also protects passengers using regular services over shorter distances. I am referring, in particular, to disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility, who have been guaranteed non-discriminatory access to transport, the right to compensation in the event of loss of or damage to wheelchairs, as well as training on disabilities for bus and coach employees. I am also delighted that an agreement has been reached on compensation for death, including reasonable funeral expenses, or personal injury, and loss of or damage to luggage due to accidents. I also consider it a positive step that passengers can choose between continuing the journey at no additional cost or reimbursement of the ticket price in case of cancellation, a delay of more than two hours, or overbooking. In terms of information for passengers, I think it would have been useful to provide them with information on connections with other means of transport, thereby also ensuring dialogue between bus and rail passenger transport services. Lastly, I am very pleased that during negotiations, we managed to research and guarantee the maximum level of assistance for disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility, giving them the option of being accompanied at no extra cost.

Today’s vote on the EU-Libya Framework Agreement is the result of some tough negotiations, particularly on the issue of migrants. In Libya, the situation regarding human rights for refugees and asylum seekers is extremely dangerous. They have no legal recognition and there is no system in place to protect them. I hope that their fundamental human rights will be safeguarded, along with their right to asylum. Libya has not ratified the Geneva Convention of 28 July 1951 or the Protocol of 1967 relating to the Status of Refugees, and at the moment, does not intend to do so. However, in 1981, it did ratify the 1969 Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa. It is therefore bound to comply with the principle of non-refoulement of migrants requiring international protection, who must be identified in accordance with criteria that are no less strict than those established by the Geneva Convention itself. Under international law, people from countries such as Somalia, Sudan, Eritrea and Ethiopia have the right to humanitarian protection and political asylum, and I hope that the Libyan authorities will agree to cooperate with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

 We should not be shy or reticent about the European Union’s duty to uphold the freedom to profess one’s religion. In view of the undeniable exacerbation of violence against Christians in various parts of the world, the EU urgently needs to take a clear stance against any violation of the right to the freedom to profess one’s religious faith. The subject of religious freedom must be integrated in European policies, not least by including a binding clause on respect for religious freedom in our agreements with other countries. These principles are Europe’s banner, and we cannot make exceptions to them under any circumstances. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 Today's vote has given the go-ahead for the first example of European democratic participation. The European citizens’ initiative is one of the most innovative provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon and a first step toward direct democracy. The initiative is an instrument that allows citizens to call on the European Commission to submit a legislative proposal on any issue that they consider to be in their interest by submitting 1 million signatures, which represent 0.2% of the population of the European Union. Issues relating to the environment, social matters and disasters caused by the financial crisis are among the most sensitive topics that may mobilise citizens to call on the EU to legislate on these matters.

Every year in Europe, hundreds of thousands of people are sold as if they were objects and, fortunately, today we feel an ever-increasing need to protect the victims of trafficking in human beings from the use of false documents, from prostitution and from immigration. When we speak about trafficking in human beings, we must think about not only sexual exploitation, forced labour and illegal adoptions, but also the problem of trafficking in organs, which is becoming an increasingly widespread crime. The European legal structure is not effective enough and the European Union and Member States must do more. We need an established structure for coordination between the institutions and the agencies of the EU, as well as those of the Member States and international partners. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, to date, access to employment has been regulated only for a few specific categories of third-country nationals. Indeed, not everyone benefits from the general principle of equality of treatment in access to employment. As a result, the European Union must take steps to guarantee equal treatment both for third-country nationals legally residing in a Member State and for those who qualify for refugee status or who require international protection, pursuant to Council Directive 2004/83 of 29 April 2004. We need to prevent a growth in demand, for example, for seasonal workers, just because they can be paid less and because they have different – lower – costs with respect to European citizens employed to do the same job. We must also avoid, for example, the risk of many multinational companies transferring their headquarters to countries such as Morocco or Turkey and sending their employees to work in European branches because it is cheaper. For reasons of social justice, we must ensure that European citizens are treated equally in terms of remuneration, working conditions and social security. For this reason, I believe that it is right to include seasonal workers, posted workers, refugees and self-employed workers in this directive. It would be extremely dangerous to make distinctions.

The latest violent events linked to the dispute between Morocco and the Polisario Front over the Western Sahara require greater attention due to the negative effects they could have on stability in the region. The clearing of the camp at Laâyoune seems to have resulted in about a dozen deaths, more than 700 wounded, 150 missing and 160 arrested by the Moroccan authorities and is believed to have led to the killing of a Spanish citizen of Sahrawi origins, Baby Hamday Buyema. We must not leave the Sahrawi people all alone, but we need to finish off the negotiations conducted under the aegis of the United Nations, in accordance with the principles of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, particularly Article 2. The European Union must intervene and urge the Moroccan Government to avoid further bloodshed and release those Sahrawi who have been detained illegally. The resumption of informal talks between the parties, which took place on 7 and 8 November 2010, must represent the first sign that a fair solution can been peacefully accepted by the parties.

I would like to express my satisfaction over the importance attributed to matters concerning civil law, such as the legislative proposal on reinforced cooperation in the divorce law sector and the recognition and creation of official public documents on inheritance. I am particularly pleased to see the emphasis placed on the need to introduce specific actions and programmes to promote an effective European judicial culture, based on the supply of training measures, to be held under Erasmus schemes for judges and all legal operators. The actions identified in the plan are very important for improving the guarantees of European citizens in respect of the law, but it is necessary to adopt a more strategic and less fragmentary approach based on the real needs of citizens and enterprises in the exercising of their rights. While, on the one hand, we must consider the difficulties of legislating in a harmonised manner within an area of shared responsibility, on the other, we need to extend EU regulations in the sector of justice and internal affairs. In this way, the parameters of legal certainty will be increasingly clear and supported and we will pave the way for a genuinely common legal theory and practice with a European Union.

 As the exchange of data between the European Union and the United States is increasingly necessary and frequent in the context of the fight against terrorism and organised crime, a general and common legal framework must also be drawn up to protect personal data. This framework must provide for protection equivalent to that enjoyed by European citizens within the Union. The Commission’s negotiating mandate is therefore heading in the right direction. With regard to the sphere of application, this legal framework must also apply to existing bilateral agreements. I hope that the Council adopts the mandate as presented and that Parliament is kept fully and promptly informed of all developments in the negotiations, bearing in mind that Parliament will have the final word on the future agreement.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Mrs Meissner for her report on integrated maritime policy, and I agree with her on the need to strengthen maritime transport and the shipbuilding industry, to safeguard coastal regions and to promote innovation and research activities. Today, maritime transport plays a fundamental role in trade. As a result, we must encourage cooperation between small and large ports that face one another in the same sea basin and which can facilitate more fluid trade. Furthermore, in order to ensure intermodality, we must invest in port and dry port infrastructure, especially in ports that can be connected via European corridors. Lastly, I believe it is important not to overlook another issue, namely port security. All the measures relating to safety within all European ports must be harmonised so as to better protect maritime transport and prevent unfair competition from harming those ports which actually have to incur greater expense in order to guarantee a higher level of safety.

I voted in favour on the indication of the country of origin of certain products imported from third countries. With this vote I wished to emphasise the European Parliament’s commitment to promoting European industry, the competitiveness of which must today be safeguarded and supported. Furthermore, the right for European citizens to know the origin of the products they buy will be guaranteed. However, I do not believe that excluding specialised and recognised production sectors with a long history and tradition, such as the optical industry, is in keeping with EU policy.

 I welcome the proposal for a directive, which represents a decisive step forward in relation to the directive currently in force. Once transposed nationally, regionally and locally, it will appreciably improve payment, particularly by public authorities, to companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, which will be able to count on having a more secure cash flow. In many countries in Europe, when the public authorities are in a difficult situation, they are known to generally pay late and very often cause some companies to go bankrupt. A glaring example is Italy where, by the end of 2009, the public authorities were in debt to companies to the tune of approximately EUR 60 billion, and the payment delay averaged 186 days, with extremes of 800 days. One need only think of the amounts owed to the hotels that took in the survivors of the severe earthquake that hit the Abruzzo region in April 2009. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of this resolution because I believe it is necessary at EU level to have a specific European strategy for the development of mountain and island regions: a strategy that takes account of aspects such as promoting the economy and structures, employment policy, the protection of natural resources, civil defence, and environmental and energy policy. The principle of territorial cohesion is one of the European Union’s key objectives introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon with the aim of reducing regional disparities and removing natural or geographical obstacles. Concrete actions and specific development strategies are needed to do this. It is necessary to create equal opportunities between these regions and the rest of the European Union. One such opportunity might be to promote sustainable tourism in the mountain regions, thus creating an important subsistence base for the inhabitants of these areas. Also, that very Madrid declaration by European ministers on 15 April 2010 stresses a more effective coordination of the measures implemented with regard to tourism policy, and on promotion aimed at more innovative, sustainable and social tourism in Europe.

Unfortunately, due to the constant increase in air traffic, the number of victims of civil aviation accidents has increased notably. Suffice it to say that in 2005, there were 1 454, an increase of some 90% compared to 2004. We therefore need new legislation which reduces discrepancies in the investigation abilities of the Member States and which creates a ‘network’ between the various national investigation authorities, with the aim of rationalising skills, personnel and resources. Therefore, I am in favour of this proposal for a regulation which, on the one hand, will ensure the absolute independence of investigations into accidents and, on the other, will oblige airline companies to guarantee the rights of victims and their relatives in the event of an accident.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the completion of the internal market in postal services by the end of this year is an important step, but the Commission should carry out an impact assessment – as some of the previous speakers pointed out – on the postal market liberalisation in order to better understand citizens’ requirements. Indeed, how does the Commission intend to safeguard the rights of European citizens who live in hard-to-reach areas, such as mountain or rural areas, so that they may receive post regularly, and what instruments does the Commission intend to adopt to ensure this occurs? Moreover, I do not think that we should use this directive, which already exists, to justify social dumping. It is the Member States which must apply the directive and which possess all the means to do so. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 I voted against the agreement reached at second reading by Parliament with the Council on the draft directive on the use of animals in scientific experiments. I am not saying ‘No’ to the advance of research but I am calling for a reduction in animal suffering, since the revised directive proposes some practices that go against that aim, such as the possibility of experimenting more than once on the same animal. Moreover, I believe the use of other satisfactory scientific methods that do not require the use of animals should be developed further. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 The legal framework on same-sex couples within the European Union is very diverse and radical differences exist between different Member States. Episodes of discrimination against same-sex couples occur virtually on a daily basis, hence the need to ensure respect for Directives 2000/43/EC and 2000/78/EC on combating discrimination based on religion, disability and sexual orientation. The European Union must make more effort to guarantee same-sex couples the same rights granted to heterosexual couples when they move to another Member State in the European Union to study or work, by virtue of the directive on the free movement of European citizens.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal on the rights of passengers travelling by bus and coach aims to aid and protect passengers, in particular, persons with disabilities or reduced mobility. It is the first regulation on the rights of bus and coach passengers and should form a guarantee for such passengers, as in the rail and air transport sectors. The position at second reading aims to establish a series of rights for passengers deciding to travel by bus or coach. I agree with the argument of the rapporteur, Mr Cancian, whom I thank for the excellent work accomplished and I believe that the scope of application of the regulation must be amended, excluding regional services when they are integrated with urban and suburban services. It would be fair and proper to guarantee the rights of passengers in case of accidents, cancellations or delayed departures, as was decided at Parliament’s first reading. Equally important is the question of information on passengers’ rights. Indeed, it would be useful to supply passengers with information on connections with other modes of transport, thereby also ensuring dialogue between bus and rail passenger transport services. Regarding persons with disabilities or reduced mobility, it is necessary to guarantee maximum protection and I would propose a 24-hour advance notice period for requesting assistance as opposed to 48 hours. I would also propose greater guarantees for compensation for and replacement of mobility equipment for people with disabilities in case of loss or damage. Furthermore, bearing in mind the needs of passengers with reduced mobility, all architectural barriers ought to be removed and existing infrastructure improved to render them accessible. This regulation aims to improve the competitiveness of the bus and coach sector and facilitate connections between modes of transport but, above all, it aims to improve the travel conditions of passengers.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteur, Mr Sterckx, who has done excellent work on this report which deals with how to increase free movement in the maritime sector, for shipping within the European Union. I agree with Mr Sterckx on the aim of this directive, which is to exempt all intra-European maritime goods transport from unnecessary administrative formalities. Indeed, in order to have a maritime transport space without barriers, it is not only important for the various competent authorities to work together well, but also for the various simplification systems to be implemented in parallel. This is in order to ensure the effective operation of the European maritime transport space without barriers, to make maritime goods transport more attractive, and to ensure it is used to the optimum extent. Harmonisation of administrative procedures between the Member States will ensure the smoother running of maritime traffic between the various EU ports and will revive maritime goods transport, which today represents only 10% of the total. Maritime transport is, at present, still hampered by the administrative formalities imposed on it. Electronic systems should therefore come into operation as quickly as possible in order to allow a faster data exchange system. Furthermore, interoperability is important for genuine simplification of administration. In fact, sending information by e-mail does no good and is of no use if the information systems are not technically interoperable. With regards to language, I believe that the use of a common language would certainly benefit European maritime transport. This would enable communication to take place more smoothly, and thus cause less confusion and fewer administrative delays. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 The report on the future of transport aims to support and develop an efficient and sustainable transport system in Europe. In order for this to come about, it is necessary that the internal transport market is fully completed and that all obstacles resulting from the late, or lack of, transposition of EU legislation in the Member States are removed. A transport fund will also be necessary in order to guarantee financing of the trans-European transport network projects and the systems to support the network. The TEN-T projects are a priority for transport policy, but the problem of missing infrastructure must be removed, as well as the geographical and historical obstacles of cross-border routes. Lastly, the issue of road safety – among other things – is one of the key points upon which the transport policy should be based in future. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 The development of an efficient and sustainable European transport system requires the revitalisation of rail freight, by means of coordinated action between Member States and cooperation between railway infrastructure managers to develop intermodality, market opening and the management of freight and passenger traffic. The proposal for a regulation aims to improve the rail freight service by means of a procedure for identifying the European corridors that must ensure a high-quality freight service. Freight corridor 5 has already been drafted at ministerial level in 2006, according to the Baltic-Adriatic corridor, pan-European corridor VI and Priority Project 23. It is therefore right to proceed with the commitments we have undertaken and pursue our established objectives; a point returned to several times during the TEN-T conference in Zaragoza.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteur for his excellent work on the European Union membership of the Human Rights Convention, which benefits European citizens: due to this convention, there will be a new court, external to the European Union, to ensure that the rights of European citizens are always respected by the European Union and Member States. Under the principle of democracy, the European Union and its Member States should always have the right to be able to defend themselves. I therefore believe it is crucial that every nation belonging to the convention should have a judge to explain the context of every appeal, just as I think it important that the European Parliament should have an informal body to coordinate information exchanges between Parliament and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council, and that Parliament should also be consulted during the negotiation process. I would also like to add that European citizens have the right to understand the mechanisms governing this membership, just as they have the right to know what their rights are. Therefore, I believe it is essential for the Council of Europe and the European Union to consider establishing guidelines, with a clear explanation of all the effects and implications that membership will entail.

 The affair of the Icelandic volcano and its current consequences lead us to reflect that the European Union must not be unprepared for an emergency or unexpected occurrences, but must protect passengers above all else using existing or new management instruments or measures.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr Leichtfried for his excellent work on the report on aviation security charges, which considers, among its various aspects, one important point: consumer protection and passengers’ rights. There have to be clear and transparent rules because, if airlines charge passengers extra for security measures, this information should be made available, in my view, to ensure that passengers are not out of pocket. I believe that it is only right that consumer protection organisations should take part in the consultations and thus gain an insight into the pricing of security measures, which they can then check against the ticket price. Only in this way will it be possible to guarantee greater transparency and information for passengers. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the recent rail accident in Brussels, which many Members have mentioned, the spotlight has once again been on the safety of the railways. Directive 2004/49/EC on safety of the railways in general stipulates that railway undertakings and infrastructure managers should bear the full responsibility for the safety of the system, each for their own part. In the specific case of the accident that occurred in Belgium, human error seems to have been the cause. We shall, of course, await the investigations. It would appear, however, that the train was not fitted with an automatic braking system. Is the Commission aware of which networks and which trains within the Member States are not fitted with this safety device? Moreover, does it intend to draft a legislative proposal so as to ensure that the Union’s entire network is fitted with this system? Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Croatia’s membership of the European Union accentuates the gelling of a European identity that is able to express the common values of our new Europe while incorporating, rather than glossing over, the individualities of its many occupants. The Republic of Croatia has made appreciable efforts to come up to the required standards, particularly in combating organised crime through new anti-mafia measures, but it needs to make further efforts, particularly in the judicial field, before the 2010 negotiations can conclude. The institutions of the Republic of Croatia can make further steps forward to come into line with the requirements of the first protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights, signed in Paris in 1952, by considering the return of nationalised assets to their rightful owners.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is committed to combating all forms of terrorism. When we speak of tackling terrorist offences, we need to ensure that fundamental rights are fully upheld and that the measures adopted to fight terrorism are suitable and effective. The rights of defence and fundamental procedural safeguards must therefore be fully complied with by the EU institutions, including when they draw up lists of individuals and bodies, in this case linked to al-Qaeda, that are subject to restrictive measures. It is equally essential that these measures are subject to proper democratic and parliamentary scrutiny, as rightly required by the Treaty of Lisbon. It is therefore clear, as also affirmed by Parliament’s legal service, that each measure of this kind must follow the ordinary legislative procedure, enabling the representatives of Europe’s citizens to fully perform their roles as legislators and guarantors.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur of one of the dossiers on Europol, I can only reassert what has already been said by the Members who have spoken before me. Thanks to its role in the collection, analysis and exchange of information, Europol facilitates investigations in Member States and has thus become an important tool in the fight against crime. We need to be more effective in tackling crime, but at the same time, we must resolutely assert the authority of this Parliament. The Council has decided that it will, in any case, adopt the texts of the Europol package on 30 November, without waiting for Parliament to obtain the power of codecision on this matter with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December. The aim of rejecting the proposals is not to stand in the way of Europol assuming its new role as a European body, but to have the powers of this Parliament, the European Parliament, extended, especially on important matters relating to freedom, security and justice. Finally, I think that it is right to give Parliament greater powers of scrutiny over Europol’s activities in order to check that the handling of data held by Europol does not undermine the rights of European citizens.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am aware that, on 30 September, the Commission presented a study on the indicators of media pluralism in the Member States. However, in 2008, this House adopted a report by Marianne Mikko in which the European Commission and the Member States were asked to safeguard, and I quote verbatim, ‘the multiplicity of opinions in the media, to guarantee the pluralism of information, to ensure that all EU citizens can access free and diversified media’. Even earlier, in 2004, Parliament adopted a report by Mrs Boogerd-Quaak on the risks of violation, in the EU, of freedom of expression and information. In this report, the Commission was asked to submit a communication on the safeguarding of media pluralism in all the Member States. To date, the Commission has still not given clear responses to Parliament’s requests. You will notice, Commissioner, that I have mentioned neither my country nor its Prime Minister. However, I, as a European citizen, am asking you in this House what the Commission intends to do at European level to ensure that media pluralism is guaranteed in all the Member States.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the motion under debate today sees the full implementation of the agreement that the budgetary authorities concluded in December on the 2012 portion of financing for the ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) research project. The ITER project, which involves the European Union as well as major countries such as Japan, the United States and China, requires a further EUR 650 million in appropriations and therefore the expenditure ceiling set out in Heading 1a of the financial perspectives needs to be revised by the same amount. Through this motion we therefore give the green light to this EUR 650 million increase in commitment appropriations. The agreement on which this important aspect of the 2012 budget is based has been a crucial aspect of these budget negotiations. In fact I would say that it has been a fundamental condition for the 2012 budget conciliation to reach a positive outcome and for the negotiations to conclude. It has allowed us to substantially increase the funds in 2012 for important programmes such as Lifelong Learning, Competitiveness and Innovation, the Seventh Research Programme, and especially for allowing us to fund ITER using transfers as little as possible. That was very important, representing a positive outcome that allowed this House to approve the agreement. ITER is therefore added to the 2012 budget without any negative impact on the implementation of other programmes and without becoming a burden on other programmes; that is a very significant fact. Furthermore, this agreement and this motion marks the real beginning of the sensitive matter of implementing the 2012 budget. Even through we focus all our attention on the negotiations for concluding the draft budget, there is then the important step of putting it into action, which starts with this step and will see us take particular care over the sensitive matter of payments. My hope is that, during the implementation of the 2012 budget, we will be able to re-locate the hitherto excellent spirit of cooperation between the Commission and Parliament in particular, which was crucial for finalising the budget and will be even more important for supporting its implementation.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank all my fellow Members for their substantial support for the report we are discussing today. I would like to emphasise that, predictably, during the debate we quite naturally looked into the substance of the ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) project. However I want to point out that today we are really giving life to the agreement signed in December, which enabled us to wind up the negotiations over the 2012 budget. We are therefore implementing an agreement reached in conciliation, which not only saw us finalise the budget conciliation but saw us finalise it in the best way possible, in view of all the negotiations we carried out last year, so that this important instrument is funded using transfers as little as possible. This is truly an important achievement, because we will not harm the other programmes financed out of the budget. To me, that seems to be the outcome that we should prize most highly. Above all, it gives me particular pleasure to point out that the conciliation process was the final step in negotiations that we managed to conduct with enormous cooperation and collaboration. Long may it continue. Francesca Balzani,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 18 November, Parliament and the Council reached a common position on the budget three days ahead of the conciliation deadline. This is a good sign: at a time of great uncertainty and difficulty, it means that the European institutions want to look to the future first; it is also a decision to shoulder their responsibilities. From the start, Parliament has put the EU 2020 strategy, the major crisis-prevention strategy for future growth and wellbeing, at the centre of the budget. Drafting a budget is no easy task for anyone today, not even for Europe, but Parliament made a choice, which was fully accepted during the conciliation. Thus, we have more resources for growth, research, employment, lifelong learning, immigration policies and international policies in Europe. Payments, however, fared badly in the conciliation. They fared badly, which is nothing new. Indeed, it is unfortunately the case that there is strong disagreement – clear and ongoing disagreement – over the issue of payments between Parliament and the Commission on one side, and the Council on the other. Disagreement that will have to be solved, that will have to be overcome, because this is a situation that we clearly cannot tolerate any longer. Unfortunately, however, conciliation is not the ideal forum in which to open discussions, in which to open conciliations, because – and the experience of the past year has clearly taught us this – opening major discussions in the strict and rigorous confines of the conciliation procedure is liable to simply jeopardise the forthcoming budget. The Commission’s faultless projections of funding requirements – and I want to emphasise this point – the Commission’s extremely authoritative and reliable projections, which Parliament endorsed, are thus rendered useless. I hope that this can be resolved. It is clear, in my view, that we will not find a permanent solution to this problem until the European budget is equipped with its own resources. However, what we, as Parliament, certainly can do – in line with the commitment to intervene promptly should payment needs increase during the year, which we signed and attached to the budget – what we certainly can and must do is to strive to ensure that this commitment is honoured and, above all, to work together to ensure that this commitment is not a victim, in terms of its form and schedule, of the next budgetary conciliation, because what we must do – and this is the decision that we made with ITER, that we made this year on the subject of payments – is to refrain from opening conciliations within the conciliation procedure. I should like to thank everyone: all my fellow Members who made an enthusiastic contribution to the drafting of this budget; the Polish Presidency, which played an important role and provided impetus; and especially the Commission, Commissioner Lewandowski, who maintained an exceptional balance throughout the entire delicate conciliation procedure. Then there are the policy advisors from our groups, and finally our assistants, who worked long into the night on this task. Francesca Balzani,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we live in a time of crisis – not only economic crisis but also a crisis of confidence. This crisis of confidence affects all citizens, but especially the youngest, who as a result find it harder to summon the courage and desire to build their own futures. The European Union has set a challenge to tackle this crisis, which is also a challenge for the EU itself: the great Europe 2020 strategy must genuinely combat this lack of confidence and help us back onto the path towards a better future and a better life. That is precisely why Parliament has put funding for this strategy at the heart of the budget for 2012, starting with its very top priority: higher employment, better employment and quality employment in a Europe that focuses on innovation and research. Hence, we in this Parliament have asked and are asking for greater resources for three key programmes, which are the true engines behind the 2020 strategy: the Lifelong Learning Programme, the Seventh Framework Programme and the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP). Today, therefore, what we need is consistency, to follow up on our intentions, to send out a positive message and hence start really building this future. Not funding a strategy to combat the crisis because we are in a crisis would be a gloomy message that would be hard to justify. Right now, our citizens are expecting us to act consistently and with sincerity. However, they are not the only ones watching us: this year the markets are also particularly attentive to our decisions and our ability to take the necessary decisions – in the right ways and in the right timeframes – in order to get back on track. Sending out positive messages is therefore a particularly sensitive issue. In this respect, it would not only be great to produce a budget that makes a genuine start on putting the 2020 strategy in place, but it would also be really important for us to do so in an atmosphere of major institutional collaboration. Parliament decided to place huge trust in the estimates of the Commission precisely in order to send out a positive message. The Commission is undoubtedly working as well as is feasible at this difficult time, which is why Parliament deemed its estimates on payment requirements to be reliable. There is another emergency: the institutional frameworks of many Mediterranean countries are currently undergoing change. Europe cannot remain removed from this process; we cannot stand in the wings but instead we must take a central role in international politics. We therefore need to react to the crisis and assume renewed leadership on the international stage. We request the use of the Flexibility Instrument for these two fundamental objectives. It will therefore be important to overcome these two challenges, instil confidence, prove our credibility and prove our reliability to citizens and the other institutions that are watching us. That is not all though, for I believe that this year there is yet another real challenge ahead: doing it in a transparent way. Indeed, our budget reading is not tactical or a negotiating tool: it is exactly the budget that this Parliament believes is essential for 2012, because I think this year it is also important to find a common position quickly and in good time, in order to communicate the essence, the ability and the image of a Europe that knows how to galvanise itself at the right time.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank all my fellow Members, as well as Mr Lewandowski and Mr Dominik, for this very interesting debate, which has seen a very important issue come to the fore. There is real unity in Parliament on this budget reading and I think this is due to something that has perhaps rarely been seen: Parliament has not limited itself to asking, but has also proposed painful cuts. As a number of my fellow Members have pointed out: on Heading 4 alone – one of the most difficult – Parliament has taken on the responsibility of making almost EUR 90 million of cuts. The motion has therefore been drawn up through effort and hard work, and – I would stress –not to fund Parliament’s priorities but to fund the Union’s priorities, because the Europe 2020 strategy is not a priority for Parliament but rather a priority for the Union. Today we are here to fund it, asking to invoke the Flexibility Instrument for EUR 240 million. We are talking about a total budget of EUR 150 billion, within the financial perspective of 2006, set up before the 2008 crisis, before the Europe 2020 strategy and even before the Treaty of Lisbon came into force. Here, today, we are asking to invoke the Flexibility Instrument for EUR 240 million, to start to fund the EU’s priorities, which we have put on the table as a way to fight the crisis. I therefore hope that our shared vision of the priorities that you have mentioned on a number of occasions, Mr Dominik, can reach its zenith in the conciliation procedure. It is difficult to talk about priorities if you do not want to take that extremely important step of turning written priorities into priorities that are realised, true, real and tangible. The year 2020 is almost upon us: we cannot wait for a new Financial Framework to start funding it and, as many fellow Members have said, it is not only citizens that are waiting to see what we do but also the markets. Therefore, I really hope that in the conciliation procedure we, as a budgetary authority, can find the unity that Parliament has found and I hope we can do so quickly. Francesca Balzani,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I simply have a technical amendment that is required in order to start the vote. In lines 05 04 05 02 and 05 08 06, the amendments BUDG1207 and BUDG1206, as recorded in the meeting reports, do not include the amendments to the amounts. These should be incorporated and adopted so as to correct the amounts in the draft budget. In relation to Amendment 1207, that means an additional EUR 2.5 million and EUR 3 million in commitment and payment appropriations, respectively, for line 05 04 05 02. In relation to Amendment 1206, that means an additional EUR 1 million in commitment and payment appropriations for line 05 08 06. However, the notes that follow particular agency budget lines must be adapted to make them consistent with the definitive amounts decided upon. Francesca Balzani,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the institutions involved in the budget procedure, namely the Commission, the Council and Parliament, described their position in the Council’s reading in July – the Council and Commission with figures, Parliament with a definition of its priorities. These positions are apparently very different, and often far removed from each other – I am thinking in particular of payments and research funding – but there are also points of convergence, and we must concentrate our efforts on these areas of agreement if we are to reach a common position. Parliament has an extremely difficult task, as it must also look to the future and play a proactive role. This is the most challenging area for elected institutions: they must operate with their feet firmly in the present, and hence be acutely aware of the tough times we are experiencing, the consolidation being carried out by Member States and the sacrifices being demanded of our fellow citizens, while always working to ensure investment, economic recovery and a more prosperous future. This year especially, the budget should strike a delicate balance between opposing desires: to maintain the stability of the present, but also to continue to look forward and start laying the foundations for the future straight away. This Parliament will make strong calls for funding for the 2020 strategy, starting with the creation of quality employment, but there are also new areas of responsibility, some of which are sensitive: I am thinking of the new responsibilities granted to us by the Treaty of Lisbon, and of the European Securities and Markets Authority. Then we have the level of payments, which should be correct from the outset, from the time of budget approval, and also undeniable emergencies such as migratory pressures and the situation in North Africa. Consequently, with regard to the documents on priorities, on which we have already voted, we will continue, in a consistent and transparent manner, to develop and create instruments that will enable us to implement our policies.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with the mandate for the trialogue the budget procedure entered its most concrete phase, the phase in which the budgetary authorities actually enter into discussions which may produce useful and significant results. This is why, above all, I hope that this trialogue is an opportunity that will be taken, an opportunity not to be missed. We embarked on the budget procedure in a spirit of great realism. The Member States are currently implementing tough national budgetary consolidation policies, and these policies have to find an important balance between the need to tackle the crisis and the need to relaunch the economy and investment. This is precisely why at this time the European Union budget, which has a great and unique ability to give added value to expenditure, investment and resources, can and absolutely must play a fundamental role. A fundamental role in which it is crucial that the Europe 2020 strategy should be taken as a starting point. This Parliament has made the Europe 2020 strategy a central issue of the budgetary discussions right from the start. The 2012 budget can and must be the first step in taking concrete measures towards this strategy, which is the tool that has been chosen precisely for the relaunch of our Union. In this sense, giving a financial dimension to the Europe 2020 strategy brings into play and gives a central role to our consistency and credibility. We cannot build such an ambitious strategy without implementing it immediately, precisely at a time when it is crucial that this tool for relaunching the economy be made to fully deploy its effects. Consistency, credibility and the ambitious Europe 2020 strategy therefore also become decisive and fundamental in guaranteeing the stability we need today within the European Union, as well as with regard to our single currency. There are also other facts and policies that are coming to the fore. I am thinking of democratic processes in the Mediterranean area and the need to guarantee an external dimension to the European Union, which at this time can truly play a role and resume an important position of leadership for itself. Let us not forget that the budget is not just an instrument to be approved when there has to be a forecast for the following year. It is also a tool that has to function throughout the course of the year. In this sense it is an issue requiring delicate handling not only with regard to the payments for the following year, but also with regard to implementation of the 2011 budget for the current year. Consistency, credibility and strong, decisive, single-minded use of the budget as a fundamental instrument for fighting the crisis and compensating for Member States’ consolidation policies – these are all issues that require a serious commitment on our part, that must truly ensure we once again play a crucial role in the security of the European Union, and above all – and this is my major concern – that invite us not to waste the opportunity of the trialogue. The trialogue can and must truly be a valuable opportunity for a concrete and useful exchange, which this year will bring us to a shared vision of the budgetary choices we need to make. I find that sharing choices when working on a document as important as the budget is another excellent sign of our ability to work within the Union, which is particularly important at this time.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that this very interesting debate, which follows on from the one we had in the special committees, shows that there is a great consensus in this Parliament as regards the fundamental strategies. Among the many others, the most important point is the budget, which is undoubtedly the only and most important tool for constructing the delicate balance between consolidation of the public accounts and the need to support growth. It is the only real bastion we have against the risk that consolidation might depress the European economy in a severe and irreversible way. The budget is therefore a focal tool. The European Parliament is not asking for a generally ambitious budget, but for an instrument that is strong on all the priorities that are today clear and easy to see. In the Europe 2020 strategy, the priority is first and foremost investment in work. Here in the Chamber today we have again mentioned research, development, social cohesion and energy, all priorities for which the budget is the most important indicator of the seriousness of our intentions. The seriousness of our intentions implies our strong institutional credibility. Today this focal budget is therefore a very important element among many, because we have once again drawn attention to the fact that it then becomes a driving force for transforming our commitments into reality, which is no small thing. The budget therefore becomes an important element for restoring stability to the European Union, and also to our single currency. Therefore, I hope that already in this trialogue this strong sense of responsibility that we all share, and it could not have been otherwise, will open the way to calm, responsible and constructive negotiations for the future of our Union.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the document we are examining today is not merely a report on the priorities of the next European budget, but also and above all a strategic document looking at the new role that the European budget must play in the context of greater economic governance. This is the first year of the European Semester, which has been designed precisely to establish the greatest possible coordination between the Union’s budget and those of the Member States, the greatest possible synergy and the utmost complementarity. All of which essentially means one thing: convergence, and making the budgets of the Member States converge with the major goals of the European budget. Today, these objectives – these European objectives – can only be those laid down in the Europe 2020 Strategy: a grand, ambitious strategy with five highly important targets and seven big flagship initiatives. These are big, important goals, but they are also very specific. The first target is extremely important and involves building a more fully, better employed Europe by making the right investments. We therefore have a huge priority for the 2012 budget: we must not waste time in executing the 2020 Strategy, beginning with the first of the targets, that of higher employment in Europe. Immediately setting out the dimension of the 2020 Strategy in our budget is therefore essential and a matter of urgency. Two things are fundamental in order to achieve this: we must plan and we must look to the future. Planning means ruling out mathematical approaches to the budget, which are absolutely senseless. Mathematical, general and indiscriminate increases are of no use at all. Instead we must look at what exactly are the programmes and the actions that can contribute to the 2020 Strategy. Looking to the future has an absolutely crucial significance: taking the utmost care over our commitments and not simply over our payments, because commitments are the tool with which to build the sustainable financial future of our Union. Flexibility is another important subject. We are at the end of the planning period and so the budget is particularly rigid. I therefore think that it is really important that, right from the start, we consider all the available flexibility instruments as fundamental and indispensable for the budget we are going to draw up if we want it to be not only possible or essential to take the first step towards the 2020 Strategy – which absolutely must not be a failure, as we have seen in the past – but also if we want it to be a useful and effective budget. I am convinced that it will only be possible to reach all these major objectives if we work together patiently, right from the very start, to build a renewed climate of institutional cooperation. Institutional cooperation is one of the major challenges of the Treaty of Lisbon, which we always talk about rather carelessly. Institutional collaboration means really finding a renewed feeling of equality so as to work together on this sensitive issue, the budget, which is not only one of the most strategically important instruments to build our future, but also one of the most tangible and practical. Francesca Balzani,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the word ‘responsibility’ has been mentioned a number of times during the speeches. There is, however, one responsibility that I really think takes priority for the institutions: above all we are responsible for implementing our programmes and ensuring that EU citizens are not left with just our words. We have the responsibility to be consistent in what we say and what we promise. Today’s major projects are those set out in the 2020 Strategy. The first target of ‘more work’ is not only very ambitious but also very precise, since it can even be measured using unemployment reduction parameters. This seems to me to be a very specific and very ambitious goal and I think it is essential to start working to achieve it. As long as we continue to consider the 2020 Strategy as too big and too ambitious to be squeezed into a practical document like the budget, I think we will achieve nothing more than increasing the risk of another failure, which is exactly what nobody wants, starting with the Commission, if I remember the first communication on the 2020 Strategy correctly. There is, however, another important issue: austerity is not a policy, it is not an instrument, it is a condition against which we must take action, and not only by consolidating our expenditure, but also by using the European budget, an extraordinary instrument that is radically different from the national budgets and gives us the chance to do something different this year. This is precisely what the European Semester is for. Clogging up the first six months of the year is not its only use. It enables us to come up with a global strategy and to create synergies; and creating synergies between the budgets of the Member States and our budget is an extraordinarily European system to give more value to public resources and to create a real method to turn the 2020 Strategy – long and ambitious as it is – into a European reality. Francesca Balzani,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament has been called upon to express its opinion on two agreements that have been signed with the United States and with 11 Latin American countries, which will draw a line under a long and difficult affair. This affair has witnessed the European Union challenged at the World Trade Organisation, and more importantly has witnessed it as the losing party. It is a thorny issue, as the disputes relate to the principle of non-discrimination in international trade, which Europe has been accused of breaching in the way in which banana imports are organised within the Union. This is because we have a two-track system in that we apply one system to African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries and a different system to other countries. This system allowed ACP countries to bring this product to the European market without paying any import duty, unlike other countries, which have to pay a duty of EUR 176 per tonne. This agreement therefore brings the situation back into balance and most importantly allows ACP countries, which are in a fragile state of development, to export their products to the EU duty-free. At the same time, the other countries that have signed the agreements will be able to export bananas to the EU subject to the payment of import duties, which however will be gradually reduced over the period 2011–2017 from the current rate of EUR 176 per tonne to EUR 114 per tonne. However, as well as finally bringing the EU back into line with its commitments as a member of the World Trade Organisation and therefore in some ways restoring its credibility, including as an institution, the most important aspect is that these agreements make allowances for ACP countries in a vulnerable state of development, as they provide for instruments to give them financial support. These instruments will allow those countries to invest in diversifying their production and will therefore hopefully strengthen their economies. At present, these measures, worth EUR 190 million, are to be provided until 2013. I believe that these agreements are a positive step, not only because they draw a line under disputes in which the EU has been the losing party, with the ensuing consequences in economic and disciplinary terms and in terms of its institutional credibility as I already mentioned, but also because they lead to a balanced solution that respects the needs both of these ACP countries and of European producers in the outermost regions, who certainly cannot be abandoned to unbridled competition. I therefore propose that Parliament should approve these agreements, whilst asking the Council and Commission for firm commitments. In the first instance, they should provide, as quickly as possible, for an evaluation of the impact that these agreements will have between now and 2020 – quite a long timescale, therefore – on ACP countries and on European producers in the outermost regions, whose economies are closely tied to bananas. Secondly, Parliament should ask for a firm commitment to evaluating the effects of the financial accompanying measures earmarked for the ACP countries eighteen months before they are due to end. This would ensure that those countries could receive further assistance and support measures if necessary, so that they are not left to go it alone and are supported in combating, counteracting and mitigating to some degree any negative consequences that the entry into force of these agreements may have within the European Union due to the price adjustments and hence to changes in the competitiveness of bananas from other countries. I therefore believe that by resolving a tricky issue this agreement definitely provides a way out that also takes into consideration the needs of those weaker countries which, as I have already said, have always been our main concern, including during the long debate we had in the Committee on International Trade. I hope they will find strong support and a favourable solution in these accompanying measures, in particular in terms of monitoring and the commitment, which Parliament is asking of the Commission and Council, to look at the impacts of the agreement and the effects of the aid measures, and to extend and increase them if necessary in the future.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think this debate has been very interesting and has partly restated some of the anxieties and issues which we have already looked at in the Committee on International Trade. I should like to re-emphasise an important fact that I think we lose sight of every now and then. These agreements represent the implementation of a specific commitment made by the European Union, in its role as a member of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). We must not forget this. Through these agreements, the EU is undertaking to resolve a serious problem with important countries, which it is having to sort out because it has breached the principle of non-discrimination. These are therefore agreements that restore our credibility and proper position as members of the WTO. This agreement follows on therefore from disputes and tensions, amid a climate that will certainly have been damaging for other areas of our relationships. As a definitive settlement agreement it is trying and succeeding to create a new balance, with particular attention, as we have said and have also stated in the resolution, to countries in fragile states of development. The accompanying measures will now certainly be monitored, and to my mind this is the most important point. It is important to have established the accompanying measures, but it will be even more important to have the evaluations of their impact and to have the commitment, which I am delighted to have heard today from the Council and the Commission, to keep constant track of the situation as it develops and above all the willingness to assist with further measures if they should prove to be necessary. POSEI (Programme of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity) itself has been incorporated into the resolution as a sensitive point that must be monitored due to the delicate balance between the financial contributions made under POSEI and the new situation regarding the outermost regions. Therefore the impact of the agreements on the outermost EU regions where bananas are produced will also be monitored and watched carefully. The Council also mentioned the need to work on transparency in the agri-food chain, which I am happy about, as it is an important point. We have been talking about producers the whole time, but there is also the major issue of banana distribution within the EU. There are many things that must be done going forward, therefore. We need to monitor the effects of the agreements, the implementation of the accompanying measures and the suitability of POSEI to protect Europe’s producers. We also need to use other instruments such as transparency in the agri-food chain and hence widen the scope of examination to take in the distribution chain as well, which has a major impact on the final cost of the fruit. We need to look at consumer protection, which is something that deserves our attention as much as all the other interests involved in this business. However, all these things, not least consumer protection, must start with the current situation and establishing the outcome of these disputes in which the EU has had to make concessions to the United States and the Latin American countries. I hope therefore that these agreements will be adopted, because I believe they form an essential basis for making the instruments linked to the delicate balance of the banana market work and can guarantee clear practices that will benefit other interests also, such as consumer protection, which is linked to transparency in the agri-food chain. These will in turn bring improvements to the banana market and to our European producers, which are impossible without a sound basis such as that provided by finalising these disputes within the WTO, to which the European Union belongs.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the amending budget we are discussing today and will be voting on in the coming days is an important document. It marks the last step for implementation of the European financial stabilisation mechanism, which was sorely needed in May to calm the severe storm that hit the euro and, therefore, the EU. One certainty came out of that storm: there are no individual Member State problems any more, because the individual problems inevitably become the problems of them all, and so a common response is required. Europe has found the courage and the strength to provide this common response that we are, in fact, discussing here today. This new budget line marks a clear boundary. It is the first step towards a new common approach to the financial policies and also, in the future, to the economic policies of Member States with regard to the European budget. It is the first step towards that integrated semester in which the budget decisions of the individual Member States and the EU budget will be compared more closely. The budget is therefore once again an instrument – which has always been the fundamental implementation of EU policies – that is taking centre stage and proving to be a fundamental vehicle for building Europe after the Treaty of Lisbon as well. Above all, it draws our attention to the importance of sound and responsible management of public resources as a prerequisite for real development and for a future of real European growth.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union and Turkey have strong trade links. The customs union has made it possible for the volume of trade between the European Union and Turkey to reach the significant figure of EUR 100 billion per year. Above all, the geopolitical position of Turkey makes it an important link between the Mediterranean area, the Middle East, Asia, and the Caucasus and Black Sea regions. Turkey is also a country which is at odds with Europe in that it has completely different demographic dynamics, is a young country, and one which first tackled the crisis and the challenging reforms which these dynamics required. So it is a complementary country because it is different to the European Union from many points of view and therefore there is a great degree of reciprocal potential: it is this that we must concentrate on. We must be careful not to waste this potential, but turn it into fruitful investments. It is true that the European Union is an important trading partner, but Turkey is looking ever more to Russia, Africa and the Middle East. Also, the customs union still does not apply to public procurement or services and there are still major obstacles to international trade. We must therefore work to remove the obstacles to this potential – and I believe the report that we are discussing today, and upon which we will vote in the next few days, is moving in this direction – because there are areas in which we must really make this potential grow: energy, the environment, services networks and infrastructure. This report therefore represents an important step and I think the work of Mr Kazak should be supported and I would like to thank him for it. Francesca Balzani,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the mandate for the trilogue is an important action, especially this year, because the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the single reading require as much clarity and as much cooperation as possible between the budgetary institutions from the outset. This budget is going ahead, developing and taking shape at a difficult time. The margins available for commitment appropriations amount to EUR 1 200 000 000 – and so are very narrow – but the matter is made even more sensitive by the fact that 70% of the appropriations come under Heading 2, the heading that covers policies for agriculture, conservation and natural resource management, and hence the fight against climate change. The budget is also difficult because of the many open procedures that will largely determine the quantities of resources that will actually be available. Such procedures include the budget review, financial regulation and the Interinstitutional Agreement, implementation of the External Action Service, but above all the meltdown and the instability of financial markets. The very meltdown that endangered the euro also demonstrated that the budget and resources are crucial to any European response, thus illustrating their importance, but also their limitations. Under these circumstances, the European Parliament must draw a line, and establish which of the priorities should have the highest profile in its main accounting document. As a group, we have chosen to tread a fine line between the need to uphold the purpose of this mandate, and the need not to debase its political meaning. Our central priority is therefore not to repeat our past mistakes, and this means we must guarantee appropriate resources for achieving the objectives of the 2020 strategy, but also keep enough resources for actions under Heading 2, particularly actions that help tackle unemployment. It is also important, however, to ensure that the fight against climate change remains central. There are therefore many challenges to be faced. We also recognised one challenge as central at the beginning of the mandate: the need to make a real effort to coordinate and restore consistency between our European budget and the budgets of individual Member States, because the consistency and coordination of the economic policies of the Union and its States are fundamental values for the future of the Union. Francesca Balzani,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the 2011 budget guidelines are the first step towards the next European budget, a very definite step. In the Committee on Budgets, we have made a great effort to establish the main identifiable priorities that highlight European action. The first priority is young people, not only because they are the resource on which to focus for innovation, research and development, but also because they are the basic starting point for farsighted social policies. However, the 2020 strategy is also a main priority: tackling unemployment, climate change and, above all, the need to genuinely and practically implement this new strategy for the future, allocating sufficient resources to it, without compromises and without cuts. However, these guidelines are also a very realistic first step. There is much less leeway in the financial perspective and this means that there are insufficient resources to carry out what is most important: new actions. This is particularly sensitive with regard to the first heading, the heading on competitiveness, growth and employment. There is, however, another important issue: the budget also needs to be highly flexible and to be able to respond quickly to citizens’ needs, to people’s needs and to changing needs. So there are priorities, but there are also essential conditions in order for the budget to really be a useful instrument to help Europe grow. These include sufficient resources, clear-cut implementation of future strategies, above all, the 2020 strategy, and lastly a definitive solution for a flexible instrument that – alone – can enable us to face future challenges. Francesca Balzani  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when we reach the end of a budgetary procedure and it is possible to assess the work carried out as a whole, I think that we need to ask a very frank, straightforward question: is this a useful budget? This budget is a transitional budget, one marking a shift towards the Europe of Lisbon, a shift within the major economic and financial crisis which has affected the entire world. This budget is therefore awkward in two respects. It needs to respond to the crisis, but reflect awareness that during a crisis, the resources available are scanty. It needs to make a positive contribution to economic recovery, but also cut, reduce and contain spending where possible. This budget will make EUR 141 billion available for next year. That is not much more than was available in 2009, but huge efforts have been made, a great deal of work has been done on the priorities and on channelling the available resources to the current priorities. The focus is on two budget lines: competitiveness and the environment. Competitiveness, because it contains social policies, employment policies and the delicate challenge represented by the Structural Funds, which still constitute the cornerstone of redistributive policies within Europe. This budget line will be allocated about EUR 65 billion for next year. The environment too, which encompasses agricultural policy, will be allocated approximately EUR 60 billion. This 2010 budget, however, relates, above all, to the economic recovery plan. This plan attracted strong support last year, but it was not fully financed in 2009. Today, thanks to significant efforts to redeploy resources, EUR 2.5 billion can at last be invested in energy infrastructure and broadband. Substantial efforts have also been made, however, to shape this budget in accordance with the Lisbon strategy, to provide even more resources than those provided by the Commission in the draft budget for the Erasmus programme, for lifelong learning, because there is a question which we must ask ourselves honestly, namely, whether this is a useful budget, but, first and foremost we have a fundamental yardstick: the usefulness of the budget must be tailored to Europe’s citizens. It must be a useful budget for every constituent citizen of Europe, and it is on the basis of this usefulness, tailored to the people, that I believe we must initiate and continue a sensitive debate on the review of the margins of availability and the resources that we wish to give to Europe for its policies. Francesca Balzani,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is precisely on the budget that Parliament can and should bring to bear all of its power as an institution directly elected by the citizens, in order to ensure that this vital instrument for growth, and also for fairness and justice, is fully able to meet citizens’ needs. The budget must have the ability to be tangible and dynamic, to listen and to respond. We have worked towards making the 2010 draft budget as flexible as possible at this time of particular economic and financial crisis. However, the budget must also be credible, feasible and tangible, and in this regard, it was fundamental to avoid making financial resources for the coming years too inflexible by restricting excessive spending beyond the maximum expenditure ceiling contained in the perspectives of the multiannual financial framework just to cases that really are an absolute priority. This is the case with the Recovery Plan. Again with the same aim, namely establishing a budget truly able to meet citizens’ needs, we have formulated specific amendments regarding payments in order to free up the maximum amount of resources possible with immediate effect. The European budget is structured on two tracks: commitments and payments. The commitments represent serious political intentions, but also real, concrete actions. Therefore, payments have been increased to EUR 127 billion in line with the draft budget tabled by the Committee on Budgets, compared with EUR 120 billion proposed by the Council and EUR 122 billion proposed by the Commission. Still with the same aim, with the same political approach, as a group we are strongly opposed to the creation of reserves, which are not genuine resources immediately available to citizens. The policy of establishing reserves at times of crisis should be reduced to the absolute minimum, to cases in which a reserve really is technically indispensable. In times of crisis, there is no point merely writing figures in the budget, but instead we should build a useful budget, immediately ready for action. Other matters also deserve special attention. As a group, we have taken the important responsibility of re-tabling the amendment to increase the milk fund to EUR 600 million, as decided by a unanimous vote of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and therefore with the participation of all the Members and groups, and also re-tabling an amendment for a microcredit project amounting to EUR 37 million which, and this is extremely important, does not jeopardise the implementation of other programmes under heading 2. There is a particular risk at times of crisis: that budget resources will not actually be increased, but transferred from one budget line to another. It is to counter this risk that Parliament, as a directly elected institution, with a role different to that of the Council and the Commission, must be especially careful in its actions, not least with regard to scrutiny.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as a member of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament who, even in the last few days, has watched with great sadness as one fire after another has devastated vast areas around the city of Genoa, in the Liguria region of Italy, I feel there is a truly urgent need for Europe to pay attention and to intervene in order to prevent these sadly recurring disasters. There should be no recurring disasters. We should work every day to ensure that there are no more cyclical disasters. This is why I believe that Europe alone can and must intervene effectively with binding acts to preserve these precious areas which, each year, are in danger of going up in smoke and which really are the heritage of us all, because it is true that fires are breaking out more and more frequently in southern Europe, and even when it is only a tiny part of this southern Europe that is burning, in reality, it is the whole of Europe that is going up in flames. We need to intervene with prevention policies and with suitable forestry policies – and by prevention I also mean intervening by means of a precise, thorough and targeted campaign against all forms of speculation directly or indirectly linked to these disasters – but I think that we also need to ensure broader, easier and quicker access to essential resources in order, at least, to mitigate the devastating effects of these disasters. I am referring first and foremost to the Solidarity Fund, an instrument that should undoubtedly be employed more quickly for the areas affected. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the single market is a major achievement and is now, more than ever, a key element in realising the ambitious objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. Twenty years of the single market is a long time, but there is still a lot to do. So it is fundamentally important that this celebration is used as an opportunity to relaunch the single market, and it is also important for us to look ahead and see what we still lack. For example, a common energy policy is now essential if all of Europe’s citizens are to be guaranteed secure and clean energy supplies at more accessible prices. Removing obstacles and relaunching the single market will prove decisive in Europe’s current economic and social crisis, because they will contribute to innovation, growth, development, the promotion of competitiveness and above all to job creation.

 Mr President, energy efficiency is one of the pillars of EU climate policy. That is why today’s vote is particularly important. It is the result of a satisfactory and timely agreement in terms of the content, in that it obliges the Member States to prepare a strategy based on indicative national targets that take account of EU objectives and, at the same time, enables energy companies to comply with energy saving requirements in accordance with the principle of reasonable flexibility. The goal of a 20% increase in energy efficiency by 2020 is therefore within reach. I believe that credit is due, above all, to this House, because if the most disruptive Member States within the Council have at last accepted this good compromise, that is due to the tenacity with which Parliament’s negotiators, starting with the rapporteur, safeguarded these goals. This is an important step for the creation of green jobs and, ultimately, to boost competitiveness and sustainability. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of this report because only a simpler and more coherent approach can effectively support vine growers in the future. According to the Commission’s proposal, Member States have to decide once and for all by December 2012 whether to transfer funds from the wine envelope to the single payment scheme (SPS). The draft report instead aims to avoid Member States planning five-year programmes at this stage, before they know the outcome of the common agricultural policy (CAP) reform. The proposal suggests converting the existing five-year measure into a one-year measure. We need to provide adequate support to vine growers and we must do so in the clearest way possible, while still ensuring a certain amount of predictability as regards funds assigned to farmers. Clarity and timely action are the key words in our policy to support vine growers, for a Europe which is a friend to the land. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, attracting investment in Europe requires concrete measures and courageous reforms. We need to ensure free and fair competition between enterprises. In a globalised and crisis-hit economy as we have at present the main thing we need to do is make businesses more competitive and increase their capacity for growth and job creation; jobs are the most important thing of all. Europe must once again become an attractive place in which to invest and work. The current crisis is a global one, and Europe must play its part to make business stronger, more competitive and above all more attractive. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, now that the European Union’s first two macro-regional strategies in the Baltic and Danube regions have materialised, there has been growing interest in this aspect of development. A macro-regional strategy ensures better cooperation among the EU’s various intervention mechanisms, going beyond the appropriations allocated to cohesion policy. I believe that the regions of the Mediterranean basin that share the same natural environment and the same history and culture have every interest in cooperating in this way. Significant opportunities exist in southern Europe, which can best be seized with the coordination and overview permitted by the definition of a macro-regional strategy. I am referring to the proposal for an Adriatic-Ionian macro-region in particular. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the committees have already stressed their opposition to this agreement. Tomorrow, it is up to Parliament to confirm this vote and put an end to this controversial dossier. The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) is a treaty that seeks to introduce a new framework for the protection of intellectual property rights, but does so without distinction, without distinguishing between commercial use for financial gain and consumer use by individual users not seeking profit. I think we need to fight the fake goods market, to combat counterfeiting, but without undermining the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In a nutshell, I believe that commercial interests must not allow us to eliminate civil liberties. For this reason, ACTA is the wrong way to go about this, which is why tomorrow’s vote is very important. Tomorrow, therefore, we need to say no to ACTA to ensure the transparency and protection of citizens’ rights. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, after seven years of income support for workers, the Indian owners of the Videocon plant in the city of Anagni have filed for bankruptcy and initiated procedures to dismiss 1 300 employees. A major company, the second largest in the region of Lazio, is closing down, and with it, related firms. This company was acquired with the intention to force it into bankruptcy and to shift production to third countries. Therefore, the institutions must now work to provide a future for Videocon and its workers who are going through a time of crisis, and who, for seven long years, have been living in a state of total job uncertainty. Italy and Europe must step in and deploy all the instruments necessary to provide work and a productive future for this important plant. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of this report because only a harmonised and coherent approach by Member States will allow for effective promotion of Europe’s energy objectives externally. If we want to achieve the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy and of the road map for a low carbon economy by 2050, we need to improve our cooperation in terms of energy policy today. From this point of view, both increased diversification of EU supply sources and the development of renewable energy sources will be essential. In this context, effective coordination with industry is crucial in order to encourage in concrete terms the investments able to favour economic growth and development and, at the same time, those able to ensure clean and safe energy. The challenge is open and Europe must play the game for sustainable competitiveness in the energy market. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

Mr President, I voted for this report since I believe that the time has come to build a more balanced partnership with China, based on reciprocity, fair competition, friendship and trust. The Chinese economy has grown significantly over the last 30 years. It has benefited from trade and is set to become the strongest global economy towards the middle of this century. We therefore need to open a new stage in EU-China trade relations based on transparent rules, an equal partnership and common development. Hence, we must encourage China to further open up its market to European companies and allow them to invest under the same conditions as those governing Chinese investments in Europe. A new partnership, then, so that China will no longer be viewed with concern by our businesses, but as an important opportunity for development and growth for our economy and, above all, for work and employment.

 Mr President, this document concentrates on the importance of regional airports as potential vehicles of territorial, economic and social cohesion. These infrastructures can, and must, perform this role, especially for citizens living outside major urban areas. The rule whereby the threshold for an airport to receive State aid was decreased to 200 000 passengers per year is good. Regional aviation can ensure that free movement in Europe is a reality not just for people living in major capital cities, but also for European citizens living outside of these areas, ensuring that these cities and regions enjoy not only the benefits brought about by greater mobility, but also by generating tourism.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on Europe Day, this regulation is a good example. The harmonisation of roaming charges is fundamental for the process of completing the internal market of the European Union. There is always much talk of a single market and the removal of tariff barriers, and yet barriers between European countries in the telecommunications sector as regards roaming charges seemed insuperable. Now this is no longer the case, and it will no longer be the case up to and beyond July 2014. Tariff reductions are finally real and tangible, and this is good news for citizens throughout Europe. The agreement binds all operators in the 27 Member States, without exception, to reducing roaming charges for telephone calls, messages and Internet connections, starting no later than 1 July next. This is an important and significant saving, at a time of crisis and grave economic difficulty for so many families. What is more, I am pleased with the measure that will enable users who are abroad to opt for the services of the most convenient operator as from 2014. No more chains, therefore. However, all this is not enough; it is only a first step. The real objective is ‘zero’ roaming; the real objective is the total abolition of roaming charges. Building a fair and competitive market also depends on Europe’s capacity to safeguard the needs and rights of its citizens. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the creation of a risk-sharing instrument must provide tangible assistance for the Member States worst-hit by the economic and financial crisis. The European Union must do more and support the Member States facing major difficulties in enacting projects such as infrastructural works. Consequently, we must ensure the continued implementation of the programmes cofinanced by the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund. This has to be done because these are key projects – especially those capable of generating net revenues, such as the construction of motorways – which can contribute to the economic and productive recovery of the affected countries.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, passing this measure will necessarily help to increase the level of investment and thus secure the European Union’s industrial future. We need to give industry the stimuli it needs to encourage investment capable of favouring economic growth and reducing CO2
 emissions at the same time. A low-carbon economy must not therefore in any way reduce the competitiveness of the European Union; quite the reverse, it must increase it. Finally, it is important to maintain the investment needed to encourage the development of renewable energy sources in order to guarantee savings and clean energy. On this issue Europe must speed up if it does not want to remain behind. Deeds and not words are what is needed for the ambition of having a genuine green economy capable of driving growth and sustainable development. Thank you. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, these guidelines for employment policies will be a great help in achieving the target of increasing participation in the labour market and reducing youth unemployment. Today, the future of young people is increasingly uncertain and insecure. There is no point in concealing the fact that sustained economic growth is crucial for the future of Europe. The youth unemployment figures are dramatic and unacceptable. The European Union must be committed to a medium- to long-term strategy for better, full and good-quality employment, especially for young people and their mobility, but also in terms of gender quality. At the same time, there must be parallel efforts to improve education and training systems at all levels. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important programme and an ambitious plan – to turn Europe into the world leader in terms of broadband speed, mobility, coverage and capacity. As has already been said, we need to aim to offer broadband for all. Europe is behind. The United States and China have already liberalised most of their radio spectrum. Therefore the agreement to open up the 800 MHz frequency band for wireless broadband Internet services by the end of the year, and to speed up mobile broadband to at least 30 Mbps is to be welcomed. These are important objectives. I believe that a European digital agenda could be a source of development, growth and unemployment. We have to act decisively in order to reclaim our leading role in the global knowledge economy. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 I voted for the report on collective redress because I believe that completion of the European single market also, and above all, involves harmonisation of consumer protection measures. However, it is crucial that Europe should not repeat the errors already committed in the US, where the practice of class action has become a primary source of profit mainly for a handful of powerful legal firms, only in very rare cases acting as an effective consumer protection tool. In this field, the European Union can do better than the US, first of all by encouraging the parties to reach alternative agreements not requiring formal recourse to legal means, thus simplifying and speeding up the process; and subsequently, by establishing a legislative framework that does not leave room for abuse, hence, with specific timeframes for proceedings, and rights to protection in line with European legal traditions. Only in this way will it be possible to prevent a useful tool for protecting citizens becoming a means of unfair competition between private entities. The report on which we voted today is a move in this direction, and is therefore a good starting point to build on in the future. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, open, free and fair trade is essential for ensuring and maintaining a level playing field for European businesses. Nonetheless, both companies and trade analysts, as well as the European Commission, have identified non-tariff barriers as the main hindrance to free access to partner countries’ markets. Since trade restrictions of this kind are highly technical in nature, they are perhaps being misused and it is extremely difficult to remove them. That is why a good starting point for overcoming these obstacles may be to work closely with the WTO and other trade organisations. The European Union needs to address this issue vigorously by seeking to remove barriers so as to complete the single market and by prioritising this issue in the new trade policy within the Europe 2020 strategy. Businesses need this, and so does development. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis is no longer simply a threat; it is a reality that is, in fact, capable of changing the social and political order, and which accordingly requires a powerful, ambitious response. While the success of the Europe 2020 strategy depends on the commitment made by the EU as a whole, the Member States must consider economic and budgetary policies as a matter of common interest. Some countries may be able to make faster progress on their own, but together we can all go further. We therefore need to become more coordinated when adopting and implementing budgetary measures and measures to combat tax fraud and tax evasion effectively. In this context, promoting international commercial links and enhancing the internal market are elements that are crucial to increased competitiveness and economic growth. However, the Europe 2020 strategy needs to have a broader regional and social dimension. Only by directly involving local bodies in the planning and implementation of programmes will it be possible to ensure greater awareness of the objectives to be achieved.

Mr President, the economic crisis that has affected labour markets since 2008 has caused the loss of 5.6 million jobs. That is why we need to reinforce human capital by updating skills and linking education and training more closely with work, just as we need to focus on small and medium-sized enterprises and on young people joining the world of work. There is, however, one point that baffles me, on which my group tabled two amendments that were rejected by this House. For this reason, my concerns remain and I did not support the report. This point in question relates to the way the single contract was presented by the Commission. The contract does not offer adequate legal guarantees or rights on working conditions, social security and the protection of workers under all types of contract. I maintain that the issue of the right to work and the right to social security is a very important point. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the experience of recent years tells us that we need a more robust economic governance framework, just as we need to broaden and strengthen the surveillance framework, making it credible and effective, and to introduce penalties, which will be an effective deterrent only if they are applied in practice. Ultimately I believe that Europe cannot solve the economic and financial crisis with austerity plans alone. The books need to be balanced, but it takes more than all that. We can do more and better, especially where fairness, development and employment are concerned, and that is why I felt I had to abstain on the Haglund report. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is important for the Stability and Growth Pact and the complete economic governance framework to support and be compatible with EU strategies for growth and jobs, with the aim of increasing competitiveness and social stability. We therefore need to introduce penalties for punishing fraud, pay the fines into a central fund for the permanent crisis mechanism and regulate the financial markets more. Ultimately I believe that the austerity measures being discussed today are in danger of weakening social justice policies. This is not the case with the Ferreira report, which I endorsed and which includes some valuable points in relation to social balance. It is the rest of the package that is wrong, because it focuses solely and exclusively on rigour and austerity and fails to promote growth. Europe will have a future only if we are able to marry fiscal discipline with the objectives of development, growth and employment. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report is an important step in the right direction. Research and innovation are both vital for development and economic growth. It is therefore urgent to propose a common framework for reorganising the existing schemes and programmes. Although Europe is the richest macro-region in the world, it has not actually invested properly in research, development and innovation. Suffice it to say that investment in these areas has been appreciably higher in the United States and Japan. We therefore have to act quickly to remove the inequalities that remain between the various countries of Europe. That will be the only possible way to prevent the scientifically or technologically more advanced countries from continuing to benefit more from existing European programmes. I therefore reiterate the need to reorganise the existing schemes and programmes and provide for new schemes with a view to producing a sustainable and inclusive growth strategy, while bearing in mind the objectives of stability, economic convergence and employment. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the key to establishing a sophisticated approach to the issue, one that does not relate exclusively to internal production factors, is to link trade policies to development policies: in other words, human rights clauses, labour standards and corporate social responsibility must become part of every agreement. Europe’s trump card in this respect are innovation policies aimed at guaranteeing supplies through a wide range of measures, the identification and extraction of raw materials in Europe, investment in new technologies for recycling and reusing materials, and compliance with fair and responsible agreements with non-EU suppliers. The framework programme is, moreover, one of the tools for reviving innovation policies, which are an important, indeed crucial element with regard to development and also with regard to work and employment.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the Sommer report because I firmly believe that Europeans should be able to make a free and informed choice about what they eat. In adopting this report, Parliament is giving the green light to clearer rules on food labelling. These rules concern not only the energy content and the percentage of fat present in the labelled food, but also the obligation to indicate the origin of the meat used. These are common-sense rules that have the merit of allowing citizens the freedom of choice, so that they can follow a healthy, balanced diet and know what they are eating. This regulation is a vehicle for citizens to be able to voice their specific requirements with regard to their choice of foodstuffs. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

Mr President, I voted in favour of this report because I take the view that the Member States should be equipped with a solid legal basis for deciding on the future of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), and especially because it needs to be acknowledged that the agricultural and environmental impact – as well as the socio-economic impact – can justify bans and restrictions. Indeed, I should like to point out that more than 60% of European citizens are against the development and cultivation of GMOs and that, as it stands, there is still no bedrock of scientific advice capable of dispelling all doubt about their impact on territories, cultures and consumers. Our legislative action must therefore once again be guided by the precautionary principle, because until we are certain that GMOs are not harmful for crops or consumers, we have the duty to protect European citizens from their potential damaging effects.

Mr President, this is a good report and one that is very important for the balanced, harmonious and sustainable development of our communities. Genuine solidarity between Member States allows our regions to be more attractive, more innovative and more competitive. Simplifying access to assistance, more effective controls and quality spending are the objectives for a better functioning of this instrument. We need greater investment in research, knowledge and innovation to boost growth, the development of small and medium-sized enterprises and employment.

Mr President, I voted in favour of the report by Mr Sosa Wagner because it effectively highlights the strengths and weaknesses in the European Commission’s approach to revitalising energy infrastructures: the need to identify the infrastructures required, the criteria for selecting projects of European interest in view of financing that will attract and boost private investment, the urgent need to deal with the dangers in Eastern Europe of relying on a single source which, as we have seen in recent years, can cause serious supply problems, and lastly the opportunity to invest part of the EUR 1 000 billion over 10 years provided for by the Commission for the reduction of pollution, combating climate change and improving supply quality for clean and safe energy.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Fukushima disaster has reopened the issue of nuclear safety. The problem of radioactive waste needs to be addressed and solved. To be brief, there are two issues that I consider top priority. The first is the ban on the transfer of waste. Every country must be able to discharge its own obligations and, above all, the ‘polluter pays’ principle is a fair one. The second issue concerns safety, and the health and safety of workers in particular. This is a point that I consider extremely important, and we have to give people peace of mind. We have to give the people of Europe peace of mind by ensuring that this subject is managed with the utmost transparency and above all, I stress, the utmost safety. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, the report on the mid-term review of the Seventh Framework Programme is especially significant. There are four reasons – which I consider to be paramount – why I voted in favour of the report: 1) the simplification and streamlining of procedures in order to make it easier to access funding; 2) the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are essential for growth and employment; 3) innovation for a competitive manufacturing sector capable of meeting the challenges of the market; and 4) the risk finance facility, which so far has produced very good results. Lastly, I should like to point out that the triangle of knowledge, education and research – on which the future of the cohesion policy rests – can only be consolidated in Europe through a steadfast commitment to research. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

Mr President, the report by Mr Garriga Polledo is a very important piece of work that allows us to set out a new financial framework for a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe. We need a budget that is designed for the challenges of the present day and that can provide a strong and innovative response to current needs. Its top priority must be research and innovation for small and medium-sized enterprises, to stimulate growth and employment, while the second objective is to reform the common agricultural policy in order to promote and support the competitiveness of agriculture in Europe. However, particular attention should be paid to the future of the cohesion policy, which I consider to be a very important instrument and one which provides financial support for investments that drive economic growth and, above all, the creation of new jobs. On this subject, I would like to revisit a point that I think is particularly important: the establishment of a new intermediate category. I believe, of course, that this new category cannot be created by siphoning off resources from existing ones, which are essential for supporting the balanced, harmonious and sustainable growth of our communities.

Mr President, I voted in favour of the report on the labelling of textile products because I think that Europe could and should do more to support enterprises in the industry. The proposal made by the Commission was purely technical and aimed to simplify the current provisions regarding labelling. Yet Parliament achieved two significant results. Firstly, textile products comprising non-textile parts of animal origin – fur and leather – must show this information on the labels in order to allow consumers to make informed choices. Secondly, by 2013, the European Commission must present an impact study on the introduction of labelling, clearly showing which garments have been produced in Europe, and which outside of Europe. The latter objective is an important milestone for the competitiveness of European textiles in Europe and the world. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mrs Merkies on her excellent work. I believe we have to invest more in innovation, research and knowledge, and we have to do so more boldly. Innovation must not be swallowed up by research. Innovation and research are not the same thing, and I welcome the fact that the report points out this strategic distinction. The report sets some important objectives: it targets ordinary people and workers through social innovation; it introduces measures to facilitate access to credit and finance for small and medium-sized enterprises; and, above all, it establishes an increasingly close and direct relationship linking together businesses, research centres and our universities. Facilitating and simplifying life for small and medium-sized enterprises through a one-stop shop and focusing on talent, creativity and innovative ideas are essential conditions for growth and development. Europe must take innovation policies seriously if we want to find a way out of the crisis and build a better future for our younger generations. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, after the tragedy of Fukushima, we all need to stop and think. Nuclear power is once more in the spotlight, and I believe we need to think above all of the future, of our children’s future. It is true that we need energy, but we need clean energy and safe energy. Safety is all well and good, but it is not enough. A moratorium is not enough; we need to go further than that. The tragedy of Fukushima tells us that there is no such thing as zero-risk nuclear power stations. Above all, it tells us that we need to organise a rapid exit from nuclear power and to focus our attention on renewable, alternative power sources. Europe needs a new energy policy in order to halt the construction of new nuclear power stations because of the terrible impact these power stations could have on safety, the environment, the climate and future generations. A radical change of perspective is necessary, for a safe future based on saving energy and the use of renewable sources. Francesco De Angelis,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if we are to restore confidence to the market, we need to prioritise the needs of consumers, workers and businesses. If we want to strengthen the rights of citizens, workers and users of public services, significant attention should be paid to guaranteeing the social dimension of the future Single Market. Growth, development and social awareness must go hand in hand. There must be economic growth at the service of citizens. From this point of view, the package of regulations regarding standards for companies contains some good proposals, including the action plan to increase access on the part of small and medium-sized enterprises to capital markets and new lines of financing for innovative firms and regional development. Small and medium-sized businesses are the heart of our economy and the growth engine of the internal market. Mr President, it is up to us to ensure these goals if we are to get out of the crisis and promote a new model of development, sustainable growth and new quality jobs. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Balzani, for the excellent work she has accomplished. Getting to the heart of the matter, there are four points in this own-initiative report that I think are crucial. The first, in general terms, is the explicit reference to the European Union budget and its redistributive nature, which are the cornerstones of European solidarity. The second, in specific terms, reaffirms the principle that outstanding commitments – which are particularly high in the cohesion sector – ought to be carried out and not, as the Council suggests, simply cut out. The third sets out some doubts – entirely reasonably in my view – as to the effectiveness of an estimate criterion based on performance in the previous year. The fourth urges the Commission to formulate proposals for the creation of new resources and, in particular, new resources must be designed to combat the persistent effects of the crisis with a robust and effective commitment to policies for innovation, research and growth in economic, productive and employment terms across Europe.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that the fragmentation of the rules on consumer rights creates a very significant obstacle to cross-border purchases and sales and is also a problem for the effective creation of a real internal market.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, news of the earthquake swarm that has been affecting the Far East and Japan in particular since 11 March has left us all astonished by the scale of the human tragedy that is unfolding. For these reasons, I think this resolution represents a necessary first step to guarantee the people of Japan all the humanitarian, technical and financial support they will need in the coming months and years. I believe that the incident at the Fukushima plant should force us all to reflect carefully, scrupulously and calmly on the risks of nuclear power. Europe must invest and must also direct the Member States to concentrate more closely and more effectively on alternative energy sources. Our thoughts go out to Japan today and our commitment for the future must be to avoid similar situations being repeated in Europe and elsewhere in the world. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs Schaldemose for her report which, above all, must be praised for proposing concrete measures to strengthen the surveillance systems for movement within the common European market of products that are safe for European consumers. It is an own-initiative report but it has the merit of going in the right direction to complete the single market and the protection of European consumers. Ensuring safety means providing traceability systems that are reliable throughout the products’ life cycle. In this respect, the report puts forward effective proposals: the creation of an information database on product safety; the strengthening of the Community Rapid Information System (RAPEX) regarding unsafe products from third countries; and greater resources to allow the surveillance authorities to withdraw products with serious risks from the market. I will conclude by emphasising that it is our job to ensure that the products circulating on the European market are safe for the most vulnerable consumers, especially children, the elderly and the disabled.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Nedelcheva, for her contribution. Talking about equality between men and women in the world of work today is not, and must not be, merely an exercise in rhetoric. On the contrary, female employment is a strategic issue for Europe, in both cultural and economic terms. As is evident from the available data, if the employment rates for women were similar to those of men, gross domestic product would increase by 30%. The current crisis must not, therefore, force us to take backward steps but, on the contrary, must make us move forward towards active policies on female employment. We therefore need targeted employment policies that allow the impact of the crisis on women to be assessed and counter-cyclical solutions to be considered. The report has the merit, moreover, of focusing on positive policies to promote the employment of women, the issue of vocational training and female entrepreneurship. I will conclude by saying that there is another phenomenon to face: the serious problem of violence against women. Europe now needs to have a comprehensive directive on preventing and combating all forms of violence against women. Francesco De Angelis,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, industrial policy is a key element for growth and employment in our regions and countries. At a time of severe economic crisis, therefore, we welcome the Commission’s initiative to provide Europe with a common medium- to long-term approach, and we fully support Mr Lange’s outstanding report for at least three reasons. The first is that the report takes an approach to the subject of industrial development that does not break down industrial and business interests into market sectors, but puts them together according to common objectives. The second reason is that it underlines the importance of regional structures through more effective support for clusters, innovation networks, knowledge transfer, research, and the improvement of skills and infrastructure development. The third reason – and I am finishing – is that it highlights the role and function of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are looking to Europe to find a way out of this crisis, which is liable to seriously jeopardise their future. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, more than 100 million workers depend directly or indirectly on small and medium-sized enterprises today in Europe. Yet small and medium-sized enterprises are experiencing an unprecedented crisis: lack of liquidity, bureaucratic obstacles and constraints and administrative barriers. Herein lies the crux of this motion for a resolution: Parliament is calling for credit and loan guarantee programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises and a vigorous European drive that is more than just a pipe dream to combat the new – and for many prohibitive – business-banking requirements, particularly with regard to higher collateral guarantees and risk premiums. Lastly, I agree with the need to significantly increase funding within the framework of the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme, and to revive the issue of simplification with strength and determination: streamline and simplify, so that firms wishing to access funds are able do so without having to resort to very expensive outside consultants. These are the reasons why I voted for this resolution: the SMEs and the 100 million European workers employed in the sector expect it of us. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Bendtsen’s report is positive for at least four reasons: – it reaffirms that energy efficiency is the most effective and fastest way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and that a firm commitment to provide resources and investment in this area will result in economic growth and job creation for small and medium-sized enterprises; – it makes valid proposals concerning workable financial instruments and calls on the Commission to firmly focus on professional training, access to information for small and medium-sized enterprises, and the refurbishment of existing buildings; – it sets specific objectives and confirms Energy Performance Contracting as an instrument for purchasing guaranteed energy savings and a launch pad for creating jobs and reducing European citizens’ bills; – lastly, the report will be all the more useful if binding emissions targets can be set without any ifs or buts. We must make the 20% target an achievable one; we cannot let this opportunity pass us by, since it would send out an encouraging signal to Europe. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D
).

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my appreciation for this resolution, which is an excellent piece of work in four respects. Firstly, it reasserts that energy efficiency and energy saving are economically advantageous priorities to reduce Europe’s energy dependence and combat climate change. Secondly, it emphasises intelligent infrastructure. Thirdly, it urges us to fully implement current European legislation. Fourthly, it strives to bring about an energy policy with a robust and consistent international dimension. Finally, I should like to underline the importance of energy security and investment in research, development and innovation to protect the interests of consumers, businesses and citizens as well as possible. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Van Brempt, for her excellent work and for an agreement that will at last make it possible to free up significant resources for the development of renewable energies and energy efficiency in the context of the challenge for green growth. The programme includes priorities that the Member States should take into account, particularly in achieving the objective of competitive modernisation of our energy infrastructures. Lastly, I wish to emphasise what I considered to be the qualifying points of the criteria for access by public authorities to finance, in particular, the commitment to work on multiannual strategies through a system of multi-level governance from territories to local authorities up to regional institutions and the institutions of the European Union, even in the context of rationalising the available financial instruments. This is an important result for the public and for small and medium-sized enterprises. Francesco De Angelis,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs Weiler for the excellent work she has done. With this provision, Europe is putting an end to a procedure that has brought a great many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to their knees. Parliament is taking action to protect SMEs – the most vulnerable businesses and the ones most exposed to the effects of the crisis – from problems of liquidity and access to credit. The current practice of delaying payments is pushing a great many small businesses towards bankruptcy, with adverse effects on employment. That is why the provision is important: it sets the maximum payment period at 60 days, increases interest on late payments to 8% and outlaws the use of contractual terms that are unfair to the creditor. In other words, it lays down definite time periods, incentives and, most of all, no exceptions. These are measures designed to protect SMEs, stimulate our economic and productive fabric, and boost employment. It is now the turn of the Member States to take swift and effective steps to implement this directive, which confirms that Europe exists, is useful and can make itself felt. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the launch of the European Union 2020 strategy effectively marks the end of the previous Lisbon Strategy phase and it will have to tackle the negative structural effects that the financial, economic and social crisis has produced and is continuing to produce. I believe that if the 2020 strategy is to be effective, it must focus on two key aspects, the first being a system for evaluating progress which factors in the use of the carrot and stick mechanism; the second being a vigorous policy of investing in infrastructure, in addition, of course, to tools for regulating the financial system and policies aimed at restoring social dialogue and cohesion. Infrastructures are the cornerstone of the relaunch of innovation policy in industry, SMEs, manufacturing consortiums or research institutes and in the relationship between these and universities and local institutions. The van Nistelrooij report should therefore be warmly welcomed since, in addition to providing an in-depth picture of the work that has been done to date in the Member States, it starts to deal with the question of criteria for harmonisation of financial instruments and operational plans aimed at innovation. The harmonisation of rules, procedures and administrative practices for the management of EU projects and the simplification and streamlining of procedures are the solutions that the stakeholders on the ground and citizens have been asking us for for a long time. I believe that on this point, Europe can and must do much to promote growth, development and employment. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
).

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the five rapporteurs who have worked so hard on these matters, and since I can only deal with one of these questions, for the second I will wear something on my head in order to demonstrate my conviction that no fish, under EU law, can be landed without fins, and so I do not understand why sharks may be landed in this manner. Thus, in honour of sharks I am wearing a fin for the remainder of my speech. I want to support the position taken by Ms Lövin and oppose the Group of the European People’s Party’s alternative motion for a resolution. I think that this alternative motion for a resolution tabled by the PPE Group, signed by the Chair, poses a very serious problem because it deletes an important part of this report involving the conclusion of fisheries agreements in the Mediterranean. Without fisheries agreements with other countries, our Mediterranean is condemned to certain death. Removing the possibility of conducting a fisheries foreign policy in the Mediterranean means killing the sea. I would therefore ask the Chair to withdraw this motion before tomorrow, and call on all Mediterranean MEPs to vote against it if the motion is not withdrawn. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is the fourth time I have had to give an explanation of vote – which does not happen very often – under these conditions. The report by Mr Alfonsi that we have adopted today is of particular importance, especially for the Adriatic region in our country. The macro-regional strategy has a considerable impact both on European planning and on its implementing acts. I believe regional strategies will be extremely important for the implementation of these rules, not least for the sector that I personally am involved with – fisheries – during the revision of our fisheries policies. Unfortunately, this sector is not given due coverage in this report, although that does not make it any less important. Besides, the constraints of the Mediterranean are well known; these constraints in both the management and the implementation of certain policies often jeopardise Europe’s comprehensive strategies. I do not think I can say anything else in all this uproar. Guido Milana,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank Mr Stevenson for his excellent work and the structure he gave to his report, which addresses the two main issues. This is not a simple management plan for herring, but is about guaranteeing fishermen a future to some extent, and a plan of action that ensures the sea is protected for years to come. But the key point in this report is – and remains – the question of delegated acts. I believe that the Council should accept the line taken by the Treaty of Lisbon and I think that the time has come for Parliament to have the courage to take a very clear and strong position on the matter of delegated acts, with perhaps a more authoritative voice than would come from the debate in the Committee on Fisheries or a discussion on a report concerning herring. We assert the right to deal with these matters under the ordinary legislative procedure. I know perfectly well that this issue concerns not only many other kinds of fishing, which will be in a worse situation following the current reform, but also agriculture and other subjects. The right course is to respect the will of Parliament. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to avoid repeating what my colleagues have already said, I personally believe that Europe really has no strategy either for the system of controls or for the means of implementing international agreements in the Mediterranean. We must not forget that the Mediterranean comprises eight European and 22 non-European countries and that its bluefin tuna attract many fishermen from outside Europe. I therefore believe – regardless of whether Mr Romeva i Rueda’s good work could have gone further – that this debate is pointless if it does not lead to the Commission preparing a proper international relations proposal. What is really needed is to establish new relationships on this subject, and on many others concerning fishing in the Mediterranean, in an effort to create the right conditions and making resources available for those countries that apply the same European rules. It would serve the interests of the tuna, of European fishing, and of Mediterranean fishing in particular. Guido Milana,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries.

 Madam President, the Committee on Fisheries has carried out an exhaustive job, considering that this is a post-Lisbon codecision matter. In this sense, the execution rate was 97.20%, hence a good execution rate as recorded in the accounts. Despite this, however, under one of the headings, a specific heading, the heading for fish markets, number 1102, had very little execution, for which the Commission gave some quite satisfactory explanations, but these do not suggest that there will be much change in the following years. Equally, one of the issues underlined is the execution of international fishing agreements. In these, the commercial aspect is too dominant compared with the aspect linked to growth in the sector: 72% is a commercial agreement. Therefore, the fishing agreements probably need to have a slightly different execution that takes into account the policy objectives of these agreements. I will close, Madam President, with just one more small comment, which is that there are reports that have been challenged for almost a decade, the closure of which is still being delayed. This is a just a point of form with regard to the execution as a whole. Thank you in particular for the time allowed to me. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the excellent report by Mr Rinaldi has been a success in the House. I totally agree with the excellent opinion of the report. Nevertheless, I would like to raise a small issue. Compared with this new world that is trying to seek democracy and different economic conditions, our Europe is a Europe divided by the Mediterranean. It is precisely this special focus on the Mediterranean that I would like the Commission to have, as regards both environmental issues and economic trade in the Mediterranean. The Mediterranean is a fishing area. We are building a new fisheries policy in Europe in which Europe will set some very strict rules. On the other side, however, there are no rules. Therefore, why not use forms of fisheries agreements, support for these countries so that they apply the same rules that are applied in Europe? This would be healthy for European fishing, healthy for the sea and environmental conservation, and would ensure that this division becomes ever smaller but an increasingly homogenous place on which to build the future of Europe and of this new world. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank Mr Arsenis, Ms Patrão Neves and Mr Romeva i Rueda and their assistants for contributing substantially to the success of this initiative. Fish is a common good, as it provides 15% of the protein intake of more than 3 billion people, and the livelihoods of over 500 million people depend on fishing and aquaculture. This makes it a truly global common good. By approving this statement, we are indicating a clear path to the Commission on the need to encourage responsible conduct, both among the fishing community and on the part of consumers. The debate on the common fisheries policy now has one more reason to support actions to broaden the scope of European policy from a narrow vision, concentrating on fishing methods and a policy of inward-looking rules. Instead, we suggest a strategy which treats the sea as a privileged place so as to increase its function as a breeding ground, both within EU waters and through innovative fishing agreements with third countries. What is more, this is not only about protecting the environment and maintaining biodiversity, but also about responsible fisheries, economic and social sustainability, which is clearly in the interests of both fishermen and our economy. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you have done very well, Commissioner, to promote this initiative and this regulation, but I would like to return to one problem – the only thing I want to pick up on in my speech – which is the under-execution of funds. The Commission must intervene because here we are facing an example of under-execution of funds. You have moved very intelligently to accelerate this process. Mr Ferreira makes some excellent points, because there are a number of questions over this issue: I do not think that we can transform the common fisheries policy over these two years, but I think we can direct our resources appropriately, especially to the most vulnerable countries, which are in greatest need of assistance at the moment. I would add, Commissioner, that in order to make this expenditure effective, I would also suggest that the procedures for the execution phase should be simplified; that is something I would focus on. Sometimes, a closer look at the execution of spending and simplified procedures can further assist in this process. I would like to pause for just a second if I may, Mr President, on the Court of Auditors. We must be wary of considering the Court of Auditors’ report as applicable to the whole of Europe. Within the report, there are many different areas where efficiency was different. Thank you and excuse me, Mr President, for running over time. Guido Milana,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, my remarks are intended directly for the Commissioner and the Minister. Commissioner, a year and a half ago, I urged you to act courageously as, in doing so, you would have had the support of Parliament. Now it seems to me that, instead, the idea prevails that Parliament is a sort of deadweight, a frill, in the procedures and that the Commission often prefers to take a stance that differs little if at all from the Council’s, which avoids having a genuine relationship with Parliament. Today, we are debating the reform of the common fisheries policy. Parliament is asking questions, while ministers are already mediating the Commission’s proposal. This goes beyond the application of Article 43(3). We must really reinstate the principle that the Treaty of Lisbon conferred on Parliament, and I believe that on this point, we must take a cultural leap in our relationships, rather than work in fine detail, trying to grasp whether we are on the right track by following this or that procedure. This is a different problem. I believe that we are still not aware of the role that Parliament can play when it comes to the fisheries sector. Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, we shall vote on the report that has been presented to us in a distinguished manner this morning by Ms Patrão Neves. If Parliament supports it, this resolution will immediately draw very important lines in the sand for the coming reform. I am not absolutely persuaded by the proposals regarding the socioeconomic aspect of the proposed reform. They effectively amount to driving the workforce out of the sector, not about finding alternative employment. I believe that here too we must take a culturally different direction. The list of issues you have drawn up is really short, as it does not set out a scenario for substituting fishing by some other occupation, where, say, aquaculture or tourism could have a key role. I believe that these measures have simply been relegated to a question of transferable rights, which, Commissioner, give absolutely no guarantee of a socioeconomic application for the reduction in fishing, because … (The President cut off the speaker) Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

Mr President, I am presenting an oral amendment with regard to the introduction of respect for human rights in this resolution. The text, which should be inserted after paragraph 7, is as follows: ‘calls on the Commission to introduce into the fisheries agreement with Morocco the clause on respect for human rights, as set out in the European Parliament resolution on human rights and social and environmental standards in international trade agreements’. I believe that this amendment improves the resolution and gives a timely reminder to the Commission, during the negotiation stage, to take into account the international context which often meets division in Parliament, particularly in this area. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a dreadful agreement, a dreadful extension and a dreadful performance over the years: these are the keywords in this debate! Well, we must consider this phase closed. If the Commission – or, rather, the Commissioner, who did not draw up this agreement – asks us to consent to the agreement, we must put this phase behind us and concentrate in particular on the new agreement and on what will happen in the coming years. As someone who has upheld the Sahrawi cause for many years, I am not sure if it is a good idea not to have any further relations with Morocco. We cannot replace the agreement, the lack of which would not help us resolve the conflict, which has been going on for more than 30 years. What Ms Lövin said was music to my ears. I wholeheartedly agree with her, although I do not think the fisheries agreement is the way to solve the problem. We certainly will not find a solution when the UN has had a mission in place for 30 years that has been incapable of resolving all the humanitarian issues involved. We should therefore say ‘yes’ to the resolution and ‘yes’ to extending this agreement, because the resolution should encourage the Commission and spur it on to negotiate hard, both to ensure that the new agreement truly responds to these requirements, and to ensure that it is a sign that the Union’s foreign policy must heed. Baroness Ashton cannot ignore the Sahrawi question any longer! Guido Milana,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it was wonderful to work with Mr Koumoutsakos. We worked well together, we had a good trialogue, and therefore my thanks are not merely formal but truly meant. We have become friends during this debate, and I think this friendship will probably lead us to give the Commission a hand because, Commissioner, the problem is the future. What we have achieved today has been thanks to Parliament, because if it had been down to the Council – incidentally absent today – we would not have achieved this result. A proposal of EUR 50 million was cut by the Council, and it is only thanks to the tough stand taken by myself and Mr Koumoutsakos that the Commission has been able to receive this EUR 40 million. The Commission can count on us for the future. It can count on a Parliament that believes in what it says. This Parliament is convinced to the extent that it knows perfectly well that the sea is made up of seas, coastlines and activities, and that there needs to be a common vision of these things. Coastlines cannot be the subject of urban and land planning that ends at the foreshore. The EU and Member States need to appreciate that town planning includes the sea – it does not end on the coastline. The activities themselves need to become compatible with one another. We need to initiate real planning in which tourism, fishing, mining and – why not? – the amazing wind energy that can be developed offshore can be an asset and mutually compatible, in the same way that fishing and fishing activities cannot be treated separately and considered only in terms of fishing methods and quantities. There, the focus will have to be on pollution-related issues, because dwindling fish stocks are not just the result of fishing. Commissioner, you have a major ally in Parliament. The problem will not be how to spend this EUR 40 million, but how we will all manage to have sufficient resources between 2013 and 2020 to do such important and wonderful things. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
).

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in this case, too, you have strong support from Parliament. Ms Lövin has carried out an extraordinary task, an excellent preliminary job, even though on some points and issues, she could have gone further. I have a different opinion as to whether or not it is appropriate or justified to set up a European coastguard, although I will support her position. I have a different opinion, but I will, in any case, support her position. Commissioner, there is only one real issue, and that is that the Commission needs to have a global role. We have said this in many different ways, and I think that this is the real key, to establish a real foreign policy for this activity. The relationship with the United States, China and Japan is crucial in this sense, because the essence of this activity lies within this relationship, within the construction of common rules and the resulting behaviours. Therefore the true goal is to increase awareness that fishing, in this sense, is a common asset, and a global common asset. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report was adopted with a huge majority in Parliament. I voted for it, but I would have liked to vote on something different, something bolder. In my opinion, Parliament has missed an opportunity to go further. It is quite true that the single European railway area can and must result in a much better relationship with consumers than we have had so far. Why stop, however, at a single national regulatory body and not push on towards a single European regulatory body? Why stop short of the issue of unbundling, bringing in a clear separation between ownership and service management? Yes, the budgets have been separated, but probably this time in Parliament it was not this House’s authority to make its voice heard that has prevailed, but rather the representatives of the abundant privilege and competition present today in the European railway market. We will only manage to truly change the fortunes of freight, improve people’s lives, improve the free circulation of goods when this single European space is worthwhile. Essentially, keeping well away from the train tracks is good for the health and not for economic policy; perhaps by getting too close you will get run over. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the budget sets out a few clear and important objectives within the scope of the Europe 2020 strategy; for this I should like to thank the rapporteurs, Ms Balzani and Mr Fernandes. It is essential to focus on investments and not merely on the careful management of the budget. The only alternative is to look on passively at the speculative way of thinking that dominates at present. We can no longer allow ourselves to follow individual interests and instead must finally act as a single, united structure, ready to face up to confrontation. I welcome the commitments adopted on the pilot projects and the preparatory actions in Heading 2, just as I welcome the fact that funding for the Integrated Maritime Policy is not to the detriment of other initiatives and programmes in the fisheries sector. This will allow us to implement policies for better marine resource management, through research and thoroughgoing exchange of data on fish stocks, bringing in new planning methods in the Adriatic area that can be used as best practices in other marine areas. I will conclude with a quick aside: with regard to future debates on the common fisheries policy (CFP) and in particular on the European Fisheries Fund (EFF), I hope that a greater effort will be made on fisheries control, which is at the heart of the fight against illegal fishing and is also a key issue in restoring stocks. Fish should be seen as a shared asset. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT) 
Mr President, I too welcome the vote on this report, even though a few points might well have been developed a little further. Reflecting on all the regionalisation and localisation of employment contracts cannot, however, fail to take heed of the important task of unifying workers’ rights. In other words, the greater the opportunity to develop territorial, business and sectoral autonomy to stimulate productivity and create the conditions for competitiveness, the greater the need to create the conditions for some fundamental rights to be applied on a supranational, or European, basis. That is why I am still puzzled as to whether this initiative could lead us to tackle the important issue of whether there can be a European policy on fundamental rights. Otherwise the alternative is that we will enter what I think will be a bad period in which there will be rich and poor workers, even though they are doing the same job. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Ms Koppa’s report is exceptionally current in what it really implies, and it comes at a time when the debate on Palestine is particularly important. Initiating this trade highlights the fact that we can no longer use this country just as a potential market, since until now, our exports to Palestine have been worth EUR 50 million and our imports from there only EUR 6 million. Instead, away from Israeli control, the country is preparing itself to play a role as an exporter to Europe, which we hope can truly help to change the fortunes of the Palestinian people in particular. I therefore voted wholeheartedly in favour of this report. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, many thousands of people die every year due to natural disasters and tens of billions of euro are lost. These are dramatic figures, and disasters are not always avoidable. Ms Gardini’s report is right on the mark in this respect, because it essentially identifies the two fundamental points in the new European civil protection strategy. The first is a thorough prevention plan, which can no longer be just the sum of the national prevention plans, and proper rules concerning prevention procedures. The second is the real, concrete idea of European civil protection, which cannot result from mere coordination but must be based on a genuine network. We have to move on from an emergency response requested by a country in relation to a disaster and the subsequent intervention, seen almost as a concession by another country, to a genuine strategy. With this hope in mind, I think the resolution adopted today is a useful one for the people of Europe. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is just a good initiative, but I think we will later have to develop a European policy on tourism. The European framework is a good idea, but I would like to focus on two issues. There is no sea or coastal tourism, we might say, but a coastal planning policy. I think the time has come for Europe to protect this important sector by producing an initiative in which ideas about the sea and coastline are not limited to a kind of town planning that ends at the foreshore and does not involve the sea as a whole. I think it will be useful to have an integrated policy on this, just as there will be a need to develop everything that lies behind the claims about rural tourism: rural tourism can be an excellent source of income for disadvantaged areas and areas where there is no work any more, where it is important to stop depopulation and instead encourage people to settle. For that, it is not enough just to make claims. We would need to suggest that Europe and the Member States take action on taxation. Perhaps developing tourism in rural areas could mean paying less tax; maybe that would create a real opportunity for tourism as a resource and for the people living in those areas. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have just three small points I should like to make, all centred on the fact that we need ‘more Europe’ in this area. I think it is an inescapable fact that on certain issues, we must not merely hope for more Europe, but actually set about building it. For example, more Europe means starting to really think about common traffic police and uniform safety rules. More Europe means having a European policy on training, not simply delegating it to the individual Member States, but instead putting together a proper training policy for schools, for young people and for slightly more at-risk categories, among whom motorcyclists were mentioned a moment ago, but we could talk about lorry drivers as well. More Europe means everyone having the same devices in their cars to improve safety conditions, such as alcolocks and anti-tiredness devices. This, in my view, would be a strategy well worth pursuing with businesses in the sector and European carmakers. Indeed, if all this was incorporated in a common policy, then I really think that conditions would, perhaps, improve. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt this is not purely a trade agreement. This agreement clearly contains a significant element of ‘political’ assistance. This does not involve treating Palestine and Israel in the same way; it is clear that their situations are different. The agreement with Israel is purely a trade agreement, a trade agreement that in some way supports a process leading to the constitution of a state, a process that brings improvements in the living conditions experienced by that population. Furthermore, the trade agreement with Europe has until now been mediated by Israel, and the result is one where imports form one tenth and exports nine tenths of our international trade. That means that we have seen, or rather, until now Europe has seen Palestine as a market and certainly not a place where producers should be encouraged to target the European market. It is my belief then, with compliments to Ms Koppa, that in this international context we would be doing the right thing tomorrow by using the vote in Parliament to send a strong, authoritative message that will help drive the process at the UN and the Warsaw meeting at the end of the month. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the single market, the freedom of movement and the Treaty of Lisbon are all elements which came about irrespective of changes to our method – either the European method or the national method – of lawmaking. We need to act on the commitments made in the light of these opportunities. In particular, we need to truly initiate a phase to simplify the legislative system, a simplification phase which must lead to a different kind of dialogue between Europe and the individual States. I would start precisely with our documents, and I would take this opportunity to suggest a kind of clarity test for our documents. When we draw up a white paper or a green paper, everything should be more understandable, and I would say that, in order to truly launch this virtuous phase of introducing legislation, the real, perhaps strategic proposal for our Europe, is to give particular responsibility to a European Commissioner who would have the specific task of clarifying legislation and relations between the States and Europe itself. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I support the adoption of this report because it has the effect of ensuring that the conditions applied to the Black Sea are proposed in other European areas, too. Regulating fishing in an area in which only two of the six countries bordering the basin are European is an important development. It is very similar to the situation in the Adriatic, for example, where different countries – EU, non-EU and candidate countries – with totally different rules exist side by side. The second reason is that I believe that the establishment of a European coastguard should be highlighted and viewed as a genuinely important development: it could actually be one of the first areas for discussion when planning how to protect the sea, fishermen and consumers. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT)
 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have taken the floor simply in order to lend my support to this report and to highlight two aspects in particular. The first, because it is part of the debate currently under way on the review of the common fisheries policy and on the fundamental decision relating to the regionalisation of a policy – a centralised policy – that has shown how utterly weak it is in recent years. This regionalisation phase is particularly relevant in the case of the Black Sea. I believe that the points contained in Ms Iotova’s report describe a specific situation, but one that is found in the rest of Europe, too: the situations in the Adriatic Sea, the Tyrrhenian Sea and the Aegean Sea are no different. In other words, the interaction between European fishing and non-European fishing, in particular, is often very harmful to European markets and to European consumers. The second aspect that I should like to highlight quickly is that of the call for a European coastguard. There can be no policy without controls. Controls are carried out today by different forces in Europe; I believe that the time has come to recognise that one of the main security forces in Europe, namely coastguards, can be managed jointly, can become more interdependent and, indeed, can form a single European body. In the hope that this will happen, I fully support the contents of Ms Iotova’s report. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Fukushima accident continues to produce very serious consequences, with radioactive water leaking into the sea at levels 6 500 times above legal limits. The risk of contaminated food products is high. Europe has established very strict controls but this applies only to fresh products. No rule has been issued to safeguard processed products, in particular tinned fish. We import 370 000 tonnes of tinned tuna. The principal suppliers are the countries of South-East Asia, which import fish from Japan. This means that tinned fish imported into Europe may contain Japanese fish. The provision of precise information about place of origin is crucial and urgent. Today consumers know where the tin was produced but not the place where the fish was caught. The Commission has recently acknowledged this and plans to close this gap with the reform of the common fisheries policy, but that will not enter into force until two years from now, just as the Sommer report, which is being debated in this plenary session, will not take effect until three years from now. We should not indulge in scaremongering but consumers have the right to urgent and clear information. The Commission should intervene as soon as possible. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I should like to express my overall satisfaction about the adoption of Mr El Khadraoui’s report. I believe it represents a step forward for consumer and environmental protection, including in terms of the positions of individual Member States, which sometimes complain of delays. Essentially, I think that by adopting this measure, Europe has demonstrated that it is further ahead than many Member States, which will clearly have to remedy this situation in short order. I come from a country whose government was rather tardy in expressing its interest in this directive. I therefore hope that Parliament’s decision will be productive and function as a stimulus so that the attitudes and the level of attention for this issue will be substantially improved in the not too distant future.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that this measure will mean that issues related to the Mediterranean are about to embark on an even more binding phase than has been achieved through the acts implemented to date. I believe that the act we are focusing on today is much more important than the effects of the 2006 EU regulation. I think it also offers a response to some limitations of that regulation which, because it is unilateral, has left large sections of the fishing industry with the idea that Europe is doing its bit but the other Mediterranean countries are not. I think it is strategic for us to address the issue from this aspect and with these characteristics. I believe that the work done by Mr Rivellini, which has been broadly welcomed, deserves formal thanks in this session.  However, I have the distinct feeling that the fact that we cannot resolve this issue on first reading and will move to a second reading, particularly over the interpretation of Article 28 of this regulation, raises one question: Parliament is siding with the Commission this time. Parliament is saying in essence that it is a good thing for these delegated acts to be the responsibility of the Commission and there is some resistance by the Council and, by the way, its absence today is significant. This act means that Parliament is now convinced that the operation of maintaining biodiversity, maintaining the abundance of fish in this important sea, will help secure the future of the fishers. That said, I think the next stage in the process must place the focus back on the idea of codecision. These delegated acts are delegated for a reason, and thus, today, they are the responsibility of the Commission, but the international agreements, when they come, have to be firmly the responsibility of Parliament. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think we have two problems, one relating to the method and the other to the merits of this matter. The problem with the method is that we are making use of an artifice, for which we thank Mrs Fraga, which is that of the oral question, to talk about something that should really, after the Treaty of Lisbon, be a Parliamentary right. I think this practice should end; we cannot resort to a strategy to see through an ordinary legislative procedure. Codecision occurs when this process is cultivated as the process develops. Today, we are having this debate, it will end, the agreement will go ahead and we will say yes or no at the end. This method should be changed. On the merits, however, because I agree with many things other Members have said, I simply wanted to stress the importance of measuring the effects of fisheries agreements to ensure these are not just mere trade agreements enabling us to buy cephalopods for EUR 1 per kilo in Mauritania. They must be able to measure sustainability but, above all, the impact on the economy of that country, to appreciate the quantitative change in employment figures, to appreciate the rate of innovation of small-scale fishing and to appreciate the use of these resources. It is not purely and simply about commercial trade, but a fisheries agreement, with all its implications. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

Madam President, a new season of rights is upon us, but these rights could have been more widespread. We must be aware that at distances of less than 250 km, the rights of the most vulnerable, of disabled people, old-age pensioners, and persons with reduced mobility, are not addressed at all in this measure. If it is true that homogenised quality standards are being established, it is just as true that excluding local transport seriously limits the number of passengers affected. Implementation over the course of the next four years will allow the sector to prepare itself as well as possible, but we will also need to monitor the establishment of the enforcement bodies. The result of this process represents a victory for Parliament and is a positive sign of our attention to citizens’ needs. However, compromise always implies mediation – and in this case concessions – of this House’s aims. Basically, we have shown that we are good interpreters of needs, in contrast to the Council which has shown that it only represents interests. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not want to break up this joyful atmosphere. It is true that we have come to the end of the phase begun in 2005, during which diplomacy helped to ensure that events unfolded in the best possible way. However, there are still many unresolved problems. This is a young country and will be a young country once secession has taken place. It is a country that still needs to establish its borders, address the issue we have heard mentioned several times of the conflicts in the Abyei region, the issue of the oil pipeline, which is the most important thing in that country, and also the international aid system. I would therefore like to make a very simple point to the Commissioner. There are two or three things that we need to do. We need to establish a strategy for Southern Sudan, and recognise this new State on 7 February, without waiting until 9 July when the results of the election are made official. We also need to put our international service into action immediately, and establish a delegation in Southern Sudan. This is the only way to support a process; this is the only way for smart, strategic diplomacy to support this country on the path to democracy. I would note that the first thing that the country needs to do is to draw up its constitution, and Europe can be of great help in this. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, it is important to link the condemnation of these attacks and the call for urgent, concrete measures to protect Christians around the world with the more general demand for respect for the freedom of religion and freedom of conscience and thought. There is no difference between someone who is murdered while attending mass and someone who is sentenced to death for adultery or for belonging to a Muslim, Christian or Jewish minority, or for having been born in a particular place rather than for practising a religion. The right to freedom and coexistence is universally recognised by humanist culture and international conventions. In contrast, we are seeing the world divided between those who uphold human rights and those who want to brutally extinguish them. Only an attitude open to dialogue and against any form of intolerance can provide a basis for protecting identities and values. A lack of respect for these can even lead to the expulsion of entire communities from their historical homelands. There is a great deal of work for Europe to do in this respect at a political and diplomatic level as well as in the cultural and social spheres. Today, we urge the Council and the Commission, and especially the High Representative for Foreign Affairs, to adopt clear guidelines for our relations with third countries in the context of the new European External Action Service. Bilateral agreements, too, must attach greater importance to the subjects of religious freedom and human rights more generally, violations of which should lead to the suspension of these agreements. I am also thinking that Europe should take a leading role in promoting dialogue between religions. A lack of such dialogue often goes beyond individual incidents and leads to real wars, in which religion conceals other, more complex reasons for conflict. Lastly, we must also look closer to home: there is no lack of cases of intolerance in Europe. Our cities are, in practice, multicultural, and that fact brings with it religious traditions and values that must be respected and afforded freedom of expression. There is, therefore, no alternative to dialogue and mutual respect. It is important to repeat the appeal made by religious communities. (The President cut off the speaker) Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have only one regret in this Chamber this evening, and that is that we are only discussing the Sahrawi people because the Moroccans have invaded the camp outside Laâyoune, and that is a shame for democracy in this Parliament. Parliament should have found the will to discuss this issue of its own accord, as it has been rotting on international negotiating tables for 30 years. This is the most significant political fact. We were forced into it by acts of violence, not because we autonomously decided to guarantee human rights. What is the fact that a referendum for self-determination should be held there, if not a question of respect for human rights? Precisely because Morocco is our friend, because Morocco is the strong party in the relationship, we must forcefully request that it is no longer possible to postpone this desire and follow up with all consequent actions. We must seek to create the conditions so that the aim of the UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) is not only to realise the conditions for a referendum which is constantly being postponed. We must try to use all the means at the disposal of the European Union to bring this event about and ensure that the referendum does justice to a people’s 30 years of suffering. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one minute is not long enough to cover four reports. I therefore congratulate the three other rapporteurs, but I will only comment on Mr Ferreira’s report. Adherence to the principles of biodiversity must be central to the actions which the European Union undertakes with regard to fishing and aquaculture. The compromise amendment is the result of the good work carried out by Mr Ferreira, who has clearly understood these concerns. We must not have preconceived ideas when looking for ways to improve fish farming standards, but we must be rigorous in the control and application of regulations which are as precise as possible, in order to avoid the risk of altering the environmental balance. In this way, the greatest support for organic production is a decision which is made in the general interest and which encompasses the protection of biodiversity. That, in fact, is the best way of optimising the production of native species. Commissioner, I hope that, as part of the common fisheries policy reform, this further measure with regard to aquaculture can be included in one simplified regulation. This will simplify matters greatly, and I hope that a single regulation on aquaculture will make the procedures as a whole even simpler. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 30 years ago, Morocco denied for many years that there was a war with the Sahrawi people and today, it is still denying that there is disproportional repression of these same people. Yet, in the Western Sahara, there are dead and wounded people of a population that is only claiming the right to live in freedom in its own land. Morocco has largely closed its borders to anyone who could witness these events. No information and no members of parliament are allowed in. A member of the French parliament and our fellow Member, Mr Meyer, were denied access. Europe looks on passively. There is no news from the Commission on this matter, which makes us subordinate to United Nations mediation, which continues to fail just as it has done for the past 30 years. Baroness Ashton, who is responsible for foreign policy, has not taken a stand on the subject. We need to react by Parliament making a stand. We need to react against Morocco, curtailing all initiatives on commercial agreements, beginning with the renewal of the fishing agreements. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur. When it comes to integrated maritime policy, we must go beyond the stage of good intentions and give fresh impetus to a strategy that will represent a route to growth and development in the European Union, making up for the huge amount of time lost in the prevention of environmental disasters, and in the fight against climate change and pollution. Only this morning Mr Pirillo reminded Parliament of yet another catastrophic event that occurred the other day in the town of Paola, in Calabria. The Commission must prove that it is making a real effort, that it is not just using its instruments of governance but actually implementing targeted legislative measures, and duly learning its lessons from past mistakes caused by an approach that was often too sectoral in nature. We are fully aware that this is a very complex process, but we are at a difficult and demanding juncture where no lapse in attention can be tolerated and where adequate investment and shared governance mechanisms are needed both at interinstitutional level and in international cooperation for the regional basins, among which the Mediterranean stands out because of the complexity of its jurisdiction. That is why it will be crucial to view the management of the Mediterranean basin as an asset shared by all the coastal States, on the basis of the res communis omnium
, or common heritage, principle. Otherwise, the increasingly widespread practice of unilaterally declaring exclusive economic zones or the like in the Mediterranean Sea, as well as running counter to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, would undermine the idea of effective, shared governance. I would point out in this respect that, only a month ago, this interpretation on the part of Libya resulted in an actual armed assault on a European fishing boat, and it would be wrong to argue that this is just a matter between Italy and Libya.

Madam President, the revision of the agreement between Parliament and the Commission establishes the basis for improved collaboration between the two institutions. Much progress has been made with regard to procedure, legislative planning, parliamentary scrutiny, requirements to provide information and the Commission’s presence in Parliament. However, the point which I am most eager to highlight is the progress made with respect to the interinstitutional aspect of international relations. The role given to Parliament should not be considered as strengthened: it is a requirement. We hope that no one casts doubt on allowing the presence of European Parliament observers at multilateral and bilateral international conferences as anything but an act of responsibility. Indeed, denying the status of observer to Members of the European Parliament in bilateral agreements, such as, for example, fisheries agreements, prevents, de facto, full knowledge of the area being negotiated, upon which Parliament will subsequently be required to express its opinion. I believe that it is not possible to do without these preconditions, as otherwise we would end up with Parliament rejecting bilateral agreements which, by definition, cannot be amended and which, in the absence of a partnership, would make the vote a mere formality. Guido Milana,

 Madam President, Commissioner, Members of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, on 4 May we in committee unanimously voted in favour of the report on European aquaculture, which is essentially aimed at promoting the sustainable development of the sector. I would like to begin by thanking everyone who worked on this report over the last few months, providing me with valuable support. This text was, in fact, drafted over many long months of work, consultation and concerted action, and I hope it will provide the foundation on which to promote a suitable aquaculture policy in a serious, practical and effective manner. I also think that, in the light of its technological potential and innovative aspects, the healthy and sustainable development of aquaculture represents an extremely important resource for the European economy. In adopting the report, the MEPs have first of all demonstrated great awareness, highlighting that they have fully understood the urgent need for legislative clarity in this area. In other words, they have proved that they are indeed aware of the negative consequences caused by the lack of a single regulation on aquaculture, the confusion among operators in the sector, the complex and excessively bureaucratic procedures, the highly discriminatory situations, the market distortions and the low level of competitiveness of European production. The report maintains that there is a need to provide greater impetus to the sector by establishing a specific aquaculture fund that is either independent or part of the European Fisheries Fund, to be used to support research and innovation, to further the virtuous coexistence of sustainability and competitiveness, and to focus serious attention on employment issues. Admittedly, many measures are needed in the short term in order to deal with and resolve all of the problems that currently plague this sector, and they are not easy to implement. I am talking about an integrated maritime development plan, which is essential for making aquaculture facilities in freshwater, sub-coastal and offshore areas compatible with areas for tourism and other activities of financial importance, all within the framework of the regulations on environmental protection. I am talking about the drafting of a regulation that will consider the specific aspects of each type of aquaculture farming, to be introduced above all with the intention of lowering production costs and of guaranteeing environmental protection. From this perspective I believe that the contribution made by both technological innovation and scientific research is crucial. The task will be to actually establish facilities to reduce the dispersion of feed into the water. To this end it will be necessary to increase the utilisation of plant instead of animal proteins without altering the nutritional value of the catch. With regard, more specifically, to scientific research on feed, we will also have to focus on waste and processing scraps to prevent likely imbalances in the maritime system caused by dangerous overfishing for fish feed. The use of the European quality label helps us to compete with products imported from third countries and to meet consumers’ needs and health requirements. Indeed, I believe that it is now crucial that we introduce product certification and supervision of the sector to enable these products to be identified, and adapt the labelling systems accordingly. Last but not least, we need to design facilities that take greater account of the wellbeing of fish, farm density and slaughtering methods. Moreover, these are all measures that should be applied to organic products, too, which are in fact the result of production that is on a smaller scale and less damaging to the environment. The employment aspect must not be underestimated, since the aquaculture sector may also be the best place for fishermen who have lost their jobs. A full vote by Parliament will certainly be the best incentive for the Commission, after its communication and our reasoned opinion, to go beyond the stage of recommendation to the Member States and actually propose the measures needed in order to develop a European policy and to stop Europe being the producer of 1.2 million tonnes of fish and the consumer of over 5.5 million tonnes. Thank you, and excuse me for running over. Guido Milana,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the debate and for your positive comments on this document, which has all the same enjoyed widespread support over the last few months. Commissioner, you have a historic opportunity. In 2001 Parliament discussed this same subject and published a communication, but there has been no follow-up. However, today I believe that the time is ripe. Since 2001 world aquaculture production has increased by 6% while European production has barely increased by 0.8%. Indeed, with such a broad consensus – which I believe will result in a majority vote by this House in an hour or so – you have the real possibility to put our work to good use. What is more, the Council has also encouraged you in this direction by fully endorsing the stance that Parliament is taking. I believe, therefore, that this occasion must be fully taken advantage of in two ways. I would have liked to have said this to Mr Stevenson, who is no longer here: delegislation and simplification absolutely do not mean lowering the level of guarantees for operators and consumers. Often, delegislation can mean making the guarantees clearer for both consumers and producers. Therefore we need to make an effort along these lines. There is only one point on which I too disagree slightly. I believe that you are too resigned to matters to challenge the European framework surrounding the powers of the Directorates-General. Have the courage to do so, Commissioner. Have the courage to do so, because simplification in the interests of Member States and European citizens only helps to strengthen European integration. If there is one thing that is clear to me, it is the specific point that Parliament is making to you today: that one should not always be restricted with regard to the powers of the Directorates-General. There is someone who assigns those powers, I therefore ask you to reflect on them too. This does not mean taking away a duty or function from the authority supervising the environment. It does not mean taking away a function from the authority supervising consumer protection. It means having a Europe in which these functions are fully integrated. That is basically the sole aim of the single regulation: to streamline the regulations in order to make them simpler and more practical for operators. I have one last comment. After the speech this morning I am tempted to go on holiday to Scotland, and I may just consider doing that, but I would not be against Greece either, if I could change your mind there about the last few points which divide us. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to highlight two points and also thank Mr Romeva i Rueda for his extraordinary work. The first point is that this is an important occasion because we are adopting a law at first reading for the first time. The second is that this work has a deadline and that deadline, as Mr Romeva i Rueda already stated at the beginning, is the next Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) meeting, in four years’ time. If what we have written and will adopt today works, then in four years’ time we will probably not have the problem of inclusion in the CITES. That is my hope. I do not want this so much for the sake of fishermen, but for the sake of tuna. The effectiveness of our action derives from our ability, over the next four years, to apply the regulation that is adopted today and to develop supervision conditions. I would like to say a few words on this aspect. We have an extraordinary Control Agency in Vigo, which does a good job of controlling tuna fishing in the Mediterranean. Yet this agency, which has limited funding and needs greater resources, single-handedly coordinates controls, or rather it offers the individual Member States the possibility to do so. I think we need to take a look at this agency and try to create the conditions to grant it direct responsibility for controls and a greater degree of authority that goes beyond simple coordination. Please excuse me for running over. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I support – and I have also tabled amendments in this regard – the inclusion of bluefin tuna in Appendix II. Supporting this certainly does not make feel me like a criminal. On the contrary, I feel very much on the same wavelength as those who, before me, starting with Mrs Gardini, upheld a different position. It is deeply flawed to put tigers, polar bears, elephants and tuna on equal terms. The FAO would never allow itself to say anything different or to support a different position for these other endangered species. Holding a different view on how to manage the tuna issue certainly does not mean forgetting that biodiversity is a value that must be defended at all costs. The spirit of the motion for a resolution is absolutely worthy of support. However, at a time when some people seem to be taking a step backwards in terms of estimating tuna biomass in the sea, rapidly moving towards inclusion in Appendix I probably means overlooking the side effects of this choice, which are severe and sometimes irreversible in many sectors of our economy. In some ways, the same goes for the issue of coral and for its inclusion in Appendix II. Here, too, there is data that does not definitely indicate the extinction or endangerment of deep coral, coral that is at a depth of more than 150-200 metres, which is what is covered by the measure. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT) 
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make just two observations. I think that we ought not to argue about greater privatisation, competition or what have you. It is clear that the logic of rushing to reduce costs is a negative factor in terms of safety standards. When there are attempts to reduce costs because a major competition mechanism is launched, it is inevitable that safety standards should fall. The real issue is that I believe the Commission ought to initiate a more rigorous phase based around a more strategic role for the European Railway Agency. It ought to take on a role of greater coordination, control and supervision over the national safety agencies, and it ought to do so in a much speedier manner precisely because of the differences between the various countries, which my fellow Members have already alluded to, regarding contradictions between national and European legislation. In my view, there are huge delays on this aspect. The model ought to be that of the European Aviation Safety Agency, and it should have the same binding powers over actions and enforcement. If there is a call to be made to the Commission today, it is that it should move more swiftly in this direction. The Commissioner has said that we need to wait for the results of the investigations into the accidents. On the contrary, I believe that these results will add nothing to the existing situation. Another element, Commissioner, which probably does not fall within your sphere of responsibilities, and which is probably also outside the scope of this evening’s debate, is that, all too often, the legislation as a whole does not ensure that anyone suffering loss or damage as a result of a railway accident – given that the rate of railway accidents is still low – receives immediate acknowledgment from the person bearing liability for it.

 Mr President, we still have a long way to go, but today we may have taken an important step towards finally introducing and levying a tax on financial transactions. I understand the prudence, the caution, the need to do things gradually expressed by Mr Šemeta and the technical issues rightly raised by Ms Vestager. Precisely for this reason, though, I hope that Parliament will express a clear, political will, with a broad majority, in order to encourage and drive forward the initiatives necessary to address the unresolved problems, especially at Council level. We all want to closely examine the impact of this tax, but it is not right to stir up unfounded fears which could even lead to contradictory and counterproductive choices. I refer, for example, to the rationale behind the proposed exemptions. If we are careful to reduce the impact of the tax, it is important to have as broad a tax base as possible, with a low rate, and not to attempt to extend the exemptions ad infinitum
. To those who are concerned about the consequences for small investors, I would point out the progressive nature of the tax, so those who carry out several transactions are affected more, and it is clear that the competent authorities must, in any case, ensure that there are no attempts to offload the possible costs onto end users. I therefore hope that Parliament will vote in favour of this tax by a large majority. Leonardo Domenici  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to ask Mr Barroso some questions, but I am happy to ask them of Mr Rehn. Commissioner, have you and the European Commission read that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) does not expect Italy to balance its budget in 2013 or very likely in 2014 either? Does this forecast stimulate any particular thoughts? I am speaking about Italy, but I could very easily be speaking about other countries. The strangest thing is that the IMF tells us, of course, that if there were no recession, Italy would have a surplus of 0.6%. That is great. However, the problem is that there is a crisis, there is a recession, and it is difficult to pretend that there is not. Mr Rehn, in Europe, are we making choices based on an analysis of the actual situation we are experiencing, or are we simply applying a doctrine based on abstract principles? I believe that we continue to focus on objectives that are not in line with the economic cycle. Commissioner, today, we have been told about the European Commission’s plans for growth, but are you sure that growth based on supply-side policy principles is enough, without considering the at least equal importance of a policy that acts on the aggregate demand side? Commissioner, I shall end with an appeal. I beg you to speak truthfully to European citizens, truthfully about the crisis and the concrete fact that we still do not have any choices to take at the moment. Leonardo Domenici  (S&amp;D

Mr President, yesterday in Florence, an extremely serious event took place which has caused horror and anguish: an armed fifty year-old man opened fire on five citizens of Senegalese origin in two markets in Florence – two of these victims have died and three are now in a serious condition in hospital. The murderer then committed suicide. The man was a member of the racist and xenophobic far right, who wanted to kill people who were strangers to him, guilty only of having black skin. Florence is my city, and before being elected to the European Parliament I was mayor of Florence for ten years. Florence is a civilised and democratic city, with a gold medal for resistance to Nazi fascism. Yet this abominable racist crime took place in Florence, a demonstration of the fact that Nazi fascistic madness can appear anywhere and we must never think that it has been wholly eradicated. Mr President, I ask you to express the European Parliament’s grief and to repeat this House’s commitment to combating every kind of intolerance and racism and working to improve respect for the dignity and rights of all human beings.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis is not a new phenomenon; it has existed for several years. Perhaps now is the time to undertake a critical review of the policies implemented up to now: have things always been done well? Have we always analysed the situation correctly? Has the right approach been chosen? Has the European Central Bank which, as Minister Rostoski said, has saved Europe, always taken the correct course of action, even when it has raised interest rates through fear of inflation? President Barroso has identified a problem: the speed of the markets and the slowness of policy; yet is this the only problem? Of course, if we consider that we are still implementing the 21 July agreement, this ought at least to suggest that we need to prepare for and organise summits and their conclusions better, but policy will always lag behind the markets. We therefore need to look further, concentrating our efforts on combating unemployment and encouraging growth. These are the areas that the European Commission should focus on; even today in President Barroso’s speech, there was more substance with regard to the deficit than with regard to signs of growth and development. The Commission must overcome its failings and state that the priority is the fight against unemployment, job creation, the redistribution of wealth and public investment strategies, while also amending the rules in the new European Stability and Growth Pact.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Tusk, your speech fills us with hope, the hope that the Polish Presidency will help combat the Europe of national selfishness, which fails to look to the future, and will help further a Europe that genuinely thinks of itself as being real, integrated and sharing a common destiny. However, as you rightly said in your speech, presidencies have specific problems to tackle and solve. In the short time that I have, I wish to draw your attention to two crucial issues relating to the economic and financial crisis. The first issue concerns the reform of the financial markets. This is not a technical problem but a major democratic issue of our time. Too much time is being taken: we need to settle issues such as the one relating to the reform of short selling and over-the-counter derivatives. The second issue is that we have the matter of the tax on financial transactions to address; we need to look at this issue in detail, and we hope that the Polish Presidency will make a real contribution in this regard.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to join in thanking Mr Langen and the other Members with whom we have worked to finalise this complex report. I think that Mr Langen made a particularly important point when he said that we wish to maintain the scope of this regulation, keeping faith with the mandate of the G20 in Pittsburgh in 2009. The basic objective was to bring the majority of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives onto regulated platforms in order to prevent their continuing exposure to a high level of risk and speculation. When it comes down (as it did) to exchanging or guaranteeing USD 400 million without collateral, that is, without adequate reserves, the risks we are running become clear. Having said that, however, I should also like to raise two problems. The first problem is the relationship with the Council; the second problem is the coherence of the proposal for reform of the financial markets that we must take forward. I raise the problem regarding the Council first and I say it very clearly. The feeling is all too often that the Council represents an obstacle to reforming the financial markets swiftly and well. I hope that the new Presidency will take on this problem because this time too we have to factor in an extension that is due in large measure to positions, difficulties and disputes arising in the Council. It is a problem that also affects the procedure that we wish to follow. The second question relates to the coherence and specificity of the provisions. There is not only the measure on OTC derivatives but also the measure on short selling and other matters. I would like to draw attention to two points: the specific issue of the commodities market, a special market that requires special anti-speculation measures, and the problem of the exposure in derivatives of local authorities in EU countries. I think that these are problems on which Parliament must intervene. Leonardo Domenici  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we are witnessing a paradox. The package that should correct and prevent imbalances and asymmetries is based on an imbalance and a lack of symmetry. It is like a body that stands on two legs, but one is much longer and more developed than the other. The leg that controls fiscal policy is muscular and articulated, while the one that controls development policy, which should provide impetus and long-term drive, appears spindly and lacking in strength. I think that this inharmonious result in the final structure of the package is down to a difference of opinion about the origins and nature of the crisis. The difference between those who believe that disorder and imbalances in public finances are at the root of the crisis and those who think that the underlying problem has to do instead with the lack of rules and transparency in the markets, economic and trade imbalances and social inequality. We risk confusing cause and effect. We all want public finances to be controlled responsibly, but the goal of reducing debt is not sufficient to kick-start growth and competitiveness. The main thrust of these measures lies in procedures and sanctions. Far less emphasis – too little emphasis – has been placed on investment and sustainable growth strategy, which Europe should promote and implement. We know that our actions can lead to widely differing results, even without our intending it, and can even have the opposite effect to the one we are seeking to achieve. This is the heterogenesis of purpose. I fear that this problem lies at the heart of this package. Leonardo Domenici  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Podimata’s report contains many important aspects that are not limited to the issue of the financial transaction tax. The report is packed with analysis and suggestions and I hope it is widely supported by this House. It could be the basis for the genuine new European tax policy that we need. On the subject of tax harmonisation, this report also contains proposals that move towards a tax harmonisation that gives new strength and subjectivity to Europe, although it is clear that at the moment, the debate focuses mainly on the financial transaction tax, to be applied as a first step across Europe. I think this is the time for courageous decisions, which should be applied in a balanced way, but still indicate the direction forward. I believe that Europe has a responsibility to show the world the way ahead; I believe that this House has a responsibility to send out a signal and a political message. Let me say one thing to Mr Schmidt, whose intelligence and lucidity I really respect: be careful with the arguments we use, because if we say today that we cannot levy a financial transaction tax because there are tax havens, we will make European citizens feel helpless at a time when many of these financial institutions are starting to go back into the black. Not only the Socialists are saying this. In my country, Italy, this proposal is also supported by many autonomous and independent groups; it is also supported by the Catholic, democratic movement for the promotion of development and balanced growth.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although the theme of good tax governance has always been of great importance, it has become even more relevant and significant following the major economic and financial crisis of two years ago. European and international summits – the G20 – have discussed and continue to discuss it, particularly when they are concerned with fighting tax evasion and tax havens. All this is important. It is a sign of commitment and willpower, but we should not delude ourselves into thinking that an announcement is all it is going to take. We need an effective and ongoing policy. There are still many problems to be dealt with. It really is still much too easy to buy or set up a front company in order to avoid taxation. Just look around on the Internet: there are thousands of websites offering companies for sale, even in European Union countries. Often, all you have to do is send an email and attach a photocopy of a scanned passport in order to set up a company. We must put a stop to the practice of creating fictitious legal entities to evade tax. The report I am presenting is based on the European Commission communication of 28 April 2009 on Promoting Good Governance in Tax Matters. The report moves towards putting forward firm proposals, and calls for a strong commitment from the European Commission and Council, so that these proposals can be implemented. The fight against tax havens, tax evasion and illicit capital flight must be considered priorities of the European Union. Hence the principle of good governance, based on transparency, exchange of information, cross-border cooperation, and fair tax competition. The point is that we need increasing tax cooperation and collaboration in the European Union. The general objective that we must set ourselves is for automatic information exchange on a global and multilateral scale, but this must, obviously, start within the European Union. As Mrs Alvarez has already said, we must completely abolish bank secrecy in European Union countries and hasten to put an end to the temporary derogation that allows the application of a withholding tax, which is often evaded or underestimated, instead of an exchange of information. I do not wish to dwell on the tangible proposals that the report contains. I will, however, stress that we still particularly need the following things: to extend the scope of the 2003 Savings Directive, to fight VAT fraud, to create an EU public register listing the names of individuals and undertakings having set up companies or accounts in tax havens and to give new impetus to tax harmonisation projects, beginning with the common corporate consolidated tax base. The European Union must also send out only one message internationally, and fight for the improvement of OECD standards to achieve the automatic sharing of information, instead of sharing on request. Mr Kovács, having listened to the other reports as well, we need strong commitment by the Commission and we now also need these priorities to be emphasised to the new Commission at the time of handover. As the European Parliament, we are entitled to call on the Council and the Commission to account for their work. I thank my fellow Members, and especially the shadow rapporteurs, for the contribution they have made to this work, which I hope will be adopted by Parliament. Leonardo Domenici,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my thanks for the comments on our reports, the products of a collective effort. I hope that these comments are a good omen for a positive vote by the European Parliament. I believe that – as Mr Stolojan and Mr Casa also said – our reports deserve support, if only on behalf of all our fellow citizens: honest taxpayers, who are the first to suffer from fraud and tax evasion. The aim is to make everyone pay, so that each individual has to pay less. I would just like to make two comments. Mrs Lulling spoke, at the beginning of the debate, about tax colonoscopy. I know from experience that a colonoscopy is not a pleasant examination, even if it can be very beneficial to human health. In the sphere of tax, there is a very simple way of avoiding it: it is simply not to conceal, not to hide one’s own income and not to evade one’s legal obligations. The second comment is that it is right to always be concerned about how public money is being used, but it is also right to do so when governments are forced to use that public money to bail out banks and financial institutions that have speculated their money.

Mr President, we are here to debate again a topic of great importance. The positive outcome of the negotiations on the treaty for visually impaired and blind people will finally open access to millions of books across the world. We are dealing with a fundamental right, not with charity. Commissioner Barnier, I remember and recognise your personal commitment more than a year ago here in this room. We are now taking the very last steps before an agreement. In Marrakesh the Commission and the Member States must find a compromise to the deadlock we are now facing. Two points are still open. Excuse me if I go into detail. Are you going to change the provision in the current text on the commercial availability requirement which is basically watering down the meaning of the Treaty, which would be, paradoxically, even less ambitious than a memorandum of understanding? We must delete commercial availability. Secondly, are you allowing for the possibility of sending a book to an individual rather than two organisations? Remember the opportunities offered by current technology. Let us come back to the core reason for the treaty. The current legal framework and the functioning of the market are not sufficient to provide a real solution to the book famine that the visually impaired still live with. Our goal is to have a good and effective treaty for the benefit of blind and visually-impaired people. We will not just be unlocking a problem affecting millions of European citizens, we will also be showing our loyalty to our constitutive values – human dignity, culture, equality and freedom of access.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to congratulate Ms Geringer de Oedenberg for her most patient and persistent work, which has led to a result that we look upon favourably, despite a number of question marks. The directive we are going to adopt is important, not only because it increases the number of people with access to artistic and original works – which, in itself, is highly significant – but also because it marks a break from a position which, to date, has had a negative effect on the spread of culture: a reverence for copyright to the extent of wishing to defend it even if there is no right holder, who might have died or is unconcerned. Moreover, the narrow-mindedness of collecting societies is an obstacle to the spread of culture, which is why we have arrived here with delays and with great difficulty. I refer, for example, to attitudes on access for blind people to cultural works and attitudes on private copying. On this issue, we have found ourselves confronted with a kind of wall, which today – thanks to this measure – we have been able to demolish or at least breach. The measure we are going to adopt has great political significance and the step forward we are about to take surely deserves our approval. There are, no doubt, some shortcomings – so I also understand some of the concerns raised by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance – but these do not add up to a reason to fail to grasp this opportunity and the significant innovation that this step represents. Fortunately, Mr Barnier has tabled the regulation on collecting societies under debate in our committee, so we are addressing this critical issue in order that the whole range of arguments and topics relating to copyright can be dealt with in the right way. It is a good proposal, which we think needs amending and improving but is worthy of support, thus convincing us yet further to vote in favour. Luigi Berlinguer  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to draw this Chamber’s attention to the fact that yesterday, it was officially announced that the Higgs boson has been measured and definitively identified. The particle that gives mass to all the others and their existence, and this happened on European soil. Science brings our earth to life, it gives us civilisation and well-being and, for a time, we can aspire to becoming a scientific hub once again. Utopia is characteristic of man, who invents a utopia and wants to build it, and it is through science and this wonderful ambition man has that today someone who is blind, who has no eyes, can see with his hands or read a book with his ears, and a young South African boy who has no legs can compete in the Olympics in a race. Well, Europe must be the home of science! This great event that will open up new frontiers of knowledge must be completely supported by Europe. Luigi Berlinguer  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) has been a very serious political mistake, not to mention a legal one, because it has caused a worldwide reaction of immense proportions, and that is enough to say that it is a political mistake. Why immense? Because it has created the suspicion that access to the Web, which is a great modern revolution, would really be inhibited. Why is this? Because it has made the mistake of lumping together counterfeiting and piracy, which are two totally different issues. The way to combat counterfeiting has nothing to do with copyright. Then there is another mistake, in that it has excluded Parliament from an important activity that it has been doing for some time: creating a new copyright, although some people would like to retain the old copyright law, which existed before the Web. The point is that we have to work on copyright and put ACTA aside, as it is an obstacle. We have to reject it, exclude it, because it is an obstacle to our work. Fortunately, the Commission, after months and years of hesitation, has brought two important measures to the attention of Parliament: orphan works and the one regarding copyright management companies. This is positive; let us work on this rationally rather than just emotionally, but without letting ACTA get in the way. Luigi Berlinguer,  
rapporteur. 
– Madam President, let me thank all the colleagues of the Committee on Culture and Education for their collaboration in preparing this report on the Bologna process on the consolidation and development of a European university system. I have a dream that every student applying to a university in any Member State should be enabled to get a degree, a qualification valid in all the territories of Europe, within the whole European labour market. This is definitely one of the ways to build up European unity and European citizenship. This is the deep meaning of this report. (Loud applause) Luigi Berlinguer,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I too would like to echo the warm greetings extended to Mr Lechner and the assessment of his work, which he carried out with competency, tenacity and determination: a labour of love, sometimes this draft regulation met with an obstacle and he withdrew it and began negotiating again with the Council, with the Commission, and with the Committee on Legal Affairs. I believe he can be proud of this. I note that there is unanimous consensus in his favour. Turning to this regulation of ours, I too am convinced that this is an important thing, which may not hit the headlines in the press, may not be considered high politics, but the construction of the European Union also involves meeting the needs of citizens in their daily lives – first and foremost of those millions of people with interests in more than one Member State dealing with procedures that are difficult to unravel, tedious and which sometimes touch on sensitive issues at the heart of a family which politics generally finds difficult to grasp. The European Union should take pride in being based on such sensitive attention. The solutions that have been proposed are new and intelligent ones. For example, those drawing up a will have been given the freedom to choose between their habitual residence and their state of origin. This makes decision-making more flexible, since there are such major differences between one State and another that the question of succession could always be rather tricky. But the law has also been made more certain, because once the legal solution has been chosen – either habitual residence or country of origin – this requires limitations of the jurisdiction and of the conflicts that can arise and therefore it is a more peaceful way of proceeding in this area and so there is more freedom and more certainty. Then there is the certificate of succession: now, we may believe that certificates are of little importance, but they create the conditions to ensure the heir is in a condition of greater flexibility and certainty with regard to all the possible difficulties that may arise. That is a positive aspect of this law. It is true,  this law is by no means perfect: there are problems concerning whether there is an executor of the will or not, the feasibility of direct inheritance, and so on, but I just want to say another word of a political nature. We hope that the Council will approve this text, and we hope it will become law. However, we must not lay this text to rest, because we cannot have England in a different condition – with the United Kingdom left like that – because Europe cannot do without the United Kingdom, and so we must therefore make sure that we overcome these difficulties. Thank you. Luigi Berlinguer,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has produced a massive amount of laws and standards to establish European legislation, and has created the European area known as the Stockholm Programme. There is an imbalance between this monumental amount of legislation and the use which citizens make of it, which is numerically, in percentage terms, very limited. On the other hand, national judges, lawyers working within individual States have grown up with the legislation of their own country and are mainly trained in this sense, whereas we believe that the true European judges are national judges capable of changing their mentality and imbuing themselves with a knowledge of European law. Therefore, before talking about training we need to discuss a great communication campaign aimed at citizens and legal practitioners, so that they can be the vehicles for this great innovation andso that they can increase capacity to profit from the benefits provided by this legislation. Primarily, though, it is a grassroots movement that must be created, through in-service training – we cannot provide judicial training of professionally highly qualified adults as if it were a lesson for schoolchildren. We must stimulate curiosity in dealing with their cases, encouraging them to connect with other colleagues and to come up with solutions, given that today common law and civil law are converging, and are not as far apart as they once were within our judicial culture. This is the real point. In our proposals, and I am happy that the European Commission is now convinced of this, we are calling for a reversal of the trend: bottom-up, more legal status than judicial training. There in a very interesting example in the Netherlands, called Eurinfra: it is a network of leaders in every court who spread this knowledge and push magistrates on this issue. This is the substance of our project, and we hope to have the full support of the Commission. Luigi Berlinguer,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the purpose of this report is to relaunch the initiative on the Bologna Process, keeping in our minds and in our sights an important goal, which is that qualifications awarded by universities across Europe must have overall recognition and validity. Once someone has earned a qualification at a university in a Member State, it must be such that all other universities recognise it, this is the main objective. It is a mistake to consider university education as a matter that is exclusively internal to Member States. The true dimension of the university and place of study is international, because studies and research are international, and professions are now international. We need to free the professional market from the shackles and ties which today impede employment mobility within Europe. This is a precondition that has economic value and also provides a response to a great aspiration on the part of young people. Who is this task incumbent on? It is up to individual Member States to organise study courses, but recognition abroad is not a task that can be performed within the State, it is up to the European Union to provide and make a policy to encourage this. Article 149 of the Treaty of Lisbon states that it is the task of the EU to recognise qualifications, contribute to the development of the quality of education and higher education, and develop its European dimension. For this reason, our report points out that, as well as the responsibility of the Member States, there is also a need to underline the EU’s responsibility; and the biennial meetings of the ministers of education, such as the upcoming one in Bucharest, must gradually come under the remit of the EU. What is to be done then? Our report identifies a number of measures, within the framework of a series of procedures, a gradual approach to achieve them: to support any actions that tend to give a European profile to universities within the EU; curriculum flexibility; learning outcomes and consequently monitoring for the assessment of learning outcomes; assessment for the quality of what happens in universities as a condition to create that trust between different higher educational establishments which lies at the heart of mutual recognition. The final goal is to set up automatic procedures that attest to the validity of qualifications throughout Europe. Secondly, remove social barriers against young people, against students from weaker sections of society, which today are being exacerbated by the cuts on the part of many governments. Change the teaching, to make it more learning centred, develop life-long learning, build a European higher education sector to enter into dialogue with the European research sector. These measures are instruments of growth. More than 900 years ago in Bologna, a great jurist, Irnerius, spread the idea of creating with the Alma Mater
 the unification of European culture. It was a time when there were no States. Now that States do exist, there is a supranational dimension and today for that reason we call upon the EU to promote a European university citizenship. Thank you. Luigi Berlinguer  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what we are asking for is a new treaty to regulate exceptions for the visually impaired on cultural works and on books. This is not charity – it is a fundamental right to access culture. The European Union and, in particular, the Commission, has not been particularly active: it has not done enough and has, in my opinion, been too conservative, almost to the point, in essence, of boycotting the Treaty itself. I refer to the amendments proposed by the European Union in November in Geneva. Fine words need to be followed up by concrete action. Voluntary agreements are not enough: it is a treaty that we need. So we must remove the legal obstacles that block the circulation and usage of works in Braille and in electronic format, the latter being particularly suitable for the visually impaired. We must no longer come up with the pretext that the treaty represents a danger for copyright per se

Madam President, Commissioner, in Europe growth is now a necessity we can no longer put off. It depends also on liberalisation measures addressing the obstacles and privileges that are strangling the internal digital market as well. Among these is the need for a new copyright regime, in particular for collective rights management, given that copyright represents 7% of our European gross domestic product (GDP). Reform is urgent, Commissioner, and we have awaiting it for a long time now. It has been announced many times with deadlines and dates that have never been respected, as you have indirectly admitted. We have been waiting for this directive for over two years, just as we have been hoping that the subject of Directive 2004/48/EC on the Enforcement of Property Rights and Directive 2001/29/EC would be addressed by an up-to-date scheme of exceptions. One had hoped that it would come to pass within this parliamentary term. Yet today our debate is contaminated with ‘ideologisms’ that artificially set artists in conflict with the right of free access to the web, in a paralysing conflict that is both noxious and sterile. All this must be resolved with innovative legal and technological ideas for a new concept of artists’ rights, which begins in the first place with their management. Although interesting proposals and opinions have been put forward, no progress has been made on this idea. Mr Barnier, you had significant success with patents, for which I congratulate you because I hold you in high esteem. On this issue, however, you are stalling. Why? Both you and the rapporteur, Ms Gallo, have spoken of genuine difficulties which, as you have said, partly justify this delay. The problem is that existing collective management companies and record companies represent powerful interests that are defending their patch. That is the main obstacle. I say no to territoriality, no to reasonable derogations, no to broad collective licences, no to incentives for new business models, no to greater transparency, no to interoperability for format shifting. All this is what makes for delay. What we need are well-fashioned reforms that do not create oligopolies capable of distorting the market, the cultural industries and small players and of stifling diversity and the cultural wealth of Europe. That is why we are hoping that this ‘spring’, awaited so earnestly by all, will finally arrive. Luigi Berlinguer  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the absence of a European patent can no longer be tolerated. Businesses in Europe are being penalised when it comes to patenting by costs 10 times as high as those faced by their US and Japanese competitors. Besides, the fragmentation of copyright in patents is one of the causes holding back economic recovery. The Commission is offering us enhanced cooperation with a specific language regime, something that we do not welcome. Nevertheless, there is something new. 25 out of 27 states are participating. The political framework has changed. Positive development may be possible, with an enhancement even of the proposer’s language, for example. We must all now work to achieve better respect for all. Besides, we want the Italian language to be protected and enhanced, but our government has cut funding and is very neglectful of this aspect. It is on this other ground that we shall be urging it on, but we must achieve a European patent. Luigi Berlinguer,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, due to the change in the agenda approved yesterday by this House, I would firstly like to express my approval for the fact that the Committee on Legal Affairs has unanimously approved the draft report that we are voting on today. The fact that the construction of the European judicial space finds such a broad consensus in Parliament is important. The Stockholm Programme envisages that everyday life should be intrinsic to the process of constructing a Europe of citizens and not merely of political forces or institutional representations. It sets out to resolve the everyday problems of Europeans by the real and unified creation of an effective market of labour, goods and services, entrepreneurial activity without internal borders and without red tape, to strengthen the common basis of rights of succession, contracts, consumers, timely payments, the family, children and more. It will also be the duty and responsibility of the justice system, national judiciaries, solicitors, accountants and workers who operate within individual States to build Europe, to interpret the laws that unite our continent. Our past is marked by different judicial and legal traditions – Common law and Civil law – with differences between the French or German systems and histories that are sometimes very different. We respect national prerogatives and the principle of subsidiarity, but we realise that in order to build Europe – and fortunately we are still on that road – we need progressive convergence that is based on the great constitutional tradition of fundamental rights for which Europe stands. Mr President, the Action Plan that we will approve sets out to construct, reinforce, extend and disseminate a solid European judicial culture, a European legal mindset. That is why I will vote in favour. Luigi Berlinguer  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in recent days, the Veneto region of Italy has been hit by serious natural disasters, in particular, the provinces of Vicenza, Padova and Verona. These catastrophic floods have affected around 500 000 people in various ways and have caused hundreds of millions of euro of damage. This tragedy has brought all productive sectors, small and medium-sized enterprises, and various other sectors, to their knees. I should like to appeal to my fellow Members and the European institutions to do everything possible to support these people and find solutions to respond to this disaster, within the limits of the rules set out by the European Union Solidarity Fund and the Structural Funds. I should also like to note that Italy also has another reason to weep today, although for a completely different reason: the collapse of Pompeii. I only wished to note it here in order to emphasise the significance and importance of an event of this type and the need for Europe to keep an eye on these things as well. Luigi Berlinguer,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we called for this oral question and a parliamentary resolution to make the Commission aware of the vital importance of fostering a common judicial culture throughout Europe as part of the Stockholm Programme. I would like to say at the outset that this is important but also that, with a view to the communication that the Commission will have to produce on future pilot projects, as already discussed, we would like to clarify some points. First of all, we would like the parliamentary consultations to start soon so that we do not get to the initial phase, when we begin to draw up an idea for these future projects, too late when the projects have already been more or less fully formulated. I say this because we have some basic observations to make. National judges and prosecutors in individual states are now crucial pawns in the construction of Europe because, by interpreting national rights in a European light, they can lay the ground for settling disputes and regulating the daily lives of citizens. By doing so, they engender a sense of European citizenship; they engender a European sensibility in everyone who inhabits these lands. This comes about because the people are made to feel the tangible benefits of introducing European elements and hence Community law, above all, into all State laws so that our citizens can live better lives. This offers real advantages for overcoming problems that would otherwise remain unresolved. By saying this, my aim is to turn the whole system slightly on its head. For example, we do not agree that these projects should be along the lines of Erasmus projects because the number of judges and prosecutors involved in Erasmus-style projects would be very low. This could not be otherwise due to the high costs of physical mobility in this field and the numbers would not therefore be very significant within the judiciary as a whole. The most important question concerns the term ‘familiarisation courses’, which we introduced in our paper. Judges are not schoolchildren sitting behind their desks waiting to be taught a lesson. They are mature and highly professional people with little time to spare and who cannot therefore easily move around. Despite this, they hold a valuable store of knowledge and should be stimulated to pit their knowledge against the new problems of European law and European culture. This will create fertile ground for exchanges, virtual rather than physical, using technologies, the Internet and the various opportunities such exchanges can create. Their starting point should be not so much a general approach but rather the individual cases, the individual problems that judges and prosecutors have to deal with. The cases and problems are new and must stimulate the professional growth of these legal operators, providing them with the stimulus they need to make an effective contribution, based on autobiographical reflection on their experience and what they have learned, to respond to the challenges represented by Europe in positive terms. As you see, Mr President, Commissioner, we intend to break with the tradition of the courses that have been held so far and that we feel are not really fit for purpose. We would like to know how much and what funds are available and express our doubts over the idea – as we stated in our communication – of a Central European institution to oversee this process because we are in favour of a bottom-up movement and against centralisation. This is a new approach. What we wish to point out, however, is that unless we shape a European mentality among judges and prosecutors, who will, in this way, offer their services to justice and the citizens who call for it, we will not make Europe. This is therefore not only an important charter for European justice; it is an important charter for the development of European unity as a whole. Luigi Berlinguer  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, concluding negotiations with Croatia during 2010 is a feasible aim and the Swoboda report is a balanced examination of our progress and the steps we still need to take. Justice is now the area in which hard-hitting reform is still required. It is not enough to complete the necessary system reforms, adopt new laws and cooperate as required with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. I stress the need to build a true legal culture and mentality in line with European standards. Crucial to this is the independence of the judiciary, which is a central issue, and also the training, recruitment and career of magistrates, in other words, the fact that the government must not impose conditions of any kind on judges. I call on the Commission to consider the need for hard-hitting measures that address these issues during the final stage of the negotiations. Luigi Berlinguer  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, two innovations have been introduced by the Stockholm Programme as compared with the Hague Programme: a fair balance between rights and security and legal protection in both the criminal and the civil spheres. Security is a right: it means not being attacked in one’s own workplace, walking the streets without risking one’s life, not being the object of violence as a woman, not being exposed to acts of terrorism. The Member States and Europe must guarantee security. However, security measures that diminish the guarantees of freedom are measures that remove certainty from the law, and are thus the source of insecurity and barbarities. Think of Guantánamo. Europe is the fatherland of rights. The Stockholm Programme defines them today with an abundance of detail. There is a fair balance between, on the one hand, the discipline of measures to prevent crime and, on the other, the daily lives of citizens and their family, social, economic, work and study relations, which are all regulated by civil law and the civil justice system. That is the citizen’s Europe. It should be constructed within the Member States and the Community institutions. European society is more united, and mobility is more pronounced than is commonly believed. Mobility is now a right. The borders between the Member States are not impermeable walls, but nets through which society filters daily. The Stockholm Programme constitutes the institutional cornerstone that provides for judicial cooperation and mutual recognition, a European justice system (made up of the national systems and the Community system), both national and Community law, European citizens and European courts (both national and Community courts). European rules are dictated by Community rules and by the case-law of the European courts, but they also derive from the conduct of workers, businesses, students, and judges, both national and belonging to the European networks between operators of justice. It is a bottom-up process that the Stockholm Programme wishes to support. Parliament has done a great job with this resolution, which I hope will be adopted here by a large, unanimous vote, for which we have worked extremely hard. The Council should take it into proper account. The Treaty of Lisbon has not yet entered into force, but it is here, and present. Minister, may the Council be ambitious, and may it take to heart what we have drafted here and the many demands arising from it. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, an excellent compromise has been achieved which puts Europe on the right track to achieve the goals of the climate package. One of the successes is having maintained the target of 3% in relation to the energy efficiency of public buildings, an ambitious target at a time of economic crisis, which has great environmental value and will act as a lever for the EU’s economic growth. The directive lays the foundations for redesigning energy saving strategies, for which both private and public operators will need to call on experts in the sector, without whom the established goals will be difficult to achieve. That therefore paves the way for encouraging national training programmes for audit and energy saving experts. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, we have to face the evidence that all the available data are pointing to, which is the depletion of fish stocks. Some fish stocks have been seriously jeopardised, and therefore our objective must be to guarantee sustainable fishing if we wish to increase future fish production in our seas. Today’s debate is an anticipation of some of the central issues of the common fisheries policy. The lack of reliable data means that it is not possible to reach a shared definition of over-capacity, and it is crucial to avoid the risk of adopting measures that could penalise fishermen, given the serious crisis that has hit the sector. Fishing needs to continue to be an important source of employment and sustenance for families. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 as regards electronic identification of bovine animals and deleting the provisions on voluntary beef labelling is of fundamental importance for the defence of quality rearing, the protection of consumer information and food safety. By proposing the abolition of voluntary labelling, the Commission is weakening these aspects and preventing the consumer from having access to additional information, such as the sex, age and diet of bovine animals – elements I consider fundamental for two reasons: because they can help the consumer to make a more informed purchase and because they give added value to the product. The criticisms the Commission has made of the voluntary labelling system are based on heavy administrative burdens not offset by sufficient advantages. I should like to know on what basis this assertion is founded, given that the simulations provided by independent associations instead show that these costs are contained, and therefore justified in order to guarantee information that protects and benefits the consumer. For these reasons, I do not agree with the repeal of Articles 16, 17 and 18 in the Commission’s proposal. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in order to attract investment, the European Union must set up a political and legal framework based on objectives for sustainable growth, as per the Europe 2020 strategy. High-quality products and a strong propensity for research and innovation are the strong points of our economy; if they are to play a more important role then they need a true internal market, where businesses can compete openly. The Programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs 2014-2020 must provide a real opportunity for small and medium-sized enterprises. We need to create a new energy model that is not conditioned by the rising price of oil and can offer European businesses affordable energy access. The creation, as set out in paragraph 16, of a European observatory capable of monitoring the reduction of tax and bureaucratic barriers, and the implementation of cohesion policies, is an interesting idea.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, water is an essential and vital public good, which must be protected by means of an holistic approach to preserve it and rationalise its use. Improving efficiency and sustainability is a duty that we must not shirk, not least in view of the challenges of climate change. The target that we have set ourselves of achieving ecological and chemical ‘good status’ for our water by 2015 is a sine qua non
 of Europe’s environmental policy and a commitment to be strictly monitored. The European Union’s water legislation needs to be enforced and stricter penalty measures should be introduced. Some 20% of water in Europe is lost due to obsolete infrastructure, which it is crucial to improve if we want efficient water resource use and sustainable water management that can address the problems of water shortages and drought.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to congratulate the rapporteurs on the compromises reached in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, as they strengthen the Committee’s proposal by ensuring greater protection for vulnerable groups of consumers and an increase in the information provided. The exclusion of gluten-free products in the initial proposal is a prime example. It would have penalised a continually growing group of people affected by an illness caused by intolerance to an allergen, which does not allow them a complete and balanced diet able to provide an adequate nutritional profile to ensure physical well-being. In future negotiations with the Council a cross-cutting regulation may be proposed in conjunction with regulation (EU) No 1169/2011. In this case the generic term ‘gluten-free’ must appear with the term ‘suitable for coeliacs’ to make a clear distinction between products free from allergens and those for proper nutrition.

 We all remember the extensive damage caused by the flooding in Liguria and Tuscany, which rendered thousands of homes unusable, destroyed networks and infrastructure, and led to the loss of several lives. The economic damage is extremely high. I am astonished that, faced with this emergency, the funds provided for by the Solidarity Fund have not yet been granted. The rapid intervention of the fund is, in fact, essential for its credibility, and we cannot allow mere red tape to delegitimise the instruments that we have put in place. At a time when, following the crisis, citizens are starting to lose faith in Europe, it is vital for the institutions to respond in a timely manner, especially during an emergency.

 With today’s vote, Parliament has shown once again that it fully recognises the importance of volunteering in terms of mutual intercultural enrichment, social inclusion and active citizenship. I would say that it is Europe’s duty to promote and raise the standing of this activity among our citizens. In terms of the creation of social capital and cross-border development, I must stress that by promoting volunteering, the European Union can grasp a precious opportunity to assert and give form to the solidarity and socio-economic cohesion that inspired our founding principles. To that end, I agree with the creation of a European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps and the introduction of instruments providing for greater recognition of the professional skills acquired.

 Mr President, despite the progress that Turkey has made on human rights, I regret to say that violence against women is still one of the country’s most pressing problems. The official Turkish statistics are alarming: 39% of Turkish women are victims of violence. The establishment of the Committee on Equal Opportunities within the Turkish Parliament and the Gender Equality Commission within the Ministry of Education represent a step forward. The recognition of Turkish women’s rights must be an essential part of the negotiations for accession to the European Union. They must be granted the same rights to education, access to employment and to justice that men have. I voted in favour of the report because I hope that Parliament’s requests will be accepted in full by the European Commission. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 The citizens’ initiative introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon is a tool for participatory democracy, which involves citizens in decisions and actively helps to establish the political agenda through a shared path towards stronger European integration. Being able to present the initiative in a public hearing with the direct participation of the relevant parliamentary committee helps to strengthen our dialogue with European citizens, at a particularly difficult time for the solidity of the economy and for consolidation of political Europe. The times we are living in are characterised by the development of Eurosceptic movements, which is why I believe that the initiative is an important step to bring European citizens closer, even physically, to the EU institutions. For this reason, I voted in favour of the amendment to the Rules of Procedure. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, China is an important trade partner for Europe, and I firmly believe that our relations must be strengthened, without neglecting the numerous and persistent obstacles to fair, balanced trade. A new chapter in EU-China trade relations needs to be written, based on reciprocity and compliance with the rules. It is regrettable that China continues to apply non-tariff barriers that limit European companies’ presence in the Chinese market, giving rise to additional costs without creating opportunities for trade. Non-tariff barriers, breaches of intellectual property rights and human rights abuses remain among the biggest problems to solve. I hope that cooperation with the Chinese Government will eliminate the remaining obstacles by 2016, when the World Trade Organisation is due to grant China market economy status.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Armenia is fundamental and strategic for strengthening bilateral relations in the South Caucasus. The renewal of the association agreements with the EU will be crucial in order to pave the way for strengthened regional cooperation. With the EURONEST delegation, I have had the opportunity to visit Armenia and to see for myself the progress that has begun to take place in democratically building the rule of law and respecting human rights on the basis of the partnership agreements initiated in 1999. The participation of Armenia in parliamentary cooperation with EURONEST is an excellent indication of their willingness to adhere to European values and principles, for which there is broad consensus in civil society. I voted in favour of the association agreement and I feel that Armenia should commit itself to resolving the conflict in the south so as to avoid undermining the stability of the country.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the goal of reducing CO2
 emissions by 80-95% by 2050 enables us to lay the foundations for a post-carbon European economy. It also requires us to launch a new industrial revolution based on new thinking about the system of production, involving the whole socio-economic sphere, to create better awareness of energy consumption and the efficient use of land. Research will play a key role in fully exploiting renewable energy. With firm and binding objectives, we shall be able to prepare industry for the transition while preserving its competitiveness at the global level. Europe must take pride in having set out at every level on the road to protecting the environment and combating climate change. There is no way that we can negotiate with the environment, and that is why we must insist on solutions that lead to zero emissions, and why I am convinced that nuclear energy must not form part of the energy mix. As the rapporteur for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE), I am grateful to Mr Leinen and Mr Davies for their excellent cooperation. Thank you. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the report on the European Fisheries Fund (EFF) because I believe it is necessary and should not be delayed, in order to align EFF expenditure in all the EU countries as a matter of urgency. Therefore, I agree with Mr Ferreira in asking for its application at first reading. Ms Damanaki did well to propose an urgent measure for countries with little investment capacity, as this has often been reduced to historic lows as the report shows. The debate about the reform of the common fisheries policy has already begun and therefore, EFF expenditure needs to be accelerated also by increasing the cofinancing threshold by 10%, in order to avoid there being resources from the old programming period still to be spent from the time the new reform applies. It is important to avoid overlapping between the EFF and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF). Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the progress made by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia shows its strong desire to join the European Union. It is a strategic country in the Balkan region, is involved in several European initiatives, and is giving proof of cooperation and openness. The reforms of the judicial system, administrative decentralisation and initial, if weak, signs of a willingness to discuss freedom of expression are very hopeful signs for the future. However, the following issues are still worrying: respect for human rights, corruption levels and the lack of pluralism in the media. This country still has a long way to go, and the years leading up to its entry must act as a stimulus to speed up the necessary reforms for the country’s democracy to develop. I believe in an enlarged, strong Europe, and therefore I voted in favour of the resolution. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the progress that has been made, we do have to admit, unfortunately, that women are still subject to many instances of inequality in all areas, including active participation in decision making and the political process. This is a feature of all Member States and even of this House, since women occupy just 34% of the seats here. In order to achieve equality between men and women, we must first of all remove the cultural obstacles and start to talk about gender policy. The parties themselves have got to initiate this first step towards change. Various positive measures are put forward in Ms Pietikäinen’s report, which I wholeheartedly support. These include the measures on quotas for women which, while not the ideal solution, are the only feasible approach until we see a change of culture and outlook, as I said. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, the current economic crisis, together with the austerity measures adopted in some countries, has created new social categories at risk of poverty, including young people and elderly people. Given the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, the Annual Growth Survey must ensure consistency between the various priorities in its political guidelines in order to ensure that budgetary needs are based on social justice. I agree with the rapporteur on the need to act immediately in order to improve employment conditions for categories at risk of social exclusion and to make tackling youth unemployment a priority. Future national reform plans will need to include training programmes able to develop lifelong learning and to create qualified jobs with dignified pay and conditions. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, today’s vote is a first step in the direction of economic governance in Europe, as hoped for by Mr Delors as early as 1993. The introduction of Eurobonds, which I hope will come about within a reasonable timeframe, is part of a wider process that will lead the countries in the euro area to strengthen the coordination and achieve the integration of their economic and fiscal policies. The three options indicated in the European Commission’s Green Paper propose three different types of Eurobond, with a decreasing degree of solidarity between Member States. The serious economic crisis we are currently experiencing shows that no country is safe from financial speculation. To sceptics, I say that Eurobonds are, to date, the only practical answer to reviving growth and development in Europe. This is why I voted in favour. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the hundreds of petitions to the European Parliament from various EU countries clarify the extent and severity of the waste management problem. An interesting aspect of the report is the attention paid to the disposal of illegal waste that affects many regions. In my region, as a delegation from the European Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety was able to ascertain, high levels of caesium-137 have been detected. This is typical nuclear waste even though there are no nuclear power plants in Italy. It is clear that this is a Europe-wide problem. There is illegal trafficking of waste that must be monitored and curbed, but which has so far been ignored by the European Commission. It is therefore easy to state that only a few countries, including Italy, do not apply European standards. Instead, given that illegal trafficking of waste extends beyond national borders, we need to think about how to deal with this at a European level. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, this own-initiative report highlights how crucial the issue of the supply of inputs is for the competitiveness of European agriculture. Over the last decade, European farmers have seen an intolerable increase in production costs, which is not adequately reflected in sales prices. European agricultural production still depends, to a large extent, on oil. Over the last decade, the price of oil has risen by 60%. In order to address this challenge, the new CAP must increase the use of renewable energy by implementing self-sufficient energy production in farms, using agricultural waste and so forth to feed biomass and biogas plant. This will give us sustainable agriculture and a reduction in costs. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it has not been easy to find a balanced compromise to combine the objective of greater protection for human health and the environment with a faster and more efficient authorisation system for the industrial sector. However, I would have preferred a European authorisation from the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) for new biocidal products immediately, and not in stages. That said, the centralised authorisation system will definitely have positive repercussions on the internal market, because it will allow equal application of the requisites in all the Member States. In order to streamline bureaucratic procedures for small and medium-sized enterprises and facilitate the entry of biocides onto the market, we needed to remove comparative assessment, still required for biocides that have been proven to be safe for use. This places a hefty bureaucratic burden on companies. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, of all the EU’s instruments, the ‘Intelligent Energy’ programme has been the most successful. It has funded over 500 projects, involving more than 3 000 partners – the majority of which are small and medium-sized enterprises – not to speak of the added value that the programme has given to the renewable energy and energy efficiency sector. Like my fellow Members, I am concerned about the future of the programme, which has played a central role in awareness raising actions, the exchange of good practice, and energy policy implementation in the European Union. I therefore ask the European Commission what it intends to do in order to continue the programme, as stopping it would put an end to so many hopes. To conclude, I would like to ask what the programme is for the Multiannual Financial Framework that will provide the necessary funding. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

Mr President, I can only welcome today’s report on the review of European Neighbourhood Policy and, in particular, the vital proposal to strengthen the EU’s Southern partnership, following the historic events which took place last spring, for the democratic consolidation of the area. Funds for countries on the southern shore of the Mediterranean were allocated before the crisis and, in the light of the concrete needs and modernisation of society in these countries, they seem inadequate; I think we should increase support for the instrument for civil society.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank Mr Perello Rodriguez for the excellent work which he has done. It certainly cannot have been easy for such a complex directive to manage to combine the demands of consumers with those of business, just as, to encourage free movement within the European Union, it was not easy to lay down rules on composition, manufacturing specifications and labelling of fruit juices and similar products. We are now at the second amendment of Council Directive 2001/112/EC, which has been necessary in order to continue including provisions of the Codex Alimentarius in European legislation. I am extremely satisfied and I consider the fact that we have avoided the serious risk of finding orange juice on our table which is actually a blend of oranges and mandarins, unless it has been properly labelled as such when sold, a victory both for consumers and for our market. The new changes will finally allow consumers to understand the difference between fruit juices and fruit nectars, and if the fruit nectar naturally contains sugars, then the label can state that the juice contains natural sugars. Important progress has been made, above all, with regard to nectar, and I believe that the directive is going in the right direction to help consumers make informed choices in terms of what they purchase. In Europe, the fruit juice market represents 10% of the non-alcoholic beverage market. I hope that in future, we will be able to encourage purchases of locally produced products that reflect high quality and sustainable development in agriculture in line with European food security principles. The annual demand for orange juice from European industry is estimated to be around a million tonnes, whilst internal production only provides 10% of that. It is therefore obvious that we should increase production of citrus fruits and I hope that the new CAP will include financial incentives to encourage an increase in the cultivation of citrus fruits and the associated creation of a virtuous food and agricultural supply chain to utilise fruit that cannot be used in the fresh market due to small defects or size in the production of fruit juices. This request is obviously directed at Commissioner Cioloş, who is here today. To conclude, Mr President, I believe that this directive achieves two fundamental aims: a more complete labelling system and an increase in product quality. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, with today’s vote, Parliament has laid the foundations for future discussion on the new directive which, as anticipated yesterday by Commissioner Barnier, will be presented on 13 December. I approve of the report given by the rapporteur who, in collaboration with all the rapporteurs, has managed to synthesise the view put forward last June by the Commission with the Green Paper. I feel I should underline two key elements at the heart of the report: language and training. I believe it is necessary, in particular with regard to health care professions, to introduce an accurate means of evaluation of the level of linguistic ability that should take place prior to the authorisation of allocating work, and to raise the minimum training requirements common to all Member States, with a view to ensuring ever greater security to European patients.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the last five years, gambling has spread over the whole of Europe. In Italy, according to the state monopolies, online gambling increased by 153% from 2008 to 2009, and by 29% from 2009 to 2010. These worrying figures provide evidence of the widespread impact of this phenomenon. We must consider this issue seriously. Although online gambling falls within the jurisdiction of the Member States, common actions must be established across Europe to protect vulnerable consumers and to tackle illegal gambling. The report on the initiative opens the door to actions which I hope will soon be initiated and I agree that there is a need to implement preventative measures with a view to reducing addictive behaviour. The trials taking place in some countries could set the measure for ‘best practice’ to be replicated all over Europe, with the aim of monitoring the phenomenon and promoting responsible gambling.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today’s vote has drawn attention to the beekeeping sector, which plays a crucial role in European agriculture by helping to maintain biodiversity and provides an income for around 600 000 workers in the European Union. I consider the programme launched by the European Commission for monitoring the health of honeybees to be a useful one that has the aim of identifying the reasons behind their increased mortality rate in recent years. The impact of pesticides on the health of bees must be explored in more detail. I have voted in favour of the report and I am disappointed that the reference to a correlation between some pesticides and bee mortality has not been supported, as proposed by the rapporteur. I call on the European Commission to provide greater financial aid to the beekeeping sector in the new common agricultural policy (CAP) for 2014-2020. Mario Pirillo,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the mobility of European workers is one of the pillars for full implementation of the internal market, as well as leveraging development and the economy. It is estimated that there is a need for around a million health care professionals in Europe. This means that we need a quick and efficient system for recognising qualifications, and the professional card could facilitate this process. However, in the health care sector, mobility must be combined with safeguarding and ensuring patient safety. This is the direction taken by the report voted for by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for which I was rapporteur. Mobility and patient protection must be considered two sides of the same coin. Therefore, extension of the rapid reaction mechanism to the health care professions is not only commendable, but also necessary. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I voted for Mr Tatarella’s report, which seeks to postpone by three years the entry into force of Stage IIIB for the placing on the market of more efficient tractors for the reduction of CO2
 and pollutant gases. In the case of tractors, a number of reasons led to the parameters laid down by Directive 2005/13/EC being revised: the sudden fall in sales caused by the current economic crisis and the lack of technical solutions capable of limiting CO2
 emissions. It will be particularly important to transpose the amended directive rapidly so that it may be applied without delay. I hope that the European Commission will take into account the European Parliament’s call for it to examine in advance whether the technology available will be capable of meeting the requirements of Stage IV, scheduled for 2014.

Despite this time of economic crisis, I hope that the national governments will prove capable of protecting them by putting in place policies in line with the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020. I welcome and endorse the report tabled by Mr Kósa, who, by drawing on his own experience, has managed to give heartfelt, practical suggestions in order to offer people with disabilities non-discriminatory access to social protection and to health and education services.

 Mr President, with today’s vote, we have laid the foundations for the future revision of the Procurement Directive. Simpler bureaucratic procedures and principles for participation in public tenders are a fundamental means of speeding up implementation processes and ensuring the full realisation of contracts between public authorities and the private sector. The increased use of information and communication technologies would allow businesses and public authorities to save money and time, and would provide greater transparency and accessibility. I would like to stress that the criterion of the lowest price should no longer be the determining factor when awarding contracts: it should really be replaced by the criterion of the most economically advantageous tender, in order to draw economic, social and environmental benefits.

I fully support the content of the report and hope that a legislative proposal will soon be presented, one which leads to the creation of a European anti-mafia committee able to expertly review and fight the phenomenon of organised crime through the institutions. Culture, education, development and work in Europe are defences capable of preventing criminal organisations from recruiting young people.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to the many Members who have signed this oral question. The EU’s objectives in terms of the fight against climate change have resulted in the implementation of what are very demanding EU policies and measures for European industry. The target of reducing CO2
 emissions is, at present, a unilateral commitment that is exposing a large proportion of Europe’s industrial system and, in particular, its energy-intensive industries to a high risk of carbon leakage. The emission reduction targets, while worthy in their aims, should be pursued in a realistic and practical way. We are calling on the Commission to adjust the tools for applying the Emissions Trading System (ETS) and the financial compensation measures envisaged as carefully and as accurately as possible, in order to prevent any imbalances in the EU internal market. Under Directive 2003/87/EC, as amended in 2009, thermal power companies will be obliged, from 2013, to purchase allowances for all of their CO2
 emissions, which means that the increased costs will be passed on in electricity prices and hence, that production costs will rise significantly. According to Eurostat data, the ETS will cost European industry an estimated EUR 8.5 billion more each year in increased electricity prices. Indirect emissions, as opposed to direct emissions, do not benefit from a compensation system to prevent differences in treatment between industries in the same sector that have different production processes and which face obvious distortions of competition within the European Union. If an equivalent compensation system is not established for indirect emissions, there is a very great risk that companies will relocate. Choosing sectors exposed to carbon leakage on the basis of the NACE code classification system is simplistic and restrictive, since it does not allow for the specific type of energy-intensive production to be identified, with the result that compensation cannot be granted to subsectors. In the case of steel production, there are two production processes: the electric furnace and the full cycle, which uses fossil fuels and a small amount of electricity; it will receive almost all of the free allocation of allowances for direct emissions. The electric furnace process, on the other hand, will receive only 30% of the free allowances due to the lack of a compensation system for the electricity portion, even though it emits a fifth of the CO2
 produced by the full cycle. Therefore, because of the type of production process used, the same product will see its price increase in Europe. Fears of such a market imbalance have been voiced by many parties, by many industrial sectors, as can be seen from the responses to the public consultation launched by the Directorate General for Competition. How does the Commission intend to proceed with regard to State aid for energy-intensive industries, in order to ensure the continuation of European industry and to guarantee jobs and prosperity? Could the revenues from the sale of allowances not be used to offset the imbalances that will be created from 2013? Are we certain that the sale of allowances will not lead to speculation? How does the Commission intend to rectify competitive disadvantages? Mario Pirillo,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I must thank all my fellow Members, from all the political groups, who have spoken and who have strongly supported my question. I cannot say that I am satisfied, because the catch-the-eye procedure will follow, and then the Commission will speak; this makes no sense to me, and I hope that we will adapt the Rules of Procedure accordingly. I must say that I will be making this statement to the press but, if I may be so bold, I am truly disappointed by the response that the Commissioner, as the Commission’s representative, has given to my questions. I think that the Commission wants to wash its hands of this problem; it is a major problem as my fellow Members have described magnificently. I hope that the Commission will answer my questions, the questions I asked in my speech, and I hope that it will give serious consideration to this major problem that is affecting Europe: this industry that we boast about in Europe and then undervalue.

The principle of European solidarity among Member States in the event of a disaster is the central pillar of this report, supported by liaison and interaction initiatives within the European Union. The merging of the humanitarian aid crisis rooms is a step in that direction.

Emphasising the importance of the quality of the tourist services offered as a decisive variable in the choices made by tourists was an appropriate decision to increase the competitiveness of Europe’s tourism industry. Niche tourism – religious, spa, mountain, rural, etc. – should be encouraged through measures to improve it in terms of quality and quantity. Lastly, I hope that the harmonisation of the hospitality industry classification systems will continue so as to define unequivocal quality standards for all Member States. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

The efforts made to make the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development more favourable to small and medium-sized enterprises have not improved their participation rate. Simplification has not hit the target. As the report by Ms Matias clearly indicates, there is a need for administrative simplification and a significant reduction of financial reporting requirements.

We must therefore prevent abuse and manipulation of the market, where monitoring and the application of penalties, along with the prohibition of insider trading, are a national responsibility. The recent introduction of the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) enables market transactions to be monitored, and the national and European registers of market participants make it possible to register transactions in wholesale energy products, thereby promoting transparency. Today’s vote, which is the result of close cooperation between the Polish Presidency, the Commission and Parliament, has laid the foundations for a more transparent market that safeguards consumer interests.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the attention paid by Parliament to the situation of women approaching retirement age: active ageing must play a key role in EU policies on account of our ever longer life expectancy. Today’s vote is a first step. I agree with the call for Member States to reflect on the role of women as care-givers. This role, if legally recognised, could create forms of official employment that make it easier for women over 50 to work. As for the pension system, I repeat the call for the Commission to introduce forms of protection to reduce the pension gap between women, who have often had to interrupt their careers in order to care for and look after their family, and men.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in a global market characterised by high price volatility and the ever greater impact of finance on the markets, I can only welcome the creation of a European strategic framework for raw materials. I welcome the fact that, with today’s vote, we have identified the need for more transparency in the financial markets with regard to raw materials and, at the same time, that we have paid a great deal of attention to the supply problems faced by small and medium-sized enterprises and to measures in this area that can help increase their competitiveness. I think it is crucially important that emphasis has been placed on the requirement for trade agreements with non-EU countries to include explicit clauses on the protection of human rights and corporate social responsibility.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with today’s vote we have certainly moved towards an improvement in the safety and inspection of offshore oil and gas activities, in order to prevent a repeat of incidents such as the one which occurred in 2010 on the platform in the Gulf of Mexico, claiming 11 lives and causing very severe environmental damage. I welcome the proposal to coordinate our civil protection forces instead of creating supranational bodies. Better still, I hope that cooperation will be strengthened between the inspection bodies in order to establish common and independent standards at European level. I think that the proposal to establish a Mediterranean Offshore Authorities Forum is a positive one. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

Mr President, today we voted on the vexed and controversial issue of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Offering Member States the chance to prohibit or restrict the cultivation of GMOs in their territory means that the European Union will surrender its leading role on this most delicate of issues. Many questions remain to be answered. Do we know what the long-term effects will be on the ecosystem? Are we reasonably sure that the use of GMOs does not carry serious health risks? Are we sure that consumers whose government has banned their cultivation will not find themselves eating them anyway? We are a long way from any definitive answers. The only thing I know for sure is that both the Commission and the Member States should guarantee that the necessary resources will be made available for independent research, and that GMOs will not be merely a short-cut to profit.

Mr President, there is huge anticipation for the legislative proposals on the forthcoming post-2013 cohesion policy, which will be tabled in September. The Commission has already announced that this reform will see the introduction of an intermediate category, which should replace the current system of phasing in and phasing out. I am left perplexed by the implications that this new category will have, since it will also include – or at least seems to include – the regions that currently are neither converging nor competing. I should like to point out that the priority of the cohesion policy is to assist late-developing regions, and I therefore would not want the reform to damage precisely the poorest regions of Europe, which struggle to put development policies into action. I hope, however, that the new programming can give European growth a kick-start. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the idea of setting up horizontal multi-fund programmes with clearly defined aims and streamlined access mechanisms is something I fully support. I agree with Professor Barca’s report, according to which an approach based on local development is the way to improve efficiency and effectiveness and to operate in a more integrated manner. We need to focus attention on the urban dimension and to ensure coordination between the funds and the other financial instruments of the European Investment Bank (EIB) and European Investment Fund (EIF). In a situation in which the budget is tight, these instruments, together with revolving funds, would allow results to be monitored. This would multiply the available resources and increase the number of beneficiaries, which in turn would deliver more results. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, everyone is aware of the importance of the common agricultural policy and of the contribution it has made to the development of the EU and to food security. Environmental challenges and the fight against climate change mean that the post-2013 CAP now has a new role to play, for which I believe we need a stronger and more sustainable CAP equipped with a budget that can meet the objectives to be pursued, with particular attention to the development of quality food products and to the needs of small farmers. Speculation in agricultural commodities and extreme price volatility put food security at risk and require flexible measures. Possible market fluctuations must be tackled with counter-cyclical measures, which should be included in the first pillar and be capable of responding swiftly and automatically.

Mr President, today’s vote represents a marked step forward in bringing in the ‘polluter pays’ principle, including in the road haulage sector, which makes a significant contribution to atmospheric and noise pollution. Despite the criticisms of industry organisations, I think that the Council’s position is the best compromise available right now, even though I hope that improvements can be made in the future. I voted in favour. I must point out, however, that we need to identify better ways to use the revenues, making it mandatory for the Member States to invest these resources to improve the trans-European transport network (TEN-T) and infrastructure for reducing pollution. This is the only way that, in future, we will be able to say that today’s decision has had positive results. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

Mr President, research and innovation play a central role in the European Union’s development and competitiveness and they are crucial in terms of reaching the objectives set out in the Europe 2020 strategy. The Seventh Framework Programme is the main instrument for funding research in Europe, as shown by the report voted on today. However, there are still many problems being caused by excessive amounts of red tape for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). In its resolution of 11 November 2010, Parliament asked the Commission to introduce procedural, administrative and financial simplification measures into the current management of the Seventh Framework Programme, yet these measures have still not been addressed. I call upon the Commission to acknowledge Parliament’s observations and to identify solutions to make it easier for SMEs to access the seventh and eighth research programmes. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

I voted against the resolution rejecting the indication of the presence of DHA in milk substitutes for babies because I think it is right to advertise the reasons for which DHA is added. I want to mention here that DHA is an omega 3 fatty acid which is present in breast milk and has a positive effect on children’s eyesight. I would point out that the EFSA, the European Food Safety Authority, expressed a favourable opinion to extensively indicating the presence of this substance. I have not appreciated the many e-mails received indicating the belief that we want to favour artificial milk over breast milk. We must always provide adequate information on substances added to food products, especially when they are for children. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the news regarding Fukushima is increasingly worrying. Safety limits have been greatly exceeded and we do not know what will happen in the near future. There has been a lack of clear and transparent communications. Stress tests should be conducted on existing nuclear plants and if the outcome raises concern we must have the courage to call for their immediate closure. We need to introduce higher international safety standards and there should be no thought of constructing new nuclear plants. We must prepare the way for a gradual withdrawal of this type of energy which causes irreparable damage to the environment and human health. Careful thought on the development of future energy policies is essential. We must urgently develop policies that aim at energy conservation and efficiency, and increased investment in research into new technologies and renewable energy sources. Finally, we should open a debate involving citizens and local authorities. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, women have always had an important role in the agricultural and rural sector. Indeed, women account for 42% of the labour force out of a total of around 27 million workers. Despite this high percentage, women are not well represented in sector organisations and face discrimination in the decision-making process. There are many areas in which women’s circumstances could be improved, including ensuring adequate social cover. The European institutions should therefore act to balance this inequality, perhaps by monitoring the sector through an observatory for female entrepreneurialism in agriculture, as already operated in Calabria and other regions in Italy. The report voted upon today – which I supported – also takes a long hard look at the issue of the exodus from the countryside. In order to help keep employment levels steady we need support policies and strategies which are designed to build infrastructure and create services suited to the requirements of modern life, which can be implemented in rural areas.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as an elected representative from Southern Italy, I join the chorus of fellow MEPs who have preceded me in calling for appropriate action to address the critical situation faced by citizens and migrants in Lampedusa. The health and sanitation situation on the island has exceeded all limits of decency. I appeal to the sense of responsibility of the Italian Government to ensure it adopts all measures available to it, and call on the European Commission to implement the measures provided for in the EU Directive on temporary protection for immigrants. The next European Council of Ministers of the Interior, scheduled for 11 April, must take appropriate measures to ensure that neither the migrants nor the citizens of Lampedusa are left in a desperate condition. We therefore need to initiate a serious debate on the European Neighbourhood Policy which will focus on initiatives to support the path to democracy, especially in the countries of the southern shores of the Mediterranean. I congratulate Mr Provera. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over the past 15 years, the number of natural and man-made disasters has increased significantly and we see phenomena that are more severe and more frequent in almost all European Union countries with serious consequences for the economy, infrastructure and ecosystems. We need an urgent EU approach to develop preventive policies and to identify and adapt the relevant financial instruments. The European Union Solidarity Fund and national funds are no longer able to cope with frequent disasters. I would ask the Commissioner who is present when will it be possible to provide data and a map of areas at risk, as announced in his communication of 23 February 2009? I regret, finally, that the Soil Directive for the improvement of land management has been blocked for some time in the Council. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the current economic crisis has revealed serious shortcomings in the framework for monitoring the financial sector and the need to respond with new instruments and new fiscal policies. The financial system has started to generate profits from speculative transactions and it is absurd that this sector is not subject to any taxation. We need a cure, a financial transaction tax, which is why I voted in favour. For other policies such as energy or the environment, Europe has managed to be the world leader, becoming an example and a stimulus for other countries outside the European Union. I believe we should do the same for the financial system. I hope that the Commission will respond soon, presenting a legislative proposal that can meet the expectations of citizens, on whom the burden of the crisis has fallen. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, the deep international economic crisis has hit industry especially hard. The idea that the markets should regulate themselves has been proved wrong. Europe has lacked the ability to give a unified response or to perform an economic analysis. Europe therefore needs to equip itself with a solid, competitive and diversified industrial base. Europe’s new industrial policy must be able to look to the future by taking a global approach to its own policies aimed at reaffirming the core importance of industry, especially manufacturing, which must continue to be the driving force of our economy and to prompt new intelligent, sustainable and inclusive modes of growth. I endorse and congratulate Mr Lange on his report, which examines all these factors and provides some interesting food for thought. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in which bluefin tuna fishing finds itself in the Mediterranean continues to cause incalculable economic damage to fishing communities. The Italian Government adhered to the decisions of the ICCAT and reduced fishing quotas for bluefin tuna for commercial fishing vessels only, with a de facto 
increase in the quantities intended for recreational fishing, an absurd measure that penalises only fishers, who are already facing a very difficult time. In this sense, I remind you of the negative effects on the industry of failing to take the decision to grant a derogation for whitebait fishing. I hope that one outcome of the forthcoming meeting to be attended by Commissioner Damanaki, who is here today, will be that fishing for whitebait can resume in 2011, at least in certain districts, such as Schiavonea and Corigliano Calabro in Calabria, with a possibility of a review for 2012.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even today in the European Union, health inequalities still persist over access to services, treatment and social factors, and this necessitates an integrated response. The reasons for these differences are, in many cases, avoidable and unjust, because they are due to discriminatory factors such as the reduced economic capacity of individuals. I believe that reducing health inequalities should become a fundamental priority for Europe, with an approach based on ‘health in all policies’, enhancing the quality of care for all. In the coming months, the European Parliament will discuss the revision of the directive on recognition of professional qualifications. It is an appropriate opportunity to achieve an improved mechanism capable of dealing effectively with emergencies without any discrimination. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is essential for Europe to ensure a fair balance between the need to support a vital sector, in other words, the agriculture of Member States, and the need to strengthen Europe’s international trade policy. A business strategy highly focused on pursuing the dynamics of global markets would end up sacrificing the ability of the European agricultural sector to compete. This not only damages the sector economy, with serious implications for employment, but also undermines any possibility of developing our rural areas. It is necessary to defend the quality of agricultural production and impose the maintenance of equal quality standards in terms of food security, human and animal health, and welfare and social rights when drawing up trade agreements with third countries.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, everybody has said that the free trade agreement with the Republic of Korea is an institutional and strategic innovation on the part of the Union. On the contrary, it is an unbalanced agreement that will have a negative impact on the European manufacturing industry. The elimination of duties on Korean products in return for a rise in environmental and social standards in Korea cannot be considered fair. The Korean shipbuilding industry benefits from substantial state aid, which has enabled it to attain a 30% share of the world market. This means that European industry, be it automotive, textile, chemical or any other, must defend itself against competition that if not unfair in form, is unfair in fact. The introduction of the safeguard clause is an appropriate measure, but it is not sufficient to patch up the many weaknesses in the agreement. I therefore call on the European Commission to be more prudent if it really wishes to defend European economic interests. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the transition towards a low carbon economy and the achievement of the objectives set out in the climate change package mean that we need to establish rules to regulate CO2
 emissions in various sectors, including the automotive sector. I am very pleased with the negotiations, which led to an agreement with the Council to limit emissions to 147g CO2
/km by 2020. This is a realistic limit that also represents an excellent balance between environmental, social and industrial rules. I hope I also played my part in this as shadow rapporteur for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. The agreement reached takes account of the economic crisis that the sector is experiencing and also makes reasonable allowances for the difference between the passenger car sector and the light commercial vehicles sector. Just as we saw with the regulation on passenger cars, the European automotive sector will also manage to develop green, competitive and environmentally beneficial technology for light commercial vehicles. I hope it will also manage to take advantage of the environmental challenge to invest even more in innovation and research. Paolo De Castro,

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which I have the honour of chairing and for which I drafted the opinion on the interim report, clearly expressed the wish that the common agricultural policy budget should be frozen in real, not nominal terms, as proposed by the European Commission. Although this is evidently the majority position, at this sensitive point in the negotiations I am in favour of giving full support to the own-initiative report drawn up by Mr Böge and Mr Kalfin, who have done an excellent job, providing Parliament with a strong, cohesive and united negotiating position. However, I should stress that were further cuts to be made to the common agricultural policy budget, it would be very difficult to reach an agreement on reform. All of the political groups in the committee have always stressed their wish not to have a final vote on the reform reports until there is clarity on the budget question. Indeed, the budget must be equal to the challenges posed by the agriculture of the future. Paolo De Castro,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the regulation on agricultural product quality schemes, on which we will be voting tomorrow, is the second most important legislative provision in which Parliament has been fully involved under the ordinary legislative procedure for agricultural legislation. As happened with the Milk Regulation, Parliament has again managed to introduce significant amendments to improve the Commission’s proposal. I would highlight, for example, the stricter rules to protect certified products against misuse and imitation (the so-called ex officio
 rule); the new system of optional quality terms, starting with the ‘product of mountain farming’ quality term; area marks; and greater simplification in the authorisation procedures for Protected Designation of Origin (PDO), Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) and Traditional Speciality Guaranteed (TSG) products. I would also like to mention the amendment to the list in the annex, which at last makes it possible for chocolate to enjoy a protected geographical indication. Allow me to take this opportunity to greet the friends of Modica chocolate who are here in this Chamber. These are just a few of the many amendments that Parliament has successfully introduced to strengthen the prospect of leveraging quality in order to compete in the sector. This was made possible by the excellent work done by the rapporteur, Ms García Pérez, whom I thank, as well as the shadow rapporteurs and the entire Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. The only regrettable fact, as the rapporteur herself mentioned, is that Parliament has not managed to persuade the Council of the need to extend production planning, which we usefully introduced in the milk package, to all the other protected designations of origin, particularly in the ham sector. However, as has been pointed out by Mr Dorfmann, one of the shadow rapporteurs, we shall not fail to do so in the debate on the reform of the common agricultural policy, and on the single common market organisation document in particular. Paolo De Castro,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to direct your attention to the six legislative reports on alignment with the Treaty of Lisbon that we are about to vote on. They do not just address agricultural issues, but affect all of Parliament. Indeed, we risk losing the new powers that the Treaty of Lisbon has given us. The Council systematically opposes delegated acts, replacing them with implementing acts that exclude Parliament from the decision-making process. We must press on to defend Parliament’s powers. Hence, I would ask you to lend your vigorous support to the decision already reached by a huge majority in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. Paolo De Castro,  
rapporteur. 
– (IT) 
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon abolishes the old comitology system, replacing it with a two-tier structure, consisting of delegated acts which include Parliament’s and the Council’s right of veto, and implementing acts which completely exclude Parliament from each step in the approval process. The existing body of legislation therefore had to be aligned to the new legal reality. We started this exercise with the three most important regulations all of which, Mr President, I shall deal with together, and which make up the heart of the agricultural policy: the regulations on direct payments, on rural development and on the common organisation of the markets. The Commission’s proposals immediately appeared to be quite balanced and there were very few changes made by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI). In particular, as regards direct payments, delegated acts must be used in cases where the basic act is amended, and in cases where rights are conferred to farmers or reversely where negative consequences may be incurred. In addition, given the spirit of the treaty on the common agricultural policy (CAP) budget, we felt that the financial discipline process could no longer be applied without the participation of Parliament. Indeed, maintaining Article 11 unchanged, with the Council acting on a proposal from the Commission, would constitute an unacceptable continuation of the Council’s exclusive right to implement measures directly. As regards rural development, we believe that the Commission has done an accurate repartition between more general provisions establishing additional elements, and which therefore require delegated acts, and more technical elements that are very much connected with the discretion that Member States enjoy in implementing this measure, and which therefore require implementing acts. By contrast, the proposed alignment with the regulation on the common organisation of the markets has proved to be more problematic, especially on issues connected with Article 43(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The article in question provides that the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, shall adopt measures on fixing prices, levies, aid and quantitative limitations. This is an exception to paragraph 2 of the same article, which requires the ordinary legislative procedure (OLP) to be used for the common agricultural policy. As an exception, Article 43(3) needs to be interpreted restrictively, that is, only when there are provisions that do not form part of the fundamental policy decisions, which must be taken pursuant to Article 43(2) of the Treaty. We therefore believe that the Commission proposal does not interpret Article 43(3) in a sufficiently restrictive way. The task of drawing up conditions and criteria for fixing aid amounts, export refunds and minimum export prices should remain with the legislator, which means Parliament and the Council, leaving to the Commission the fixing of amounts through implementing acts. Once these three recommendations had been approved by an overwhelming majority in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, we began to negotiate with the Council and the Commission so that we could reach an agreement at first reading. The urgency was dictated by the imminent reform of the common agricultural policy, which we would not have wished to be encumbered by complex negotiations on institutional issues. Despite our willingness to negotiate, to concede something with respect to our initial position, and despite the outstanding activism first on the part of the Polish Presidency and then from the Danish Presidency, we were unable to find a compromise solution, hence the need for the committee to act efficiently and in a timely manner, on the one hand, and the new and stronger powers conferred on Parliament by the Treaty of Lisbon, on the other. The main obstacles we encountered were from the Council, which wishes to systematically and horizontally eliminate delegated acts, even where these are legally required, in order to replace them with implementing acts which completely exclude Parliament. Such a position is unacceptable to us, because it means surrendering the new prerogatives that the Treaty has assigned to us, thereby severely limiting the powers of Parliament. Another factor that made negotiations more difficult was the attitude of the Commission which, during the negotiations, moved from a position close to that of Parliament to siding with the Council’s, leaving us alone in the battle to defend the most authentic interpretation of the Treaty. We are now faced with the difficult negotiations on the reform of the common agricultural policy; we therefore decided to ask plenary to confirm the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development’s vote on alignment, so as to strengthen our position when we negotiate future agricultural policy. Indeed, only by defending the prerogatives of Parliament can we be sure to respect the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon and, at the same time, ensure that in future, the CAP is more democratic and closer to citizens. Paolo De Castro,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take advantage of this minute just to thank my colleagues for their comments and also to thank the Commissioner. We take note of the support that the Commissioner has shown today, in the hope that the difficulties of reaching an agreement with the Council on implementing acts do not turn into difficulties of reaching an agreement on common agricultural policy reform. For this reason, I appeal to the Commissioner: we are in the Lisbon era, the Council needs to understand that Parliament has new prerogatives, which it is not prepared to surrender. In tomorrow’s vote, we will be following the Commission’s approach, so we hope that the Council will, in the end, join with us on these positions. Paolo De Castro,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in its capacity as co-legislator it is essential for Parliament to know the Member States’ simulation data for the new biophysical criteria put forward by the Commission on identifying Less Favoured Areas. The lack of transparency and unwillingness to send this data to the representatives of EU citizens reveal the ongoing ignorance of Member States and the Council of the democratic revolution enshrined by the Treaty of Lisbon. Parliament is co-decider on agricultural matters and, together with the Council, we are preparing to reform the common agricultural policy. We cannot therefore accept any discrepancy in the information held by the two institutions. We must be on the same standing as the Council in order to be able to evaluate the criteria put forward by the Commission in full awareness of the facts. The Commission – I would remind the Council – will not let us have this data, as some Member States have opposed it being given to Parliament. We therefore urge the Council to appeal to the Member States for the utmost transparency and full cooperation, in the light of what is a new institutional reality. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to express my delight in the fact that we have achieved the highly important goal of extending the programme for food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Union to 2013. It has been a long and difficult process, involving the efforts of all of Parliament. Now, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have together urged the Commission to make a clear commitment to the European Parliament to pursue the programme after 2013. The statement of 6 December 2011 in which the Commission acknowledged the opposition of some Member States to a new programme must not prejudice the Commission’s right to legislative initiative as provided for by the Treaty. The Commission must take into account the strong desire on the part of the European Parliament and the vast majority of EU Member States to continue this programme. Therefore, we are pleased with the statements the Commission has made to us today. We are talking – let us reiterate this – about an instrument which allows the EU to distribute 440 000 tonnes of free food every year to over 18 million poor people and struggling families, a number which, unfortunately, also includes many children. This is why we cannot consider our political initiative to be over. Mr President, Commissioner, taking into consideration also the new global challenges, such as food security, which are making life even tougher for the disadvantaged, Parliament will do its best to ensure that differences are overcome and that the programme can continue in 2014.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the vote on opening up the tariff quota for imports of high-quality beef marks an important moment in good transatlantic relations. What is more, thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament is, for the first time, playing a fundamental role in approving this sort of decision. This fact increases the United States’ interest in and understanding of Parliament, as we saw first-hand during the meetings held with the US Congress by a delegation from our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI) last June. This agreement puts an end to a long-held, age-old dispute, thereby enabling the sanctions imposed by the US to be lifted, while also maintaining the ban on imports of meat treated with hormones so as to guarantee our own high standards on food quality and safety. For these reasons, the AGRI Committee – which I am honoured to chair – gave staunch support for the conclusion of this agreement and did not present any amendments, in the spirit of deepening transatlantic trade relations and improving dispute resolution within the framework of the World Trade Organisation. My heartfelt thanks to Ms Quisthoudt-Rowohl and to the rapporteur for our committee, Mr Lyon. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that tomorrow we will be voting on the recommendation for a second reading on the programme for the distribution of food products to the most deprived persons in the Union, which involves the continuation of this important programme until 2013. After all these months and the commitment of so many people, whom I would like to thank, starting with our rapporteur, Vice-President Siekierski and Commissioner Cioloş, we have managed to achieve this important result, which means not abandoning 18 million poor people in Europe to their fate. The European Parliament has often expressed its approval of this programme and also of its continuation after 2013. Our political initiative will therefore continue, we will not rest just with tomorrow’s vote, Mr President. In full compliance with the ruling of the Court of Justice, Europe must also be able to continue offering solidarity to the weaker members of our society in the future, particularly during these tough economic times.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the measure we are about to approve represents the culmination of a process undertaken by Europe after the 2009 crisis in order to find solutions for stabilising the market and revenues of dairy and cheese producers. The work and commitment of the European Parliament and our rapporteur Mr Nicholson, whom I must truly thank for his enormous commitment along with the shadow rapporteurs of this important report, have meant we have reached a rapid agreement on a text that improves the Commission’s proposal. An important new provision is the possibility of managing and planning the volumes of certified quality dairy products. Such a tool is even more strategically significant at a historic time of prolonged and considerable market volatility, and we will consolidate it within the new regulations on quality agricultural and food products. The new possibility of involving representatives of the trade in interprofessional organisations is very important, as it will promote and consolidate positive links between all the components of the supply chain. Today, Mr President, Commissioner, we are showing that Parliament knows how to face up to its responsibilities and work swiftly as a whole towards completion of the legislative process. This is our first testing-ground before the major challenge of the debate on reform of the common agricultural policy. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with the report by Mr Bové, whom I thank for his work, Europe is focusing decisively on establishing a legislative framework to ensure fairness and greater transparency in relations within the agri-food industry. In this field, the ideas and requests approved in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are very much to be welcomed. Higher levels of transparency in prices, the reduction of the costs of production inputs and more effective management of energy and natural resources within the industry are just a few of the most important points. Madam President, on these grounds, and taking advantage of the presence of Vice-President Tajani, I think it appropriate to recall the central point of the joint resolution on the imbalances in the food supply chain, to which my fellow Members have also referred: a European system to harmonise the length of time taken for payments in commercial transactions between agri-food producers and the distribution system. Mr Tajani, we can no longer allow distortions of competition between European producers; it is no longer acceptable to have different national legal systems that regulate deadlines for payment, contractual agreements and discounting practices differently. There is a lack of territorial homogeneity exacerbating this phase of extreme market volatility where sharp price rises are not translating into higher margins for farmers; they, on the contrary, see their incomes dropping lower and lower. Mr Tajani, we in Parliament are ready to support a legislative proposal that goes in this direction and I know of the work that you are doing with the high-level group. I therefore sincerely hope that we may soon see a legislative proposal on harmonisation of the distribution systems in Europe. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the importance of cultivating trees for the landscape and the environment is already well known and acknowledged. Different scientific studies demonstrate that trees are more capable of reducing CO2
 levels than meadows and pastures. Considering the dispositions of direct payments, which anticipate that 7% of farmed land should be set aside for ecological purposes, what, Commissioner, will happen in the case of an olive farm that already comprises within it dry-stone walls and rows of trees, and that includes centuries-old trees of important value to both the landscape and the economy? Do you not think that such farms are already sufficiently sustainable from an environmental point of view, and that the application of the required 7% indicated above would instead risk causing harm to economic sustainability and the environment, with farmers forced to cut down part of their olive grove? Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for the response. We hope that no olive trees will be cut down. I will take this opportunity to ask a quick question. Commissioner, yesterday the result on help for the destitute was important and a very important agreement was established; we can now move forward with the 2012-2013 programme, and for this I thank you. However, what I would like to know is this: will the budget remain the same, at EUR 500 million, or will it be cut? Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Sawicki, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, the food aid distribution programme for citizens at risk of poverty represents an extraordinarily important tool to sustain the most underprivileged in our society, an instrument that has been a success for the common agricultural policy in recent years and which enables the Union to distribute 440 000 tonnes of free food each year to over 18 million poor people and families in difficulty. This number unfortunately includes many children and looks set to rise at a time when access to food is defined as a fundamental right. We therefore cannot but express incomprehension and opposition when faced with the blocking minority in favour of cutting aid which has emerged within the Council of Ministers for Agriculture. We are aware of the Court of Justice’s ruling and we will work to ensure that from 2013 there will be a text which will, of course, take account of the Court’s comments, but we certainly cannot allow this programme to be interrupted. I believe that, while Europe is today discussing a EUR 500 million programme of aid to its internal population, in the United States for over 40 years the US ‘Fair Deal’ law has been providing aid to the US population with a programme worth more than USD 20 billion. I would therefore argue that we must all redouble our efforts and in this respect I would like to thank the Polish Presidency and Mr Sawicki, and to commend Mr Cioloş, who has taken this matter to heart with courage and determination. We must find a solution. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report on information to consumers allows Europe to take a new and important step towards achieving its specific objective of protecting consumer rights. I would like to thank Mrs Sommer for this, and all the shadow rapporteurs, in particular the shadow rapporteur from my group, Glenis Willmott. While it may be true that Europe can look to the future with more confidence now that the instruments for food protection and transparency have been made more effective, it is also true that the agreement in second reading redefines, albeit in part, what this House approved at first reading. For example, we would have expected more, Madam President, on origin labelling for foodstuffs. The obligation to indicate the origin of all meat, given to us in the new paragraph 25, is a significant change that meets the expectations of large numbers of European consumers. At the same time, we have to underline its less ambitious approach with regard to the introduction of mandatory labelling for all fresh agricultural products and single-ingredient processed foods, which this House had approved. Meat labelling in Annex XI excludes some important products that require an equal level of protection, such as rabbit meat, which for some reason has been excluded. However, the way forward in food transparency has been shown, and we now need to pursue it with the same commitment and responsibility that have brought us this far. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, fifteen years after the emergence of BSE, we should take stock of the implementation and prospects of the European legislative framework and the relative checks carried out on feed and food. As the rapporteur has said, figures show that the number of cases testing positive in the European Union has fallen from over 2 100 cases in 2001 to just over 65 cases in 2009, and in the light of this declining epidemiological trend we can conclude that the legislation implemented helped to eradicate BSE. This is why the report we are about to vote on is an important opportunity to show commitment and responsibility in moving towards aligning legal provisions with the actual situation in terms of risk. One good signal in this regard is the review of the ban on using animal meal in feed. The period of panic having passed, scientific progress shows that the time is now ripe for reviewing the ban on feeding non-ruminants with processed animal protein. This is an important new factor, and one which, in full compliance with food safety rules, is of strategic importance, particularly in light of the EU’s current protein deficit. At the same time, it is naturally important not to lower our guard in terms of checks and monitoring. We need to make sure we do not threaten the extraordinary progress Europe has made in consumer and animal health protection. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Dess report marks the beginning of a new phase in the common agricultural policy (CAP) reform process. It is the result of several months’ hard work by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, for which I would like to thank Mr Dess and all the shadow rapporteurs and parliamentary groups. Today this House can give a clear opinion on the future of the common agricultural policy: it must be a robust, simple, flexible and greener CAP that takes young people and employment into account. That, Commissioner, is why we are worried by the news in the press today about budget cuts, especially in the second pillar. That would be incompatible with both the Dess report and the report on the European Union’s financial perspective by Mr Garriga Polledo, which we adopted in plenary in recent weeks. The latter report introduced the important principle for the CAP of maintaining the current level of funding in the next financial programming period. Therefore, Commissioner, we would like some clarification about the news that has been circulated, and we would like to know whether as far as you are concerned there are different guidelines from what we have been told up to now.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we have an important chance to tackle the growing problem of antibiotic resistance in animals responsibly and with commitment. This is a strategic issue for the agriculture sector and, in particular, for the future of the European animal husbandry system. The data show that around 50% of the antibiotics in Europe are prescribed for animal use. If used properly, antibiotics are a useful tool that helps farmers keep their livestock healthy and productive and safeguard its welfare. Therefore, we are not here to demonise antibiotic use in animal husbandry, but we want to ask the Commission to provide a concrete response for the more efficient and effective use of antibiotics, in order to reduce resistance in animals. In our resolution of 5 May 2010 on the EU Action Plan for Animal Welfare, this House underlined the link between animal welfare, animal health and public health, and urged the Commission and the Member States to address the difficult problem of antibiotic resistance in animals in a responsible manner. In particular, we called on the Commission to collect and analyse data on the use of all animal health products, including antibiotics, with a view to ensuring the effective use of such products. A year later, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which I have the honour to chair, is here to ask the Commission to implement all relevant initiatives to resolve this long-standing problem, which can also have consequences for human health. What is needed, Madam President and Commissioner, is a tangible commitment from the Commission that it will use the data collected to put the results obtained into practice, not only encouraging research and monitoring activities, but also ensuring more effective use of antibiotics as an important tool for fighting animal diseases. On that front, I would point out that some studies show that low-energy animal feed could lead to a higher incidence of diseases and, hence, more antibiotic use. It would therefore be desirable to review the ban on the use of animal meal for non-ruminants, in line with the opinion of the European Scientific Veterinary Committee. These are the requests made in the resolution adopted in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on 12 April this year and which will be put to the vote in this Chamber tomorrow. It has been hard work for the last few months, and for that reason I would like to personally thank Mrs Paulsen, the shadow rapporteurs and all the parliamentary groups for their invaluable contributions to establishing a common text on this issue. The future competitiveness of European animal husbandry may depend on how this problem is managed, and its cross-cutting nature calls for commitment and responsibility, through a coordinated approach and a shared political will.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank Mr Wojciechowski and all the shadow rapporteurs for the work carried out on this report, which aims to make the rules on vaccination against bluetongue more flexible. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has made every effort to approve the text as a matter of urgency in order to allow the vaccination campaign to go ahead before the summer. The European Commission had presented a proposal which did not take into account the approval of the Treaty of Lisbon. In other words, it left decision-making power solely with the Council, totally excluding Parliament. After intense discussions, for which I would like to thank Parliament’s Legal Service and the secretariat of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, we managed to reach an agreement to change the legal basis, in accordance with Article 43(2) of the Treaty; in other words, within the framework of the ordinary legislative procedure. Now we expect the Council to be equally efficient in accepting our position and including the correlation tables, in order to give a prompt response to European livestock farmers. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the petition under discussion today has arrived at a time when Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and its Committee on International Trade are debating the new chapter on agriculture in the agreement with Morocco. The European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) confirms that there have been irregularities in the calculation of duties on tomato imports and that this has been damaging to European producers, the very same producers who are expressing their concern at the expected increase in tomato and fruit and vegetable imports in general that will take place if the agreement is signed. We are obviously sensitive to the concerns brought about by bilateral agreements where the agricultural element is often sacrificed for the sake of broader industrial interests. It is not a good way to proceed, and we will continue to repeat this to the European Commission. However, I would like to point out that the current economic and political crisis throughout the Maghreb area should lead us to consider this agreement carefully and with greater solidarity. Paolo De Castro,  
Chair of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to speak briefly just to underline the importance of the Wojciechowski report on bluetongue for an institutional issue which concerns us all. As far as the content is concerned, there is no conflict between the Commission, Parliament and the Council. However, the inclusion of the correlation tables in the text remains a very sensitive issue. Despite the fact that the Council was totally opposed to it, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development decided to vote for a text that includes the correlation tables, which oblige Member States to report on transposition of the directive. It is now up to the Council to decide whether to accept the correlation tables and conclude the agreement at first reading, or to answer to European farmers for causing the bluetongue vaccination campaign to be missed this year in order not to give way on this point. I believe that this report can act as a precedent in future negotiations with the Council. We must be united and determined in calling for maximum transparency from Member States and in defending total compliance with EU law. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, social tensions, such as the recent ones in North Africa, are almost always triggered by rising food prices. The record increase in the prices of cereals, sugar and vegetable oils is a clear sign of the increasing imbalance between global supply and demand. A further – sadly possible – rise in prices would have dramatic consequences particularly for those parts of the world where food expenditure accounts for more than 40% of per capita income. It also poses a real risk of creating tensions throughout the entire planet in an increasingly interdependent world economy. The European Union must therefore have a clear awareness that agricultural policies – the common agricultural policy for the European Union and the Farm Bill for the United States – have a role of extraordinary and strategic importance to play in the world order, a role that goes far beyond the legitimate protection of farmers’ incomes. We need, Madam President, a new global food policy capable of coordinating agricultural policies at international level. Personally I hope that the forthcoming G20 summit will be an opportunity to actually embark on this new path. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D
).

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should also like to thank Commissioner Dalli for coming to the Chamber today to report on this case, which is a source of great concern for European consumers. Next week, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which I have the honour of chairing, will also meet to look further into the debate on the consequences of this serious episode. Despite the fact that Europe is very much committed to food safety, further efforts in terms of transparency and checks are needed in order to avoid further cases of food contamination. I would note that last year, Parliament adopted an own-initiative report on agricultural product quality and, above all, that this Chamber adopted the regulation on the provision of food information to consumers at first reading, introducing obligatory marking of the place of origin of agricultural products on labels. Unfortunately, this important development stalled on 8 December in the Health Council. We shall try to reintroduce it at second reading, because it is an important objective for protection and transparency in favour of European consumers. Parliament is therefore moving in the right direction, showing that it is on the side of consumers. We hope that the Council and the Commission adopt a similar attitude. Paolo De Castro,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today represents an important opportunity to discuss the strategic issue of protecting animal welfare in agriculture. On 1 January 2012, the terms of Council Directive 1999/74/EC will enter into force, laying down minimum standards for the protection of hens, tantamount to the abolition of conventional battery cages as a system of rearing for the production of eggs. This method of animal housing will be banned in favour of systems of rearing that guarantee better animal welfare. Mr President, the memory of the Council of the European Union on Agriculture, held on 19 July 1999, is fresh in my mind. It was an important day, on which, as the representative of my country (at the time I was the Italian Minister for Agriculture), I contributed to the approval of this important directive by voting for it. Now, one year after the irrevocable entry into force of the new legislation, data show that European producers are proceeding to adapt their production system, but not without running into difficulties. What we need is a concrete commitment from the Commission to safeguard animal welfare, to protect producers who have adapted their system of rearing to Council Directive 1999/74/EC, and, at the same time, to effectively guarantee the passage of the new legislation, avoiding distortions in terms of market competition. This is why my fellow Members and I felt it appropriate to add this important topic to the agenda of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which I have the honour of chairing. Hard work over recent months, involving all parliamentary groups, resulted in the oral question of 28 October 2010, which puts three important issues to the Commission: Firstly, to report on the implementation of the new legislation within the Member States; Secondly, the actions to be taken in the Member States to guarantee compliance with the terms of the directive, and compromising where necessary with those undertakings that show a genuine desire to adapt. Lastly, measures and guarantees to be adopted to avoid crises in the egg market in the coming years and to prevent unfair competition from third countries that are not obliged to respect the European Union directive within the European internal market. These are the queries to which we are awaiting concrete and definitive responses from the Commission. Lastly, we ask the Commissioner to guarantee a more transparent market, along the lines of the concept of so-called reciprocity of rules, in order to facilitate the prospect of greater international convergence on the animal welfare standards applied by the European Union. Attending to this matter, which we have discussed a number of times in committee since the start of the legislature, is essential to prevent Europe’s efforts on animal welfare – our efforts, Commissioner – from being rendered useless by a market that is incapable of recognising the social values that are bound up in foodstuffs. We need to reduce the distorting effects of the possibility that producers outside the European rules system could translate the lesser restrictions they are subject to into greater competitive advantages. Mr President, adopting the motion for a resolution on the welfare of laying hens, which we will vote on this morning, could represent a first and important step in this direction. Paolo De Castro,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as Chair of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I am deeply disappointed for several reasons with the contents of Mr Szájer’s report, which is being voted on tomorrow. Firstly, none the amendments voted for by my committee unanimously – and I stress, unanimously – were taken into account, even though the common agricultural policy is one of the policies with the most acts adopted under the comitology procedure and is therefore one of the ones most affected by the adaptation of legislative acts under the Treaty of Lisbon. Secondly, under the text of Article 10, the European Parliament will have no power to exert pressure nor a margin to negotiate with Council over the adaptation of CAP legislation to the new treaty. We are aware, in fact, that the Council has already demonstrated its unwillingness to agree acts delegated to the European Parliament and, with the adoption of this Regulation, the Council will not have any interest in proceeding with negotiations because the automatic adaptation – which excludes delegated acts and only covers implementing acts – has no deadline because it is transitional. For this reason, together with other fellow Members, I tabled an amendment that makes the automatic alignment genuinely temporary and I call on you all to support it in order to reinforce the role of the European Parliament. There is no reason, in fact, to come to an agreement at first reading over such a sensitive file that sets the rules for implementing the treaty for the coming years. This is the reason why, for this all-important file, we have the right – I would even go so far as to say the duty – to improve the text as much as possible and therefore proceed to a second reading without giving in to blackmail by the Council, which is threatening not to move on this file in order to force us to accept this negative agreement. After the budget, I think this is the most important file we have to vote on, because it redraws the balance of power between the European institutions. Here in this Chamber, we must vigorously defend the prerogatives of Parliament, which has been democratically elected and represents all European citizens. Paolo De Castro,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution we are about to vote on represents the view of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the European beekeeping support policy. As is normal practice for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, this important paper has benefited from the participation of all the parliamentary groups, who have added their valuable contribution to the end result. Despite the recent increase in the annual budget for measures to improve the general conditions for production and marketing of bee products, a widespread concern persists with regard to the numerous challenges and problems that beekeeping will have to face in the near future. Difficult production and marketing conditions, strong and prolonged price volatility and difficulties emerging from the increasingly widespread mortality of bee stocks are some of the critical factors that afflict one of the most important sectors of European agriculture. Like all other primary sector operators, European beekeepers must be put in a position where they can plan their own affairs. Since the current support depends on European agricultural policy implementation procedures in force at present, the future of this policy after 2013 is uncertain. This is the background to today’s resolution, whereby we intend to call on the Commission to make an active commitment to defend beekeeping. The main demands to the Commission contained in the motion for a resolution include the following: a specific undertaking after the expiry of national programmes, also in view of new challenges and problems in the sector, namely bee mortality, price volatility etc.; a commitment to the necessary improvement in statistical measurements, for more effective control of non-EU honey imports and research development; a strengthening of the role of European veterinary policy; an action plan to tackle the phenomenon of widespread bee mortality, partly through specific undertakings in the field of research; greater financial support in the field of operator training and education and, lastly, a revitalised role as a leading player for the beekeeping sector within the common agricultural policy after 2013. In thanking Mrs Lulling and all my fellow MEPs for the common work carried out, I would like to remind you, Madam President, Commissioner, that the International Year of Biodiversity is about to end. This is why we hope that approval of the resolution will definitely mark the start of the road to relaunch a sector that is particularly strategic from the viewpoint of environmental sustainability and maintenance of biodiversity, as well as in terms of economic and social impact.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are here today to call on the Commission to implement suitable efficient and flexible market instruments to combat the crisis into which the European livestock sector has plunged. We hope that the proposal that the Commission will shortly present on market instruments for the milk and dairy sector will also include proposals to limit the impact of price volatility on the agricultural sector as a whole. Many actions can still be deployed to send out a strong signal to European livestock breeders. We believe, for example, that it would be very useful to the livestock sector to review the current ban on the use of animal meal for non-ruminants, for example, for the avian and fisheries sectors. As you know, this ban was introduced following cases of BSE but now, a few years on, the scientific community agrees in stating that the ban can only be justified for ruminants. In the case of non-ruminants, conversely, there is no danger to human health and the environment and we therefore hope that this ban may be overturned with the aim of offering these animals a greater possibility of higher-energy diets.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after a year and a half of difficult negotiations between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, we have at last arrived at a compromise text in the sensitive dossier on animal experimentation. It has been difficult work and I should like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Jeggle, and our shadow rapporteurs, for having carried out such intense negotiations. The text was adopted unopposed, with only 4 abstentions, by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which it is my honour to chair. It achieves a good balance between the need to improve the welfare of animals used in experiments and the need to allow for progress in medical research. The proposal aims to examine and improve the 1986 directive, which is now obsolete, and harmonise European regulations on the subject. Animal experimentation is a particularly sensitive topic for all of us as well as for the general public, but I can say with conviction, ladies and gentlemen, that the text on which we are about to vote is reasonable and the outcome of serious, meticulous work. It is a definite improvement on the existing legislation in terms of animal protection while, at the same time, it does not lose sight of our moral responsibility to advance medical research. Paolo De Castro,  
Chair of the AGRI Committee.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as chair of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which is the relevant committee for this topic, I am against referring back the Jeggle report. After more than a year and a half of intense debate, our committee has already come out quite clearly in favour of the compromise reached on the common position, without any votes against and only a few abstentions. I therefore see no reason for re-examining the text: we already have everything we need to vote on it today. Paolo De Castro,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Jordan River is a major asset of not only environmental, but also agricultural and economic significance for Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian Territories, and the degradation it is suffering cannot fail to worry us. It is important to point out that roughly 98% of the 1.3 billion cubic metres of natural fresh water in the lower course of the river is diverted away every year, and long stretches of the river are at risk of running dry. This is devastating not only in terms of biodiversity, but above all in terms of local communities’ access to sources of water. Several international actors, including the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly and the United States Senate, have addressed the situation of profound degradation of the Jordan River. We, too, must demand intervention, not only from the local governments and authorities, but also from the Council, the Commission and the Member States, to provide technical and financial assistance for the rehabilitation of the river. In particular – as stated in the joint resolution signed by all the political groups, whom I thank for their wholehearted support – we must ask the Commission to insert a clear, specific reference to this project in the action plans of the neighbourhood policy with Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority. An initial step could be to set up a joint study on the situation of the Jordan River. We are well aware that water is a precious, inalienable asset, so I would like to point out that distributing the water fairly means paying equal attention to the demands of all the communities in the region. This is a matter of supreme importance if we want to achieve lasting peace and stability in the Middle East. We have been watching the resumption of peace negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians in recent days with some hope, as these negotiations have identified water resource management as one of their essential points. We hope that the governments, local communities and civil society organisations in the countries and territories involved will begin to cooperate effectively as soon as possible in order to save the lower Jordan. This is a duty not only because of the high symbolic value of this river but, above all, in order to improve the living conditions of the local communities. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over the next few years the challenges accompanying the development of the European agricultural system will be huge: the growing demand for food will have to be met through the sustainable use of natural resources, with a parallel increase in the level of environmental performance. This outlook, which strengthens the relationship between the agricultural sector and the production of public goods, gives agriculture a new strategic importance: the creation of the future common agricultural policy (CAP) today represents the solution to these major challenges facing our society, and the policy will play a crucial role in responding to what is already a food crisis. Therefore, it is a case of producing more while polluting less: this is the difficult objective that European agriculture will have to fulfil over the next few years. Based on these assumptions, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which I have the honour of chairing, has produced an intense and concise piece of work – which Mr Lyon, with the involvement of all the groups, has overseen in an excellent fashion – in the shape of the report presented to Parliament today. It is a report that we are convinced will help lay the foundations of the future CAP and will provide the European Commission with some clear pointers so that it can prepare the year-end communication on the future of the CAP after 2013.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a new phase of reflection has opened in Europe today on the issue of quality, which is intended not only as a guarantee for consumers but, above all, as a stimulus for our producers to be more competitive in a market that is far larger and far more competitive. Our businesses need to gain market recognition of the distinctive and quality-related aspects associated with their products. In this sense, as Mr Scottà’s report intends – and I, too, thank him for my part – we are making progress in guaranteeing, first of all, more information on the origin, composition and characteristics of production processes. At the same time, Commissioner, it is fundamental that European regulations allow organisations designated for the protection and promotion of quality products to plan their product supply and to adapt their production potential to market needs on the basis of fair and non-discriminatory principles. We hope that the approval of this report will signal the definitive establishment of quality as the lynchpin of the European strategy for the agri-food sector, and that the Commission will seriously consider our committee’s proposals, so that one of the principal strong points of European agriculture can be transformed into a precious competitive advantage. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT) 
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I must express my sincere regret, and that of the entire Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which I have the honour of chairing, that no reference whatsoever has been made to the agri-food sector in the 2020 strategy. It is absurd that the Commission’s proposed strategy for the next 10 years does not include the central issue of the challenge relating to food security, growth and job retention in rural areas. Madam President, how can one conceive of a green and sustainable Europe without taking into account that 45% of all European territory is managed by farmers? How can one fail to take into account the nearly 30 million people who work on that territory? These are workers who must be safeguarded and protected. Before we focus on new jobs, we must protect the existing ones. I would remind you that agriculture provides a whole host of essential services relating to, among other things, food, biodiversity, the landscape and the environment, and these are tasks that are performed for the sake of the social and economic life of rural areas. The Spanish Presidency has also insisted strongly on the need for a powerful common agricultural policy. I am therefore concerned about this very serious omission, which I hope Parliament will be able to put right. Paolo De Castro,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, here we are once again discussing the crisis in the agricultural sector. In recent months, Parliament has spoken several times on the difficulties that have seriously beset the milk sector, and asked the Commission and the Council to take urgent action. We have achieved results, albeit only partial results, but on the basis of these initiatives, a special fund of EUR 300 million has been made available to deal with the emergency. However, we must now take note that the crisis that has affected the dairy farming sector is rapidly extending to other sectors of European agriculture, with the wheat, olive oil and fruit and vegetable markets showing alarming signs, as Mrs Fischer Boel has just said. As for milk, we are facing a cyclical phenomenon that goes hand in hand with the difficult economic situation that has inevitably resulted in a fall in demand and in the ensuing stagnation of the markets. This crisis is starting to take on a decidedly worrying dimension, as demonstrated by the numerous protests led by farmers in many regions of Europe. These are symptomatic of a pressing and alarming situation and of widespread concern for the future of the sector as a whole. That is why, at the last meeting of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on 1 December, we decided unanimously to invite the Commission to the House to report to us on the status of the crisis faced by our agriculture and the trends that the various productive sectors are going through. On this front we expect, first of all, the Commission to make use of all the measures at its disposal to stabilise the market and to stimulate the recovery of consumption but, at the same time, we believe that this opportunity should also be seized upon to look to the future, and help guarantee that the common agricultural policy will continue to be an important European policy, which will look after the interests of all citizens and all European regions, from northern Sweden to southern Cyprus. Farmers expect immediate answers, and today we are here to accept responsibility to speed things up, to tackle the crisis in a decisive manner, and to put the lessons of recent experiences to good use, thus avoiding wasting time and quickly remedying a situation that is in danger of becoming even worse. We would like to receive an answer and also news from the Commission in this regard. Paolo De Castro,  
Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, here we are once again discussing the crisis in the milk sector. The dramatic nature of this crisis continues to concern us, just as European farmers continue to express their hardship and voice their fears for the future. Parliament has already expressed its views on this matter, both by adopting a resolution with our proposals and by adopting the Commission proposal to extend the intervention period for milk powder and butter, to which we added the request for the measure on the private storage of cheese. At that time, we pointed out that the measures proposed by the Commission did not go nearly far enough. We now have to decide whether or not to allow the urgent procedure for the extension of Article 186 of the single CMO Regulation to the dairy sector, namely the possibility for the Commission to decide, in the event of a market crisis, to implement emergency measures without going through the normal procedure in Parliament. Yesterday evening, an extraordinary meeting of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development was held to discuss this, with Mrs Fischer Boel attending. Firstly I, and the committee which it is my honour to chair, would like to thank the Commissioner for coming to us in Parliament right at the end of the Agricultural Council which was held in Luxembourg. This gesture was one of great attentiveness which we appreciated. Yesterday evening, the debate was very spirited, Mr President, and our fellow Members voiced a lot of criticism. First of all, it was pointed out that the Commission was very slow to act, and did not adequately grasp the seriousness of the crisis under way. Then the objection was raised that Article 186 deprives Parliament of its decision-making prerogatives, thereby giving carte blanche to the Commission. It was also said that the Commission should have made more funds available to tackle the crisis. These are legitimate concerns which we agree with in part. Nevertheless, Mr President, I feel compelled to admit that the Commission has made considerable efforts and progress, showing that it takes Parliament’s opinion and wishes seriously. It has explained how it intends to use a fund of EUR 280 million – which, I would remind you, we will be voting on this Thursday in the context of approval of the 2010 budget – and set out some of the measures it will implement, such as the private storage of cheese and raising the ceiling of de minimis
 aid from EUR 7 500 to EUR 15 000, as requested in our resolution which was adopted in September. Although I am aware that all this still does not go far enough, I nevertheless believe, Mr President, that today we should vote in favour of the urgent procedure. European farmers expect immediate answers and too much time has already been wasted. Today we must take responsibility for speeding things up in order to face the crisis head on. Let us show, ladies and gentlemen, the same responsibility which pervades our preparations for the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon with codecision in agricultural matters. Paolo De Castro,

 Mr President, Mrs Fischer Boel, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to take the opportunity to say how pleased I am at the responsibility shown this morning by the House when it adopted the urgent procedure to include the dairy sector under Article 186 of the single CMO Regulation, along with many other agricultural products. The rapid extension to this sector of the rules governing intervention in the event of market crisis enables us to provide a significant response at an extremely difficult time for farming as a whole and the dairy sector in particular. At this point, we expect the European Commission to take onboard, as Mrs Fischer Boel just said, Parliament’s requests, which have pointed out several times that the measures taken until now have proved to be inadequate given the seriousness of the current crisis. Parliament’s openness towards the Commission today should not be interpreted as full delegation with unrestricted powers, but as a gesture of responsibility in a dramatic and wholly exceptional situation. I am keen to stress that in this regard, Parliament considers it essential to be involved at every stage of the decision-making process in order to guarantee democratic scrutiny, and this is why we believe that the Commission should notify Parliament in advance of how it will actually use these new powers conferred under Article 186 for the milk sector as well.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 2 October was a great day for Europe thanks to the Irish who voted in favour of the Treaty of Lisbon. The entry into force of codecision will be a veritable democratic revolution for the common agricultural policy in particular. Parliament will finally have decision-making powers equal to those of the Council of Agricultural Ministers, thanks to the agreement of the Irish and the favourable votes received in the national parliaments, including the Czech Parliament. Any delay would create problems for farmers throughout the Member States. In fact, the agricultural sector is going through one of its most delicate and difficult times of recent years, with a fall in the prices of most products, and not just of dairy products, as we have seen these last few days. As we await the formal entry into force of the Treaty, we expect the Council and the Commission, Mr President, to give careful consideration as from today to the decisions taken by Parliament – which was democratically elected by all European citizens – regarding agricultural matters too, starting with measures to address the crisis in the dairy sector. Paolo De Castro,

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the dairy farming sector is going through one of the deepest and most serious crises of the last few decades: the fall in the price of milk and the more general crisis in the dairy farming market have now become a source of concern throughout Europe. This is a cyclical crisis, caused by the difficult economic situation, which has led to a decline in milk consumption and created stagnant markets, with the prices paid to producers in free fall. The prices paid to milk producers have plummeted everywhere, averaging 24 cents per litre within the European Union. Many economic operators are in an even more serious situation, as they get prices of less than 20-21 cents, when their production costs come to at least 40 cents per litre. Other markets, such as the cereal, olive oil and fruit and vegetable markets, are showing some alarming signs too. On this front, first of all, we should continue to make use of all the measures at our disposal so as to stabilise the market and to stimulate an upturn in consumption, but at the same time we need to be able to look to the future with medium- and long-term policies and to do everything possible to identify acceptable and lasting solutions aimed at minimising the risk of price fluctuations. In this context the Commission proposals extending the intervention period for butter and skimmed milk powder have been welcomed and accepted within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, as the unanimous vote of 2 September demonstrates. We believe, however, that these proposals are not enough to mitigate the serious consequences of the crisis in the sector. That is why, still in relation to the adoption of the European Commission’s proposal, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has adopted an amendment to my proposal that also reintroduces aid for private storage of cheese, which was abolished under the health check on the common agricultural policy in November 2008. This was a unanimous decision, Madam President, Commissioner, representing what are, in essence, identical views shared by the members of the Committee on Agriculture, which I have the honour of chairing, and expressing our desire to send out a strong signal to the Council and the Commission at a sensitive time for an extremely important sector for European agriculture. As well as being a first important demonstration of the positive leadership that we as the European Parliament want to provide when looking ahead to codecision in agricultural matters too, this is a measure that can also offer immediate help to dairy farmers, who are grappling with an increasingly difficult market and with an obvious and dramatic fall in sales. However, these initial measures, on which we will vote today, are not enough to support the producers in crisis, and that is why the Committee on Agriculture, through an oral question and a resolution on which we are preparing to vote, is calling on the European Commission to introduce new and effective measures to combat the crisis and to support the sector. We want to encourage and at the same time support the European Commission in the process of deciding what must be done to end the crisis in the European dairy farming sector once and for all. In this sense we hope that the Commission will provide an exhaustive answer to our questions and will take our proposals seriously, so that interinstitutional cooperation produces the results that European agriculture deserves and shows its solidarity by offering practical support to European farmers in crisis, who need our help today. Paolo De Castro,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank the Commission for deciding to come here to Parliament today to present new proposals on the crisis in the dairy farming sector. It is important for the parliamentary term that has just begun to be characterised by an interinstitutional dialogue between the Commission and Parliament, a positive dialogue, which has in fact already launched the codecision process. We will assess your new proposals very carefully, Commissioner, and it will be my job to ask the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to issue an opinion on the new ideas immediately, without delay. May I conclude, however, by pointing out that, if the amendment adopted unanimously within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is also adopted by this House in plenary, it will become a political problem if the Council, after the ratification of Lisbon, should then vote it down. I therefore invite you, and the Council, to give it serious consideration. Rita Borsellino,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is an emotional moment for me as I come to present my own-initiative report on the European Union’s internal security strategy. It is, in fact, 20 years ago this week – on 23 May to be precise – that Judge Giovanni Falcone, his wife and his police escort were murdered. I would like to dedicate the adoption of this report to all the victims of mafias, organised crime and terrorism, and, in particular, to Melissa Bassi, the young victim of last Saturday’s attack on a school in Brindisi, in which six other girls were also wounded. The motive for the attack is still unknown, but it clearly comes within the context of growing tension and lack of security caused by the crisis, which organisations or individuals may be tempted to exploit for violently subversive ends. My thoughts also go out to the victims of the earthquake in Emilia Romagna, because natural disasters also come within the Union’s internal security remit. The text that we will vote on tomorrow highlights the importance of having a consistent security strategy for the Union, and in that respect I would like to thank the Commission for the major effort it has made in drafting this strategy. As is repeatedly shown in the report, security must always be pursued in accordance with the rule of law and people’s fundamental rights, which form an integral and inseparable part of this strategy. That is also why the role of the EU institutions in defining and implementing the strategy is of particular importance, especially in the post-Lisbon context. The European Parliament also needs to play an appropriate role in this context, both in setting priorities for the strategy and during the evaluation stage. This role derives from the fully-fledged legislative powers that Parliament has acquired in matters of security. It is also essential for ensuring proper democratic control, which the European Parliament should exercise alongside the national parliaments. That is why we will undertake to establish regular links between the European Parliament and the national parliaments, so as to create a parliamentary political round associated with the Commission’s annual report on this subject and ending with an annual parliamentary report on the implementation status of the internal security strategy. We believe the Union needs to have a clear idea of the extent of the threats to internal security, which it currently does not have. We therefore call on Europol, with the support of the other EU institutions and agencies, to conduct a global analysis of the threats facing the Union, on the basis of a more transparent and robust methodology and relying on information contributed by the Member States. In relation to the five key objectives identified by the Commission, we are of the opinion that they are not exhaustive and that the order of priorities could probably have been better structured. The fight against terrorism, organised crime and mafias is, and must remain, a key priority within the internal security strategy. The Union must know not only how to react to whatever happens in Europe, but also how to prevent and interpret it. That has been shown by the events in Utøya and now again in Brindisi. We need to be able to recognise the early signs of violent radicalisation, barbarisation of the social milieu and violent extremism. Judicial cooperation is the main element lacking in the security strategy outlined by the Commission, and this gap needs to be filled. Joint action by judicial systems across Europe is crucial if we are to clamp down on crime and terrorism; strengthening such action must be prioritised, as must fighting corruption and combating environmental, economic and corporate crime. While we agree with the emphasis placed on fighting cybercrime, the Commission’s decision to include the protection of intellectual property rights among our security priorities hardly seems justified. As the issue of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement shows, this topic is not just a security matter but is highly complex and involves people’s rights, and therefore it requires a more thorough debate. I would like to finish by thanking all the shadow rapporteurs who played a part in drafting this report, as well as the staff of the political groups and my personal assistant. Rita Borsellino,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I was part of the European Parliament delegation that visited Sicily in November last year. The head of our delegation, Ms Wikström, wrote to the Italian Minister for the Interior, Ms Cancellieri, and has received a reply that is clear enough. I should like to put on record first of all that since our visit, there has been a change of government in Italy, and there has also been a change of approach to the situation. However, the situation itself in the countries from which the flow of migrants largely originates has also changed. This is why we must not shirk from the need for a close examination of what has happened or of the situation as it is now. The most important fact, still an issue, is Lampedusa’s status as an unsafe port with the closure of the Contrada Imbraciola emergency assistance and reception centre following the fire in September 2011 in which it was damaged. However, the damage was only partial: a dormitory was wrecked and one of the facility’s seven buildings was damaged, followed by the effective termination of the Presidium project. Now, apart from the consideration that the only unsafe port in the Mediterranean was Tripoli in the Gaddafi era – and this analogy does not seem flattering to me – and given that the migration flows have certainly not come to an end, even though they have notably lessened both in numbers and for seasonal reasons, it is important that there should be a functioning emergency assistance and reception facility, and that it should be located at Lampedusa, which is the first landing point for those arriving from the opposite shore after journeys that are certainly not easy or free from risk. This is something the shipwreck victims from Somalia who arrived in April this year know well, after seeing 10 people die on the barge on which they were travelling, or the 20 who were transferred from Linosa because there was no place for them in the other reception centres, or the 18 who are still in Linosa, living in the stadium’s changing-rooms. There is also the tourist residence of Cala Creta, where they are currently housed, which is certainly neither an identification and expulsion centre nor a reception centre for asylum seekers, and especially the fact that in the meantime, both the sanitary arrangements and the possibility of receiving asylum at Lampedusa have been removed. Everything has been entrusted to the goodwill and the kind-heartedness of the police or the citizens and volunteers of Lampedusa. Another thing that must be borne in mind is the role that the centre itself has assumed in the recent past. After having allowed thousands upon thousands of people to gather, against all legal and ethical standards, in a place which, in terms of capacity and function, was only intended to accommodate a few hundred passing through, after having allowed an area of a few square kilometres, already made problematic on account of its location and logistics, to be forced to accommodate a number of people far in excess of the local population itself, we must give thought to who is responsible for an extremely tense situation, which then resulted in the fire itself. I believe that a perusal and examination of the facts is enough to understand that it was precisely the removal from Lampedusa of the great number of people who had gathered there which led to all this. Today, the best relations will surely lead to a better state of affairs. Rita Borsellino  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Member of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to join my colleagues who have welcomed the anti-corruption package approved by the European Commission on 6 June. Corruption is a transnational phenomenon and European-wide measures are needed to fight it. According to estimates from Eurobarometer, the vast majority of our European citizens believe that Europe should do more. How can we fault them? Many Member States have lacked the political will to fight corruption. One only has to consider that some European countries have still not signed the United Nations Convention Against Corruption. If we think of the devastating effect of corruption on democratic processes, citizens’ rights and confidence in the rule of law, it is clear that the national anti-corruption measures adopted by Member States to date are not sufficient to curb what is a growing problem. The European Union has to give a unified, strong response, especially now, in the midst of an unprecedented economic crisis, which is having an impact on people’s lives, on the survival of welfare and pension systems, and on the ability of institutions to guarantee essential services. Each year corruption causes the loss of EUR 120 billion, the equivalent of 1% of the European Union GDP. Every day it siphons off resources belonging to the EU and to Member States that could be used to provide key services – education, children’s services, employment and transport. In other words it siphons off clean resources from services to support people. We therefore need to be more courageous and more firm, both in overseeing the implementation of anti-corruption measures, and in intensifying and strengthening measures to combat corruption at EU level. More specifically, we cannot talk about combating corruption unless we are capable of adopting at least basic standards for defining the crime of corruption, which there is no trace of in the package just launched. The same goes for the definition of standard parameters for measuring the extent of the problem in Member States, which is essential for preparing an adequate response. For example, we are in favour of relaunching the network of EU anti-corruption contact points, as I proposed in the resolution we will be voting on tomorrow. Rita Borsellino  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today’s debate on readmission agreements cannot escape the now thorny issue of the agreement between the European Union and Libya. We know that one part of the agreement centres on the fight against illegal immigration. We are worried because so far, the Commission has said little to us on the issue, despite the fact that the Treaty of Lisbon obliges the Commission to provide Parliament with information promptly. As we know, Libya is not a signatory to the Geneva Convention on Human Rights, nor has it so far shown that it has adopted standards of behaviour in line with international law. I am thinking of the case of the Eritrean immigrants held in inhumane conditions in the Libyan centre of Brak, as well as the closure of the offices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Above all, however, I am thinking about the events of last week, when a Libyan patrol boat opened fire on an Italian fishing boat from the Mazara del Vallo fleet in international waters, claiming that there were illegal immigrants on board. This is an extremely worrying explanation that brings to mind the agreement signed between Libya and Italy. Among other things, this provides for the refoulement of immigrants to Libya without any provisions on the right to request asylum or individual, case-by-case assessments of each situation, whilst it also permits the use of firearms to stop immigrants. Given that part of the agreement is secret in this case too, I wonder if the Commission is aware of its content and whether, in the case in question, it thinks it necessary to request explanations regarding the Libyan authorities’ ability to open fire on boats if they suspect that they are carrying illegal immigrants. Because if this was the case … (The President cut off the speaker) Rita Borsellino  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Chastel, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the French Government’s decision to expel more than one thousand Roma is an extremely serious matter, above all, when we consider that this measure was taken for propagandist and populist reasons at a time when the French Government is far from enjoying favourable public opinion, and this is true political manipulation. This measure undermines the principle of European citizenship first and foremost. Under Directive 2004/38/EC on freedom of movement, this principle must be restricted only in specific cases and the restriction assessed on a case-by-case basis. I do not believe that this is what happened. As guardian of the treaties, the Commission’s job is to intervene quickly and to carefully assess conduct by Member States that is xenophobic and does not comply with EU law. I would also like to remind you that when the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force, the Charter of Fundamental Rights became binding and prohibits any kind of discrimination based on ethnic origin or nationality. Today, this debate gives us the opportunity to find out what the Commission and the Council think about these measures and what action they will take in this regard, not least because, quite sincerely, I believe that the Commission’s response was a little late in coming. I shall conclude by asking the Commission and the Council what became of the action plan for the development of a European strategy for the Roma and their integration, and how France and the other Member States are using the European money earmarked for the integration of ethnic minorities.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is not my intention, nor that of my group – which supported and wanted this debate – to transfer Italian internal political diatribes to the European domain. The issue of freedom of information concerns us all: it concerns the European Union, which can and must regulate the matter at Community level, so as to resist political and economic conditioning and to guarantee true pluralism of information. The Italian anomaly, where the Prime Minister is also the owner of some of the most important private networks, lies precisely in the existence of a dangerous link between the media and political and economic powers. It is precisely for this reason that we are calling for a European legislative measure, a measure that – far from being an anti-Italian act – will help to safeguard pluralism of information, preventing concentrations and conflicts of interest. We therefore call on the Commission today to intervene as quickly as possible – as this Parliament has already requested in the past – in order to equip the European Union with common rules for safeguarding freedom of information for all European citizens.

 Mr President, Mr Barrot, Mr Billström, ladies and gentlemen, in recent days, when setting out the European asylum plan, you yourself, Mr Barrot, talked of steadfastness in the fight against illegal immigration and of humanity when receiving the victims of persecution. Translated into legal terms, this means ensuring protection and the right to asylum for those fleeing starvation, war and persecution, and preventing their expulsion to countries where their lives are in danger or they risk inhumane treatment. This is basically the opposite of what the Italian Government is doing, as demonstrated by the latest worrying refoulement of 75 immigrants from Eritrea and Somalia to Libya, which happened without at least checking whether there were any potential asylum seekers, as required by international law and as denounced yesterday by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. An agreement between Italy and Libya cannot transform that stretch of the sea into a free zone where human rights are violated. I therefore call on the Commission to take action as soon as possible to ensure that the rules of international law are restored and complied with. Furthermore, I would like to know what progress has been made in the negotiations on the bilateral agreement between the EU and Libya, already underway for a number of years. When do you expect to conclude it? Can the Council and the Commission confirm that this agreement would prevail over the Italy-Libya one? Can you explain to Parliament the key points relating to tackling illegal immigration and guaranteeing the right to asylum and the principle of non-refoulement? Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, I would like to move this oral amendment, which is purely technical, to add to paragraph 22 the words: ‘which are eligible for registration and expected to register’.

Madam President, we are having a strange debate. We are discussing two balanced reports, and then the third one, the report by Ms Ferreira, on which the EPP has chosen to follow an ideological and extremist line, sticking to the defence of an integralist version of austerity policy. The members of Berlusconi’s party in this Parliament are performing the miracle of being extremist twice over: extremist in Italy against austerity, and extremist in this Parliament in supporting austerity, but behind the ideologies there is reality, and the reality is that the rate of fiscal consolidation is not only worsening the recession and unemployment, it is not reaching its main goal: the reduction of deficit and debt.  Open your eyes, EPP colleagues in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. With your medicine, public debt is growing in Europe, and if we want to reduce it, fiscal discipline must not be blind. It must be growth-friendly; it must leave room for public investment and have a sustainable space. After the IMF, the Commission and the European Council are recognising this reality, but not the EPP in the ECON Committee, which even went so far as to delete a paragraph which simply welcomed the efforts of the Commission to pursue growth-friendly fiscal consolidation. We hope that in plenary the EPP will isolate its extremists and will return to moderation and a spirit of compromise, but if this does not happen, our ‘no’ will be loud and clear.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the current crisis is not just an economic crisis, it is also a political crisis that has to do with the contradiction between the prevalence of the national political sphere and the need for the euro to have a European government founded on European institutions that have democratic legitimacy at European level. For this reason, the resolution is of great importance. Roberto Gualtieri,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. 
– (IT) 
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I said that the crisis currently affecting the euro is not exclusively economic but is rather a political crisis based on the growing contradiction between the fact that the national dimension prevails in politics yet the policies needed to face the crisis are European. This resolution aims to bring about a reform that does not require changes to the Treaties or secondary legislation. It is an important political and institutional reform because it uses the mechanism of nominating a candidate for Commission Presidency based on the model of parliamentary regimes, although we are obviously not dealing with a direct election. Nomination is by the European parliamentary parties, recognised by and present in the Treaties. We are therefore applying the spirit and the letter of the Treaties, which state that the President of the Commission is elected by Parliament and that the appointment of the President should take into account the result of the EP elections. At the same time, we are introducing a reform allowing the citizens to participate directly in choosing the political government of Europe. This brings genuine democratic legitimacy, based on a real European political sphere for the European institutions, which is a precondition for the effectiveness of their actions of government, as well as for their democratic legitimacy. On the other hand, this reform does not, in my opinion, contradict the independence of the Commission. This is because Article 17 of the Treaty of Lisbon on the independence of the Commission refers both to the fact that the Council should propose a candidate, acting by qualified majority, and that the proposal should take account of the results of the elections to the European Parliament, clearly demonstrating, as is the case in ordinary democratic regimes, that the democratic legitimacy of a governing body does not necessarily conflict with its independence. The question here is one of democratisation and politicisation, in order to strengthen the action of the Commission and, overall, to build a more legitimate, stronger European Union that is closer to its citizens and therefore more capable of providing a response to the extraordinary crisis that we are experiencing. Indeed, with reforms such as this, the crisis might well be the opportunity to take another step on the road to a political Europe. Roberto Gualtieri,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fundamental message of this report is that a single currency cannot simply be a system of rules but requires proper economic governance, with its own resources and full democratic legitimacy. A genuine Economic and Monetary Union should therefore be based on the EU institutions, around which a true European political space should take shape. Consequently, an increased role for Parliament is not a case of empire-building but is an essential condition for giving legitimacy and strength to the governance of the euro. However, we believe that a loose federation, based on a clear definition of roles, resources and powers between the EU and the Member States, would be more effective and democratic and, at the same time, more respectful of the national parliaments’ prerogatives than the model that has taken shape in recent years. Because of this, we support the idea of stronger fiscal powers based on own resources, the embryo of a proper European Treasury, provided that this operates within the EU budget and is based on additional resources. For this reason we believe that the ex ante
 coordination of economic policies can be increased and must involve Parliament on a different basis from the contract-based model indicated in the interim report. Because of this we believe that implementing common debt management mechanisms at EU level is unavoidable. So this means reinforced governance, but also different policies. Budgetary discipline should be accompanied by countercyclical measures that can guarantee a suitable role for public investment, and the protection and revitalisation of the European social model should become an integral part of the governance of the euro, a genuine ‘fifth pillar’ based on a social pact that prioritises youth and employment. With this report, Parliament is therefore promoting an ambitious vision and a clear and realistic roadmap. Firstly, full use should be made of the broad margins for manoeuvre offered by the Treaties; in the next parliamentary term, boosted by enhanced legitimacy from Parliament and the Commission, through the mechanism by which the European parties choose the candidate to be chair, a Convention should be set up that completes the process of building proper economic and democratic governance of the euro, which is essential if the crisis is to be overcome and Europe saved. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the current difficulties facing the European steel industry demand an examination of the role of the industry in EU policies. This not only concerns the limited powers of completion, shall we say, of the industry, but the overall effect of competition, trade, cohesion and fiscal policies. Although the economic crisis has highlighted the central role of manufacturing, we must move away from a system that has in recent decades put consumption before production, services before industry. I believe that the various cases, such as the special steel manufactured at Terni and the Piombino steel plant, are food for thought in this respect. In terms of competition policy, for example, we should maintain a global, and not just a European, outlook when evaluating dominant positions. With regard to this particular question, I believe it is important that we guarantee the integrity of the Terni site during the current sale and hive-off by Outokumpu of its steel pipe business. In terms of fiscal policy, the measures contained in June’s Growth Pact must be implemented swiftly, encouraging fiscal consolidation to bolster growth and thus safeguard the role of public investment in European fiscal policy. Finally, there is the question of rules on State aid, which should be recast to encourage bridging finance aimed at securing the future of manufacturing at sites deemed to be strategic. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a single currency requires genuine economic union; not merely a system of rules and regulations but economic government based on democratic institutions and equipped with adequate resources. Parliament insists that there can be no effective and legitimate ways of achieving this aim unless developed within the Union framework based on the institutions of the Union, and that the European Parliament is the Parliament of the euro because the euro is the currency of the Union. It is right that these principles should be recalled in the European Council’s conclusions, but they need to be stated tangibly and coherently. Greater fiscal capacity is required to absorb the shocks caused by the crisis and to sustain growth and social inclusion, but clearly such fiscal capacity can and must be made a part of the EU budget and must be based on additional own resources; above all it should not distract from the need to have a joint capacity for issuing and managing debt. However, we are opposed to individual contracts: they are ineffective and risk bringing about an asymmetric transfer of sovereignty, which would accentuate the democratic deficit. Parliament proposes a different model: binding and general social and economic objectives defined in ordinary legislative procedure at EU level, with national governments and parliaments competent to decide how these might be achieved. This approach reflects a vision that is at once more ambitious and more realistic of a Europe in which stability, growth, social cohesion and democracy go hand in hand – and for this reason a fifth social pillar is essential – and of a federal transition aimed at building consensus among citizens on the basis of a clear road map. This would involve: 1) correcting a policy based on austerity and the inter-governmental method with swift Decisions that take maximum advantage of the possibilities offered by the Treaties and prioritise growth and employment; 2) rendering the upcoming European elections genuine elections for the government of the EU. Finally, a convention should be called to complete the building of real democratic government for Europe and its currency. Parliament calls on you to act, and Parliament will exercise all of its powers. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with Mr Brok’s statements and with his report, which see progress in the development of the European External Action Service. This, together with your personal action, is starting to give shape and identity to the EU’s common foreign and security policy and external action, along the lines of a global multilateral approach based on plural instruments, which is the only possible way to face the challenges of the world today. In this framework, I believe that the balanced approach you have taken on delicate issues such as those of Syria and Iran, based on a correct awareness of the delicate network of interdependence and on the contradiction between state and national religion that characterises the Middle East, is commendable. That said, there is clearly a long way to go towards a better identification of the priorities, which are to strengthen the unity of intent of the Member States, strengthen European defence and develop the parliamentary dimension of the common foreign and security policy, both in terms of parliamentary control of the spirit and the letter of Article 36, and of strengthening the potential of parliamentary diplomacy. I believe that in these areas, too, we can work together, not least in preparation for the review of the decision establishing the External Action Service, towards which we will work constructively.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the ‘two-pack’ shows that there is a legal basis for EU governance of the euro area, as this Chamber had called for during the revision of Article 136. What we now have to assess is whether these two regulations seem to be capable of dealing with the deterioration of the crisis and the potential of their legal basis. Here, the answer is clear: the Commission’s proposal seems to belong to another epoch. As Commissioner Rehn has said, the Commission proposes an addition to the ‘six-pack’ without taking into account the obvious limits of austerity policies and economic governance that are solely focused on introducing rigid constraints and without attributing any real financial decision-making powers to the EU. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has introduced significant improvements to the Commission’s proposal, especially visible in the report by Ms Ferreira, first and foremost, in the article on the debt redemption fund. However, there remain several limitations. I am struck by the deafness of rapporteur Mr Gauzès who, faced with the proposal to involve Parliament in activating the enhanced surveillance procedure, introduces a procedure similar to that used for delegated acts. Our group, however, has responsibly decided to focus on one point, on which, however, there still appears to be some confusion. Amendment 82 is not a weakening of the Stability and Growth Pact, it is not a classic ‘golden rule’ clause. Quite the opposite: it is a tool to defend the Stability and Growth Pact, to make it effective and to ensure compliance, as well as giving a greater role to the Commission. The amendment is based on the concept of sustainable discipline and gives the Commission the task of prioritising investments for growth and employment when defining medium-term objectives and assessing Member State budgets. For this reason, I call upon fellow Members in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) to read the amendment, to reflect and to prevent this Parliament from appearing to be cut off from a situation that is evolving throughout Europe as well as in the Council. Roberto Gualtieri,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Martin’s report paves the way to the full implementation of the Treaties’ provision governing the right of inquiry, essential for carrying out one of Parliament’s fundamental duties: political control. The Treaty of Lisbon introduced a special legislative procedure, and we therefore hope that during negotiations, both the institutions – Council and Commission – will uphold the spirit of this rule which explicitly entrusts the power of initiative and regulatory power to Parliament, and limits the role of the Council and Commission to a mere expression of consent. Mr Martin’s report draws on the previous experiences of temporary committees of inquiry which have shown the limitations of this instrument, and proposes significant innovations. Informal talks with the Danish Presidency and with the Commission have resulted in satisfactory compromise proposals which meet some of the requests of the Member States and the Commission, but which do not limit Parliament’s right to hold to account EU and national institutions for the correct implementation of EU legislation, and to identify possible instances of maladministration. Certain wording could be better clarified, but it is vital not to compromise on one point: the committees of inquiry must have access to documents and persons. This has nothing to do with judicial duties but, precisely, it concerns the full implementation of the political right clearly enshrined in the Treaties: the right of political control. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, now the figures more than the theories clearly demonstrate that not only has the austerity strategy failed to produce growth and employment, but that it does not even provide stability within the European Union, which was Ms Merkel’s main goal, given that public accounts are getting worse, not better. We therefore need a change, and although the actions on which a consensus seems to be emerging are certainly positive, they are still insufficient. The project bonds pilot project is an important precedent, but its macro-economic impact is just a drop in the ocean. Even strengthening the European Investment Bank, which has greater potential, is not decisive, whilst better spending of Structural Funds is unlikely to have much of an effect since we currently lack even the resources to pay for projects already begun. Two essential elements for emerging from the crisis are missing. The first is a reformulation of the Stability Pact, which would also affect the fiscal compact without it needing to be amended, to separate a portion of investments from calculation of the structural deficit, giving the Commission a specific role in establishing them and activating this separation in recessive phases of the cycle. The second is joint management of a portion of the public debt based on the model of the proposed debt redemption fund. These two elements must go hand in hand and form a ‘growth and stability pack’ which must be EU-wide in order to be effective: so a ‘pack’ and not a ‘compact’. For this we need to make the most of the ‘two-pack’ discussion in order to act quickly and effectively on EU legislation. I believe that the Commission should play a clearly defined role in this process and stop defending an austerity policy now acknowledged by everyone as disastrous. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I join in thanking the Commission and the Presidency of the Council, but this debate is especially timely and important because we are facing two unacceptable violations of the letter and the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon. The violation of the letter – as many speakers have pointed out – is the European Union’s boycott on acceding to the European Convention on Human Rights, which is clearly set out in the Treaty of Lisbon and is a essential complement to the adoption of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The violation of the Treaty’s spirit, meanwhile, relates to the project currently under discussion in Brighton to amend the Convention, reducing citizens’ opportunities to appeal to an unacceptable extent. These are truly paradoxical proposals, not only because Protocol 14 has already significantly reformed the Court’s procedures, but also because, in more general terms, solving the problem of too many pending cases by reducing opportunities to appeal is like combating an epidemic by closing hospitals. The problem is not too many appeals, it is too many violations of rights in Europe and that is what governments should be worrying about. Parliament is therefore very concerned and highly vigilant. We think a reaction that prevents the kind of reforms under discussion in Brighton is of the utmost importance. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have to say that I was disappointed with Mr Barroso’s speech. As many have said – the last of whom was Mr Domenici – a fact evident to all, with the clear exception of the European institutions, has not been acknowledged. That is that we are falling from a recession into the risk of a depression, and in these circumstances, compliance with the objectives of the ‘six-pack’ and the fiscal compact is quite simply impossible. There is only one solution for tackling this recessionary and depressive downward spiral and that is to revitalise demand through investment. The solutions and answers that Mr Barroso proposed cannot work by themselves. Investment is needed, and as it is not realistic to make a substantial increase in the European budget at the moment – although we have been asking for it – public investment is needed, and therefore a reform of the ‘six-pack’ that introduces the golden rule on a group of public investments, which need to be separated from the calculation of the structural deficit. This is what Europe needs today. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the satisfaction of having escaped danger is understandable, but it should not make us forget the mistakes and the delays of recent years, not to mention the decisive role played by the European Central Bank (ECB) and by the new Italian Government. Most importantly, our satisfaction should not stop us facing up to the enormous structural problem that the policies of recent months have not resolved. The strategy of salary deflation brought in by austerity policies as an alternative to devaluation is not economically or socially sustainable, nor is it universally accepted in political terms. We should leave the caricatures behind. Nobody here is proposing deficit spending. We do think, however, that it is possible to combine national fiscal responsibility with a revitalisation of investment and demand; it is possible with a more even distribution of wealth; it is possible if we confront macro-economic imbalances; it is possible through large-scale EU investment; it is possible if we set up shared management of debts through a debt redemption fund. The Community method offers the instruments for realising these objectives, but we need a change in political direction which, between the elections in France and the European elections of 2014, will start a new cycle and see the consolidation of a different strategy and of truly European economic governance. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, by taking part in a critical but constructive capacity in the negotiations for the fiscal compact, this Parliament has reached an important point of unity. Greater budgetary responsibility at national level is necessary but insufficient, and without concrete steps towards growth and solidarity, it could lead to an unsustainable downward spiral towards recession. There is no evidence of Parliament’s approach, which is well thought-out and balanced, in the preparatory documents of the European Council. For the Council and the Commission, the word ‘growth’ seems to mean fiscal consolidation and salary reductions. It is true that there are positive developments taking place on the internal market, but they are not enough. Growth requires a robust internal driver, which involves a two-pronged objective: to reinforce internal demand in countries with a surplus and to promote an extraordinary investment plan financed by project bonds. However, the Commission only interprets the macro-economic imbalances in one direction – ignoring the logic of the Ferreira rule – and there is no trace of project bonds and shared investments in the European Council documents, except for a vacuous game in which the card picked is to use the existing resources of the Structural Funds, a bit like the way Mussolini used to move his tanks around in the Second World War to make it seem as if he had a bigger army than he actually had. It is therefore clear that this ruling class has had its day, and only a major political sea change can save Europe from disaster. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, commenting on the rather forgettable conclusions of the summit on 9 December, we said that this Parliament would watch and work to limit the damage of that unfortunate choice. This has been the case. Parliament’s united commitment in the difficult negotiations that have taken place has definitely helped to prevent even worse developments. There was a real risk that the new treaty would seriously undermine the law and the common European institutions, by establishing standards, mechanisms and procedures external to the Union and in contradiction with its laws. That is no longer the case. Parliament, the Commission and the President of the European Council have averted this danger. Now the treaty will have to be implemented through EU legislation. The parameters for defining deficit and debt levels have been substantially, although not completely, brought back into the context of the current regulatory framework, and the dreadful possibility of having a new parliamentary institution has been averted. But even though we have significantly limited the damage, the fiscal compact is not an adequate response to the crisis. There are still unacceptable and unwise aspects, such as the limitations on the presence of Parliament at Euro summits. From a legal perspective, the Court’s power to impose sanctions seems highly dubious. Only if the proposals that Parliament put forward with one voice in its resolution – financial transactions tax, project bonds, stability bonds – are finally adopted, can Europe overcome a crisis that unidirectional fiscal discipline threatens to aggravate.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Brok reminded us, this Parliament has adopted a critical approach to the new international agreement, which is reflected in the resolution we are about to approve. We have given the reasons for our criticism on several occasions. At an institutional level we believe that the tools provided by the treaties would have made it possible to avoid the damage of an intergovernmental agreement and to strengthen governance and budgetary discipline in the euro area whilst remaining within the legal framework of the EU. It is a paradox that even before the ink on the ‘six-pack’ has dried, some Member States already want to amend it by intergovernmental means, introducing some elements that they had not asked for before, indeed in some cases that they had actually opposed. This is a step backwards and not forwards along the road to fiscal union. On a political level we believe the economic slant of this agreement is dangerously unilateral, because without concrete measures to strengthen growth and solidarity the EU will not emerge from the crisis and the very objective of stability will not be achieved. We nevertheless felt that we had a duty to become active and constructively involved in limiting the damage to the edifice of the EU, defending the primacy of the Community method and Parliament’s prerogatives, and emphasising the necessity and urgency of shared management of sovereign debt. It is extremely significant from a political point of view that the four pro-European groups have defined a shared platform of amendments along these lines. Now we are waiting for the fourth draft of the agreement. It is clear that if not even the smallest points, on which there was agreement, are faithfully carried over into the text, Parliament will have recourse to all the tools at its disposal in order to oppose the agreement. However it is also clear that only a significant correction in approach, on an institutional and economic level, will be able to eliminate the reasons for our criticism and our determination to build a real European economic government based on the Community method and focusing on stability, growth and solidarity.

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, the European Union is a Community based on law, and therefore form cannot be separated from substance: form is substance! That means that using an intergovernmental treaty as the basis for a fiscal compact is legally and technically quite a complex operation, or indeed an impossible one in practice. The comparison with Schengen and Prüm is not valid, because those areas were not governed by the Treaties. The fact is that we have reached this point because the premise was wrong; in other words, the Treaties could and should have been overhauled. We now have to find a way out, avoid the risk of renationalising Union competences, preserve the EU’s legal system, avoid duplications and, of course, correct an economic policy that is both wrong and inadequate. This House will watch carefully, ready to play its part in sorting out this incredible mess, by putting the process started at the European Council back on the rails of EU law, which are the only possible foundations on which a true fiscal union can be built.

Mr President, since Ms Koppa has already stated why the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament supports the Lisek report, I would like to focus on the Council’s conclusions, which, to my mind, represent a small but nonetheless significant step forwards. Of course, Parliament expected more, above all, in terms of planning and conduct capability, but the serious risk of a widespread abandonment of the common security and defence policy (CSDP) has been avoided, and for this I would like to thank the High Representative for her work on this front. To return to the subject of new operations, after the uninspiring outcomes of the European Union Force (EUFOR) in Libya, the Horn of Africa, Sudan and the Sahel, we expect to see real results and we are ready to offer our political and financial support. Whilst we already have pooling and sharing projects to be implemented, in terms of planning and conduct capability, the search for unanimity has presented limits, but the will to consider activating an operations centre as only a first step also emerges from the Council’s conclusions. It is important now that we do not lose momentum and instead take further steps forward, because otherwise no Member State will be able to avoid a future of global irrelevance.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation is coming to a head, and it is time to act with the speed and effectiveness that has so far been lacking. Relying on the miraculous effect of a Treaty reform announcement would be pointless and counterproductive. Embarking on the risky road towards an intergovernmental treaty would have a quite devastating effect on the markets. Reforming the Treaties takes too long; an intergovernmental agreement will not result in any kind of fiscal union. The truth is that the problem facing the EU today is a political problem, not an institutional one. It is possible, under the current Treaty, to strengthen economic convergence, enhance fiscal discipline, maintain stability in the euro area and boost growth. The two new proposals for regulations tabled by the Commission demonstrate this, and with that legal basis, Article 136, it is possible to go even further, including with regard to the role of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The flexibility clause would make it possible to increase the powers of the euro area, and Article 122(2) is an appropriate basis for that extraordinary Eurobond-based debt redemption fund proposed by the German Council of Economic Experts. In short, one has the feeling that Treaty reform is being sought so as to avoid codecision, so as to have less rather than more Europe. Hence there are no excuses: immediate action must be taken and the foundations laid for the full creation, with the citizens’ consent, of a fiscal union based on stability, growth, solidarity and democracy, one that ultimately serves as the basis for that reform of the Treaties, which is too important a goal to be compromised by a clumsy, ill-timed reform that would be legally unnecessary, economically insignificant and politically harmful today. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this excellent report can make a very important contribution to the debate under way on economic governance and on the possible reform of the Treaties, because it highlights very successfully the extremely close and obvious connection between the effectiveness of economic governance and the degree of its democratic legitimacy, thereby also emphasising, I wish to say, the absurdity of the idea of a limited Treaty reform. Because, although the objectives that such a limited reform seemingly sets could easily be achieved, as we have already argued, not with a reform but by applying the Treaty, if instead we turn the guidelines and recommendations made on the basis of Articles 121(2) and 148(4) into decisions with legal standing, we are stepping beyond the confines of a limited reform and moving towards a full-blown federal-style fiscal union that cannot be created without full democratic legitimacy and hence without a full codecision role for the European Parliament. In short, this reform, if limited, is useless; if it grants new and unconditional powers in relation to economic policy then it certainly cannot be limited. Therefore, a completely different approach must be adopted; Parliament must be involved straight away in defining the guidelines and recommendations, as the report proposes. This is a prerequisite for subsequently making those guidelines binding in nature. Adopting a completely different approach, following the Community method and striving for greater democratic legitimacy: that is the line that the Berès report convincingly proposes to us.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all allow me to offer my sincerest congratulations to Mario Monti for his good work; his nomination to guide the Italian Government is fantastic news not only for Italy but also for Europe. I believe that from this debate strong messages from all political groups will emerge with clarity, and I hope these will be listened to attentively. The first message is that without instruments for growth and development, and with only an austere approach to fiscal matters, the idea of a stable Union is a chimera. The second is that the government of peers, this peer pressure of which President Van Rompuy has also spoken, cannot function. We need provisions that have a legal basis, and we need institutions legitimated democratically. This is the only way to produce a true European economic government. In all this, to think that reforming three paragraphs of Articles 121 and 126 as decided in Berlin should be a panacea is an illusion not only because of the difficulties and risks of the revision itself but also because, of these three amendments, the first is useless, the second is irrelevant and the third is impossible. Thus, our position is clear. Firstly, before changing the Treaty of Lisbon, apply it and read it, and you will discover that Articles 136 and 352 are founded on strong legal grounds for strong governance of the euro area based on communitarian methods. Secondly, it is obvious that this Parliament is not opposed in principle to strengthening the EU’s jurisdiction by reforming the Treaty, but this mandate can be limited and should be well-balanced, and this Parliament will not accept a reform which, alongside stability, does not create a Union of solidarity, growth and democracy.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, cooperation between the European Union and the United States is certainly going to play an increasingly important role in transatlantic relations. Dialogue with the European Parliament has a crucial and growing part to play in this cooperation, which is something our friends across the Atlantic have grasped perfectly well and often better than many national governments and parliaments. This dialogue is first and foremost legislative in nature, but there is also political and strategic dialogue on major economic and foreign policy issues, areas in which this House intends to strengthen its actions and make the most of its prerogatives. One of the issues that I would like to highlight is a matter of great importance which has been positively taken up in the joint resolution. I am referring to the Middle East question. We are committed to supporting the efforts by the High Representative and the Quartet to resume the negotiations between the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli Government, because we all know that if the parties do not negotiate there will be no peace and no two-state solution. At the same time, however, we believe that recognising the Palestinians’ aspirations to be represented in the United Nations as a state does not negate the need for the talks but instead may strengthen them. We therefore call on the Member States and the United States to come up with pragmatic measures to achieve this recognition. In the context of the budget procedure, we are committed to increasing EU economic support for the Palestinian Authority and believe that the Unesco boycott is a misguided and counterproductive reaction.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Gahler has just explained, cluster munitions are terrible, fiendish instruments of death for the civilian population. Banning them is therefore a battle for civilisation to which this House has been committed for some time. The entry into force of the Oslo Convention was a major success, but now, little more than a year later, we are faced with a dangerous attempt to undermine its outcomes through an additional protocol to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons – the review of which is currently being negotiated in Geneva – which would again allow the use of cluster munitions. This is a protocol that must not and cannot be signed by countries that have already signed up to the Oslo Convention, because, as you said yourself, Commissioner, it is clearly incompatible with the Convention and would open up a dangerous loophole, not least for those other countries that want to continue to produce, stockpile and use these types of munitions. Moreover, it would create a very serious precedent and would be a blow to international law. The argument by those who say that the protocol would in any case improve the situation, because it would be signed by countries that have not signed the Oslo Convention, sounds decidedly specious to us, and on this point we would perhaps have liked to hear a rather clearer and less equivocal statement from Ms Ashton’s representative. Protocol VI would undermine the Convention because it would allow for the use of munitions produced after 1980, which form the great majority of them; it foresees a long transition period; it would allow for the use of types of cluster bomb that are extremely dangerous to civilians; and it would not set out any clear obligation to destroy individual countries’ stockpiles. It is therefore crucial that all the Member States do not support the entry into force of this protocol and that the High Representative commits herself to ensuring that all the countries in the Union adopt a clear, united position in favour of a definitive ban on cluster munitions. The joint resolution that we are about to adopt on this issue is an important political signal, and we are certain that it will be adopted in its entirety by a large majority.

 One of the causes of the current economic and financial crisis is the lack of adequate regulation of financial markets. Through the adoption of the report by Mr Canfin and the first-reading agreement between Parliament and the Council, the EU has taken an important step forwards by bringing in new rules on credit default swaps and short selling. Thanks to the work of Parliament, the slightly timid approach taken by the Council has been corrected in a number of fundamental ways. Indeed, we have brought in a ban on naked short selling – that is, selling securities that you do not actually own – which includes a ban on buying credit default swaps unless you also own the relevant government bonds. Moreover, the information and transparency obligations imposed on operators will allow national supervisory authorities to keep up to date with any pressure on a security, thereby effectively preventing risk. Parliament can therefore only express its satisfaction about the adoption of this regulation: it may be just an initial step and a simple part of a more general project to regulate the financial markets, but this regulation represents significant progress and a robust contribution to better-functioning financial markets, particularly in terms of sovereign debts.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the most recurrent words in these conclusions are ‘urge’ and ‘commitment’, including Mr Berlusconi’s commitment to tackle the North-South divide in four months. It is clear, then, that exhortations and commitments do not add up to any sort of common economic policy; nor do institutions that do not exist, such as Eurosummit, for example. The proposed regulations based on Article 136, announced by Mr Barroso, show that the institutions that do actually exist can, instead of exhortations, make laws. We say: ‘make them; make these laws now’. We would add, furthermore, that we shall not allow any treaty reforms unless all the possibilities of the existing treaty have been exhausted. We shall not accept a limited mandate that has not been devised in part by Parliament and does not include codecision on economic policy and shared responsibility for Eurobonds, because without democracy, growth and solidarity, a stable European Union remains merely a chimera.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Heading 4 is structurally underfunded with respect to the EU’s commitments and strategic interests. This has forced us to make painful choices to protect our priorities and particularly resources for Palestine, which are clearly necessary, especially in the light of the decisions taken by the United States Congress. That is what is behind the cuts to the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) budget, which are not generic, linear cuts but policy-based cuts on specific issues, which do not therefore affect other operations. First of all, Afghanistan: this is a painful cut, but at the same time we must be aware that, despite the good results of our mission, the EU is a bit-part player on this issue, subordinate to the strategies of others which, moreover, are not seeing great success. In terms of emergency measures, the issue of special representatives is coming to the fore, so this is a logical cut to make. In terms of preparatory measures, the Council rejects Article 51(5)(c) of the Financial Regulation, which gives Parliament a limited role in these measures, in line with the Madrid agreement. Hence, this cut is inevitable. It is not Parliament that has chosen this path of austerity: the Council can hardly be taken aback by its consequences. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, even though it is too early for a conclusive assessment, it is difficult to escape the impression that this Semester is producing weak coordination and inadequate democratic legitimacy. The two things are linked because without full democratic legitimacy, the Semester runs the risk of being more a bureaucratic exercise than a coordination of substance. This limitation certainly relates to the crucial issue of the Union’s competences and Parliament’s prerogatives, which should lie at the very heart of any Treaty reform, which would otherwise be pointless or harmful. This limitation also highlights a problem of effective political will to make immediate use of all the instruments offered by the Treaty in order to strengthen coordination and give Parliament a greater role. Then there is a problem of content. A reading of the Council’s recommendations shows an obvious limitation in the line of economic politics that inspired them: deficit reduction and development of the internal market are necessary but not sufficient conditions for tackling the crisis, and unless there is a major investment plan, they are liable to trigger a vicious circle that may bring us to collapse. The political line of the Semester therefore needs to be the subject of a genuine political debate, which can only take place in the context of the discussions between Parliament and the Council.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, President Barroso said some important things today, but several points need to be clarified. I would like to highlight three of them. First, euro area fiscal union. At last, someone has noticed the existence of Article 136; however, the President of the Commission spoke of a Commission-Council procedure. In fact, Article 136 also contemplates the possibility of regulations. It is therefore possible that, under Article 136, 17 Member States will vote in the Council and 27 in Parliament. We would like to know whether – as Parliament has requested – the Commission intends to propose regulations with the ordinary legislative procedure pursuant to Article 136 for the conditionality of the stability mechanism. Secondly, the stability mechanisms themselves. The 21 July agreement is fine, the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) is fine, but the truth is that the quota method does not work. You must tell us if you think that the EFSM, which still exists, can continue to operate, especially after the ruling from the German Court, and if therefore it is possible to think in terms of the communitisation of the stability mechanism. Thirdly, the Secretary General of the German Christian Democratic Union (CDU) today said that he would like to move on from monetary union to stability union. Without growth, development and employment, there can be no stability. You should tell us if the Commission agrees with this. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 In voting against the Wortmann-Kool report, and in fact against the entire ‘governance package’, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is not saying ‘no’ to more robust and stringent European rules on the fiscal policies of the Member States, but is expressing its opposition to a specific line of economic policy: a line focused solely on budgetary discipline, and therefore an inadequate response to the current serious economic and financial crisis. As a condition of its support for the package, the S&amp;D Group had requested the introduction of a golden rule to ‘save’ productive investment from swingeing cuts. The alliance between the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Euro-sceptic conservatives of the European Conservatives and Reformists Group, backed by the Council, has made it inevitable that we would vote against by rejecting this potential compromise, which opposes a line that is destined to exacerbate the sovereign debt crisis and to hit both social cohesion and growth prospects in Europe hard.

Despite the measures taken by the individual Member States, the number of victims of road-traffic accidents in Europe is still too high. By approving the report by Mr Koch – which contains more than 100 suggestions on how to ensure effective road safety – Parliament is adopting a resolution in response to the Commission communication of 2010, which appeals to this House to put forward an even more ambitious action programme. We shall need to improve the deployment of road signs, as well as infrastructure and vehicle safety and information exchange. Above all, however, we shall need to move towards harmonising legislation on the subject, for example, by reducing the speed limit in residential areas to 30 km/h and banning new drivers and those driving with passengers from drinking alcohol. This is the only way that it will be possible to halve the number of victims and reduce the number of injuries by 2020. We therefore expect the Commission to produce a new plan that follows Parliament’s suggestions by the end of the year. Road safety must be a priority for Europe. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

Mr President, would you not agree that the treaties already allow for closer integration in the euro area and that therefore it is not necessary, and indeed would be counter-productive, to achieve it outside the EU institutions, as the current governments of France and Germany seem to be aiming for? In particular, would you not agree that Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union makes it possible to adopt legislative measures for the euro area within the scope of the economic policy competences given to the EU by the treaties? Secondly, would you not agree that Article 352 makes it possible to strengthen the powers of the existing institutions in order to reach the objectives set out by the treaties? Lastly, is it not the case that Protocol No 14 does not forbid the Eurogroup Heads of State or Government from meeting without having to create another institution, and therefore that it would be unreasonable for the President of another institution – the European Council – to preside over this expanded Eurogroup? Therefore, would you not agree that achieving euro area integration within or outside the treaties is a problem of political will and not of legal barriers? Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have reached a crucial moment in the decade-long aspiration of the Palestinian people to have a state of their own and also in the rightful aspiration of the people of Israel to live in safety. This is because the latter is so intimately connected with the former, because there can be no safety without peace and there can be no peace without a democratic Palestinian state that is respectful of international law, as outlined by Mr Abbas to the United Nations. The acceptance of the timeline drawn up by the Quartet is a victory for the European Union and one which we must salute you for, Baroness Ashton, even though some countries did try to steal the European Union’s limelight. However, the news of new settlements warns us that the path ahead will be strewn with difficulties. That is why it is important to increase the pressure on the Israeli Government and clearly express the EU’s support – despite the absence of absolute unanimity – for a possible vote in the UN General Assembly on awarding the status of non-Member State. This House must be united in upholding and increasing this pressure, including putting aside differences of opinion on full membership, giving its unanimous backing through its resolution on the legitimate aspiration of the Palestinian people to be represented as a state at the United Nations.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, after 42 years of dictatorship and six months of conflict Libya is at a turning-point in its history that could open the way to a future of democracy, peace and development. This future is in the hands of the Libyans and no one can expect to impose choices and ready-made solutions on them, but at the same time it is clear that the European Union has a great responsibility, a decisive role to play in supporting the process of stabilisation and transition to democracy in the country. After being marginalised by the divisions among its members in the early stages of the conflict, a conflict the wise management of which can be attributed to NATO, the EU has gradually begun to demonstrate the capacity for action that we all value and which has produced concrete results, with the opening of the office in Benghazi, missions in Tripoli, which we would like to be more coordinated, external service action and ECHO (Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection). This activism must now find its place in the context of a strong and credible political strategy capable of defining a multilateral framework that is both robust and effective, and of ensuring a true unity of purpose within the international community, preventing overlapping and competition and guaranteeing real support for the Libyan transition. The transition will inevitably be long and complex, and will have to focus on national reconciliation while preventing the creation of new divisions within the country. At the same time it will have to ensure progress and democracy, and guarantee the involvement of civil society and the creation of new ruling classes. During this transition the return to normality and restoration of public order means difficult problems such as border control, rebuilding the judicial system and the security forces, and controlling the widespread distribution of weapons, must be addressed as a matter of urgency, while at the same time the transition has to be based on a robust and credible road map that is both democratic and representative. All this requires dialogue, commitment, leadership skills, as well as intensive planning and work to identify resources. It is therefore an important test for the EU, for the European External Action Service, and for its comprehensive approach, and the European Parliament is ready to play its part and to support this commitment.

 Parliament’s vote on the report by Mr Glante opens the way to the development of a European satellite navigation system. The establishment within the Galileo programme of a public regulated service (PRS) – an encrypted, maximum security network to be used by operators authorised by governments, such as the police or the armed forces – will provide an extremely useful service for European citizens by helping to ensure that security forces can respond to crises or emergencies without delay. Other than providing benefits for citizens, the Galileo programme also represents an opportunity for European industry in the new technologies markets by helping to create high-level jobs in the satellite navigation sector. Parliament now awaits the position of the Council, in order to make the PRS service available and operative from 2014 onwards. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 By adopting this own-initiative report, Parliament is proving its commitment to increasing female employment in such a highly significant sector for the economy as entrepreneurship. If it is true that women traditionally encounter greater obstacles than men in entering the labour market, then this is particularly the case in the business sector. It is therefore important to incentivise female entrepreneurship through targeted actions. This can be achieved, in particular, through easier access to credit – in which case the European Microfinance Instrument Progress can be of major help – or by subsidising exchange initiatives, similar to an Erasmus scheme for young female entrepreneurs, which could encourage women to embark on such a professional vocation. The European Union must therefore strive to promote the presence of women in small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe, removing the economic and obstacles that they encounter.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament believes that the construction of a true European political space is a prerequisite for progressing towards a political Europe that can rise to this century’s huge challenges in a strong, determined and appropriate way. The Treaty of Lisbon represents a significant step forward in this respect, especially when it comes to the principle already mentioned by the rapporteur, Mr Duff, which clarifies that the European Parliament directly represents European citizens at EU level. Nevertheless, despite this and other important innovations in the Treaty of Lisbon, and despite the fact that everyday life clearly shows us that a political Europe is necessary, the construction of a true European political space is still a long way off. Debate in our Member States is too focused on national issues, too many of the discussions among political parties are carried out from an exclusively national perspective, and the European elections themselves often appear to the citizens as an extension of national political debate, which is also one of the reasons for the overly low turnout. We believe that a reform of European electoral law that strengthens our common principles can contribute towards this Europeanisation of European political debate. Clearly, it is not the only requirement, but it can help. Therefore, despite being aware of the numerous problems associated with this proposal, the S&amp;D Group supported the proposal for a transnational list in committee. At the same time we supported the request for a referral back to committee, because we realise that broad consensus is needed on this proposal. However, we also believe that we must proceed with determination towards a reform of the European electoral system that strengthens the transnational nature of these elections.

 By adopting the Sommer report, Parliament is showing that it is mindful of the transparency of information about the nutritional value and the provenance of foodstuffs, in line with the requirements of European consumers for greater safety in the products they buy. By confirming the agreement at second reading with the Council, Parliament is introducing the obligation to provide detailed information about the composition and energy value of foodstuffs, as well as extending origin labelling to fresh swine, sheep, goat and poultry meat. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has played a dynamic role in the negotiations, convincing the Council and Commission to consider the subsequent adoption of rules on origin for meat used in packaged foods, as well as on the effects of using hydrogenated fats, which, from today, are subject to legislation. The adopted text signals recognition of the Italian approach, which has already previously shown how to protect and promote Italian and European excellence, and it is therefore a source of satisfaction both for Italy and for operators in the sector. However, although the step taken is important, our commitment to European citizens being able to make ever more independent and informed choices about the products they put on their tables will go on. Roberto Gualtieri,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution that we are preparing to vote on is important and timely because it sets out and unequivocally clarifies the principles that must guide the action of Parliament and its representatives in conducting these difficult negotiations with national parliaments. First and foremost, these principles derive from Treaties that, by getting rid of the pillar structure, on the one hand, and assigning Parliament the role of representing citizens directly at EU level, on the other, make the European Parliament a vital source of democratic legitimacy for the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) and the common security and defence policy (CSDP) as EU policies This double innovation results, as we know, in increased functions and responsibilities, from the vote to approve the High Representative, to the referral powers established by Article 36, to the budget powers that, we must remember, make the European Parliament the budgetary authority for the exceptionally large increase in CSDP missions which, as we are aware, are civil missions. However, the reasons that lead us to take, with determination and readiness for dialogue, the road towards genuine agreement with national parliaments are also political and pragmatic. Interparliamentary cooperation is appropriate and necessary to strengthen support for the CFSP and the CSDP and to increase consistency between them and the choices made by Member States at national level. It is precisely for this reason that this cooperation should represent, in a balanced way, the institutions that express Europe’s democratic legitimacy at a different level, and an imbalance that excessively compromises Parliament’s power would be incongruous with the mission to Europeanise the debate on foreign security and defence policy in Europe, which is at the root of the idea of holding a conference. That is why it is good for tomorrow’s vote to clarify that the readiness for debate is accompanied by the utmost commitment to certain principles, starting with the principle that, as Article 9 of the first protocol clearly states, no regular form of interparliamentary cooperation can be established without Parliament’s consent.

 The single European emergency number 112 is a service that aims to ensure rapid access, free of charge, to emergency services for everyone throughout Europe, thus markedly simplifying access to the service, especially for people who are abroad. Adoption of the Rapti report is Parliament’s response to Europeans’ scant knowledge and awareness of the potential of this service. This lack of information is certainly worrying. Among the aims of the European Parliament resolution is in fact to carry out an effective information and awareness-raising campaign in key locations such as doctors’ surgeries, pharmacies, schools, airports and stations, as well as to call for improvements in the quality, efficiency and accessibility of the single service, thus ensuring easy access even for people with disabilities and vulnerable individuals. By providing the Commission with clear guidelines on how to improve use of the universal service, we have taken a step forwards in protecting people who live and travel in the Union, with particular attention to social and geographical inclusion.

 The vote on the Langen report on over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives further reinforces Parliament’s priority of regulating the financial markets and fighting speculation, the main factor in market instability at a time of crisis. Parliament has defined its position at first reading on the proposal for a regulation in line with what has already been suggested both by the European Commission and by the G20 mandate, which calls for a strengthening of the system within which OTC derivatives work, in order to provide more transparency and greater risk management. It is necessary, in fact, to provide the relevant European and national authorities with all the tools they need to supervise and control the derivatives market, including more information on the nature of derivative transactions and on the contracts entered into by counterparties. We now expect the Council to get over the splits between Member States and offer the opening needed in this area, so that the wholesale reform of European financial markets can come to fruition.

 Urban areas, which are home to 73% of Europe’s population and generate around 80% of the GDP, are the Union’s major centres of innovation, culture and growth. However, the urban dimension has up until now received insufficient recognition. For this reason it is important that Parliament should propose to enhance the European Urban Agenda within the framework of EU policies, reinforcing the contribution of cohesion policy to urban development and encouraging greater involvement on the part of local political stakeholders. It is necessary to direct the urban dimension of political cohesion towards supporting the development of basic physical infrastructure, the modernisation of economic, social and environmental characteristics of cities, urban regeneration and the promotion of social innovation in disadvantaged neighbourhoods. All this requires direct participation on the part of local authorities and civil society, and the involvement of cities’ political representatives in strategic planning and in defining and negotiating partnership contracts. Within this framework the call for the Commission to promote the creation of urban administrators and to establish an Erasmus for local and regional elected representatives is of significance. Let us monitor closely the Commission’s commitment to welcoming the important proposals of this report, in the belief that a full appreciation of the central role of the urban dimension in EU politics constitutes an indispensable condition for its success.

 Europe needs stronger and more Community-based economic governance. However, the package of measures being voted on today wrongly reflects the tendency of the current centre-right majority to view governance as a mere austerity exercise, by strengthening the preventive and corrective dimension of the Stability and Growth Pact without outlining mechanisms and instruments for supporting investment and development. One cannot accept the reverse majority rule and tougher parameters and sanctions without a golden rule to protect Member States’ investments and without Eurobonds to fund European investments and, at the same time, to guarantee sovereign debt. This is not a good enough formula for tackling the crisis and it is destined to make it worse. That is why we will vote against this and the other reports on fiscal surveillance. Moreover, we will fight to take European economic policy in a different direction and, at the same time, to strengthen the Community method and the EU’s instruments and resources.

 The European Parliament has brought an end to the long legislative procedure on the Consumer Rights Directive by adopting the Schwab report, which is a satisfactory compromise with the Council and the Commission. Two important steps have thus been taken. On the one hand, we have adopted a single legislative instrument on consumer rights, which provides harmonisation and takes over from the four previous directives in this area. On the other hand, we have laid down detailed rules for buying and selling online, in order to promote cross-border trade and to guarantee transparency for both businesses and consumers. The new directive lays down aspects that are intended to give greater protection to the European consumer, such as the information to be contained in sale contracts, delivery times, the right of withdrawal, and the right to repair or replacement of a defective product, as well as the cases in which the risk is transferred from the vendor to the consumer. Although yet more detailed rules may be laid down in future, the text that has been adopted represents a positive compromise in the harmonisation of existing regulations, guaranteeing secure purchases and putting a definitive end to typical sharp practices that hide behind electronic purchasing.

 The tragic earthquake in Japan is an incentive for Europe to look more deeply at the consequences of nuclear technology use and its impact on the safety of European citizens. In adopting the report on the proposal for a directive on the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste, Parliament is showing that it is particularly sensitive to this issue and demonstrating a clear desire to find common, definitive solutions to the storage of nuclear waste in Europe. By calling for common minimum standards for all the Member States, we are encouraging their governments to invest in new technologies, with a view to obtaining rapid, concrete results in relation to the disposal of this extremely hazardous waste. I therefore welcome two amendments tabled by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament calling for Parliament and the Council to co-decide on matters relating to nuclear energy use and endorsing the fundamental ban on waste exports to third countries, a ban which demonstrates Parliament’s determination to shoulder its responsibilities. Parliament’s vote is therefore a further step towards the gradual abandonment of nuclear energy, in favour of sustainable energy solutions that are safe for the public. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 The Dess report adopted by this House is entirely consistent with the guidelines already set by the European Commission. It calls for the common agricultural policy for 2014-2020 to be reviewed in order to meet the challenges of environmental sustainability, job creation and guaranteed high-quality, safe food. In adopting this text, the European Parliament is demonstrating its opposition to regressive tendencies and proposing that the future CAP budget remain at least at the same level as the 2013 budget, thereby ensuring that farmers receive the support they need to invest in new technologies, a crucial step if this sector is to remain competitive. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has made a decisive contribution – partly as a result of the numerous amendments tabled both in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and in plenary – to achieving a convincing result, thereby sending a clear message to the European Commission ahead of the legislative proposals scheduled for October.

By approving Mr Klinz’s report appealing for effective regulation of rating agencies, Parliament is taking another step towards greater transparency in the financial markets. It is important to overcome the current problems that characterise the sector: the lack of competition, the regulatory over-dependence on ratings, and the low reliability of notes. In this vein, Parliament’s request for the Commission to consider creating an independent European agency that could also be responsible for sovereign debt ratings is significant. Since the irresponsible behaviour of credit rating agencies (CRAs) has often been the initial cause of speculation that primarily harms European taxpayers, it is hugely important to review their role in sovereign debt ratings as part of the ongoing reform process, which will be completed in the autumn.

 By voting for the Garriga Polledo report, the European Parliament has made its voice heard on the future of the European budget and put forward an ambitious proposal for the next Multiannual Financial Framework. The request to increase the post-2013 EU budget by 5%, and therefore to increase the total European Union GNI from 1.06% to 1.11%, corresponds to a desire to honour commitments made to support growth and development, first and foremost, the Europe 2020 strategy, for which adequate resources are needed. It is important, in fact, to remember the added value of the European budget, which can act as a driver for economic growth, research and development and employment, particularly for young people, alongside national budgets. The report also reinforces Parliament’s position in favour of new financial instruments, such as the tax on financial transactions and Eurobonds, which are an opportunity for the European economy. It is now down to the Commission to take up Parliament’s ambition, presenting its proposals for the next European financial framework and not falling victim to the restrictive budget policies of Member States.

 Parliament’s approval of the directive on the charging of heavy goods vehicles is a step forward in the protection of European citizens’ health, and a commitment to lessen the harmful effects of pollution caused by such vehicles. The ‘polluter pays’ principle has been introduced for the first time in this sector in order to encourage safer and more sustainable transport, and hence to promote alternatives such as rail transport. Under the compromise reached, however, due consideration must also be given to the protection of the haulage industry, which must not be penalised excessively. Member States must therefore strive to make more effective use of the revenues collected under the Eurovignette, for example, by investing in infrastructure improvements and encouraging the use of less polluting haulage vehicles, so as to ensure that the benefits of the directive are enjoyed by all the sectors involved.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the common security and defence policy (CSDP) is going through an extremely difficult time. Just when developments in the international system require the European Union to become a credible actor in security and defence; just when the European approach to crisis management through supporting democracy rather than exporting it appears to be more suited to the challenges of our times; just when the economic crisis makes the option of developing a common defence inevitable; just when the Treaty of Lisbon provides new instruments to develop the CSDP within the framework of an integrated approach; in short, just when a quality leap in the CSDP has become necessary and possible, the European edifice seems to be creaking dangerously and there is a real risk that the ambitions and possibilities of the CSDP will have to be drastically downsized. The report I am presenting seeks to tackle this contradiction and suggests possible answers for the other institutions. With regard to the Libyan crisis, we do not confine ourselves to expressing our disappointment either at the European Union’s inability to define its position and take joint action or at the restrictions placed on the EUFOR Libya mandate. We believe the time has come for a European political initiative, in conjunction with our other partners, to bring about a ceasefire and to hold negotiations that will put an end to the Gaddafi regime and begin a transition to an inclusive democracy. NATO’s military intervention is clearly unlikely to solve anything and it will do well to adhere scrupulously to the mandate of the UN resolution, avoiding any disproportionate use of force. At the same time, we hope that CSDP assets will be used effectively to provide humanitarian assistance to the civilian population under attack and that future operations will be planned in such a way as to support the development of democracy in Libya. The Libyan situation also calls for reflection on a wider scale, and I believe it reinforces the report’s suggestions. Responsibility for the future of Europe and for security and defence, of course, lies primarily with the European Council, its members and also its President, who represents the Union in matters of foreign and security policy at that level. We say to them clearly that bilateral cooperation and coalitions of the willing cannot replace the CSDP as the Union’s policy. We do not find the idea of renationalising this policy convincing, not because we are Treaty purists, but because, if it were renationalised, this policy would not be equal to the challenges that lie ahead. We propose that Parliament should enter into a strategic dialogue with the European Council, which we call on to discuss Parliament’s recommendations, to draw up a proper foreign policy strategy and to devote an extraordinary meeting to European security and defence. We call on you, Baroness Ashton, to intensify your efforts to build a consensus among the Member States and to make use of your multiple functions to improve consistency between the CSDP, the common foreign and security policy and the other facets of the Union’s external action. The European External Action Service is an instrument with enormous potential for this work. The report puts forward several proposals for the role it should play, starting with that of being a crisis management board able to provide a genuinely integrated response to crises, and we are delighted to see that it is taking shape. The Libyan situation also confirms the inadequacy of Europe’s military capability, which is well below the overall high level of national defence budgets. It is quite obvious that strength only lies in unity. This involves pooling, sharing, strengthening of the European Defence Agency, permanent structured cooperation, development of an efficient and competitive European defence market, strengthening of the industrial and technological base, and enhancement of joint command and control capabilities. The inadequacy of these capabilities has been a factor preventing Europe from responding promptly to the Libyan crisis, starting with setting up a permanent operations general headquarters. The report formulates a large number of concrete proposals on this and other issues, such as the integration of external and internal security policies in a way that respects the primacy of the Community method. It is noteworthy that in this respect, the main pro-European political groups are united, and I thank the shadow rapporteurs and coordinators for this fruitful collaboration. Parliament is ready to support the development of a CSDP that is fully integrated with the Union’s external action and is rooted in the values and principles of Europe. Baroness Ashton, we hope you can respond convincingly to us both in words and, above all, in deeds. Roberto Gualtieri,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe Mr Albertini was right because as rapporteur, he had four minutes for his speech and two for his reply. I therefore take the liberty of pointing out that he should have his four minutes. For my part, I think this has been a useful and important debate, which shows how united Parliament is and how ready it is to offer its support for consistent and effective external action by Europe. We have not only heard recriminations for the obvious limitations shown by Europe in recent events, but we have also heard proposals offering a kind of strategic partnership between Parliament and the other institutions in order to make Europe a credible actor in security and defence matters. I believe this partnership would be not only an opportunity but a necessity as well because, if what we have been saying is true, which is that Europe’s integrated approach is its main potential, achieving that integrated approach will require the support of a body endowed with clear legislative and budgetary powers. For that reason as well, I think we should find a balanced solution to the matter of interparliamentary cooperation. It has become clear from the discussion how we must act. We must first of all assess the possibilities offered by the Treaty: by permanent structured cooperation and by Article 44, which makes it possible to delegate the task of carrying out a mission to particular Member States, but within an EU procedural framework, which is not the same thing as renationalisation. We need to make use of existing structures – starting with the European External Action Service – and set ourselves ambitious tasks in the field of capabilities. Of course, we also need to know how to offer leadership ability. We would like to thank Baroness Ashton for her commitment and for the important statements she has made. It is an attractive thought, as she said, that a small group can do great things, but Europe is a great civilised power which cannot shirk its responsibilities. Roberto Gualtieri,  
rapporteur.

 By approving the Hökmark report, Parliament is opting for innovation: the broadband and mobile telephony sector is not only of great interest to Europeans, but it makes it possible to develop new prospects in terms of research and development, areas in which the European Union can and must aspire to play a leading role. In this respect, it is important to ensure that the first European radio spectrum policy programme is in line with the objectives already outlined in the EU 2020 strategy and the Digital Agenda and comes within the priority actions of the Single Market Act. The EU must endeavour to overcome the digital divide that results in huge disparities within Europe – between urban and rural areas in particular – so as to ensure all citizens have equal access to services, especially those involving new technologies. I therefore welcome the ambitious targets proposed, to provide broadband access throughout Europe by 2020, with particular emphasis on wireless networks. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 The approval of a common transparency register, following a broad majority vote in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, is another step towards greater transparency in parliamentary activity. A common register between the European Parliament and the Commission that is public and accessible online will make it easier for citizens to check the various stakeholders with whom MEPs interact. However, the agreement still needs to be improved as registration by actors is still on a voluntary basis, although a pre-requisite for obtaining access to the institutions. The next objective will therefore be to make registration mandatory for all lobbyists. We also expect that, like the other European institutions, the Council will adhere to the indications of Parliament and the Commission and participate in the register. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

The specification of a European forest protection strategy is part of the EU’s overall commitment to the fight against climate change. Particularly positive points in the report that has been approved are the proposal for a specific regulation on the prohibiting of building on land cleared by fires proven to have resulted from arson, and the request for suitable funding for forestry strategies, which is currently at a very low level. Finally, the request for appropriate sustainability criteria for biomass produced for the use of energy is also important. We therefore urge the European Commission to continue along this route, by presenting a White Paper on forest protection to deal with these issues. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

I voted against the joint resolution because of the rejection by the House of two key amendments presented by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament on the development of medium- to long-term strategies for the progressive phasing-out of nuclear power and the definition of binding renewable energy targets. The vote against the entire resolution by the House highlights the fact that the nuclear issue is no longer just one of greater safety. It is now vital that we begin to think seriously about the energy issue and about investment in renewable energies. Japan’s tragic experience has shown us just how necessary it is to discuss nuclear power in depth. In this sense, the European Parliament’s vote is the first step towards a change of direction in energy policy choices on both a European and an international scale. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that the establishment of a permanent stability mechanism is an important achievement that provides the foundations for the political commitment to defend the euro at all costs. Therefore, despite not inconsiderable reservations about the methods and intergovernmental nature of the fund, Parliament supported this watershed moment and has focused on ensuring a solid link between the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and the EU Institutions. In this vein, the reference in the European Council’s conclusions to a regulation establishing the procedures to define the conditional requirements is important and we now expect the Commission to come up with a suitable proposal. Even though this is a positive result, it is difficult to consider it adequate. The problem is the basic direction of European economic governance. We persist in treating the symptoms of the illness instead of its causes. Deficits are the effect and not the cause of the crisis. Thinking that we can cure the illness by limiting ourselves to cutting deficits with one hand and refinancing banks with the other is sheer make-believe: it risks deepening the crisis and making the very task of the permanent stability mechanism unsustainable. If we want to treat the illness and not merely the symptoms, then we need to tackle a number of basic problems. We talk about strengthening European competitiveness. Rightly so, but which model of competitiveness are we pursuing? We cannot bring in a model for recovery driven solely by exports to third countries, because this will accentuate imbalances. In order to be more competitive in external trade, we also need to stimulate high-quality internal demand. We must therefore deal with the issue of the banks and the system for providing credit to the economy in order to direct European savings toward long-term investments. We need to equip ourselves with instruments such as Eurobonds, the tax on financial transactions and a budget worthy of the name, in order to make large-scale public investment at a European level that can provide a kick-start for private investment. Finally, we need to think of the European social model as a resource instead of a burden. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

A European regulatory framework in the fight against violence against women represents one crucial step forward within a comprehensive strategy. Only a combination of legal, social, economic and preventive actions will manage to resolve this problem which is rather close to home, given that over a quarter of women in the European Union have experienced violence during their lifetime. Violence against women makes no distinction by age or ethnic or cultural background, and it remains an invisible problem that has nonetheless very high human, social and economic costs. The European Union must affirm its active role in fighting discrimination against women and that is why the Svensson report supports the European Commission in its attempts to create a clear and homogenous regulatory framework in the context of the Stockholm Programme. I am therefore in favour of the request for an instrument of criminal law which would define violence against women as a crime in itself, through the development of a directive against gender-based violence, to be brought in line with the multiple training, prevention and awareness-raising initiatives in order to fight all forms of abuse against women.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the report that we are about to vote for, we still have reservations over the decision to adopt a revision of the Treaty on the intergovernmental character of the mechanism, but at the same time we are in favour, because – as Mr Brok explained – the negotiations that we conducted allowed us to achieve important objectives that relate mainly to the fact that the conditionalities associated with the assistance will be determined by a regulation, hence by a codecision procedure. It is therefore fair to vote in favour and I would like to thank the many fellow MEPs who have contributed to this result and mention the privilege of working with Mr Brok, Mr Pirillo’s extremely useful advice and also the work of the two rapporteurs from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON): Mr Scicluna and Mr Gauzès, Mr Schade, Mrs Häfner and the group coordinators and of course the chairmen of the groups that have given us such significant political support, thank you.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it would not be an exaggeration to say that this is an historic time in the process of Europe-building. The economic crisis has made it clear that the single currency needs real European economic governance and, for the first time, significant and innovative steps are being taken in this direction. At the same time, we are seeing a dangerous trend of giving this new governance an intergovernmental flavour, which not only risks threatening the institutional structure of the European Union, but also making the new mechanisms ineffective. Hence, the permanent stability mechanism is an issue of symbolic and central importance. Indeed, on the one hand, the establishment of a permanent stability mechanism represents a decisive and important step forwards. Parliament supports this decision, although it is important to stress that it must not rule out the possibility of using extraordinary solidarity mechanisms, such as those based on Article 122, which are currently in use. On the other hand, if the establishment of a permanent mechanism is therefore positive, the European Council has chosen to create a purely intergovernmental mechanism, thereby denying in a unique manner the European institutions any role, including in the procedure leading up to its establishment. Amongst other things, this could stir up disputes during the ratification process about the appropriateness of a simplified procedure, given that it is hardly in doubt that cutting back the competences of the European Union would require an ordinary revision procedure. Furthermore, since the treaty states two clear things; that the monetary policy of the Member States whose currency is the euro is an exclusive competence of the European Union, and that the Member States must coordinate their economic policy within the framework of the Union, as the treaty states, a mechanism that operates completely outside the European Union’s institutional structure would scarcely be compatible with these principles and would therefore result in a reduction of the European Union’s powers, which would not be compatible with a simplified revision procedure. This problem could also be raised by a number of national parliaments during the ratification procedure which, as we know, will be a complicated and risky process. Likewise for this reason, Parliament would have preferred a different, more institutionally appropriate and less politically risky procedure, such as Article 352, either alone or in combination with Article 136. The report sets all this out in black and white, but we preferred to concentrate on the substance rather than on procedures so as to reach a realistic yet determined approach. The central point is that the permanent stability fund will be created by the Member States because that is what they decided, but it may also lay the foundations for a new structure lying outside the EU institutions or it might be an intergovernmental wagon within a European Union train, travelling down the tracks of European law. Parliament wants to make a contribution because we are following the latter of these two paths. Hence, we asked in our report for two conditions to be respected: the proposal for an amendment must be redrafted so that the establishment of the mechanism’s distribution is somehow placed within an EU procedure, or that the EU institutions are heavily involved in the practical implementation of the mechanism and, above all, in defining the conditionality measures. What principles and rules should be established for providing assistance? Who shall establish them and how? For this, we need a regulation with an ordinary legislative procedure and we are waiting to consult with the European Council and the Member States on these issues. Roberto Gualtieri,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this has been an important debate which I think has clearly shown the existence of broad consensus among the political groups over the assessments and general direction of the report. With a few exceptions, Parliament is truly speaking with one voice and that is important. We are saying yes to the permanent stability mechanism though we cannot hide some confusion and concern which, as we have learnt, is also shared by the Commission, even though we would have liked to read of these concerns in the opinion of the Commission on the procedure selected. We are open to showing practicality and a sense of responsibility in noting that the political conditions do not exist to set up a European mechanism today and, nevertheless, we have shown and continue to show determination in our desire to help insert the mechanism into the Union’s legal and procedural framework, whilst also respecting the Treaties. Our proposals are clear, but now I think the crucial issue is another. Is the European Council willing to start up a real discussion with Parliament on its proposals and is the Commission willing to take an active role in this discussion? I should like to underline that Parliament has taken what I would call a customary decision to postpone the vote to 24 March. I think this is an important sign: this is a responsible Parliament, but I think the Council also needs to show this sense of responsibility by taking Parliament’s proposals into consideration.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday evening, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, by a large majority, adopted Parliament’s opinion on the amendment to the Treaty to introduce a stability mechanism. The text proposes a change to the amendment to the Treaty of Lisbon, setting out a procedure which, while safeguarding the intergovernmental nature of the fund, justifies the inclusion of the rule in the Treaty. It also contains some clear proposals regarding the operation of the mechanism, designed to make it compatible with the duties that the Treaty assigns to the European institutions and with the need to have real economic governance, which simply would not work if it were intergovernmental. To use a metaphor which you, Mr Barroso, used in the last debate, Parliament proposes putting this intergovernmental wagon on the rails in a Union train and giving the Commission its due role in running this train. How does the Commission view Parliament’s proposals? Is it willing to help push them in the negotiations over the coming days? (The President cut off the speaker) Roberto Gualtieri,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we stand at a crossroads for the future of the Europe Union. After the many delays that we are guilty of, it has become obvious to everyone that Europe needs real economic governance, which must be particularly stringent for those countries that have adopted the euro. We therefore welcome the creation of a permanent stability mechanism, which we feel is a key point in the construction of genuine economic governance in Europe, even if we continue to nurture legal and political reservations on the procedure adopted, which we think is risky and does not make full use of the instruments provided for by the Treaty. I am delighted to hear that you also share these reservations. In any case, we are now focusing on a different point: how will the new mechanism actually work? Will it contribute to strengthening the economic governance of the European Union or will it be a step towards a new (and inevitably discretional) ‘intergovernmentalism’, which is the direction that was also taken by the unfortunate wording of the Franco-German competitiveness pact? Basically, in what direction is this train setting off? Who will be driving it? Indeed, on the one hand, the proposed amendment to Article 136 sets out an intergovernmental mechanism that is entirely disconnected from the Union and its institutions, while, on the other, we can read in the opinion of the Commission that the mechanism shall have to rely on economic governance exercised by the Union and that the Commission will take all measures to ensure consistency between the stability mechanism and the aforementioned economic governance. We do appreciate these intentions but, since there is no sign of any of this in the proposal to amend Article 136, we think that this is the time to clearly define how this mechanism will work. What procedure will be adopted to put the mechanism in place? What role will the Commission have in its management and in defining the conditions for its application? What will be the composition of the secretariat? What does the Council think about what Mr Barroso has just said on the validity of the current extraordinary solidarity mechanisms? Will there be a role for the European Parliament? I believe that only a rewording of the amendment to Article 136 or, alternatively, a clear declaration from the European Council on these issues, will enable Parliament to adopt an opinion in line with the desired schedule of the European Council.

Mr Present, ladies and gentlemen, I am a keen supporter of regard for the European Union and the competences assigned to it by the Treaties, which I believe also represent the best way to carry out our role as the direct representatives of the citizens of the European Union. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, ladies and gentlemen, I see two major problems with the proposed amendment to Article 136, one of them institutional and the other political. The institutional one is that Article 3 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that monetary policy for the countries whose currency is the euro is the exclusive competence of the Union, but Article 2 provides that exclusive competence may be exercised by the Member States if authorised by the Union. It is difficult to understand why the application of a rule clearly set out in the Treaty should require reform of the Treaty. Then there is also a political problem: choosing the Treaty reform option, rather than using Article 2 or Articles 352 plus 136, places the European Stability Mechanism, and hence the future of the euro, at the mercy of 27 ratification processes. Do people realise that if just one of these 27 ratification processes proved unsuccessful, it would then be difficult to find a plan B for the euro? Does the European Council realise that choosing this path puts the future of the euro at great risk? Roberto Gualtieri,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, there seems to be positive agreement between Mr Danjean’s remarks and what you said in your speech, Baroness Ashton, regarding the analysis of the situation, which is that the situation in the Sahel is critical. We are talking about one of the poorest regions in the world, bordering on some of the countries that have been shaken over the last week by more dangerous instability than ever. It is also a region where terrorist infiltration and drug trafficking are intertwined to a truly worrying extent. All that makes the situation unsustainable and a real threat to Europe. We therefore need to see a qualitative leap in Europe’s initiative. The 2009 initiative for security and development in the Sahel has so far proved ineffective. What is needed is the new strategy for security in the Sahel that the Council of Foreign Ministers have called to adopt, which we are awaiting. I believe there are two important points that have been highlighted: firstly, a regional approach; and secondly, an integrated approach that enables us to make the best possible use of the various instruments available to the EU in a concrete, operational and coordinated way. We must realise, however, that the path for a possible mission must be assessed very carefully, because Common Security and Defence Policy missions are one of the instruments we have available, but they are no replacement for a political strategy. Our group therefore fully endorses Europe’s new, renewed commitment in the Sahel and we are anxious to see the new strategy, discuss it in detail and support its implementation. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D
).

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, procedure is the stuff of democracy and therefore the implementation of the citizens’ initiative was not merely a technical exercise but imposed crucial choices that made it possible to turn the citizens’ initiative into an instrument effectively capable of helping to build a genuine European political space. Parliament undoubtedly exercised its prerogatives in an exemplary manner, significantly improving the original proposal. The main results have already mentioned and I do not need to remind you of them. I would, however, like to emphasise another one, to which our group made a significant contribution: European political parties will also be able to promote a citizens’ initiative. This is an outcome of great significance because the fate of European democracy lies at its heart, since there can be no genuine international democracy until European political parties take on an effective role in the democratic process. Today we are taking a step forward in this direction and this is another reason why it is a great day for European democracy. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the new strategic concept developed by NATO contains important, positive changes to meet the challenges of the 21st century in a manner consistent with the values of the Atlantic Pact. In particular, we welcome the revival of the strategic partnership with Russia, the explicit formulation of the goal of a world without nuclear weapons, the recognition of the importance of a stronger European defence, the reaffirmation of the principle of collective defence and, at the same time, the statements that NATO does not consider any country to be its adversary. There are still, however, problems and contradictions that this far from new concept does nothing to dispel. Firstly, there is no clear and unambiguous commitment to the elimination of tactical nuclear weapons, which are still deployed in Europe even though they are strategically anachronistic and economically increasingly unsustainable. Secondly, the European Union's role in the strategic concept is still insufficient and the planned civilian crisis management capabilities are at risk of pointlessly duplicating those of the European Union. We are aware of the political problems that hinder more effective EU-NATO cooperation, but this cannot get in the way of developing an operational perspective, complementarity and synergies that are a match for our ambitions. Helicopters, medical support and explosives represent significant progress but are not enough: we need vision and an active commitment and we call on you, Baroness Ashton, to deploy them both with strength and clarity. Roberto Gualtieri,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament approves the establishment of a new section of the budget for the European External Action Service (EEAS) and the provision of additional funds for staff. This position is due to Parliament’s desire to see the EEAS set up, because Europe urgently needs it, but, of course, it does not mean that it will give up its role as budgetary authority in the debate on the nature of the body that will deal with crisis management or on the priorities of staff policy, as shown by the reserve that we established in the 2011 budget. The regulations that we are going to adopt reinforce the outcomes of the Madrid agreement and, in some cases, go further, for which I would like to thank Mr Rapkay, Mrs Gräßle and Mr Rivellini. I must also thank Baroness Ashton and Mr Christophersen for their willingness and openness in our discussions. The Staff Regulations ensure that all EEAS staff will have the same rights and duties irrespective of their origin, and requires the High Representative to ensure a geographical and gender balance. These arrangements will be binding and Parliament will make sure that they are complied with. At the same time, they avoid the use of quotas, which would be not just difficult to implement but also wrong. The Financial Regulation ensures a solid control system and keeps the EEAS closely tied to the Commission. I welcome the success we have achieved with the setting up of specific budget lines for the main common security and defence policy missions, which represents a major leap forward for Parliament’s ability to exercise control over the common foreign and security policy. With tomorrow’s vote, therefore, we will have an EEAS that is stronger, more communautaire
 and subject to greater Parliamentary scrutiny. We will be strict and demanding in performing this scrutiny but, at the same time, we will do it responsibly and in a constructive spirit, since we are determined to help the High Representative in the colossal task of providing Europe with a real foreign policy to serve its values and interests. Roberto Gualtieri,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think the genuine satisfaction that has emerged in this debate shows that Members were aware of just how difficult yet important the task facing us was. How to unify functions associated with different policies and subject to different decision-making procedures in order to make the European Union’s external actions more consistent, without endangering the communautaire
 nature of certain policies, but embracing the contributions of bodies operating in the field of the common security and defence policy, was not merely a problem of European law or administration science or a test of the power relations between institutions. Instead, it was a necessary condition if we were to endow the High Representative with an instrument that could enhance Europe’s potential on the world stage, strengthen its role as a civilised power, and allow us to act more effectively in the Middle East, the Horn of Africa, the Caucasus or the Balkans. Well, I think we have risen to the challenge marvellously, and so our satisfaction is fully justified. The High Representative will, I believe, enjoy Parliament’s exacting support as she performs her duties. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is very important to make a success of this budget procedure, not just because it is the first budget under the Treaty of Lisbon, with a new procedure and new functions for the European Union, but especially because it comes at a crucial time for the future of Europe, affected as it has been by a severe crisis. Faced with the crisis, many governments think of an economic governance model based entirely on stability mechanisms, which means cutting their national budgets and perhaps also the European budget. We, on the other hand, think that a stronger European budget, supported by own resources and also a financial transaction tax, is a precondition for effective European economic governance and for greater discipline in national budgets. We must therefore decide which way to go, and to that end, the amendments that the President-in-Office of the Council has considered inappropriate are, in fact, extremely important. However, the greatest disagreements concern the figures, of course. In this respect, I would urge the Council to make up its mind, because it cannot want to keep strictly to the margins and, at the same time, expect Parliament not to bring its own priorities into play. The Treaty of Lisbon is quite clear on this: the Council is paramount as regards the quantity of spending, whereas Parliament has the last word on the quality of spending. Thinking about heading 4, we are not against increasing funding for the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) or for the Industrialised Countries Instrument (ICI+), but we do not want it to be at the expense of our priorities: first Palestine and then development cooperation. The Council therefore has three options to choose from: it can accept Parliament’s priorities, or it can agree to a revision of the margins, or it can accept greater flexibility of the budget and in the budget, in the knowledge that Parliament will stand united in defence of its prerogatives and priorities. Roberto Gualtieri,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the strengthening of the industrial and technological basis of European defence is an essential part of developing a common defence system. What it needs, however, are common rules and a coordinated approach in order to enhance the development and competitiveness of the European defence industry and, at the same time, to ensure that this development is in line with Europe’s principles and international commitments. To that end, together with the directive on the internal market in defence, the December 2008 common position defining procedures and criteria for military exports to third countries was an important step forward. As we know, these procedures do not include a general consultation mechanism. However, the common position does include a timely reference to the need to enhance cooperation and convergence in this field within the framework of the common foreign and security policy. Until the hoped-for progress on this front, and until such time as the creation of a common defence system makes it possible to adopt even more binding mechanisms, the cooperation and convergence referred to in Article 7 should not remain just on paper and the annual report on military exports should be made available to Parliament. Naturally, the question tabled by the Members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) seems implicitly – although it has now been made explicit – not to confine itself to matters of a general nature. Given that it would have been better to refer to things by their names right from the start, it does not seem that the sale of French ships to Russia contravenes the 2008 common position. On the contrary, such exports could strengthen European-Russian ties and cooperation in the security field and make them more binding. These ties, however, should be removed from the bilateral sphere and be entirely addressed, discussed and managed at a European level. Roberto Gualtieri,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets.

 Mr President, Mrs Ashton, Mr Šefčovič, ladies and gentlemen, clearly, the report on which we are preparing to vote is not a simple opinion, but the result of intense negotiating efforts, for which I would like to thank the High Representative and the Spanish Presidency. These are negotiations in which Parliament played a prominent role in significantly improving the text of the decision that the Council will have to adopt. The compromise reached in Madrid is fully in line with the objectives that guided this highly coordinated work carried out by Mr Brok and Mr Verhofstadt: to provide Europe with a service that has resources and powers sufficient to increase the consistency and effectiveness of the EU’s external action, but which is, at the same time, closely linked to the Community method and the Commission, and subject to the full democratic control of the European Parliament. I, too, would like to say to those who have mentioned so-called red lines that the European Parliament must not cross, that it is precisely because Parliament has been able to exercise its prerogatives fully and dynamically, and even cross some of the red lines outlined by governments, that Europe will have a more effective, more democratic and more European service. I am talking about a service, for instance, that is able to reconcile development cooperation policies with the rest of the EU’s external action, without undermining either the necessary independence of those policies or the Commission’s responsibility. Parliament shall continue to make strong and determined use of its legislative and budget prerogatives, especially over the coming months, in order to define the Staff Regulations and the Financial Regulation in accordance with the basic outline of this report. It will also carefully supervise the actual development of the service and ensure that the letter and spirit of the Madrid Agreement are fully respected, beginning with the proper participation of European officials at the helm of the service and in the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) budget reform. It will also make use of these prerogatives to provide the High Representative of the service’s officials with its full support as the European Parliament, an institution which cares more than any other about the development of a true European foreign policy and about its gradual communitisation, in which the Madrid Agreement is an important stage.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Madam High Representative/Vice-President, I would like to emphasise the fact that we are discussing three excellent documents drawn up by Parliament: ambitious documents that express clear stances, make clear-cut choices and are subject to broad consensus between the groups within this Parliament who care about Europe and its future. It is an important fact, demonstrating Parliament’s will and ability to offer itself as a candidate to play a central role in CFSP/CSDP on the basis of what I would call a dynamic reading of the Treaty of Lisbon. We intend to exercise this role in the process of constructing the External Action Service, not only to guarantee Parliament’s prerogatives, but also to contribute to making the service an organisation capable of ensuring that EU external action is consistent and efficient while, at the same time, strengthening and gradually extending the community method. As regards the Danjean report, I would like to highlight that the concept of strategic autonomy is presented in the context of a multilateral approach, and that it is a condition for strengthening the strategic partnership with the United States. I would also like to highlight the fact that Parliament is united in requesting an Operations Centre, and I am glad that you, High Representative, have declared yourself open to a more exhaustive discussion of this idea. Concerning the non-proliferation resolution, I would like to underline the importance of envisaging a world free from nuclear weapons, the clear judgment on the anachronism of tactical nuclear weapons and the value of the positions recently adopted by some European governments on this front. Thus, Parliament’s message is clear, realistic and ambitious, and we hope that the High Representative is able to grasp and endorse it. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the unprecedented humanitarian disaster in Haiti affects us deeply and the European Union has a duty to contribute as best it can to the efforts by the international community, using all the tools at its disposal. As far as financial resources are concerned, significant progress has been made in recent days and hours. What deserves more thought is the other aspects of Europe’s response to the crisis, but we should avoid worrying about our image and concentrate instead on the substance, as the High Representative rightly said. The central role of the MINUSTAH mission has now emerged clearly, in terms of both civil protection and security, ruling out an autonomous CSDP mission, but the EU’s coordination role in support of the UN mission remains key. On this point, I would like to remind Mr Juvin that this coordination exists, and that the Monitoring and Information Centre is performing it in the area of civil protection, and the Situation Centre is performing it in the area of security, and it is to be hoped that this work will result in deployment of the European Gendarmerie Force, as has been expressly requested by the United Nations. What it is useful to understand from the High Representative and from the Commission is how the MIC and the Situation Centre are responding, in practice, in the face of such onerous tasks and tests, how their coordination is working, and whether their instruments and resources are adequate. This will also help us at a later date when we will have to consider the adequacy of these instruments and the capacity of consular protection, but now is not the time for these debates. Now is the time for action and commitment, and we fully support the action being taken by the High Representative. Roberto Gualtieri,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the developments in the situation in Iran, one cannot help but express serious concern. These concerns relate to the increasing infringements of political and civil rights, which we strongly condemn, and concern over the failure to perform the duties resulting from Iran’s membership of the Non-Proliferation Agreement, upon which even the country itself states it does not want to cast any doubt. We do not question Iran’s right to the peaceful development of nuclear energy, nor do we intend to underestimate the important role that Iran can play on a regional level, its legitimate security requirements, or the need to create a credible system of regional security that involves all the nuclear powers in the area. It is precisely because of this, though, that we do not understand the reasons for the failure to comply with the request by the International Atomic Energy Agency for the uranium to be enriched abroad, and we regret this decision. Faced with this situation, it falls to the Security Council to determine the international community’s response and the possibility of new sanctions, which should be focused on non-proliferation and designed to be an instrument to support the path of difficult but unavoidable dialogue, and not designed and used to beat down the regime. With regard to this course of action, the European Union should play its part by giving thought, at the appropriate time and in the appropriate form, to possible technical measures to complement the UN sanctions and, at the same time, by confirming its readiness for debate and dialogue, which should never be lost, even at difficult times. We will fully support action by the European Union and the High Representative in line with the approach that was set out clearly in the High Representative’s speech. Rosario Crocetta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that today is a great result for Parliament, because when I wrote to President Buzek on 15 July saying that ‘we need to set up an anti-mafia committee’, I remember many Members from different countries saying, ‘But the mafia is only a problem in Sicily and in Italy’. Today, recognition by our fellow Members from the north and from the whole of Europe that there is a problem of ‘organised crime in Europe’, and the desire to fight it together is, I believe, a momentous fact, and I would like to thank you, Mr President, and Parliament as a whole.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if Arab dictators shoot at the crowd the West immediately responds, with no-fly zones, UN intervention, and so on. If, on the other hand, the Israeli air force bombs Gaza there is silence, because it is natural for Israel to bomb the Palestinian people. Yet the lack of a solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict is the main cause of conflict between the Arab world and the West, and it provides strength to extremists. Today the Arab revolutions have brought a fresh wave of democracy to North Africa and the Middle East. This cannot fail to have an effect on the relationship between Palestinians and Israelis, too. The very existence of Israel is in some way linked to an understanding of this cause. Either Israel accepts the existence of a Palestinian state, or Israel will no longer be able to live in the same conditions in that region. Within this framework, I believe that it would be very hypocritical for Europe not to give the Palestinians the same support that it is giving to those who are today fighting for freedom and rights in the Arab world and elsewhere. This is because I believe that the right of people to have their own land, to govern themselves, and to have their own state is an inalienable right, and I believe that Europe should support the Palestinian resolution at the UN.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Commissioner Malmström for having forcefully raised the issue of an anti-corruption package, however I must be honest. Those who, like me, live in a Mafia-controlled area and have also paid and continue to pay a terrible price for it, are not amongst those who are convinced that a magical law is all it takes to finally put a stop to corruption. This seems to be the main problem and cause of the state of emergency we currently find ourselves in. Corruption is an ancient art, much older than the world itself, and has probably now become part and parcel of the way in which politics is done, not only in Italy, but in many other countries too. I strongly support what the Commissioner said: we must ensure that we fully emphasise the importance of this policy. When considering how to combat corruption, we must start by asking ourselves how public procurement procedures are conducted; what the threshold is for cases in which a degree of discretion is allowed; whether or not a monitoring network exists to monitor, for example, whoever wins a contract; how people have accumulated their wealth; whether or not there are any rules for tracing money; and how we check whether politicians who have been found guilty have actually been sentenced and imprisoned, or ascertain whether they are still members of parliament, protected by their parties and the laws of their country. We should start a revolution, so to speak; I personally would make the fight against corruption, the Mafia and organised crime the focus of this second half of the parliamentary term, in order to tell the Spanish ‘Indignados
’ that we want a better Europe, a freer Europe, a more transparent Europe, and to tell the young people participating in the Arab Spring that we too want to change the world, and that we want to enact serious change. So, congratulations, Commissioner, but let us do more. Rosario Crocetta,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Beijing’s justification for the arrest of the artist Ai Weiwei for economic crimes is not convincing, and neither is the need to treat a free, dissident artist so harshly. It is not convincing since this arrest is one of hundreds of arrests of opponents and part of the systematic repression of all signs of dissent. At a time when uprisings are breaking out in the Arab world, we think back to the images of cruel violence in Tiananmen Square against young Chinese who, just like today’s Jasmine revolutionaries, were demanding freedom and democracy. China has opened up to the West in economic terms without, however, linking production to respect for the environment and safety at work, and it is unable to embrace democracy and pluralism in any form whatsoever. This is not interference on our part in Chinese internal affairs, as Beijing maintains, but the appeal of men and women, of movements and parties that intend to build a world free of intolerance on every continent. The Beijing government should watch what is happening in the world to grasp that, if it does not change, it will be historic events and Chinese citizens that will change China.

Then, it was considered one of the most democratic countries of the Gulf and has been considered so even in recent years. So one must say, imagine what happens in other countries given that Saudi Arabia performs a few hundred executions a year, given that terrible massacres take place in Iran, given that throughout the Gulf, killings are commonplace and there is complete denial of the rights of the press. Today, we approved the resolution on Syria, Yemen and Bahrain, but when we will prepare a resolution for Saudi Arabia, for Algeria, for China and for the other countries which violate human rights in the world?

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is sad to note that sometimes, the West can find great solidarity when it comes to bombing, sending companies into third world countries and taking oil, but finds it more of a struggle to make solidarity and migration policies. This evening’s debate touches on these themes. I went to Lampedusa on Monday and saw 4 000 - 5 000 people on the ground, huddling together to sleep under the sun and the rain, doing their business where they ate and not being able to change the wet clothes – which some have said were designer labels, but are, in fact, fake designer labels – they had on during the crossing, in lamentable conditions. Among these were 4 500 children, 12-13 year-old kids, living under the same conditions, conditions of discomfort shared also by the inhabitants of Lampedusa. Tunisia is now home to 150 000 migrants who come from Libya and shows its solidarity. It is a poor country showing solidarity, while wealthy Europe is unable to accommodate 5 000 migrants. Europe should instead show its solidarity to these wonderful kids who have sparked the Jasmine Revolution originating in Sidi Bouzid that is changing North Africa and the world.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Egypt: from the virtual community on Facebook to the real one, with millions of people seeking fairer distribution of wealth and greater justice, and protesting against corruption. We must move on from the transition period of soldiers and tanks to a true democracy: a new constitution, new elections, abolition of the death penalty, more humane prisons, social rights and freedom. It will be difficult. Those who are willing to deploy any means in the name of an idea are lying in wait. We want to believe in the great Egyptian people, who have not, however, ever experienced democracy. We want a secular democracy, with a distinct separation between religious authority and political power, a democracy that integrates minorities and establishes true rights: to public healthcare, social security and work. Europe is supporting this approach by investing resources with the ability to promote real development in Egypt: no more dictatorships, no more misery, no more poverty. Rosario Crocetta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commissioner for having devoted her attention to the issue of Tunisia. To be sincere, I would have liked this debate to be given a different title, namely ‘Debate in support of Tunisia and other countries fighting against dictatorships and for human rights’. Instead, we are making a humanitarian crisis out of the fact that one of the greatest world powers, Italy, is having to tackle the problem of taking in 5 000 people. Of course, for Lampedusa, these refugees are a problem, even though a daily ferry links the island to Sicily and there is also an airport through which these people can be taken away. We have to realise that what is being discussed at the moment is not the problem of Frontex or how to stop the boats, but the fact that we are dealing with peoples whom we have urged to fight for democracy and, now that they are doing so, we must be in a position to receive them. Granting more visas is one policy that Italy can pursue to try to help those countries. Rosario Crocetta  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is time that Europe made efforts to give the Tunisian people and their transitional government concrete support and to re-launch a Euro-Mediterranean dialogue that has been badly neglected in recent years. The explosion of anger among the young people and the poor in the Maghreb and Egypt has been caused by the inequitable distribution of wealth and restrictions on people exercising their fundamental freedoms. North Africa is fired up and is demanding more democracy, better economies, more participation and more employment, while looking in disbelief at the old continent of Europe, which is immobile and unable to grasp the social transformation that has taken place in the region or to develop genuine policies for progress and peace. Europe needs to be pay closer attention to human rights and democracy and must promote more dialogue, more collaboration and more genuine economic assistance. Europe must open its doors and its heart to North Africa, so that the Mediterranean can become a sea of peace. There must be no more rejection of migrants through violent collaboration with countries like Libya. What we need is more investment, more openness, more aid and more of a Euro-Mediterranean policy. History demands it of us. Rosario Crocetta,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by asking for the immediate release of Nasrin Sotoudeh, we are urging the Union and its Member States to do more to liberate Iranian citizens and the world from one of the cruellest and most authoritarian regimes in history. The Islamic Republic of Iran is characterised not only by the threat it poses to world peace with a nuclear project capable of evoking the terror of nuclear war, but also by the illegitimacy of its elections; mass arrests of people requesting free elections; the killing of objectors; the rape and physical abuse of those who do not support the regime; the iniquity of judicial processes, where decisions can be predicted as soon as the accusations have been made; serious discrimination against women and homosexuals; and the absence of freedom of expression and of association. The conditions of Iranian prisoners in Camp Ashraf, where they are subjected to violence and even stoning, are absolutely incredible. Every day, at least two people, including children, are sentenced to death in Iran, and they are guilty of nothing more than of not pleasing the regime. Legal evidence is often created through the cruel and skilful use of brutal methods of torture. These criticisms are certainly not aimed at Islam, which is based on peace, but at the Iranian regime. The arrest and conviction of Nasrin Sotoudeh bring to light a new level of judicial deceit, since in this case, the attack and conviction are against a defender of the people, which means that citizens of Iran cannot even defend themselves.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the purpose of my speech is to point out the severity of the deindustrialisation process affecting a range of Sicilian industrial centres, in particular, the Termini Imerese automotive centre owned by the FIAT group, and the Gela petrochemical centre belonging to the ENI group. Termini Imerese is being damaged by the competition arising from the low salary system within some EU countries, whilst Gela is being damaged by competition from Asia. With regard to the severe deindustrialisation processes that are taking place in widespread areas of the Union, I would argue that the time has come to reconsider the policy of non-intervention that the European Commission has adopted up until now, and to begin to launch a set of important, strategic measures to support European industry. This call is addressed chiefly to the European Commission and to Mr Tajani, the Commissioner for Industry and Entrepreneurship. Rosario Crocetta  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as someone who has visited Tunisia two to three times per year since 1982 and who, as a Catholic, on 6 January attended mass, as I regularly do, I find it truly difficult to think of Tunisia as a country which suppresses religious freedom. There are problems, but for Heaven’s sake let us not to look at these countries, countries which are trying to make progress, through the prism of Western countries, because if we were to use that parameter, a parameter which someone is using this morning with regard to Tunisia, then certain European countries would probably be denied entry into the European Union, because the violence and denial of freedom which exists there is on a greater scale than in Tunisia. Thus, the issue arises as a result of one concrete fact: namely, that we have before us a country which has abolished Islamic fundamentalism, which is making efforts to develop a cooperation and peace policy with Europe, which is trying to evolve. There are problems. I believe that the way to solve these problems is to strengthen dialogue and friendship and to help these countries to achieve more. Rosario Crocetta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we were in Ramallah when we heard the news that Europe had adopted a new decision on the Middle East peace process. We saw the hopeful smiles on the faces of the Palestinian representatives. They were days filled with emotion and suffering, etched on the faces of the children gripping the window bars of their homes on the Hebron road, the deserted road that no Palestinian is allowed to cross. We saw the suffering of an 85-year-old woman, driven out of her occupied home, forced to sleep in the cold in a tent set up in the garden of what used to be her own house, and the suffering on the faces of the Palestinians who had built a farm using European funds, subsequently destroyed by Israeli soldiers. Israel has the right to be an independent state, but the Palestinians also have the right to a homeland, a state and a passport. The decision of the Council of Europe represents a considerable step forward, but we need to act immediately. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is just the tip of the iceberg in a larger conflict. On the final day of our visit, the Israeli authorities prevented us, the European Parliament delegation, from visiting the Gaza Strip. I believe that in this regard, the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, should step in to protest on behalf of democratic Europe. I should like to thank Mr De Rossa who led the delegation and all the other members of the delegation, because during the days we spent in Palestine, the vulnerable were able to see and hear the face and the words of a Europe which upholds rights and wishes to, and must, do more.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, concerning the request from the Council that we approve the proposal for exchanges of information between Europol and partners, including third countries, one can see what this would lead to: the proposal, if approved, would create the absurd situation of regulating, among other things, the exchange of information between Europol and third countries without Parliament having yet approved any such list of countries. This proposal, in its depiction of the handling of personal data, seems to pave the way for the creation of a truly limitless database which could even be made available to third parties that have not yet been specified by Parliament. Article 15(2) of the Council’s proposal states that in cases of absolute necessity, even where there is no suggestion that a crime has been carried out, data may be transmitted that reveal a person’s race, ethnic origin, political stance, religious and philosophical convictions, trade union membership and so on, without it being specified what is meant by ‘absolute necessity’ and, worse still, by endorsing the idea that there is such a thing as racial groups. It would be interesting to hear the Council clarify what a racial group is and which racial groups exist. As far as I am concerned, I believe that there is only one race – the human race. For these reasons, but also to maintain the independence of Parliament, which must work within the necessary time limits, I believe that the Council’s proposal in its present form must be rejected by the requested deadline of 30 November.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank you for asking the Belgian and French authorities to provide me with police protection. To feel the solidarity of the institutions when you are on the frontline fighting a phenomenon such as the mafia in Italy, which has resulted in many victims over many years, is really important in my view, and I offer my heartfelt thanks. However, for some time, Mr President, mafia organisations have been a global phenomenon: not just through money laundering, but also through their permanent presence in various European countries, and also via immigration. When, on 16 July this year, I called for the establishment of a committee of inquiry into mafia organisations in Europe, I did so with the aim not only of serving my country, but also the European Community, in the belief that a lack of vigilance when it comes to organised crime associations such as the mafia could have a negative impact on citizens’ quality of life and safety and on development mechanisms. And it is strange, I have finished, Mr President ... (The President cut off the speaker) Salvatore Caronna  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted for this report and I would like to congratulate Mr Alfonsi once again, because I believe macro-regional strategies can be a tool for creating added value for the whole of Europe. That is why it is important to continue along this path, though subject to certain specific conditions. Macro-regional strategies have to be developed around a well-defined geographical area with specific, uniform characteristics. In addition, strategies must be functional and stakeholders must be willing to push forward the integration process. Essentially, the regional approach should guide local communities towards integration at a higher level in order to address and overcome challenges that they would be unable to tackle otherwise, if they did not cooperate. With regard to the Mediterranean area, I think it is important that the report envisages one strategy for the western Mediterranean and another for the eastern basins, in other words, the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. In particular, it is significant that there is already a very high degree of coordination in the Adriatic and Ionian region. I therefore believe the Commission and the Council should follow up this important report. Salvatore Caronna  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the role of the cooperative movement has always been important for creating a more balanced and just economy. Currently, while we are going through one of the most serious economic and social crises since the war, the function of cooperative societies has become crucial. It is quite clear that where there has been substantial development of the cooperative dimension in the economy, the result has been an increase in employment, more skilled labour and more equitable redistribution of the wealth generated. Therefore, it is good that the European Union has adopted a statute for cooperative societies, but now more than ever, there needs to be a real simplification of the rules. We need to give new incentives for the creation of a common European framework on cooperatives and this must occur by giving assistance and not creating bureaucratic obstacles. This is why I voted in favour of this resolution and I hope that the Commission and the Council will take action to resolve the problems mentioned. Salvatore Caronna  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the creation of a European Higher Education Area is a major goal that the European Union has set for itself. However, despite the progress made with the Bologna Declaration – which, as noted, dates back to 1999 – we have got to recognise the fact that in terms of student mobility and the harmonisation of degrees across the various countries, the results have been far from satisfactory. That is why I voted in favour of this report. We need to move forward with greater speed on this issue and reverse the trend – especially in some countries – of cutting investment in education. Accordingly, the harmonisation put forward under the Bologna Declaration is still essential in order to improve the entire European education system and make the labour market more dynamic. I, too, would like to applaud Mr Berlinguer for his excellent work. Salvatore Caronna  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Parliament’s vote relating to the scheme for distribution of food products to deprived persons for the next two years was, above all, a mandatory step, bearing in mind also the fact that a few weeks ago, we approved a report against food waste that had amongst its targets the fundamental objective of helping the most needy sections of the population. It is unthinkable that at a time of economic crisis and social suffering like the present, we should not be responding, albeit partially, in such a way. In such a perspective, it is to be hoped that we will find a definitive solution for the entire 2014-2020 period. As we are seeing at the moment in the squares of Athens, the image of a European Union capable only of imposing cuts and sacrifices is a devastating one. We need to offer an alternative Europe capable of solidarity and of taking care of those in difficulty, and we need to do it soon. Salvatore Caronna

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first, I would like to thank the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their cooperation during the drafting of this report. This fruitful collaboration meant that we were able, swiftly and almost unanimously, to approve a text on an issue, that of the waste of food, which has, for too long, been underestimated by the institutions and by policy. We can no longer permit ourselves to underestimate it. All the most authoritative specialist sources now say that one of the main problems in the immediate future will be to tackle the new and extremely high demand for food and that therefore, the issue of food security has become one of the most difficult problems to tackle because, in the future, the demand for food will tend to exceed supply. If this is true, we can no longer allow ourselves to remain passive in the face of food waste. When we talk of food, we are talking of food that is still perfectly edible, and so this issue has become a large-scale problem which is no longer sustainable. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) estimates that a third of food produced every year in the world that is intended for human consumption is wasted, and in Europe, the figure is already 50%, with every citizen on average wasting 105 kilograms per year. We have reached such a level, in fact, that we have to say that we are faced not only with an ethical problem, but with a real economic and social issue, with enormous implications for the environment. That is why, through this report, we want combating food waste to become a priority on the European Union’s policy agenda. We are therefore asking for the Commission to lead the 27 Member States in adopting a common strategy that can foster a real step change to reduce food waste significantly by 2025. We therefore ask that all the associations, volunteer groups and initiative-taking centres that have produced specific projects in this area in various countries should be turned to good account. These experiences have generated a virtuous system which has guaranteed significant recovery of products to be sent to those sections of the population that are experiencing financial difficulties. I would like to remind you that in Europe, wealthy Europe, nearly 70 million citizens live under the poverty threshold and suffer from malnutrition. We are therefore asking for precise directives from the Commission. Specifically, it would be important to amend the regulations on public procurement for catering services in canteens and hospitals so that, when they are being considered, priority is given, other terms being equal, to those enterprises that have a management model established on combating food waste. On this aspect, I would like to point out that the important fact is that the first to set an example should be the European institutions, starting with this Parliament. Finally, we are calling for all stakeholders in the agri-food industry to take responsibility. A real awareness-raising campaign needs to be conducted, targeted firstly at the large farmers’ organisations, the world of industry, schools and universities, which can produce a civil and scientific culture oriented towards a more restrained and environmentally sustainable model of consumption. With this report, the European Parliament has done its part. Now we hope that the Commission will address this work by putting an effective strategy in train. Above all, we hope that swift action will be taken to declare 2014 the European Year against Food Waste; this would be a tangible sign of the institution’s true, strong and immediate commitment in this area. This would give an immediate signal to all citizens that the European Union is able to be at the forefront in establishing a fairer and balanced development model. Salvatore Caronna  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are currently living through a period that is decisive for the future of the euro and with it of the whole European project. Being aware of this would mean abandoning a short-sighted logic that subordinates everything to an ideological balance of payments straitjacket. We all want various countries’ books to be in order. We all want to reduce debt. Nevertheless, it is clear that without a sensible policy of investment capable of breathing life into the economy, there will be no possibility of growth. The one clear outcome of this approach is that the greatest price will, as usual, be paid by the least well-off. That is why we in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have voted against this report. In fact, it continues down a one-way street that is one of austerity without growth, a direction that has so far proved to be the wrong one. Salvatore Caronna  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very appreciative of the work done by Ms Ferreira in this report. In fact, this was the only one of the package’s six legislative proposals devoted to economic governance for which my group and I voted. We did so because it includes, among other things, a clause on the protection of social rights, starting with collective bargaining, and because it also strengthens Parliament’s role in the adoption of delegated acts. Therefore, although we cannot change the overall balance of the six-pack, with this report we are definitely making progress towards, among other things, a surveillance system that takes account of fundamental rights. In this context, then, although a vision based solely on a policy of austerity does not, in our view, produce positive results, this positive report certainly bucks that trend.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I had no hesitation in voting in favour of the report by Ms Zimmer, above all, for one purely political reason: I think we need to bring this major issue of food security right back to the core of all European Union initiatives. It is not only a matter of helping developing countries to tackle this issue more effectively. Rather, since the demand for agricultural products is set to increase by more than 70% between now and 2050, the food crisis is a key issue that must be dealt with quickly and decisively. Otherwise, it may become one of the main threats – if not the main threat - to stability, peace and, as we have seen, even democracy. I think it is therefore incumbent upon the European Union and the Member States to take the required steps to properly tackle this important issue, beginning with adequate investment, as the report proposes. Salvatore Caronna,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that the challenge of the coming years is to ensure that Europe, as has been said, maintains its position as the world’s number one tourist destination and, at the same time, is able to enhance its entire territorial heritage, both in terms of environmental protection and competitiveness. The challenge is a difficult one and not to be taken lightly, having regard not only to the opportunities but also to the aggressiveness of other countries in this sector, of other continents from China to India and Brazil. Against this backdrop, as Commissioner Tajani mentioned, and as noted also in the opinion that we approved on the Committee on Regional Development, having a strong, general, EU-wide strategy on tourism with an enhanced role for the regions and territories becomes fundamental. Accordingly, in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity, it is essential that regions and local authorities are fully involved from the outset. Moreover, I believe that the development of integrated tourist networks and projects should be encouraged through the creation of partnerships for the exchange of best practice. I think that the proposal to identify a ‘Europe brand’ that is capable of defining a high quality of tourist product is also good. Obviously, it will be up to the Commission to define better the priorities, above all from a financial point of view, to guarantee that Europe retains its number one position in future.

Mr President, I voted in favour of the report by Mr Garriga Polledo on the forthcoming financial perspectives of the Union because, at one of the greatest times of crisis for the so-called European spirit, I am convinced that it is vital for us to insist upon and prevail in our belief that it is essential to provide the Union with credible instruments, beginning with adequate funding. The request for a 5% increase in the next budget is therefore just and necessary. Perhaps it will not be enough, but it is essential in order to provide answers to the big questions that lie ahead: these resources are needed to tackle real problems, such as greater cohesion between the regions, a greater capacity for research and innovation, and a greater capacity to generate growth and provide jobs. Without adequate resources, none of these problems will be properly dealt with, beginning with the introduction of the intermediate category in cohesion policy, which only makes sense if it does not harm the other categories already in place. That is why I voted in favour and I hope that the Commission and the Council will follow the recommendations of the report. Salvatore Caronna  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the adoption of the report by Mrs Podimata represents a significant step forward for a more balanced, more progressive and stronger economic and fiscal policy in Europe. It is now clear to everyone that Europe, as the coordinating authority of the 27 countries, urgently needs to equip itself with economic and financial instruments that are capable of controlling the economy and not just submitting to it. For this reason, the proposed taxation of financial transactions has caused quite a stir and generated a large amount of attention and discussion. The fact that the majority of this Parliament has voted for this regulation is important and significant because, for the first time, things were not just left to ride and instead, we have achieved a step forward. I do hope that the Commission and the Council will continue on this path. Salvatore Caronna  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Open Days have been taking place here in Brussels over the last few days. Many municipal and regional representatives have been talking about how to address the serious problems our cities are facing and about the old and new needs affecting workers, families, and small and large production companies alike. The economic crisis that has hit our societies has made it harder and more difficult for all of us to find suitable solutions to a new and serious social issue. In this context, I believe everyone has come to understand that, time and again, cohesion policy has been the only real instrument the regions have had available to them for trying to provide solutions. We can therefore say that over the last few years, cohesion policy has provided a vital fillip to the European integration process for all of the regions. Now we are having to redefine this policy for the period after 2013, and we are therefore at a turning point. That is why it is vitally important to avoid certain risks. The first fundamental risk would be to renationalise it: that would be a serious step backwards. Next, when preparing the financing budget, we must lay down appropriate requirements with regard to the weaker areas without penalising the more competitive and more advanced regions. Lastly, it is essential to simplify the procedures for those who have demonstrated efficiency and to make more legally binding the power to penalise those who have not. We expect the Commission to take action along these lines. Silvia Costa,

 Madam President, I want to remind you that today is the 23rd anniversary of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and I believe the digital world is a new frontier for promoting and protecting the rights of babies and children. I wholeheartedly thank the shadow rapporteurs from the Committee on Culture and Education and the rapporteur from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for the excellent job they have done too and I hope that today we will really send an important signal to everyone awaiting Parliament’s vote. Silvia Costa,  
rapporteur

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, 23 years after the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the internet is becoming the new frontier at which the rights of minors have to be protected and promoted, given the growing penetration of the internet among children and adolescents in Europe – a kind of symbiotic relationship which helps to form their personalities and the way in which they relate to the outside world. A few years ago, the average age at which children had their first access to the internet was around 9 years old, but today, the first steps on the web, for those born in the digital age, are being taken even before they learn to read or write. Young people under 16 use computers for study, play, watching video clips, downloading videos and music, file sharing, and for visiting chat rooms, blogs and virtual worlds. However, the majority of children between the ages of 9 and 16 have their profile registered on a social network, many using a fictitious identity, and a quarter of adolescents declare an older age than their real one. Twelve per cent of those in the 9 to 16 age group report that they have been harassed, in particular by being bullied (40 %) and by content and approaches of a sexual nature (25 %). Therefore, opportunities and threats coexist on the internet; nowadays the internet is indispensable for the integration of children from a social, educational and work point of view, but the European institutions and the Member States must do their utmost to ensure that minors are guaranteed the conditions they need for their education and to keep themselves informed, the rules required for safe navigation, and that providers, business and educators are made aware of their responsibilities. The report proposes a holistic approach in respect of the promotion and protection of the rights of children online. Exchanges with the various political groups in the Committee on Culture and Education and the shadow rapporteurs – whom I would like to thank – allowed us to arrive at a compromise text which was highly satisfactory even though it deals with a topic about which there are different sensibilities and trends. The work carried out with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and its rapporteur, Ms Hedh, made a significant contribution. The report welcomes and incorporates – with precise recommendations – the recent communication from the Commission for a better internet for children. It was our aim to strike a balance between the fundamental rights of the child in the digital world, the right to access to education, the right to protection and the right to digital citizenship, in a new system of governance which puts at its heart, as paramount, the interests of the child, as a person undergoing education and as a European citizen, on the basis of Article 24 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Treaty. Where governance is concerned, we call on the Commission to mainstream children’s rights across all the policies of the European Union that refer to the internet, to continue to finance specific programmes such as the Safer Internet Programme on the basis of a report and monitoring, and to take appropriate measures, through the internet among other things, which make it possible to coordinate the implementation of codes of conduct and the CEO coalition initiative. In addition, we support the Commission’s proposal to take legislative action if the adoption of the current codes of self-regulation should fail. As regards safe and untroubled access to internet use, we propose taking measures for an educational alliance among families, schools, associations and those involved in media and audiovisual services, to integrate these skills in school curricula and to train trainers and adults; vigilance in respect of the online marketing and publicising of harmful substances; an exchange of good practice in the role of informal education by the dissemination among adolescents of positive and good practices on the internet; the access of minors to safe and high-quality pluralistic digital content in educational programmes and services and, in particular, in the public service media. As regards the right to protection, the report makes a clear distinction between illegal content and unsuitable and dangerous content. For the dangerous and unsuitable material, we call for action to protect identity and privacy; to prevent excessively early contact with sexuality, grooming and improper behaviour – including that towards other minors, such as online bullying and sexting. Furthermore, we call on the Commission to maintain the initiative for classifying unsuitable content and, in general, for all the technical innovations that guide parents and children; we support the proposal from Ms Reding on the protection of personal data, privacy, the right to be forgotten, with specific measures for minors, and with mandatory parental consent for the processing of their data. As regards illegal content, however, there must be tools which are effective in dealing with online crimes such as grooming, and we would repeat that such crimes are of a cross-border nature and so stronger international cooperation is required in dealing with computer crime and in supporting hotlines. Finally, we would encourage – and we call on the Commission to encourage – the Member States to give whatever support they can to digital citizenship, which is crucial for the development of an intelligent and inclusive Union and civic participation, including that on the internet, by minors.

 Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, sending disconcerting, destabilising messages to Europe’s young people is not a great way to celebrate 25 years of Erasmus. The 33 countries involved in the Erasmus programme and the two and a half million students who have so far had the opportunity of studying abroad deserve certainty. It is unthinkable that the reason that this programme is in crisis is its success, including in terms of the funding already used. We need to be aware that the entire lifelong learning programme accounted for just 0.7 % of the EU budget in the last seven-year period, and we are talking about seeking an increase of 65 % or 75 % for the next seven-year period. We would be giving a completely mixed message if we were to say we could not honour our commitments. I hope that the Cypriot Presidency and the Council will make a very real commitment to reconsidering the extra funding requested by the Commission. Parliament should give a strong, united signal to ensure young people do not become eurosceptics too. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I, too, would like to congratulate Ms Jiménez-Becerril Barrio and Ms Parvanova, the Commissioner and the Council for this step forward by the European judicial system represented by this directive, which is also a way of honouring the victims of 9/11. I believe that, after the directives concerning human trafficking, child pornography and the European protection order, it is very important to focus on vulnerable people using a holistic approach with this directive. It is very important for all the countries to decide on a shared basis of inalienable rights, starting with the right to understand and be understood in one’s own language, access to services, information, compensation, and basically to justice for oneself and one’s family. It is also important that, thanks to the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, reference is made in this directive to the specific nature of violence against minors and women. I hope that in this regard, major efforts will be made to inform and update magistrates and lawyers, and I will conclude, Mr President, by saying that it is important to ensure that we prevent the secondary form of victimisation that often takes place via media that is not self-regulated, which broadcasts pictures of minors, exposing them to further violence and violating their privacy.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we must acknowledge that the European Council of 28 June represented an important political step forward, finally bucking the trend of years of repatriation of EU policies and delays in the process of strengthening and completing the Union’s institutional and economic framework to accompany the single currency. It is now irresponsible of certain governments or political groups to question or threaten to veto the decisions that have been taken, which I hope will be confirmed and fleshed out at the next Ecofin Council meeting. Such behaviour also risks negating Parliament’s efforts to push ahead with common objectives, namely boosting own resources, investment, jobs and growth. Thanks above all to the efforts of our political group and the work of the Italian and French Governments – together with the Spanish Government – the ‘golden rule’ and the Tobin Tax are now on the agenda, but a renewed push for greater political and economic integration in the European Union should be there as well.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I very much wish to emphasise the importance of this report on volunteering, and also to congratulate the rapporteur, with whom I had an excellent relationship in the Committee on Culture and Education (CULT), especially to ensure that Parliament’s attention on this issue will not wane now that the European Year of Volunteering is over. We were hoping – as I had asked previously in my role as shadow rapporteur – for a White Paper on volunteering work, which unfortunately has not been forthcoming. That would have provided an overall comparative framework at European level between the various situations, defining a status for European volunteering work and ensuring consistent fiscal treatment. I find that, despite not having had this, this report does fill a void and looks ahead. It is important to want to strengthen cross-border volunteering and remove the barriers that hamper many volunteers from gaining access to this opportunity and also, in particular, for disadvantaged people who need to be able to get help from volunteers. I think it is vital for us to find out how widespread volunteering is in areas such as cultural heritage, the environment and sport, and to make sure that in European tenders, the work of voluntary associations can be considered as a form of cofinancing for the purposes of being eligible for such tenders.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work. Fifty-five years on from Article 119 of the Treaty and after Article 157 of the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, the average pay gap in Europe is still 16.5%, demonstrating that a more comprehensive approach should be attempted, as the report itself advocates. In my view, the nine key issues identified in the report provide a sound basis for amending the 2006 directive, which Parliament is asking the Commission to review by February 2013, with the inclusion of both legislative and non-legislative measures. I would remind the previous speaker that the legal basis is Article 157, which provides that Parliament and the Council can act through the ordinary legislative procedure, in conjunction with the Commission, to introduce measures to ensure that the Member States implement equality measures. In particular, I must stress the need for transparency in defining work of equal value, which should be based on a job classification system that takes into account professionalism, skill and responsibility. Statistics should be made comparable – which is not the case at the moment – and there should be effective monitoring bodies to which appeals can be addressed, as well as more effective sanctions. Additionally, in terms of pay evaluation, greater transparency is needed in the wage or salary component, which is generally equal compared with the other components, such as benefits, allowances or deductions, in which the gap tends to be greater. That is shown by the fact that the higher women climb in their professions, the greater the pay gap becomes. We should therefore focus on that aspect, together, of course, with the need to reconcile work and family life and the need for training opportunities, not to mention raising the profile of part-time work in relation to the ability to pursue a career, a factor that penalises women to this day. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate the words of the Council and Ms Malmström. I think that today we must at long last talk about a proper European strategy on fighting trafficking, on prevention and on protecting victims. I attach huge significance to the role of the European coordinator, whose staff should, I think, be beefed up. We also need strong direction from the Commission so that all the Member States create equivalent organisations that will work with the national rapporteurs through ongoing consultations, with non-governmental organisations – which are often the most involved in this area – and closely with the police, the magistracy and with the cyber police on offences committed online. It is also important to compare the measures against customers and on discouraging demand in the various countries. This will allow us to move forward and connect the measures on children in a more holistic way as we implement this directive and the one on Internet child pornography. I think that training legal professionals is of central importance, as is legislative consistency. In this vein I would note the appalling situation of those in Italy who from 1998 had the humanitarian residence permit while now illegal immigration has been made a crime. I hope the current government will change this, because it is making it impossible to use the humanitarian residence permit for women who are victims of trafficking. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me just clarify this: I think, personally, that I have some concerns over one point in the report but I would not express it in the way Ms Bizzotto did, in the sense that it seems to me that the report goes a bit beyond the remit of the European Union, not so much when it describes various types of cohabitation, of family, and so on, in different forms, but when it says that the EU must somehow enter into what comes under family law which is still subject to subsidiarity. As far as same-sex families are concerned, I would like to make it clear that there are definitely same-sex unions in Italy, there are same-sex unions in situations where children are present, but same-sex union is not treated as being equivalent to the condition and legal status of the family and this is allowed under the various freedoms of Member States. I believe this is the point that should be clarified, it is not denying reality, it is denying legal gender equality in this case in my country. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that to sum up the situation and indicate more advanced goals for equality between men and women – today, in March 2012 – means facing up to the dramatic data from the economic crisis that show a rise in female unemployment, especially among young people, increasing poverty amongst women and I feel we should also acknowledge the rise of violence against women, especially where it is perpetrated in private. There is a situation, therefore, of suffering exacerbated by the cuts being introduced in many States in areas such as welfare, education and social security, which has mainly hit women. I believe there is a connection between this situation and the continued exclusion of women from the decision-making process and that this leads to an underestimation of the impact on women of the crisis and of our policies. Against this backdrop, the two reports focus on some goals that I agree with: a stronger focus when planning 2014-2020 Structural Funds on actions also targeted at women; economic independence, encouraging women entrepreneurs with Guarantee Funds and support tools; abolishing the gender pay gap, by reassessing women’s work and professionalism; prohibiting discriminatory behaviour – for example in my country, forcing women employees to sign blank resignation letters. We also call for standards and measures to recreate a balance in terms of representation, with transparent selection procedures for men and women in politics and in decision-making, and I would welcome it if Commissioner Reding can with the support of Parliament – as she has announced – really get a directive on quotas in enterprises. We also need to act at a symbolic level, not only countering the stereotypes in the media, but by promoting the enhancement and respect even for the dignity of women which is all too often commodified and abused. I am disappointed that the rapporteur Ms In ’t Veld proposes an amendment to delete this reference to the dignity of women, perhaps not fully grasping that the degradation of their image becomes a legitimisation of the violence towards them. Thank you. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, it would be truly strange if, at a time of such difficulties and problems in the lives of millions of people in Europe, the European Union were to impose further restrictions on food distribution. This would have a detrimental effect on basic social citizenship rights, the value of social cohesion and the very perception of the European social model. The signal that Parliament and the Council are both giving is a positive one, but we need to work on giving a definite structure and future to this necessary initiative. I would like to point out that in my country, Caritas, local bodies and other not-for-profit organisations providing free meals have seen an exponential increase in the number of people joining the ranks of the deprived, who can no longer count on being able to feed themselves, and these include not just immigrants, but many elderly and young people as well. I believe that, in the context of our ambitious fight against poverty and efforts to reduce poverty, this scheme is a prerequisite, and if we had not approved it, we would have gone against our own policy objectives.

I voted for this important report on sport, which is a response to the Commission’s communication on the subject and anticipates the proposal to create a sub-programme for sport in the 2014-2020 multiannual programming. As the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, we pushed for the following points: the adoption of sport as a compulsory subject in school curricula, the need to encourage women and girls from disadvantaged backgrounds to take up sport, focusing on sport as a driver of social integration and as a tool with which to combat intolerance, racism and violence, increasing the protection of minors in competitive sport, combating doping, the use of the European flag at all official sports events, the establishment of a European Day of Sports and the extension of the Erasmus programme to sports.

 Madam President, one of the fundamental rights that the European Union must guarantee for its citizens and residents is real freedom of movement under safe conditions throughout the 27 Member States. At the moment this is not guaranteed for those people – most, but not all of whom are women – who have obtained protection orders in their own countries, often with great difficulty, after being persecuted, stalked or repeatedly threatened even with being killed by someone they know, often a spouse, as Ms Reding mentioned, or an ex-husband or a boyfriend, or in any case someone they know. Such people are in fact no longer protected when they travel to another Member State. Parliament and the Council, in conjunction with the Commission, are seeking to fill this legislative gap by means of this directive. I would like to point out that we have applied the codecision procedure for the first time, at the initiative of the Spanish Presidency together with another 12 Member States, including Italy, and with strong support from the Polish Presidency, whom I would like to thank. This is the first legal instrument offering effective prevention and protection for actual or potential victims of crimes against the person or crimes of a moral nature across the European Union. It may be executed by either the civil or the criminal authorities of a country with measures that are the same as or equivalent to those taken in the issuing country. As the shadow rapporteur in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I would like to highlight the excellent cooperation that arose with the two rapporteurs and the invaluable contribution made by Ezio Perillo of Parliament’s Directorate for Legislative Affairs, who is today at the Court in Luxembourg. I also want to say how pleased I am with the key points of our proposal: the expansion of protection to cover physical and psychological integrity, dignity, personal liberty and sexual integrity; the right to information; the guarantees that the perpetrator of threats will also be informed of the consequences of breaching the European Protection Order; and the obligation for Member States to draw up comparable statistics. Of course, I also expect Parliament to adopt a position on the Victims package that Ms Reding has announced, so as to make this focus on victim protection truly horizontal. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that three issues are important in the transition from training to work: the relationship between theory and practice in teaching and learning; the integration of the humanities with technical and scientific subjects; and the structure of higher education and technical training, including non-academic training and continuous development. This is the direction that should be taken in teacher training, the promotion of training partnerships between companies, training centres and research centres and the promotion of high-level training. Today, we have a two-speed market for young people, and the situation is getting worse. We also have a flexibility that has not been matched by welfare provisions, but the new welfare is continuous development and opportunities to return to work and for mentoring. I think this should be presented more as a new social right. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that compromises are made not only by aiming downwards but also by seeking a middle way that aims upwards, and by improving the living and health conditions not only of women but also of children, whom I believe have not received much attention in this debate. I appreciated the intellectual honesty and politeness with which Mr Mleczko described the Council’s difficulty. I truly hope that a balanced compromise can be reached. However, I believe that we have done well to raise the bar compared with the requests contained in the Commission’s project, which were truly modest. I want to say one thing which I believe is really a basic objection. It seems as though Europe has not yet understood that, unless it helps reconcile work and motherhood, millions of European women will be excluded from the labour market or will be unable to remain in it. A different type of compromise would rejuvenate Europe, reduce childhood and family poverty and increase the productivity and community of Member States, unless the only proposal for welfare reform and cost optimisation is to increase women’s pension age, which would lead to a paradox. Under this system, these women will never reach pension age, because they will leave their jobs, as happens in many countries including mine, because it is not possible to reconcile work and family during their productive and childbearing years. I believe that unless European economic thought revises its conceptual base and moves beyond an ‘accountancy’ approach, growth will not be intelligent, inclusive or sustainable, because the women will not be there. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a point I very much welcome in Ms Wallis’s report on alternative dispute resolution is the fact that it calls for a general ‘justice for growth’ agenda across sectors which goes beyond consumer-producer disputes to include civil transactions, and family disputes in particular. I would argue that family mediation and a strong commitment from Europe in this respect are extremely important issues, in view of the growing number of disputes that generally follow separations and divorces in the European Union. In particular, disputes between spouses who are often of different nationalities tend to drag on longer and consequently have a terrible effect on the children. Experience in many countries shows that having a family mediator, as someone neutral that they can freely turn to, helps partners reach a mutually acceptable understanding, with an agreement in writing that can be submitted to a judge to be made official. This goal must therefore be determinedly pursued at a European level, although with due respect for subsidiarity, not least in light of the 2005 EU regulation on parental responsibility. It will also strengthen cross-border protection, particularly with regard to child abduction and the role of the European Parliament Mediator. I hope, therefore, that the Commission also includes this aspect directed to the Member States in its legislative proposal. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her complex, interesting and fertile report. As has been mentioned, single mothers now make up over 5% of the female population in Europe, and I would also point out that 85% of single parents are women. Single-parent families are therefore concentrated on the female side, and this fact should now be increasingly acknowledged by welfare, employment and social security policies. Naturally, as the report shows, this is a highly diverse population in terms of age, legal status and economic situation. In northern Europe, for instance, the vast majority are young unmarried mothers, especially in certain countries in Scandinavia and the United Kingdom, while in the south, most single mothers with children are separated, divorced or widowed. Their conditions are therefore also highly varied. Whereas certain welfare services and systems are probably more advanced in northern Europe, not least because family connections are less extensive, in the south, we are having to face a new, emerging problem of young unmarried mothers as well, but with a welfare system that has not yet been properly focused or thought through. There are therefore different speeds of response. I believe the first thing that should be done, as the report also points out, is to compare welfare systems and best practices in order to work out the right mix of services for employability, for training and for welfare, in order to guard against forms of poverty and exclusion from the job market and to enable these women to achieve a work-life balance, which is much more complicated for them. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Alfano, on this important report. It has become an essential reference for Parliament’s actions in an area in which it has new, enhanced competence based on the Treaty of Lisbon. It is a fundamental reference because of its subject matter – the fight against organised crime and mafias in the European Union – and because it calls for a special committee, the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor’s Office and the harmonisation of the Member States’ legislation. I also appreciate the fact that some of the proposals I made as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality have been accepted, for instance, the proposal to promote the role of associations of victims’ families and the establishment of a European forum, as well as the call for a holistic approach to people trafficking, especially child trafficking, and to illegal adoptions, not least in light of the recent European directive. I would like, however, to place a little more emphasis on the extent to which the text succeeds in showing that women and children make up the majority of direct or indirect victims, especially of crimes against the person, and that there must therefore be a specific, targeted commitment to support and protect women victims of crime and violence, including when they are witnesses or have dissociated themselves, especially from mafia and criminal families, and also to value their role when they commit themselves to a culture of legality. I would also like to mention the growing number of women involved in combating crime as judges, lawyers and police officers, and also as teachers trying to change the culture of our young people in this respect. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as I congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Gardini, and the Commissioner, I must say that I agree with the calls for European legislation, a bottom-up approach and a coordinating centre that draws on the best experience and the models of civil protection intervention used in the various Member States, bringing together expertise and voluntary resources, national coordinators and local bodies. I would like to refer to two points. Regarding the consolidation of 112 as the single emergency number in Europe, I would ask the Commission to carry out an active check, given that my country, for example, is moving towards further fragmentation of emergency numbers and the services that answer emergency calls. There are even two numbers for fires. Secondly, we should increase the part played by new technologies in the field of early warning and warning systems, for example, by supporting the roll-out of prototypes that the EU finances but which are not then taken up by the Member States. Lastly, in terms of the organisation of civil protection, I think it is also important to highlight the social changes that have occurred in the European population, which, to an increasing extent, is elderly, of foreign origin and concentrated in outlying areas where there is little infrastructure. Hence, there is a need to safeguard access and the possibility for this most vulnerable section of the population to be supported. Silvia Costa,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as everyone knows, being a woman is already an undertaking in itself, because it means having to manage and reconcile family, professional and social life, in a context that still does not adequately recognise the high level of education (as Commissioner Reding mentioned earlier), professionalism and expectations of women. I appreciate that in this report Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou has worked extremely hard to collect numerous proposals and objectives that, as a shadow rapporteur and member of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I advanced together with several of my colleagues. In the European Union women are under-represented, as they are in management positions in companies, currently making up only 12% of the membership of boards of directors of listed companies. Against this background we are happy to have heard the serious commitment of Commissioner Reding, and we call on the European Commission to propose legislation including mandatory quotas by 2012, to increase percentages to 30% by 2015 and to 40% by 2020, if the steps taken by companies and the Member States are found to be inadequate. In this regard it is an encouraging sign that six countries, including Italy in the last few days, have approved legislation along these lines with a bipartisan vote. I would like to clarify that these quotas are not just numerical, but also aim to achieve better performance in the corporate system, by sharing the management not just of large enterprises, but also of small and medium-sized enterprises. This is why we are proposing the use of several instruments under corporate social responsibility, including family-friendly services, flexi-time working arrangements, and management training for women. It is also important to recognise the link between the presence of competences and women’s roles in corporate governance with a different approach to process management, optimal use of human resources, anti-discrimination rules and sustainable productivity which they often guarantee. I would like to raise another point also in response to what Mr Bauer rightly said earlier, and that is that we have not merely just included female quotas, but we have also included an important mechanism, which was our own proposal, and that is that the joint presence of men and women is linked to greater transparency in appointments, in the selection of men and women, so that this is a benefit for everyone, not just for women. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Mr President, it is highly significant that Parliament is using this resolution to send a strong message to both the Member States and the younger generations to ask for greater commitment to European cooperation on learning, vocational training and higher education in order to bolster the Europe 2020 strategy. We know that youth unemployment has severe repercussions on poverty and social exclusion, as does the prolonged period of insecurity in which 40% of European young people live. Strong backing should be given to a combination of education policies and a new incentive-based welfare system for enterprises that provide full-time employment for young people and women. Ensuring that the skills being learned are in line with the competences – including for citizenship – required for the new goals of sustainable and intelligent growth is essential, as are policies for the transition from education to the workplace and speeding up the recognition of professional qualifications, titles and academic credits. Those Member States which, like my own, are cutting resources for education and research at a time of crisis must know that they are hurting young people, and hurting the future of Europe. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, in an ageing Europe that is struggling to find answers to the global challenges of the future, the European Union and its Member States must seize this strong stimulus from Parliament to demonstrate that they can be more courageous, investing in future generations, in education and in culture. With these four reports and the Sarajevo proposal, Parliament calls for these issues to be placed at the heart of the Europe 2020 strategy. In particular, the economic advantages, as well as those in employment and innovation, are highlighted by the report on cultural and creative industries, which already account for almost 3% of Europe’s gross product and employ 5 million people – a figure which rises to 7% if ancillary industries are taken into account. As shadow rapporteur for this measure for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists &amp; Democrats in the European Parliament, I am pleased to see that the rapporteur, Mrs Sanchez-Schmid, has welcomed our amendments. What did we propose? First of all, that cultural tourism and fashion should be added to the eight sectors already included. We also hope that the Commission – and I am sure that Mrs Vassiliou will take action to ensure this happens – will submit a White Paper on cultural and creative industries as soon as possible in order to strengthen this cross-sectoral strategy throughout Europe and the Member States. Cutting funds for culture and education at times of crisis – as my country is doing, on the grounds that culture is not essential to survival – means failing to invest in the future and in smart, inclusive growth; it means failing to understand that culture is essential for life. The report states that the European status of artists and of those engaged in creative professions should be officially recognised, and that in cultural industry, small and medium-sized enterprises should be fully recognised as such for the purposes of access to credit and support when starting up, especially for young people under the age of 35. It also promises to protect jobs, and to introduce specific training and innovative financial instruments, bearing in mind that capital in the creative sector often consists of values that are intangible but nonetheless crucial for innovation in all sectors. The Europe-wide cultural sector must be taken into consideration in the legal framework for international trade, certainly in the European dimension and in cultural diplomacy, in the internal market, in mobility … (The President cut off the speaker) Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, naturally, I wish to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur on this report which really signals a significant step forward in EU policies, in its invitation to the Commission to submit a proposal for a directive on the procedures to be adopted by Member States to recognise, and possibly revoke, international protection. I believe that the events of recent days between the African and European coasts indicate that we need the ‘asylum package’ – as it is to be called – to become a binding rule. In particular, I think of the positive amendments that were approved; for example, the whole question of greater safeguards with regard to minors, since I believe that children must not be detained under any circumstance (which is exactly what has been happening in Lampedusa, where children have been treated in exactly the same way as adults, together with adults, often in totally unacceptable conditions). It would have been better to have this directive in place before these dramatic events took place in Europe and Africa. Another very important issue is that of vulnerable people and their issues, especially women, and problems relating to family matters and reunions. Congratulations also to the rapporteur. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as some of my fellow Members have already said, I think that by voting in favour of this report by Mrs Svensson we are making a commitment to ensuring that the Commission fulfils its pledge to adopt a Communication, before the end of 2011, for the implementation of a strategy and a European action plan to combat violence against women, which will take a global view and therefore include all the different cases, from sexual violence to domestic violence and female genital mutilation, and – I hope – all the new forms of violence. I am referring to the actual inducement to violence, which is often carried out by advertising and the media, as well as the forms of blackmail and violations of women’s human rights that occur in the workplace when they decide they want to become mothers or are already working mothers. Following the implementation and adoption of the directive on trafficking in human beings – to which Parliament was very committed – and the directive on the European Protection Order, I think it would be important to have a proper directive on this issue within the new legal framework created by the Treaty of Lisbon and the Stockholm Programme. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Svensson. We know that violence against women and children is increasing across Europe. For this reason, we urge the Commission to submit a proposal, as it has already promised, for a strategy on violence against women by 2011. This should be all-inclusive, in the sense that it should cover domestic violence and genital mutilation, but also some more insidious forms. I am thinking of severe discrimination and bullying in the workplace against women who are pregnant or intend to marry and who are called on to resign beforehand, which is something that happens in my country but is no longer a crime as it was in the past. I am also thinking of what can only be described as the incitement to violence perpetrated by the media and advertising. After the directive on trafficking in human beings and the imminent directive on the victims of violence, announced by Commissioner Malmström, I think that the Treaty of Lisbon has laid the basis for achieving greater legal harmonisation in the way Member States acknowledge the importance of crimes of violence against women and children as specific forms of violence, as well as defining the essential standards of services for consulting, legal assistance and protection for women and children in cooperation with NGOs. It will also lead to consistent and comparable statistics with impact analyses of forms of prevention and enforcement by Member States to ensure a reduction in violence. I think, in this respect, that there is a common will by Parliament – I was one of the signatories to the written declaration – to define a year of reflection across Europe on the theme of violence, and I think that Parliament can add its very strong and very influential voice to this. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to ask my fellow MEP who spoke just now if it can really be considered appropriate to apply the terms ‘freeloaders’ and ‘fortune seekers’ to people who are fleeing from a situation of great political distress – and all the political groups agree on this – such as the one in North Africa. I find this to be an extremely serious allegation and call on the President to somehow highlight what has been said and establish whether this can be considered appropriate in such a sensitive debate that touches on the suffering of human beings, who are clearly not considered to have the right to eat, as it has been said of them ‘they even demand food and are lot of freeloaders’. I find it very serious that this has been said in this House and I hope that European citizens can read this extremely harsh utterance, which only serves to reveal the total political inadequacy of the person who said it. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteurs and I also dedicate this 8 March to the women of North Africa and the Middle East, such as the many women who, at this moment, are demonstrating in Cairo and Iran and fighting for democracy and liberty in their countries. In this respect, I hope that firm measures will be taken, including in the external actions of the European Commission, to establish links with these women. Even in Europe, there is a great reawakening of women’s participation, starting with demands to respect the dignity of women in the media and in the behaviour of men in institutions, as was said in town squares on 13 February by 1 million Italian women and many concerned men. As for the reports under discussion, I would note that there is a strong link between growing insecurity at work and in the lives of young women, even though they are better educated and more skilled, the inadequate protection of atypical female workers – which most young women are – during maternity and parenthood, the shortcomings of current policies for achieving balance and the lower rates of female employment, the more frequent instances of poverty among women and children, and the lower level of their pensions and, hence, their exclusion from decision-making powers. While I agree with Mrs Reding’s initiative concerning boards of directors, I am less supportive of the initiative on insurance which risks penalising women in particular. Without this, there will be no Europe 2020. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, I voted for this resolution because I believe that the compromise reached with such difficulty within our committee is essentially positive, insofar as it is a tool to remind Member States to ensure that pensions are adequate, sustainable and portable throughout Europe, in the context of a significantly ageing population. I would however like to make three criticisms, which I hope the European Commission will implement in the coming White Paper. The first is the lack of recognition of the importance of the third pillar in pension systems. Second, although the difference in retirement income between men and women resulting from the pay gap, breaks for periods of care and greater unemployment among women has been acknowledged, there are no flexibility criteria for women of retirement age who cease to be employed, and there is no adequate recognition of periods of care for the purpose of defining retirement age. This would, however, be desirable. Thirdly, European citizens’ right to a common programme of welfare education and information about their pension and insurance situation should be affirmed, in particular for young people and workers throughout the course of their working lives. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, during a stage in its life in which Europe is undergoing a crisis of identity and prospects, I think that the establishment of a European Heritage Label that identifies those sites – both material and immaterial – of high symbolic and educational value for the history, culture and creation of the European Union, is particularly significant. My sincere thanks go to the rapporteur, Mrs Paliadeli, who efficiently took on board the proposals and additions suggested by many of us in the Committee on Culture and Education, providing, in particular, for procedures that are more certain and more respectful of the Treaty of Lisbon with regard to the subdivision of tasks among Member States, the Commission, the Council and Parliament. As some of my fellow Members have picked up on, we also strove to make sure there was no overlap between the label and other initiatives of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) or the European Council’s historic and cultural itineraries. Indeed, on the basis of well-defined criteria, the Member States will present not more than two actively managed sites every two years. This is an important point: the Member States must show that they believe in the sites and therefore manage them in an educational way, involving the people. The Commission, meanwhile, will be responsible for pre-selection after hearing from a panel of experts, but it will also assume a monitoring role, will assess the effectiveness of the management of the sites every six years, and may also withdraw the label. Parliament comes out of this with a stronger role because not only does it appoint four of the 16 members of the European panel, but also because it has an active relationship with the list of pre-selected sites. I also support the solution provided to the complex problem of the marks already assigned on an intergovernmental basis to many Member States that, in any case, though not suitable for the new system and the new criteria, will retain their earlier mark and will not therefore be downgraded. I also appreciate the priority given to transnational sites, which will be a very interesting challenge for Europe, and the role assigned to the Committee of the Regions as part of an approach of subsidiarity, as well as the emphasis on the necessary involvement of Member States in the selection phase, including municipalities and regions, in order to avoid their being only partially involved. However, I think an extra effort by the Member States would also be useful. It would be very important for them to launch competitions aimed at young people in schools and universities to start a process to identify the sites, which would also become a way to reconstruct a common European history and destiny and mean that they, too, would contribute to the sense of belonging and European citizenship.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if this programme is brought to fruition today, it is thanks to the determination of Mrs Pack and the will of Commissioner Vassiliou. As an Italian-Swiss citizen, I am happy that Switzerland is the first country from outside the European Union to participate in EU education programmes for young people, both in higher education and continuing skills training. Indeed, let us remember that even if Switzerland is not part of the European Union, it has made a major contribution to building the values and freedoms that are a shared heritage of the European continent. It is a symptom of the success of programmes such as ‘Youth in Action’ that Switzerland requests that the mobility of our European programmes be extended to their young people and therefore, it is of significant importance that Switzerland is not only requesting a larger economic area but also a larger educational area. I believe that it will be very interesting for the young people of the European Union and Switzerland to get to know each other better, and I am sure that this will lay foundations that will also have an influence on the future of the European Union.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, through this proposal for a directive – for which I should like to express my great thanks to the rapporteurs, with whom I worked as a shadow – Parliament is supporting and expanding the Council’s proposal, which was designed to protect people across all 27 Member States who suffer forms of persecution or serious and repeated threats from known and previously identified persons – often ex-boyfriends, husbands or partners – who threaten their physical and sexual integrity, dignity and personal freedom. Indeed, the number of attacks and killings – particularly against women – is on the increase. Their complaints are often not taken seriously enough by the police and the judiciary, and protection orders and measures against the aggressor are currently only valid in the country in which they are issued. Commissioner Reding, the measure under approval may not be perfect, but it plugs a legislative vacuum. After all, in creating the European area of freedom, security and justice, we have always acted empirically, at times pushing matters through where necessary. Indeed, we believe that this initiative is important because it will allow all citizens of the European Union – men and women – and all European residents to travel freely across borders, taking their human rights and their rights to protection and security with them, as stated in Article 3 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which we in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament intended as the legal basis, in order to give a more coherent direction to the structure of the proposal. Through the establishment of the European Protection Order, the protected person is guaranteed to be looked after even in other Member States, through a fast and free-of-charge procedure. Each Member State must appoint a competent authority to inform victims of their rights, carry out campaigns, collect statistics and inform the person as soon as their national protection order has been issued. Furthermore, it gives a great boost to the creation of the European legal area and the implementation of freedom of movement, and it also applies the ordinary legislative procedure involving codecision between the Council and Parliament for the first time. I hope that the Council will confirm this commitment and I hope that the Commission – though showing particular attention to the coming ‘Security for Victims’ package of measures – does not miss this particular chance to respond right now to this extremely serious situation, which is also demonstrated by European and national statistics. Amongst other things, this could lead to important legal convergence among Member States. I would therefore suggest that we avoid any delays and make a specific commitment to this particular type of victim protection. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur, I should like to thank the rapporteurs and say that I think this directive is extraordinarily important because it is the first time that the European Union has taken legally binding action in the fight against the trafficking of human beings. Fifty years after the United Nations convention, there are still hundreds of thousands of people in our civilised Europe – mainly women and children – who are reduced to slavery. For the first time, the EU is equipped with a single instrument to fight against the trafficking of human beings, whether for reasons of sexual or labour exploitation, including forced begging. Our group had three priorities: to hit traffickers with uniform, more severe sanctions, including confiscating assets and using them to support the victims of trafficking; to ensure a high level of protection and social rehabilitation for victims, with free legal representation and immunity from prosecution for crimes committed in connection with being trafficked; and to promote the crucial role of the non-governmental organisations, both secular and religious, that work to support the victims. However, I am hoping for a revision of the 2004 directive on the resident permit for victims. I would also underline that in the proposal, we provide for the safeguarding of children through strengthened measures and I support Commissioner Malmström’s call for further measures against sex tourism and child pornography. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, I believe that Parliament has a great opportunity today to reiterate that motherhood is a social value, that the protection of a mother’s health and that of her child must be strengthened, that a female worker must not be discriminated against for being a mother in finding and keeping a job, and that childcare should be better shared with fathers. Notwithstanding the current crisis – as has already been highlighted – we must make the same observation which has already been made by the most advanced economists: the impact assessment which has been carried out shows the need for a more far-sighted and holistic approach. Today’s costs, which can potentially be staggered, are a social and economic investment in the greater well-being of children, fewer diseases and the greater participation of women in the labour market. Many claim that there will not be an increased and appropriately trained and qualified female workforce without a new welfare system and new opportunities to achieve a work-life balance: I fully agree with and thank the rapporteurs, Mrs Estrela and Mrs Plumb, for the complex work they have carried out, as I do all Members who have strived to find common ground. I also agree with the facility which, I believe, many of us wanted, and which will provide mothers of disabled children, and in the case of adoptions and multiple births, with greater opportunities to have flexible working hours, the reversal of the burden of proof against breaches of the law and greater protection from dismissal. Furthermore, I proposed, together with other Members, that with respect to the compulsory six weeks’ leave following childbirth, a safeguard clause be provided for those countries where legislation provides this compulsory period prior to childbirth too. In conclusion, I hope that now, over these two days, we will be willing to find common ground so that we do not miss the important opportunity to adopt this directive in this parliamentary term as well.

 Mr President, I should like to express my support for maintaining the European Social Fund’s own budget and rules, albeit with a view to its greater integration with all the other Structural Funds. However, the rules need to be revised in at least five areas: we need more simplification and more monitoring of results and not just of procedures; we need to really make the most of experience such as that gained in the Italian regions over the last two years, to offer integrated packages of guidance, training, retraining and support to help integrate workers who have been made redundant or who are unemployed into SMEs; we need to promote training partnerships between educational training institutions, universities and businesses in order to provide opportunities for continuous training that take into account the need for new skills; we need more transnational projects, which, until now, have only been experimental; and we need more national and transnational work-study initiatives for young people. I believe that it is on the basis of these points, among others, that we need to reconsider the prospect of introducing new rules for the European Social Fund. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, through this debate – which frankly I was hoping would be rather better attended, because it deserves far greater participation – Parliament is seeking to add its voice to that of so many others around the world who have come out in recent days against the tragic death sentence by stoning for Sakineh Mohammadi-Ashtiani, after the appeal by her son Sajad, and to save all the other women sentenced to death or unjustly imprisoned, like Zahra Bahrami, in summary trials in Iran. In this age of globalisation, it is even more obvious that human rights and women’s rights are inseparable. If a woman dies after being tortured by stoning, our consciences and our freedoms will be stoned with her. In our resolution, we urge both the European Union’s High Representative, Catherine Ashton, and the Commissioner for Human Rights, Viviane Reding – two powerful women – without further delay, to take all necessary steps with the Iranian Government and in international forums for the death sentence for Sakineh to be rescinded, for Zahra to be released, for the barbaric practice of stoning to be abandoned, and for renewed efforts to be made in the battle to achieve a moratorium on the death sentence and also to support the democratic opposition in Iran. We, the Italian female Members in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, together with all our fellow Members, are holding a candlelight vigil tomorrow evening here in the courtyard of the European Parliament in Strasbourg. We are calling it ‘A light for Sakineh’s life’, and we ask all Members to take part so that darkness does not fall over this tragic, highly symbolic affair and so that the Iranian people and the Iranian opposition are not abandoned. We are calling for more robust intervention from the Union because we believe that the defence of human rights, here and around the world, is an area where the European Union’s credibility and identity are at stake.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteurs – whom I thank – have raised a key issue, which Commissioner Reding has also addressed in part. We must ensure that policies for women and for equal opportunities are incorporated and integrated more effectively into general policies at European and national level alike. I am thinking of the crisis, poverty, development, cooperation, employment and welfare. I believe, however, that there are three issues that should be emphasised by the Commission, by us in our work and by the Member States. Firstly, I would like Commissioner Reding to emphasise the role of women in the European Union’s external action. A new policy of which women must be made more aware is contained in Mrs Figueiredo’s report. The second issue is that of the Commission’s support for the draft directive on the European Protection Order, which is a tool of fundamental importance for guaranteeing the … (The President cut off the speaker) Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 10 years since the introduction of the Lisbon Strategy and on the eve of the Europe 2020 strategy, in the middle of a full economic, social and employment crisis, we know that we cannot come out of this crisis, nor lay the foundations for new and sustainable growth and a new social cohesion, as you have said, unless we strengthen the mechanisms and instruments that the European Union has at its disposal to sustain investment in the knowledge triangle: education, training and research. Just now, Commissioner, you confirmed that as regards this objective, some European governments are performing well, others a little less so. In order not to fall within the limits revealed by the Lisbon Strategy, I believe that in this area, the Commission has to strengthen the open method of coordination with Member States, provide incentives and penalties in the European Social Fund and monitor the results. I do not consider it to be consistent for governments, as the Italian Government has done, to cut EUR 8 billion in three years from education and the universities, without reinvesting the savings in these areas, especially as we have a 19% early school leaving rate and 25% youth unemployment. In conclusion, do you not consider it opportune to strengthen the legal powers in Directive 2005/36/EC to facilitate the mutual recognition of professional qualifications among Member States? According to Professor Monti’s report, currently, less than 3% of European workers in fact work in another Member State, and one of the reasons seems to be precisely this difficult issue of mutual recognition of qualifications.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Beijing +15 is confronted this year with a financial, economic and employment crisis that is having a negative impact on the living and working conditions of millions of women throughout Europe and the world, but which may represent an opportunity to review development models, the organisation of the labour market and social policies. In strengthening the Beijing +15 objectives, the European Union must prioritise, on behalf of women, policies for providing access to environmental resources and credit, including by means of micro-finance; the balance between family life and work life, including by means of the adoption of the directive on parental leave; training policies and incentives for businesses that employ young people and women; and the fight against trafficking in human beings with a new directive, which we hope will be based on the resolution approved during the last part-session in Strasbourg. Above all, we must focus development cooperation support on the empowerment of women in the poorest countries, and in African countries in particular, building a possible Euro-African alliance with the women. It would be good – I am addressing the Commissioner and the President here – if the European delegation in New York promoted and gained support for the campaign to award the Nobel Peace Prize to the women of Africa, symbolically represented by the leaders of associations active in those countries worst affected by conflicts and poverty.

Madam President, Commissioner Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is very important for the European Parliament to take the opportunity offered by this debate with a view to the March elections in Iraq. The Iraqi political process has shown itself to be important – even if, as you were saying, interesting – but still very fragile. It is thus even more important to do everything possible to consolidate and strengthen the country’s new institutions and the political equilibrium which sustains them. We believe this to be a vital objective if we wish the first substantial withdrawal of US troops to occur in August without it having serious consequences on the country’s internal situation. The coexistence of Shi’ites, Sunnis and Kurds which is today embodied in the federal structures should be guaranteed by new laws, as well as by a political consensus involving all these parties. On this point, concerns are being aroused – and we would also like your view on this – by the electoral commission’s recent decision to bar many candidates and parties with close links to Sunnis or Christians, thus running the risk of weakening the already fragile democratic process in Iraq. Through the measures undertaken, the European Union must follow this electoral process, as you have said, but also be more ambitious in the development of relations with Iraq. The Union’s EUJUST LEX programme directly involves us in the process of improving Iraqi legislation and democratic institutions, and we, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, consider it a positive sign that the Council has decided to extend the mission until 30 August 2010. The EU should continue to maintain strong support for Iraq through its cooperation programmes, with the aim of participating in the process to stabilise and develop the country, and after the elections, it should strengthen relations between the parliaments. It should be remembered that many Member States are working with Iraq, including Italy, with the important cultural cooperation programme. Iraq’s political equilibrium is essential not only for the country but also in terms of the role that Iraq can play in the region strategically, with the aim of overcoming existing conflicts and securing peace. In this sense, the improvement of relations with Turkey by the regional government of Kurdistan constitutes a positive step in that direction. However, as we know, Iraq remains a country with very serious problems in relation to security, respect for democracy and human rights, as well as economic insecurity. It is the most vulnerable groups, such as refugees – forming 10% of the population – ethnic minorities, women, religious minorities and children who are suffering the negative impact of this situation. We must therefore play a still more incisive role in this area – I am just finishing – partly through support for local and European NGOs working in Iraq and, in this regard, women can also be involved as strategic figures to overcome some of the population’s difficulties.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my great satisfaction that today we are tackling a subject like this with an important question, for which I warmly thank the authors, and I would also like to express my gratitude for the high level of cooperation that we have seen between all the political parties and the two committees. I am also very happy to have heard very serious commitments voiced by the Commission and also by the Spanish Presidency, and I truly hope that the new directive will soon be drafted along the lines that essentially seem to enjoy a large consensus. I think we know that the numbers in this field are very complex to analyse, but in brief, we are talking about almost 300 000 people, 79% of them women, many of them minors, being trafficked every year in our civilised Europe. Unfortunately, numbers have been rising in recent years. For this reason, too, we need to make very strong progress in the light of the new areas of responsibility that the European Union has and also in the light of what we have already approved in the Stockholm Programme to bring in some innovations. It was a great step forward when we approved, at EU level, the provision – which, for example, had already been in force in Italy since 1998 – allowing humanitarian residence permits to be issued to victims. However, we must also make progress on safeguarding victims in relation to protection, social and employment reintegration, the possibility of preventing there being customers – which we must think very seriously about – and more serious and effective measures on sanctions which must, as you said, Commissioner, be harmonised at EU level. In particular, we ask that the consent of victims to their exploitation be considered irrelevant, in view of the high level of blackmail involved in these circumstances. I will conclude very shortly, just adding this: we need not only special protection for minors but, above all, also forms of support for persons arriving in Europe who have already previously suffered forms of trafficking along the journeys, ever longer and ever more tragic, that they complete before reaching our coasts and our territories.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it would be very important for 2010, the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, to mark the birth of a new Community financial instrument, dedicated to microfinance, aimed at those who are disadvantaged in accessing the banking system but who have micro-enterprise plans. As we are aware, micro-credit has proved to be an extraordinary tool for creating self-entrepreneurship opportunities and widespread social value in developing countries, particularly for women. It has become a new strategy of the United Nations and of the World Bank, but it has also been trialled with positive results in many countries, in many European Member States, including Italy, particularly for immigrants, women and young people. By adopting this report, Parliament is providing, in the midst of a serious economic and financial crisis, not only a strategic opportunity for social inclusion but also a positive challenge to the banking system, since it is developing a new approach and new powers, in collaboration with non-profit bodies and local and national institutions. I welcome the adoption of many amendments, which I will not go over again, but I would like to say that today we are asking not just for micro-credit resources, but we are also asking that micro-credit … (The President cut off the speaker) Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to dedicate this International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women to the memory of Anna Politkovskaya, a journalist and a woman who paid for her love of truth with her life, to the African women in conflicts, and to the many forms of suffering of women in Europe that often go unobserved. These examples are at odds with the degraded and consumerist image that the media often attaches to female identity, helping to create a culture where women are oppressed and humiliated. This is also a serious form of violence against which Europe must speak out and intervene in. We must urgently set up a consistent European system for statistical recording – it has been said more than once – with particular reference to minors, trafficking, physical and sexual violence, and women in vulnerable categories, such as immigrants. Yet we would also like to see tangible results from the European Union guidelines on women in armed conflict, which the Commissioner also mentioned previously, at least through the provision of financial and other support for projects, often organised by small associations, local NGOs, including in countries concerned with reintegrating and assisting women who are victims of violence. We are aware that today, we have a new possibility, as offered by the Treaty of Lisbon and the Stockholm Programme, to enshrine this preventive action within the Community. However, we must also denounce another aspect of violence: the context in which violence takes place. Alcohol- and drug-related violence is growing among young people and minors, and perhaps we do not mention this often enough when we discuss violence against women.Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me first thank Mr Leichtfried for this document. It is important because it provides better definition of the interinstitutional relations between Parliament and the Commission on an extremely sensitive question: Parliament’s powers have been extended in the area of trade, which was not part its competences under the ordinary legislative procedure. There is therefore a fundamental problem, not with the Regulations we are amending today, which are being adapted to a new regime, but in terms of the relations between the European Parliament and the Commission. In this regard, although I welcome Mr Leichtfried’s report, I am not at all pleased with the views expressed by the Commissioner in this House. The relationship between Parliament and the Commission is still overly technical. There is an evident and continuous effort by the Commission and the Council to reduce relations with the European Parliament to their pre-Lisbon level and we cannot allow this to happen. Limiting the powers of the Commission is an important step that should result in more parliamentary control and make the Commission act in a more focused manner. Only in this way can we respond to the problems raised by Mr Salvini: I completely agree that the EU’s exclusive competence in the area of trade policy should be maintained, and that the EU’s power should be increased over that of the individual Member States. However, we must also be stronger within the World Trade Organisation, in the knowledge that unless we pay more attention to the real economy, we will never emerge from the current crisis. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that on your travels around Europe in this difficult period – especially given your competencies in some key areas at this time of crisis – you will have had a chance to ‘see for yourself’ the situation in which Europe finds itself. I say this because the last thing I would like in the present case is to find myself agreeing with Mr Salvini. We must be aware of the situation we face: we know that China represents a great opportunity, and not simply great problem. It represents an opportunity for those enterprises that export EUR 170 billion worth of goods to China each year, although we also import EUR 250 billion and are only too aware that this represents a trade deficit. However, if we do not introduce strict and exact rules on fair trade, we will end up by fuelling and increasing the wave of anti-European sentiment against the EU institutions. What else do we need to say or do to make you understand in that ivory tower that is the European Commission what kind of situation we are facing? These continuous sermons on innovation and development mean very little to the sector we are dealing with here, which is at the cutting edge in terms of innovation and development! So all of you, and all of the gnomes that live inside the offices of the Commission, cannot but be aware that the timetables that you are proposing do not do justice to Europe and the problems we are facing! I think that you should make an effort to understand that for the largest economic power in the world to impose the rules of fair trade simply means enhancing its own dignity, showing that it understands how to live within the great global village of the present with a sense of dignity. Currently Europe is not managing to do this in a way that benefits its citizens. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, nobody in this Parliament is in any doubt that the importance of the measure that we will be voting this evening goes well beyond the specific issue we are discussing. I have always considered myself to be a friend of Israel and I personally have no doubt that the conflict that has pitted a large part of the Arab world against Israel for decades is due mainly – if not exclusively – to the fact that too many in the Arab world do not want to recognise the right of the State of Israel to exist. Having said that, however, we must also strongly condemn the repeated violations of international law and of the agreements signed by the Israeli Government, which have led to a downward spiral that Israel should – precisely because it claims to be the only democracy in the Middle East – make a definite effort to end. We therefore request that this report be referred back to the Committee on International Trade and be shelved until Israel takes decisive steps towards dismantling its settlements in illegally occupied Palestinian territory and until it shows more respect for the Palestinian people’s right to exist. Such signals can be encouraged by a more effective European Foreign policy in the area, which today is altogether lacking. Despite the fact that I am not voting in favour of the measure, I believe that Parliament should at least support the amendments by Mr Moreira, Ms De Keyser and Ms Schaake, aimed at preventing the extension of the advantages for Israel under this measure to products originating from the unlawfully Occupied Territories. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I voted in favour of this proposal on trade and economic relations between the EU and the United States, in part because of the important, balanced and complete report drawn up by Mr Moreira, for which I thank him. The proposal offers us a complete framework of the commercial and economic prospects and of the difficulties and challenges involved in the meeting of the two main world economies that together account for about half of global economic output and nearly a third of world trade flows. After many years of deadlock, we are now approaching a possible turnaround in bilateral relations, with the prospect of a far-reaching agreement between Europe and the United States that could open up positive scenarios for transatlantic relations. Naturally there are questions relating to tariff barriers, and an agreement of this scope would have to aim to remove the many trade and technical barriers that unfortunately persist. It would also deal with other important issues, such as the protection of indications of origin, the opening up of the public procurement markets and harmonisation of rules of origin and regulatory standards, including health and plant protection standards, where there is still too much divergence. However, this in no way detracts from the steps being taken. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution before Parliament is an important policy document taking account of the ambitions and concerns that European manufacturers have for some time held with regard to a country that is both a great opportunity for our economy and a great problem. The EU and Japan together represent more than a third of world GDP and more than 20 % of world trade. These figures alone give us an idea of the importance of the upcoming negotiations. I would have preferred Japan to send out stronger signals than it has done, in my opinion. The most important question remains the removal of the numerous non-tariff barriers (NTBs) by the Japanese as well as regulatory barriers that cannot merely be ascribed to cultural differences. Such removal should be seen as a precondition for reaching a mutually balanced and mutually advantageous agreement. The outcomes on public procurement and the automotive sector seem particularly decisive for a successful conclusion to negotiations. Japan should open up its market to the same extent as the EU in a spirit of real reciprocity, in particular with regard to NTBs in the automotive sector such as the ‘zoning regulations’ and special fiscal treatment for ‘key cars’.
 The question of indications of origin for agro-food products including wines and spirits is also important. Parliament should also ensure that it is continuously informed on the progress of negotiations and that the Commission carry out a second assessment of the impact of a possible free trade agreement with Japan, in particular with regard to more sensitive sectors such as the automotive and electronics industries. This is the only manner in which to provide proper protection to European manufacturing sectors at a time of crisis without compromising our commitment to free, sustainable and fair trade.

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Leichtfried, the negotiations on the trade agreement with Colombia, Peru and Central America and the corresponding stabilisation mechanisms and safeguard clauses have kept many of us and the Committee on International Trade very busy. We are in favour of the proposed regulations because they secure a balance between various demands, all of them referring back to the principles of free trade, attending to Union interests, and international trade as a tool for growth and development based on environmental sustainability and respect for human rights. In particular, these regulations are designed to protect European companies and consequently the workers they employ – our farmers – especially those in the outermost regions of the European Union. The safeguards and stabilisation mechanisms are effective for a limited time only, and we believe that the time period suggested is long enough for us to adapt our production system to the liberalisation measures included in the agreements and also for the countries in question to increase their exports considerably. That is why we voted in favour. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

– (IT) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on this issue, there should have been a more respectful approach towards the prerogatives of Parliament, towards the need to avoid a confused agreement which tends to regulate matters that are, in themselves, too diverse. I will be voting against the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) not because I am convinced that the fundamental rights of the Union are truly being violated to the core, but because counterfeiting and online piracy cannot be fought with the same weapons, almost as if counterfeiting a handbag or a drug is similar to downloading a song or a film from the Internet. I am against ACTA because the Commission and the Council hitherto have not yet regulated in a credible way an issue that is so very much in the limelight in the digital age, such as the protection of intellectual property on the web. I am opposed because current legislation would already enable action to be taken against those countries that make a living out of counterfeiting. I conclude by reiterating my opposition to an agreement that touches on highly sensitive issues, but does so in an inefficient, confused way, lacking a legal framework that is the only thing which would allow me to do anything other than vote against, as I shall be doing tomorrow.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, while we appreciate the care with which they were formulated, your answers only partly give us peace of mind. We are facing a highly political issue, not just a commercial one: formal consistency between this agreement and the more general association agreement with Israel cannot justify the sort of subterfuge that facilitates infringing the prohibition that international law has imposed on Israel regarding products made in the occupied territories. I understand our economic interests, I also understand the technical scope of this protocol, but I believe the European Union should undertake a careful review of the origin of the products, because no protocol or agreement can ignore the more general context which prevails today. The repeated violations on this point by Israel do not help the process of détente which we all feel is required and which needs the European Union to be an active part of the solution.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to explain my vote also in relation to Ms Ferreira’s report, because it seems to me that it is the right time to overcome the contradiction between growth and austerity, which is at risk of becoming outdated. Today, we have spoken in favour of growth and, at the same time, in favour of recovery. There is a contradiction when we say that we do not want to adopt a report like Mr Gauzès’s, on which I abstained for reasons I will explain, and then at the same time we call for a consolidated European budget and fiscal union. We need fiscal union, we need to monitor the budgets of Member States and, at the same time, encourage growth with the amendments we have presented and voted for in Ms Ferreira’s report. I therefore believe that we have done something important. We have done it even though Mr Gauzès’s report contains an article – Article 10 – which sends a negative message to the markets, as it concerns controlled default procedures, which we should not even talk about at the moment because we have to show the European public that we want to move forward with the euro and with greater integration.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the prudence with which the Commission is looking at the new system of relations between the first and the fourth largest economies in the world is a comfort to us. Deep underlying reasons, based on the history of our times, push for relations between the democracies of Europe and of the Rising Sun, based on the desire for friendship, development and the opening up of new opportunities. We cannot, however, overlook the fact that, amid all the distrust caused by long-term antagonism and by resentments that have not yet fully died down, the history of a system of relations in the name of multipolarity, overcoming the hegemony of the United States, is pushing us into new partnerships with the Far East. This has led to new forms of cooperation between China and Japan, shifting the balance that has become established since the Second World War and which must not be used against the European Union. The new set-ups which are being introduced at global level and in the major regions of the world thus require the European Union to be an enterprising key player, both by strengthening the multilateral approach and through bilateral relationships that will help Europe strengthen its competitiveness. For these political and economic reasons, we fully support your efforts to create conditions that will improve the system of relations between ourselves and Japan. However, we are not willing to begin negotiations unless the Council first involves Parliament in drafting the negotiating mandate. Although, formally, Parliament has the power to conclude the negotiation process by ratifying, or otherwise, any treaties that have been signed, it is equally true that parliaments throughout the world, due to their democratic legitimacy, have always been involved in drawing up the policies that underlie negotiating mandates. Europe needs to follow not only the letter but also the spirit of the treaties, so we call upon the Council, in this as in other cases, to duly take this into account. Finally, acknowledging the words of the Commissioner, we stress that it is imperative that Japan prove it wishes to break down tariff and especially non-tariff barriers that still dominate its domestic market. It is not therefore our intention to impede negotiations, but to assume responsibility for the growing demand within European public opinion, which fears that bringing together an open internal market such as ours with the increasingly closed markets of our main competitors will, in the end, damage our competitiveness and, with it, growth and employment.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are duty bound to acknowledge the positive elements in the Commission proposal on which, following the improvements proposed by the Committee on International Trade (INTA), we will be asked to vote. However, from a methodological point of view, I honestly do not agree with concluding at first reading a matter that will only become effective from 2014 onwards, and which divests Parliament of the power to exert its full potential on such an important issue. Looking at the substance, I believe that the positive elements in the new regulation are not fully compensated by the persistence of negative issues that adversely affect the interests of industrial sectors that have already been severely tested in Europe by a globalisation governed neither by multilateral rules nor by reciprocity. One positive aspect, however, is the new geographical coverage owing to the principle of differentiation, which provides a boost for the poorest nations. Equally useful is the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance, known as ‘GSP+’, linked to the implementation of the main international conventions on social, human and environmental rights. Also positive is the safeguard clause for the entire textile and clothing sector, as well as the general clause. However, the loosening of the financial criteria for the beneficiaries of the GSP+ regime and the exclusion from the graduation mechanism of nations that come under this scheme actually opens the door to unfair competition in relation to already heavily affected sectors, as I said, and gives priority to countries such as Pakistan, whose violations in the field of human rights must not be approved. In short, there is no doubt that this is a positive regulation, but the issues I mention cast a shadow over other aspects that we wished to consider. Gianluca Susta,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we speak of trade relations between China and the European Union, we evoke relationships which, on many occasions, have affected the course of history, as the pendulum has swung between East and West. The pendulum appears now to be firmly in the East. Europe seems to be labouring in China’s wake, as our second trading partner has seen its exports rise by 39.5% in just under two years. It is our loss if we view China only as a source of problems, as certain nationalist and protectionist elements on the political right have been trying to portray it for years, and not also as an opportunity. In the 21st century, however, the greatest world economies can work together only in an atmosphere of reciprocity, compliance with the rules, and intolerance of illegality, of unfair practices and of discrimination, to which we have grown accustomed after a great many absolutely unacceptable episodes. It is understandable that the pendulum of history is now swinging in favour of emerging countries. It is right that we open our markets. However, the Chinese Government has a number of unacceptable policies: protecting its country’s businesses while leaving our companies’ intellectual property inadequately safeguarded; the proliferation of technical barriers, sometimes much more burdensome than tariff barriers; keeping a closed procurement market; and an almost total disregard for the most basic social and human rights, as the oppression in Tibet shows. In the European Union, terms like ‘reciprocity’ and ‘traceability’ – which recall others, now long forgotten, like ‘transparency’ and ‘quality’ – must become a precondition for every trade agreement and every legislative initiative within the framework of a renewed multilateral policy. It is our duty, therefore, to keep our market open while protecting the Union’s interest from outside protectionism – from China and elsewhere – by demanding adequate quality standards for the goods and services available in the European Union market. This report addresses these matters with clarity, describes important solutions, and is heading in the right direction. It will therefore have our support. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I thank Mr Rinaldi for his broad-ranging report, which is worthy of support in political terms, and packed with ideal aims and practical proposals that will undoubtedly be looked upon with renewed hope by the people living on the shores of the Mediterranean after the revolutions that have taken place in their countries. We need a change of pace and a return to the spirit of the Barcelona Declaration in order to overcome the fragmentation characterising trade relations between the European Union and the Mediterranean countries. Only a short-sighted view of the EU’s strategic role could consider that a policy of greater integration with the countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean contradicts the EU’s western vocation. Trade governed by a balanced new free trade agreement could also represent an instrument of stability in a region criss-crossed by uprisings that have not yet perfected an approach to democracy, which also involves reducing inequality, strengthening production, better protection for civil and social rights, and commitment to avoiding Islamic fundamentalist tendencies. Of course, this does not just depend on us, on the European Union. It also depends on the tremendous difficulties of cooperation and integration experienced by the countries on the southern shores. However, to paraphrase a great writer, if the Mediterranean becomes a project once again rather than a state of affairs, together we can overcome the current political and economic obstacles that have prevented a good agreement being reached in the past. We need an EU initiative towards the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, to hold more in-depth talks about legislation with all countries in order to eliminate the excessive number of tariff and non-tariff barriers, and to open their markets up towards reciprocity, which means that a larger amount of aid must be tied to greater commitment on the part of our partners. In conclusion, I can only repeat my appreciation of this report and trust that the Commission will make it a priority objective of its political and administrative agenda. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the goals of the agreement are all highly commendable and it should therefore be adopted. However, we cannot forget the big social question that cuts across this sector: a trade that improves the quality of its product, offers fair prices and develops the industry cannot fail to bring about an improvement in the economic status and living conditions of 5.5 million smallholders and the 14 million workers who depend on cocoa production. Since the European cocoa industry is the biggest in the world, we must urge our processing companies to commit to fighting the exploitation of children and for a sustainable and fair cocoa supply chain. That is what this resolution sets out to achieve and that is why it deserves our support. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Mr President, the political importance of the convention under discussion today will be clear to everyone. The European Union is well consolidated, but a further process of integration within the confines of Europe and between Europe and the rest of the world on its borders is a prerequisite for strengthening this region in the new global balance of power. Once again, a modern framework for trade relations may be a useful point of compromise between those who believe that Europe should primarily have an Atlantic vocation and those who believe that a new balance of power in the Mediterranean is essential for building a democratic future for Europe. This convention brings together in an improved multilateral, if interregional, logic, all the different positions currently in force concerning the origin of goods traded with the participants in the Barcelona Process, the EFTA States, the Faroe Islands and all of the Balkan States participating in the Stabilisation and Association Process. By adopting a legal instrument of this kind, it will be easier in the future to have recourse to the pan-Euro-Mediterranean system of cumulation of origin, and therefore agree on preferential tariff treatment for Mediterranean goods, although the absence of a review clause and uniform provisions for the settlement of disputes must be lamented. Precisely for this reason, the convention may be an important element to help revive a process which began in Barcelona almost 20 years ago and to which various initiatives refer, some more convincing and effective than others, but all of them important, such as the Union for the Mediterranean, the trade road map agreed under the framework of that process. Ours is an ambitious goal, but a slow-moving one due to the imbalances that are still too strong between the two shores of the Mediterranean, the political instability that is still crossing the Middle East – which requires greater effort from the European Union to push Israel to respect the international agreements on the Occupied Territories – and on account of the uncertainties linked to the evolution of the Arab Spring in North Africa. These are all major outstanding issues, which require a strong political and diplomatic initiative from the European Union. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, the relevance to the EU of this agreement is more than just that of farmers in the south, although this is of course important. The southern shore of the Mediterranean will not develop peacefully or democratically if we retreat into autarchical nostalgia which could encourage the spread of anti-European sentiment on the African continent. Of course it would have been preferable to pursue a multilateral approach with the countries of North Africa, in order to avoid future inequalities. Nevertheless this agreement appears to be balanced. It does not threaten many of our traditional products. Quota restrictions on six out of the fifteen most sensitive products exported by Morocco will remain. New opportunities are opening up for some of our products and for those to which total liberalisation will apply. Finally, the safeguarding clause offers an additional protective mechanism in the event of serious damage. It is true, ladies and gentlemen, that this agreement does not resolve the ancestral issue of the Saharawi people. Every trade agreement needs to be accompanied by a courageous political initiative on the part of the EU to promote the values of liberty and justice in the world. However we cannot use the tragedy of the Saharawi people to safeguard a few individual sectoral economic interests. We can and must have the farsightedness of a trade policy vision that looks beyond its own immediate requirements – a vision that this agreement allows us to catch a glimpse of, and therefore I will vote for it. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of this report because, in these difficult times, a free and fair trading system based on principles of reciprocity and harmonisation within an enhanced multilateral framework is a fundamental prerequisite for development. We need to bring down customs duties, non-tariff barriers and protectionism, which is still too widespread, and not only in emerging countries. These are the most serious obstacles to creating an effective international trading system. Europe should be more aware of its role and should use its democratic, social, open model of political union to achieve stronger multilateral cooperation and bilateral agreements that are balanced, sustainable and respectful of civil and social rights. Europe, ladies and gentlemen, should play its role with authority, so as to eliminate distortions of competition by the main global players, and it should maintain the Generalised System of Preferences only to help lift the least-developed countries out of poverty. Such an approach will benefit our producers, workers and entrepreneurs, as well as those who look to Europe as a model for greater freedom and social justice in the world. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Mr President, as well as seeking to remedy its mistakes, Europe must also start investing in its future again. We have set ourselves an ambitious target: 75% employment for the 20-64 age group by 2020. However, just as it is inconceivable that only public expenditure will drive new investment for growth, there will be no new jobs if we do not stimulate private investment in innovative sectors and youth hiring; if more training - better training - is not carried out; if budget, fiscal, pensions and welfare policies are not harmonised across the EU; and if the labour market is not made to be more flexible, making contract negotiations more in tune with and proximate to the needs of businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, while also respecting fundamental rights. My vote in favour of the report by Ms Bastos is an act of faith in the EU institutions and in their ability – albeit late in the day – to pull the leading world economy out of the crisis without distorting the European social model. At the same time, however, the institutions must succeed in releasing the hidden energy reserves in Europe’s economy, which are hindered from reaching their potential and contributing to the much-needed growth of the European economy and the resolution of the sovereign debt crisis by bureaucratic inflexibility, the labour market and dumping within Europe.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we could sum up our debate by saying that, while Athens is weeping, Sparta is not rejoicing, in the sense that both Europe and the United States are going through a serious crisis, and both are struggling to come up with the solutions needed to overcome the crisis. The world is certainly sending some undesirable signals with regard to the approach we must take in order to relaunch the economy, with our focus being mainly on regulating the financial markets and, to a lesser extent, on the possibilities of developing the global economy. We have to move away from the debate between those in favour of economic rigour and those who support growth, because Europe and the rest of the world need rigour in the management of their public debt and public resources, but they also need to grow, and we need to be seriously concerned about the protectionist signals coming from the United States, from Argentina, from Brazil, with the introduction of new taxes, and from parts of the world such as the Mercosur countries, which are facing difficulties today. We must therefore pay a great deal of attention and understand that the world markets have to be extended, safeguarded and broadened, and that we have to eliminate barriers in order to encourage growth. Mr Caspary’s proposal was very interesting, and I think that as part of the logic of opening up world markets, we should have a far-reaching Marshall Plan, a new Marshall Plan for developing countries, so that they can compete with the major players that compete with us. On the same day that the House rejected President Obama’s plan containing the ‘Buy American’ provisions – which we oppose – the United States Senate passed a law on the issue of the yuan and the strengthening of the yuan against the dollar. These are also measures which must be seen in the context of a new way of managing world monetary policy. Alongside an open global trading policy, we need to safeguard EU interests, and we also need a new Bretton Woods agreement to define the world’s monetary framework. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of this package, despite the instructions of my group. I believe that in a seriously critical moment like this, the most important thing that Europe can do is to react with urgency to a demand that comes from its citizens. I therefore believe that this package does not go far enough, but it is absolutely necessary to continue down this road, strengthening the instruments of growth but bringing budgets under control and increasing regulation in order to enable development to be managed. Consequently, I think tomorrow is an important day for focusing on what has made the European Union the most important democratic institution at this time. Certainly, much remains to be done, but this is an important initial response, and we could not miss the opportunity, after years of discussion in which we failed to tackle the greatest crisis in our lifetime with the necessary urgency and firmness.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the future of our trade policy coincides with the future of European competitiveness itself. For years, we have justifiably pursued a policy of opening up our market – and perhaps we have been more generous to others than to ourselves – but the slowdown in the Doha Round, the resurgence of protectionist measures by several partners, including strategic ones, and the enterprise shown by emerging countries must lead us to reconsider the way in which we Europeans want to relate to the world. In this context, words like ‘reciprocity’ and ‘protecting European interests’ must become the litmus test to show whether what we are doing is right. We have to play a leading role and not a supporting one in seeking to conclude the Doha Round with a well-balanced global agreement, which is an essential condition for arriving at a free-trade agreement that really opens up the markets and, above all, creates equal opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises. Trade policy and economic governance go hand in hand in this world, and we are therefore calling for a new financial system and a new monetary and exchange rate policy, as well as a redefinition of trade protection measures.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, no one can deny the importance of closer trade relations between the European Union and Taiwan. Yet, surely they must be aware of the well-known and delicate question, which the Commissioner also mentioned, of institutional relations between the countries officially known as the Republic of China and the People’s Republic of China, with whom the European Union and all the Member States maintain steady diplomatic relations. Furthermore there is no doubt that the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement signed in 2010 between Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China will help to overcome the consequences of the territorial and political separation of ‘One China’ and will facilitate better trade discipline between the European Union and Taiwan. Trade relations between us and the fourteenth largest global trade partner, the European Union’s seventh largest trade partner, can only improve, even though they require new regulations to eliminate the current barriers, in particular non-tariff and linguistic barriers, of a market that is still locked in the multilateral framework of the World Trade Organisation, which Taiwan has been a member of since 2002. As I have already mentioned, however, the principle difficulties concern relations with the People’s Republic of China. While we must address the issue of maintaining a dialogue with all parties, yet politically recognise a ‘One China’, we must ensure that the two Chinas do not turn the current triangular trade into veritable triangulation which could put the European Union at a trade disadvantage, as has already happened with other East Asian trade partners such as Korea.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, almost 10 years have passed since the Doha Round began. In two months’ time we will be marking its 10-year anniversary, but it has still not achieved any results. The global setting has changed profoundly. Countries which were considered to be developing countries have now become emerging countries, and today those countries are emerging even to the point where they are able to put themselves forward as saviours of the European Union or of certain Member States. The rules of global trade need to be rewritten. Trade still has extraordinary potential to promote growth, better distribute wealth around the world and rebalance the North and South of the world. Within the multilateral framework, all of this has remained unchanged, but we need the chance to renew reciprocity between countries too, and we also need to launch and contribute a new process to strengthen democracy within the World Trade Organisation which is unable to function properly in its current form.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, any initiative that aims to promote our real economy at a time of serious crisis like the present must be thoroughly welcomed, especially when its goal is to make our businesses more competitive on the global market. I am grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Jadot, and to the other shadow rapporteurs for having delivered a report that singles out support for investment and makes it more transparent without increasing the already substantial number of administrative requirements imposed on SMEs. I hope that this agreement that we are adopting today, and which was concluded within the OECD, will be signed by other countries that are trade partners of ours in order to guarantee a genuinely level playing field for operators and to ensure that Europe does not suffer competitive disadvantages in a sector that accounts for 10% of world trade and which is therefore crucial to the overall growth of the European Union.

 Madam President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is at a turning point and this crisis could lead to situations that would imply the dissolution of the biggest political and institutional project of the tragic century that was the 20th century or, alternatively. a decisive step forward in the process of integration. It is worrying, therefore, to see governments asking to reduce Europe’s financial perspective or acting against the idea of amending the Treaty to strengthen the euro; it is worrying to see all these initiatives that do not aim to help the real economy but the financial economy – the dream of so many irresponsible people who continue to travel back and forth across Europe. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) also have to play their part in tackling new markets, offering new products, adapting to the whims of the global market, bolstering their capitalisation, investing in research and innovation and showing – as they already are – that in this changing world, nobody can reserve the role of bank of the world for themselves while making others function as their workshop. We are heading towards a world in which today’s emerging big players are capable of being both bank and workshop and will have to face the challenges – including social and environmental challenges – that this world will deliver to them and will also affect us. Our competitiveness, our ability to grow and simultaneously ring-fence employment and security largely depends on our SMEs’ ability to adapt. SMEs have much to gain from a new commercial policy, but to do so they must be strengthened, they must present themselves as consortia on world markets, and they must know how to work together to crack open new markets and meet growing demand, including in sectors that require the huge volumes which we have not been able to provide in the past. They must be supported when they have to defend themselves before the courts of third countries because their patents and trademarks are being violated. Europe and its Member States have certainly done a great deal, but the fragmentation of skills and the random distribution of resources in many countries has so far prevented SMEs from working effectively on an international scale, in particular – I would reiterate – when faced with the enterprise shown by our big global competitors. This is what we need to focus our attention and commitment on. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted for the reports, with the exception of Mrs Wortmann-Kool’s report, on which I abstained despite supporting my group’s amendments. Therefore I did not vote following the overall indications of my group, because I believe that we are facing such serious problems that we must at this point demonstrate the cohesion of European institutions and our ability to deal with the problems we are confronting. Despite a certain timidity and arrogance on the part of the Council with regard to this crisis, I believe we need to show this cohesion. I did not agree with the postponement either, because we are in a position in which we need to give our citizens urgent responses to the economic crisis, which is not just the result of financial speculation, but also of our inability to deal with the problems of recovery and growth. We have a duty to heal Europe’s public finances and we have a duty to set out responses, which have to begin with the involvement of businesses and the world of work, and have different and more open rules in order to complete the single market and be in a better position to compete on the global market. That is why I voted for the reports with the exception of Mrs Wortmann-Kool’s report. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I feel bound to note that a sense of fear and a need to defend European interests still prevail among some Members in this Chamber: in other words, they are on the defensive. As far as I am concerned, I believe that this agreement with a country with which we have a long-standing bond of friendship is important as long as it is entered into on the right basis, that of true reciprocity, and is a balanced and ambitious agreement. It should not be limited to the elimination of tariff or non-tariff barriers but should represent an opportunity to take a qualitative leap in the elimination of environmental and health policy differences, and I refer, in particular, to the farming sector, the protection of animal species at risk of extinction and particular economic extractive activities that have a significant environmental impact, such as asbestos mining and oil sands drilling, or that restrict access to medicines for the poorest countries. However, we must be positive in our attitude, not defensive like we were with Japan. I would therefore emphasise the need to improve reciprocity in terms of the protection of intellectual property, including trademarks, geographical indications and policies for the reciprocal promotion of bilateral investment, aimed principally at innovation and technology and inspired by the positions already taken in this field by the European Parliament. Madam President, I believe that the numerous bilateral agreements between Canada and the Member States are the best foundation on which to build a robust free trade agreement in the commercial arena, thanks to a friendship that we have already experienced in the UN, the G8, NATO and the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, a friendship based on the ideals of democracy and freedom that characterise Canada and the European Union.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this proposal for a regulation is worthy of support because it helps to simplify and harmonise the different laws in the Member States. The proposal sends out a signal that is in line with the Commission’s proposals on small and medium-sized enterprises and the strategies to stimulate European competitiveness in the manufacturing sector. The regulation also implicitly rewards product innovation and contributes to greater transparency in the process. However, I would point out that the compromise reached with the insertion of the review clause and the joint statement by Parliament and the Council on origin marking – the political significance of which is not lost on me – could set a precedent and compromise the outcome of the difficult negotiations between the Commission, Parliament and the Council on the complex issue of origin marking for non-EU products, which Parliament approved at first reading last October and which concerns non-textile products also. It is high time that the Council acknowledged once and for all the democratic will expressed here by the majority of MEPs. However, despite these concerns, we will vote in favour of the proposal for a regulation. Gianluca Susta,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, quite honestly, we do not understand why the majority of the Committee on International Trade were so adamant in wanting to put this matter forward for debate, only to then ask for it to be referred back to committee, a request that we reject. Both decisions are wrong; however, because of the time constraints, among other reasons, I intend to focus solely on the issue of merit, but only after voicing my full support for Mr Moreira’s speech. In this complicated world in which natural and man-made disasters are occurring all the time and in large numbers, we would be setting a dangerous precedent if we were to turn every humanitarian emergency into a review of trade policy. That is a slippery slope that could result in serious imbalances and, hence, unfair treatment of the poorest countries. Yet it is only through balanced, permanent and objective rules that those countries can reap the benefits of trade policy, which must not replace development cooperation. We know that any aid earmarked for Pakistan would not be used to help the people hit by the floods almost a year ago. We know with just as much certainty that it will be the European textile sector that mainly, if not exclusively, pays the price for this humanitarian aid. We cannot accept this unfair departure from trade policy rules because we are aware of the need to consider other factors, too, in our discussions. We all know that, as well as showing solidarity with Pakistan’s flood-hit populations, another fundamental reason for granting aid lies in the decision to support Pakistan’s counterterrorism efforts. The grey areas that have emerged in recent days between the Pakistani authorities and al-Qaeda, and the Bin Laden affair itself, show how unreliable that country is. I believe that we must focus attention on this, just as we must focus attention on the major human rights issues that have emerged lately. Gianluca Susta,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council’s request to open negotiations with Japan on the conclusion of a free trade agreement must be assessed very carefully. We therefore welcome the Commissioner’s cautious approach to this issue and we call on Parliament as a whole to follow that approach, which inspired our group’s motion for a resolution. The new Japanese Government has demonstrated – at least verbally – its willingness to open up its market, one of the most closed markets in the developed world. This positive attitude must be verified in practice, especially with regard to the 27 non-tariff barriers identified by the European Union, which must be lowered so that we can open negotiations with Japan and make them one of the priorities of our trade policy. We believe that improving these relations can help make Europe more competitive, since Japan accounts for 9% of world GDP, or over 35% when its GDP is added to our own. Today, however, we cannot adopt resolutions unless they make the opening of free trade agreement negotiations subject to specific, binding and verifiable conditions; namely, that there will be genuine reciprocity and a proper impact assessment. Firstly, Japan’s protectionist policy in the automotive sector concerns us, because there is an imbalance between exports and imports. Secondly, we wish to raise the issue of non-tariff barriers. I am talking about a whole range of standards, from health and plant health measures to technical standards – especially in the agricultural and automotive sectors – export subsidy rules, customs checks and factors allowing for counterfeiting and also triangular trade with China and Korea. To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, we ask that before Europe declares itself willing to open negotiations on the conclusion of a free trade agreement, it resolutely defines the Community interest that it intends to protect and specifies the areas in which it will request reciprocity from Japan. We hope that the Commission will take these comments of ours on board. Gianluca Susta,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on International Trade.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the economic and financial crisis has led many people to rediscover the central importance of industry. Despite your efforts, Mr Vice-President, the Commission has still not always realised that. A great many acts, of which the documents on the Europe 2020 strategy or certain free-trade agreements that have recently been approved or are under discussion will not be the last, are still biased towards the service economy and the strengthening and development of services, particularly in the financial, banking and insurance sectors. In contrast, the real economy is giving us opposite signals, as you have said. Production and exports are rising and we are witnessing a reversal of the trend for relocations. We must encourage these signals, since no great economy in the world can escape the central importance of industry. Hence, we need to complete the internal market and to speed up the implementation of strong initiatives in support of innovation and research, technology transfer, product traceability, protection of intellectual property and promotion of European production, not to mention effective rules against dumping and for true reciprocity in bilateral negotiations. This report is a step in that direction, and I am very grateful to Mr Lange and all those who have worked on it. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is wrong to have turned the debate on the Free Trade Agreement with Korea into a stand-off between supposed neo-protectionists and die-hard free-traders. I also think it is wrong for the Commission to have acted more like a service economy development agency than the political government of 500 million Europeans, which should strike a balance between considerations relating to growth on the one hand, and to employment and distribution of wealth on the other. What differentiates us from the United States, which has not yet ratified this agreement – and we know why – and this also applies to relations with Korea, is the very fact that no world economic power exposes its quality – and I stress the word ‘quality’ – manufacturing industry to inevitable dismantling processes, sacrificing it on the altar of financial interests, setting white-collar workers from the City of London against the white-coated workers of modern European factories, which is exactly what Europe does not need in the wake of the crisis. All this, Mr Sturdy, Commissioner, has nothing whatsoever to do with neo-protectionism. Otherwise we would have to include in this category the Spanish, German, Polish, Portuguese, French and Italian Industry Ministers who, in the 10 February edition of Le Monde
, reiterated the need to make Community interest central to the work of the European institutions, stating that in this case it definitely could not be protected by the safeguard clause, however worthy it may be. An excellent academic exercise in the field of international trade relations has taken place, but we have failed to act in Europe’s interests. For that reason ...

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it happens all too often that intellectuals or high-powered institutions in some countries refuse to understand the phenomenon of Italian terrorism, raising doubts about the trustworthiness of our judicial system. Since this is the legal basis for the refusal to extradite Cesare Battisti, we cannot but reject it. Cesare Battisti, an individual with something of an ambiguous past, is the product of a time in which thousands of young people – many of whom were desperately lonely – chose armed struggle as a means of political struggle and ended up turning the alienating utopian dream they believed in into a crime. Other countries have experienced similar tragedies but none have so far offered the protagonists of these any chances to reform, unlike Italy, which, in fighting terrorism, really cemented its sense of national unity. Taking up the appeal of the victims’ relatives, we therefore ask for Cesare Battisti to be brought before the Italian judicial system, which will know how to show – as it has done in hundreds of other cases of former terrorists who are now reintegrated into social and civil life – that to be punished is also to make amends, as the Italian, Cesare Beccaria, taught Western legal civilisation, and not just intimidation or brutalisation, as the Brazilian authorities fear.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I totally disagree with the last speakers. Personally, I find that this measure is harmful to the priorities of Parliament and is against the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon. We are about to conclude 70% of the agreements at first reading with the Council, but I fail to understand the rush to conclude such a sensitive measure as this at first reading since it concerns the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon, which has extended our powers, particularly on commercial policy. At the very opening of the anti-dumping procedures, we are changing from the objectivity of legal certainty to an intervention by Member States, which threatens to become the outcome of bargaining between the Commission and Member States. I therefore think it is a step backwards, as is automatic alignment without any time limits from the old comitology system to the present system in the agricultural field, which strengthens the role of Parliament. Therefore, I do not believe it is wise to rush into an agreement with the Council at first reading, because we also run the risk of disputes before the Court of Justice. Gianluca Susta,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Scholz for drafting this report, which establishes a financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised countries. It is right that this instrument is managed by the Committee on International Trade because, above all, it relates to cooperation with industrialised countries and emerging countries, so there is a certain difference compared to other instruments. First and foremost, I think it is necessary to emphasise the role of Parliament. We have lost too much time in a tug of war with the Council and the Commission on an obvious issue after the Treaty of Lisbon. We must defend the centrality of Parliament, in regard to both delegated acts and executive acts. Secondly, I think it important to underline the strategic importance of this whole game and, thirdly, the need to intensify collaboration with developing countries and emerging countries, without taking money away from the poorest countries. We must make an effort, within the budget of the European Union, to divert more resources to the poorest countries, bearing in mind that the problems with emerging countries are mostly to do with rules, rather than financing. In any case, innovation must also be supported, but with additional resources that have not been taken away from the poorest countries. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we have to be mindful of the crisis that the European Union and its Member States are experiencing on a global level. With a crisis that is hitting work, employment and growth, I wonder about the logic inspiring some European countries but, above all, the European Commission, in terms of international relations. The Commission proposal under discussion today will heavily penalise some industrial sectors, particularly textiles and, in a situation like the present one, we must ask ourselves whether it is reasonable. Some people fear that these decisions are borne from the desire for Europe to take a leading role on the world stage. In reality, we know that this is not so and that the attempt to reduce the pressure, including terrorist pressure, within or related to some political and institutional systems, has even less to do with it. The truth is that not even the recent flood has anything to do with this proposal, since the main concentration of the Pakistani textiles industry is not based in the regions hit by the disaster. The actual reason is that once more, the aim is to penalise a sector in favour of financing the European economy and to favour large-scale retail, rather than the interests of the manufacturing industry located in some European countries. This is profoundly mistaken in terms of growth, work and employment in a time of serious economic crisis and the need for real EU growth on global markets, in terms of its exports and its capacity for innovation and quality.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Muscardini, and all the shadow rapporteurs with whom I have worked on this issue, which is extremely important for us. I hope that tomorrow, the European Parliament gives the same strong backing to the legislative resolution that it gave in July 2006, with the written declaration of 2008, and the favourable vote on the resolution of 2009. We are preparing to adopt a measure that should protect the consumer, informing him or her of the origin of products for a more general purpose, which renews equality of opportunity in international trade and reciprocity between the European Union and its main competitors. It does not add costs for businesses in third countries, which are already obligated to mark their products in all our competitor countries in the world and in many others. Nor does it create any burdens for the European distribution system which, indirectly, without costing the public finances anything, favours the return to Europe of significant production, slows business relocation and also contributes to the fight against counterfeiting. It is a combination of very obvious advantages, which cannot be halted by calling perhaps for further measures because here, it really is the case that the best is the enemy of the good. We must come to the end of a process that began seven years ago, showing our concern for the interests of our businesses – above all, in this time of crisis and unemployment – but also for the potential for a trade system regulated so as to provide reciprocity, consumer protection and correct information which could be further developed in terms of traceability. If this measure is not voted through by Parliament, there will be trouble. I should like to thank the European Commission once again and all those who wish to support this measure, because it is helpful for European citizens and for world trade. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I think we must ask ourselves what we want as Europe, what we are calling for as Europe, and what commitments we intend to adopt in relation to this serious economic and financial crisis, the depression we have experienced around the world, and the difficult recovery that we are facing. In my view, a Free Trade Agreement at a time of such great difficulty for multilateral relations, when the Doha negotiations are at a standstill, should fulfil at least two major requirements. On the one hand, it should establish a truly level international playing field between us and the other competitors in world trade and, on the other, it should show the world the direction in which Europe wants its economy and development to go. This agreement is divorced from all that. It takes no account at all of the global context. It is on one side or on the other. It is simply a very cleverly produced Free Trade Agreement. It is an important conceptual document, and it would certainly be able to open up useful scenarios in a totally regulated world, a world in which reciprocity, common rules and common qualitative standards are the order of the day. The world is not like that, however. What we see, in fact, is that Europe’s manufacturing industry, on which it should build in order to create more development, more employment and more jobs, is being penalised, while once again, the financial services sector is being rewarded. In its positive aspects, this agreement has hardly any effect on increasing GDP; in the best case scenario, it will raise it by 0.03%. I do not see the need for it. After President Obama’s cautious overtures, even the United States is putting the brakes on now under pressure from at least 100 congressmen from the majority party, who have described this kind of agreement – similar to the one we are about to sign – as ‘job killing’. The ratification process in Korea is extremely slow and neither the ecological standards nor the social standards are guaranteed. Even so, we want to move towards ratification very fast. We must ask for one thing, however. We asked for it before in the preliminary stages through the vote that we cast then. There can be no provisional implementation of this Free Trade Agreement unless the safeguard regulation is adopted, and in this Parliament, we have introduced some important amendments that will enable us to address the subsequent stages more effectively.

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, ladies and gentlemen, as I am one of the last people to speak, I would like to offer you some words of comfort. In my opinion, you were right to point out here that you do not represent the governments, but Europe and the European Union itself: an affirmation that is obvious, though not for some, evidently. We therefore urge you to persevere in your role to ensure that the stable Presidency of the Union provides that encouragement, that backing, and forces the governments to turn their words into action. We welcome what has been achieved over recent months, the idea of the task force and also the fact that the Heads of State or Government were forced to draw up a significant document because, Mr President, the content of that document, if put into effect – although we are not really sure whether all of the Member States do wish to put it into effect – is certainly significant. For example, we do not know whether the statements in the final document on the taxation of financial transactions or on the tax on banks will actually become reality. We are waiting for the task force’s conclusions in order to see whether these effective instruments, in conjunction with the statements on economic governance, together with the statements on growth, are really an essential premise of our political action. We wanted the constituent process, which ended with the Treaty of Lisbon, in order to signal a change: we hope that the stable Presidency of the Union will insist – as Mr Van Rompuy underlined in his reply – that these words become reality.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you to the rapporteur, and also to the shadow rapporteurs, and to Commissioner Tajani, or should I say Vice-President Tajani, for the precise and accurate answers you have given us on key points. Eighteen years ago, the University of Barcelona carried out a study that concluded that the textile industry would have disappeared from Europe by the year 2000. It is now 2010 and this gloomy prophecy has not come true, and it has not come true for one simple reason: namely that the research and innovation developed in Europe and in countries that have maintained their manufacturing base – because they have not just acted as research centres, but as centres of applied research and industry – have ensured the production of new innovative fibres. Hence, the need for these regulations instead of a directive, to guarantee flexibility, protect consumers where labelling is concerned, and also to vouch for the country of origin. I believe, Vice-President Tajani, that it is worth imagining a future where we also have a European Monitoring Unit to protect health and safety, in other words, an authority to safeguard this originality. I believe that we must all agree on this positive aspect that has emerged from this report. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I listened with interest to the introduction by the President of the Council and the Vice-President of the Commission, and I have to say that I am not convinced by the conclusions. I am not convinced by the conclusions of the March European Council, because we are witnessing a decline, among some leading figures of European contemporary history, of the Community ideal and method. It is this that concerns us given what is happening in the world; rather, certain aspects concern us. The Greek affair is merely an illustration of what Europe ought to be, but is in reality not yet. Therefore, we call on the European Commission, on the Vice-President, who is standing in here for the President, and on the President of the Council, to adopt a strong political initiative, a legislative initiative: the Commission must set the agenda, and the Council must ensure that we do not trail in the wake of governments whose power and incisiveness is too often curbed by imminent electoral issues – yesterday in France and Italy, tomorrow in the United Kingdom and Germany – which paralyse the action of governments. Your role must be not only that of a facilitator, Mr Van Rompuy, but of a driving force behind this Europe, and we appeal to your democratic and pro-European sensibility to ensure that this new impetus will bring benefits for this Europe. It is no longer enough to set objectives; we need to define instruments. We agree on the objectives, just as we agreed on the Lisbon Strategy. What are the instruments, though? Do we want to end up with a federal budget – and to call it that – which equates to at least 2% of GDP? Do we want to bring into play Eurobonds, European investments and treasury bonds so that we can politically enhance this Europe, without which we will go nowhere? In essence, we need to know whether we are succeeding in defining the new Europe and whether we are succeeding in defining – through a new relationship between the European political forces within and outside this Parliament – the real distinction, the real boundary that exists within today’s Europe between conservatives and progressives, between those who want a more politically integrated Europe and those who, instead, want only an enlarged single market.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe’s ambition to remain the world’s largest economy must increasingly be linked to the revival of its competitiveness, to the quality of its manufacturing system and to its ability to conquer new markets. The fight against counterfeiting and commercial infringement plays an essential role in this context. However, the protection of trademarks, patents and intellectual property are not only non­financial instruments that make the system more competitive, they are also a tangible example of the application to the industrial economy of principles of a democratic legal culture founded on respect for the rules, for those rules which have been violated in past years under the force of international financial speculation. The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) is a fundamental instrument with which to combat counterfeiting, a phenomenon which yields incredible revenues of USD 500 billion per year, which has links with organised crime and which affects – indeed threatens – fundamental human rights such as health, if we only think of the counterfeiting of medicines. If we are to assess the need for ACTA, we must bear this international context in mind. On the other hand, we must call for this treaty to also respect certain basic, fundamental principles of coexistence inspired by respect for the rules. We cannot hide the fact that we are concerned about the legal basis of the treaty, about the negotiating mandate and its transparency. Those who represent, as this Parliament does, 500 million citizens, must be informed officially, not confidentially. The negotiators from the Commission must report back to this House on the state of progress of the work, and access to the documents and information must be provided so that a detailed opinion can be expressed. The difficult yet fruitful cooperation between Parliament and the Commission can help the European Union to realise its potential in the best possible way. The resolution is along these lines and, as such, it is worthy of our vote. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important opportunity to reaffirm, above all, the importance of the Generalised System of Preferences. Both the basic GSP system and the GSP+ system, which are both linked to the ‘Everything But Arms’ initiative, contribute to reducing poverty, in strict accordance with the primary obligation of ensuring respect for human rights. It is the violation of these basic principles of coexistence that recently led the European Union to withdraw Sri Lanka’s preferential tariff benefits following a detailed investigation by the Commission. The new institutional framework must, however, fully include Parliament in the legislative process aimed at modifying the legislation in force. We therefore hope that it will include a complete review of the regulation, in accordance with the ordinary procedures, since it has several shortcomings, including on the very subject of investigations. The next step will be the joint resolution. The effectiveness of the regulation depends on its credibility, the objectiveness of the criteria upon which it is based and the strictness with which it is applied. In a Europe in which the vast majority of citizens do not agree with exporting democracy at gunpoint, trade and trade­related aid are essential vehicles for disseminating principles of coexistence based on respect for fundamental human rights. It is our duty not to lapse into indifference – which would be wrong – but also to avoid making hasty judgments about certain parties, judgments which sound like irrevocable sentences, as is the case with Colombia. This is why I do not feel able to support what are almost one-sided inflexible attitudes to one country or another, but I do strongly support the need for enhanced monitoring of all of the problematic situations, in the spirit of the legislation in force and according to the principles of the rules on which we want to base the legislative review that we are demanding.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, new players have emerged out of the wings onto the world stage, some of which were actually considered developing countries not long ago. This must change our approach, cultural and otherwise, towards free trade and the tangible manifestations of the relationship between the European Union and its major competitors. This relationship is currently mediated by certain magic terms that have not yet entered into the vocabulary of the European Commission. These terms are reciprocity, European interest, the fight against dumping and the fight against tariff barriers. This is the background to the free trade agreement with Korea, which incidentally confused two Commissioners – the Commissioner for Internal Market and Services and the Commissioner for Employment – and some governments. What are the real advantages of this bilateral agreement, when 50% of the trade between the European Union and Korea concerns the automotive sector, when the disparity between the 700 000 Korean cars exported to us as opposed to the 27 000 European cars imported by Korea is glaringly evident? What is the sense in providing indirect aid of approximately EUR 1 600 for each Korean car sold in Europe when some European governments find it difficult to provide incentives for buying and selling cars to stimulate consumption? How can we also fail to take into account the serious doubts over the textile and electronics industries? We will not settle with hearing for the umpteenth time, Commissioner, as Mrs Ashton said before you, that there are advantages for our chemical, pharmaceutical or agrifood industries because these pale scandalously into insignificance compared to the consequences for textiles, electronics and, above all, for cars, or financial services. Could it be that Europe, even with the crisis we are in today, is yet again choosing the financial option for its development? We all welcomed the birth of the new Europe in Lisbon with hope. Europe cannot however, fail to take responsibility for European interests in the world, particularly today. The United States is jumping through hoops to defend Boeing against Airbus and the Argentinean Government is threatening to expropriate Telecom. The agreement with Korea actually legitimises pass-through financing with China which, until now, was illegal. This is the scenario in which our major businesses are forced to operate. Behind them are hundreds of thousands of workers, of families who can see their future going up in smoke, not because they are producing poor quality services or goods but because poorly defined interests are allowed to prevail over more evident and objective interests. We trust in your sensitivity, Commissioner, in the hope that you will avoid over-hasty ratifications, which could go hand in hand with unacceptable decisions over the provisional application of the commercial side of the agreement pending ratification, or at least decisions that will be unacceptable until the regulation on the bilateral safeguard clause has been clearly defined. The adoption of this clause is subject to the ordinary legislative procedure that should be considered a first step to any appraisal of the advisability … (The President cut off the speaker) Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

President of the Commission, the progressives among us are giving you a vote of confidence today so as not to leave you open to the blackmail of those who have little faith in this community of Europe and so as not to subordinate you to the governments of the Twenty-Seven. Believing in a community of Europe means breaking your deafening silence and taking up a central role in the major international issues; defending European interests in the industrial and economic arena; reinforcing social policy and investing more towards conquering world poverty; consolidating our alliance with the United States but on equal terms; reinforcing the position of the European Union in international bodies, beginning with the UN Security Council; relaunching multilateralism in world trade; and setting the agenda in the fight against global pollution. Our vote today will be a conditional vote of confidence, with no exceptions, in the Commission and in the individual Commissioners, in order fully to achieve the new Europe born in Lisbon, a political player among the major world powers, and so that it can be, above all, a community of destiny dedicated to its own economic and civil progress, and which sets itself a mission of peace, justice and freedom in the world; one that is not solely a community of memory, living in the present off its own wealth and off a past glory that is now faded.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Zapatero, thank you for the great commitment you are making during this parliamentary term regarding the items you have announced, even though this is no longer the time to list all the useful items, but to make practical efforts to revive Europe. We need to end this period of defining institutional structures and to face the major issues which still prevent Europe from being able to compete on an equal footing with its international partners. We need to know whether the European Union will be able, one day very soon, to have a seat in the United Nations, whether it will be able to have a seat, as the European Union, at the G20, whether it wants greater fiscal and social harmonisation, and what resources it wants to put into the European economic circuit so that it can truly do what its other international competitors have done. We need to come here – and I say this also to President Barroso – with concrete measures to revive Europe, because, in six months’ time, we will not see the same results as we have seen previously with other previous experiences. We would also like to know whether the time has finally come when, as Kissinger would say 30 years ago, the major world leaders know which telephone number to call when they need to speak to someone in Europe, and do not just contact the Member States. At stake is Europe’s dignity as it emerges from the Treaty of Lisbon, but also the European social model, that fundamental democracy which we Members of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament strongly demand and on which we want the future well-being of our citizens to be based.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I certainly do not intend at this time – even with the time available to me – to go back over all of the reasons behind the repeated request that we, as Parliament, are making. I would point out – and you yourself have already made this point, Commissioner – that Mrs Muscardini and I are the only two veterans of 2006, of the signing of the resolution with which this Parliament endorsed the initiative of the then Commissioner Mandelson in December 2006. We hoped that the initiative that you undertook a few weeks ago to make small changes in order to achieve a compromise could have been supported more strongly, including within the Article 133 Committee. Among other things we regret that, within that committee, many countries reiterated their opposition or misgivings, including the United Kingdom, via its representative. All that we want to do today is to remind you that this request is not about protectionism; it is not industries that are no longer able to compete on the international market that we want to defend, but consumers: we want to draw attention to the theme of health, the environment and genuine reciprocity on the world market, which is lacking today. Moreover, it is not only lacking with regard to the weakest subjects in the world: no, it is also lacking with regard to Japan, to the United States, to Australia, to Canada, to Brazil, to India, to the main competitors of the European Union, which has a duty, in these economically difficult times, to defend the Community interest, which is also behind this request. We therefore hope that Parliament will throw its full weight behind the initiatives that the Commission provides and we also hope that the commitments made a few weeks ago will be fully honoured, even if this procedure cannot be wound up by Christmas but under the new procedure introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the time has come for this House to stop the endless debate on the Treaty of Lisbon, which we have still heard going on today. I believe that we must respect the wishes of this Parliament, of the great European countries, of the 27 and of the 26 that have ratified this treaty in various forms, but democratically, and thus the offences to the treaty and its democratic content must also be rejected. I also believe that the Council meeting at the end of the month will be an important opportunity to reaffirm the need to revive the idea of Europe beyond Lisbon and to revive the economy, as well as to ensure that Europe does not back down over the major issue of climate change. From that perspective, I believe that what we have heard lately from the President-in-Office, but also what we have heard today, is insufficient. Europe beyond Lisbon is failing to interpret the strong content of the new treaty and is failing to comply with the terms of the Lisbon Agenda. Therefore, if we 500 million Europeans want to remain the world’s biggest economic power, a power that is preparing to become a major political player on the international stage, I urge the Commission to fully carry out its mandate of proposing European legislation on the major issues relating to the economy, the economic recovery and the labour market recovery, and I urge the Council to turn a long list of headings into an actual policy to help resolve the economic difficulties. This is what I believe we are lacking. We are lacking a major economic recovery plan, we are lacking in major areas such as the revival of the infrastructure policy with Eurobonds, and we are lacking a high-profile European approach. This is what we expect from the European Council at the end of the month. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, people who seek to label as anti-Italian, subversive and communist anyone who calls for a set of rules on communication and freedom of information that respects pluralism, and which is characterised by a clear separation between the fortunes of those who assume important institutional responsibilities and the wealth they derive from entrepreneurial activities in the publishing and information fields, are making a serious mistake, which must not be forgiven, justified or allowed here in Europe. Not once in our speeches have we mentioned the Italian Prime Minister. We could have referred to the number of newspapers he owns: 150 in Italy; and around 40 television channels. That is not the problem, however. The problem is that pluralism of information – and in information – is a cornerstone of every free democracy and must be used as a defence against every monopolistic and oligopolistic philosophy and against conflicts of interest. The sovereignty of each State, the reaffirmation that the European Union is not a superstate, Commissioner Reding, must not make us forget that the European Union also has a Charter of Fundamental Rights from which stems a legislative system that the Member States cannot ignore. You know that, on these very issues, many times the Court of Justice – in the case of Italy, not on issues to do with the system, Mr Speroni – has passed sentences that are still to be carried out. Globalisation of the markets and the ever-increasing use of the airwaves now require more targeted European legislation to regulate this sensitive matter, which has such a strong influence on public opinion and therefore also on the principle of popular sovereignty – which underpins the European Union and not just the Italian Republic – and on the ways in which this principle is exercised. It should no longer be possible for anyone to invoke the sacrosanct rights of the popular majority to justify threats to freedom of the press in what was, until recently, a situation of disparity between the plaintiff and the defendant – whether in Italy or in Portugal, as we were reminded earlier – because this undermines the foundations of the rules of coexistence on which the Union is based. This is why there is an urgent need for a directive against concentrations in the field of information that will regulate the dealings of those who are involved in politics and, at the same time, control very important media.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have welcomed the work done during this period in which Mrs Ashton has been carrying out her role as Commissioner. I must say that we have had a better relationship with her than we had with her predecessor, despite their common political affiliation, which we too share, and their common nationality. However, this time I do not share the Commissioner’s enthusiasm on this issue, because too often in recent years, the Commission has taken the floor here and talked up certain initiatives, only to then pursue a different path. We are going through a particular moment in time, a major economic and financial crisis, which is also the result of a lack of reciprocity in the world, not only with developing countries – which has its own logic, its own explanation – but with the new global players and the traditional global players. Too often I seem to sense a lack of awareness within the Commission, by its President and its Commissioners, of which initiatives should be implemented to aid the recovery of European industry, the recovery of the European manufacturing industry. It seems to me that this agreement – which, admittedly, is a positive agreement and has extremely positive content – has more of an academic value; it is almost a textbook treaty, but one that is not in touch with reality. We export USD 30 billion to Korea, only USD 20 billion come back in the form of cars exported from Korea to Europe, and USD 1.5 billion will be the indirect aid that accrues to Korean cars in Europe, without mentioning the textile and other sectors. That is a definite imbalance, which I believe must be highlighted and must be corrected, before the green light is given to a free trade agreement that penalises European industry. Ours is a quality industry that has committed itself to the new requirements that innovation calls for, certainly not a bankrupt industry that cannot get to grips with the need for innovation that exists within the economy.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, like many of my colleagues, I would like to ask the Council what its real intentions are in the light of this proposal. Do you want to reduce everything to a minimum and freeze the future? And is this the same Europe that will supposedly be relaunched with Mr Van Rompuy’s document on integration? Where is the consistency between Mr Van Rompuy’s two policy documents? Where is the consistency, from the point of view of ordinary citizens, between the measures announced in July on employment and growth, those great calls for hope and for the future of the EU that we heard from the Council, and this sudden violence done in the name of realism, aiming for mere survival? With these figures and these cuts how can we implement cohesion and the agricultural reforms in terms of concrete actions? These are sincere questions that require a clear and honest answer, because there is evidence here of a type of institutional schizophrenia that Parliament and the citizens can no longer tolerate. Parliament wants consistency and credibility. The very first criticism that can be levelled is that the budget just does not add up. So much for growth and investment: this is the 2008 budget over again! Of course it must be conceded that Mr Van Rompuy, in heading 1a, overturns the quite scandalous suggestion by Cyprus. He also recognises the essential role of the budget in offering support to growth in some sectors, additional to the support offered by the national budgets. But growth and innovation – clearly – should not be achieved at the expense of other sectors that also contribute to ‘growth’ and ‘employment’, such as cohesion policy, but also agricultural policy, which has created jobs and is ever more focused on innovation and protection of rural areas. ‘Growth’ and ‘employment’ also mean culture, training, the transnational networks, the Connecting Europe Facility, as well as solidarity and international development, human rights in the world and our contribution to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. What we are seeing however is the usual Council spectacle: no vision, no leadership, a Babel of conflicting and competing national interests, an inextricable tangle of vetoes, aspirations and general discontent. Unfortunately what is mainly missing is Europe! Patrizia Toia,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today Europe is being asked to perform a new task of industrial policy coordination, and even the most ardent supporters of the freedom of private initiative are calling for this role to be carried out. Without more Europeanisation of national strategies, particularly in terms of job protection, the current crisis will not be resolved and there will be no economic recovery. The automotive crisis is not just about overcapacity: it is about widespread job losses. The crisis now seems to be structural and concerns the very future of the automotive sector as we know it today. We want to have an automotive industry in Europe and do not want to squander the skills, know-how and professional expertise that exist. We are therefore calling for a major restructuring and regeneration project to be launched swiftly so that the costs do not escalate disproportionately. Restructuring cannot only derive from fragmented decisions by national governments and individual companies. We at least need to try to join forces and guide this painful process at EU level, making the interested parties sit down at the table for a dialogue between the social partners, manufacturers, trade unions and governments in each country, offering support for research, innovation, training, upskilling and the necessary funding. I know that this will be an arduous task, because the national interests of individual companies are not the same. However, since competition within the European Union is highly ambiguous and at times risks being unfair, I believe that ultimately it is in the interests of all countries to have effective EU guidance and stimulus, so that together we can face the increasingly aggressive global market.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the energy crisis has taken and is continuing to take its toll on employment, on the thousands of short-term, temporary and permanent workers in this sector. The major steel conglomerates are increasingly pivoting towards the Far East or the American continent, which raises a question over the direction of our development model. I believe that Europe should resurrect the idea that a manufacturing sector such as ours needs a solid production base, able to supply the European internal market. We must therefore defend this sector and the role of a stable steel industry, and we must support it, Commissioner, if we want to halt the industrial decline. I think we need to move away from the dualism – which has not emerged here this evening, but which is often heard in discussions about this sector – between those who campaign to protect the environment and workers, which is misguided because it does not show us the way forward. An industry in which steel is considered to be an integral part needs the latest production systems, concrete and balanced solutions, which safeguard the various interests, the various requirements. Therefore, we need a strong European plan focusing on sustainability – on which we should never turn our backs, in my opinion – as a source of real added value, with which we can compete in the world, supporting investments, as several parties have already said, new technologies, new processes and upgrading our plants; a European economy that makes efficient use of its resources, including energy, indeed starting with energy and the search for new materials.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a budget is the programme and charter of an institution since it shows what it is, what it does and above all what it intends to do in the future. We are faced with a crucial choice between a budget for mere survival or subsistence – with a little less for everyone – or a courageous budget with selective decisions, with investment in job creation, innovation, youth, in other words in the future of the European Union and its development role. It must be emphasised that, as has been stated very clearly by Mr Kalfin among others, today Europe can do what the individual Member States cannot do for the economy, for regional development and for the regions – where social cohesion will either be strengthened or die – in other words, for the lives of the very citizens we mentioned. The great European choices are today in danger of being suffocated by accounting-based disputes – within the Council and elsewhere – between net beneficiary countries and net contributors. It should be underlined that this as a false problem, because it is easy, taking account of what happened in the past, to demonstrate with figures and numbers, rather than with words, that the contributor countries actually gained, often more than the others, from the convergence of economies and growth. The Council is currently working to add figures to the various headings. The war of positions has started: statements, stances taken by certain countries that view the budget as a mere expense item to be cut mercilessly, and even used to appease anti-European sentiment, easy to fuel at a time of crisis. This is a mistaken position that does not help the integration that we are struggling to achieve in other areas. As many of us have pointed out, our Europe is still incomplete and imperfect. We adopted a stability plan that was supposed to include development, but we have stabilised so much that we are in recession. Let us at least take the opportunity offered by this budget and this multiannual financial framework to make choices that go in the right direction. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I just wanted to add my voice to the plaudits this report has garnered from the House in relation to the need to strengthen the European Union’s standing as a place where it is possible to invest, produce, and produce in line with our conception of an economy that is inclusive as well as socially and environmentally sustainable. I think a number of parts of this measure are really helpful, while others could be added. I do think it is important to grasp this opportunity and work even harder to enhance our attractiveness through regional marketing policies and openness, which represent the region’s proposition for a productive, industrial, manufacturing and services economy that, as it originates in the region, is respectful of the environment. This regional approach together with EU policies along the same lines are what we need to attract investment and growth. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the initial comments on the European Council, now the time for simplistic interpretation has begun, which is a mistake because important progress was made. For example, the destructive link between banks and public debts has been broken and we have a plan – albeit a weak one – on employment and jobs. The European institutions seem once again to be infused with a spirit of resurgence and renewed progress towards political unity, after so much slowness and dragging of feet, and a desire for real progress towards greater integration. In this vein, yesterday saw a display of real unity between Parliament and the Commission. There were no winners or losers, but an undeniable, new institutional and political vitality compared to the diarchy of the past, which was the negation – the very antithesis – of the European spirit. Many countries showed initiative and a desire to act, not to create new, exclusive alliances, but to build a shared consensus that is respectful of all Member States. This is the path towards political unity, without which any form of banking, fiscal or monetary unity will be totally inadequate. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, water is increasingly being seen as a public asset, a precious resource for the whole of humankind. It is vital, therefore, to develop an integrated, efficient strategy for the wise use of this finite resource. Measures at EU level must address our continent’s current and future water challenges, and therefore the ‘Blueprint to safeguard Europe’s water resources’ to be published in November is more important than ever to ensure – as has been said – sufficient availability of good-quality water for sustainable and equitable use. I regard this as an important aspect of the EU 2020 strategy. Water is linked to food or, rather, water is part of food, and a small amount of food contains a huge amount of water, so a water strategy is also a strategy to ensure food security for Europe and the world. Water can lead to wars, but it can also be a factor for development and peace; I therefore strongly support the proposal contained in the report to devote 1%, for example, of water tariffs to decentralised cooperation measures and growth projects around the world. I hope this legislation, which already exists in some Member States, will spread like good practice to other countries to become law in all the Member States of the European Union.

 I support this report because it is essential to attract new investors to the EU market. This is only possible through measures such as project bonds and far-reaching reforms such as the cohesion policy reform that we will adopt in 2013. Ambitious territorial development policies will allow the EU to maintain its high-quality human capital and foster an open and fair business environment as well as investment in research and innovation for successful products and business models, for the benefit of Europe’s economy and society. The promotion of a strong industrial base needs to be put at the centre of reforms, particularly in those areas where the EU has traditionally been strong, as well as in high-tech sectors where a strong industrial base is essential to develop innovation in products, processes and services and to create new jobs. In a context of economic recovery, it is necessary to adopt ambitious legislation for SMEs by simplifying regulations and strengthening access to finance, promoting effective capital systems (venture and angel), and enhancing the role of private and public equity investments in financing long-term corporate growth. Parliament’s commitment will be maximal. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even though our budget is limited, a year’s budget adds up to a figure that can be wasted by the markets in a single day. The multiannual financial framework (MFF) is very important but only if the Member States do not see the budget as a source of expenditure to be cut like all public expenditure, but rather as a resource which can help the economy to grow – an investment – and not as a cost for citizens but as the way to produce tangible results. The figures represent programmes, projects, things to be achieved. Therefore, I say ‘no’ to short-sighted cuts and ‘no’ to infighting between countries, because growth is an opportunity for all European citizens. In addition, the European budget should not be seen as separate, but as complementary to national budgets. A new approach is needed to strengthen links between the European budget and national budgets. In some ways, our budget is the 28th budget of the Member States. This is the only way we can create the global assets that can develop effective policies. We are asking for a more coordinated approach. The European Semester can also help with this. Finally, as regards Parliament’s role, I say this to the Council: we will accept neither a fait accompli 
nor a ‘take it or leave it’ approach. We want a preliminary consultation before the formal proposal is presented for approval. Citizens, worried about the future of Europe, express themselves through us and we, as their representatives, want to play a part in taking decisions. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say a big thank you to Ms Podimata and to all those Members who have worked hard so that we could hold today’s vote. This proposal has an inescapable logic and its basis is clear, robust and fair, if it is possible to use this latter adjective in relation to the economy. Not even the objections raised today undermine this logic, and the understandable concerns voiced over the possible counterproductive or undesirable effects – if made in good faith – can potentially be answered and resolved, as shown by the debate over the last few months. Of course, solutions to avoid undesirable effects exist, as long as there really is the will to establish this tax, because sometimes one has the feeling that caution is called for just to slow or block the approval process, with predictions of economic catastrophes. On this point, I would address Ms Ford: have we not already experienced these catastrophes thanks to harmful and reckless speculation? Mention has also been made of difficulties, but today, Europeans are calling on the institutions to recover the ability to carry out their general role and to equip the world of finance with precise rules, since this is our duty and this is our sovereignty as a body with a general nature. Therefore, let us make the right choice today, one which the citizens will welcome. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, development is not a luxury but a duty. Today, growth is a universally acknowledged priority. Yet this was not the case until recently, and my group can be rightly proud of having consistently pressed on this matter, in calling for some significant changes to the focus of European policy. As has already been mentioned, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) – which are the productive backbone of the economy – need not only the urgent interventions that will be discussed later but also long-term measures to cultivate the human capital of the young men and women of Europe. These measures must send them the message that a business-oriented outlook and a spirit of enterprise mean more than a career or a question of personal success or adventure. Indeed, these attitudes are also useful to society, because they help to create – through a model of development based on widespread enterprise – the conditions for fairer and more sustainable growth, as Ms Krehl has already said. For we want to see development that is innovative, and that is both able to seize all the new opportunities and sustainable in environmental and social terms. As regards the long-term efforts, in terms of training, I would also advocate revisiting technical colleges, which are a real asset in Europe, one that we have neglected for too long. These are a great resource and a great way of learning about science and technology, and therefore of getting a taste for creating something new through your own ingenuity. As for resources, while still on the subject of urgent action – and I address these remarks especially to the Commission but also to the Council, which together with Parliament, must make a decision on the Structural Funds Regulation – it will be essential to coordinate resources. Shall we be able to use the Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs (COSME) funds (the financial instruments for SMEs), the research funds and the Structural Funds in a complementary approach? If we use these resources wisely, in a complementary fashion, then we shall be able to get the most from them; otherwise, we shall risk spreading them too thinly. The Structural Funds are indispensable, and they are intrinsically focused on this priority. Nevertheless, Commissioner, while recognising the importance of thematic concentration, I believe that it is also important that the regional authorities should be able to contribute to the planning and decision-making process, because while it is true that many regions need guidance, many others are quite capable of planning and setting priorities. The regions are key, for they are the engine room of progress, of business growth, of the spirit of new employment, and of the desire to participate, including on the part of all the economic, social and community bodies. Hence, the regions are the main resource where EU policies and the policies of the local authorities must come together. I must emphasise, then, the importance of coordinating resources. And finally, as regards the definition of SMEs – a subject on which the Member States will have their say, and therefore the Council will need to as well – in my view, what counts is not only the structural elements – employment and turnover – but also the quality of the small and medium-sized enterprises, which operate locally but think globally. I therefore ask that special consideration be given to the fundamental nature of small businesses and their support network. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, when we speak about good examples for our citizens, when we speak about the internal market and the possibility of creating genuine, concrete opportunities for changes in everyday life through the working of the internal market, we can truly use this example – and we obviously have need of many others – as a fruit of our labours. It is a good example because, as was said, it has an impact on citizens’ real lives, on their daily lives. It also helps businesses to expand their market, not because charges are high and services reduced, but because they can increase their service offering and, in substance, it also helps the economy as a whole. That is why I believe that it is, without doubt, a positive example, a good example. Yet you will have realised, Commissioner, that there is a widespread desire in this House; in particular, let us recall the speeches of two of my colleagues, Ms Riera Madurell and Mr Goebbels, not to mention many others, who would like this good example to become the best possible example, and would like us to move towards a zero-cost roaming outcome. Such an outcome is possible, and this measure partly anticipates that. Are we wishing for utopia? No. We are not, because an internal European market implies that domestic and non-domestic tariffs should be similar. There is no longer differentiation if we speak of the single market and, above all, because there is no technical justification for an increase in charges. I remember when, in 2007, we began to discuss voice roaming charges, the first of the trio that we have now tackled. There was a certain incredulity and also certain difficulties; not, however, on the part of the Commission, and here I must give the credit to your predecessor, Ms Reding. The difficulties were quite wide-ranging. They came from those who said that a true market did not allow for tariffs to be regulated, that there were political prices to pay, that they belonged to an old idea of the left, et cetera, et cetera. There were those who said it would not work and so on, that it would put a brake on the market. In the end, however, we have done it. The interests of citizens and establishing that these were not justifications for increased charges have made it possible. That is how the world moves on, and things are becoming, let us say, ever more possible. That is why I think an even more courageous outcome is achievable. A concluding remark on why it is not possible to do otherwise. Today, we had a visit from a delegation of Tunisian citizens; I do not know if they are still here. Perhaps one of its many benefits is that this extension to outside the EU will make us understand that the opportunity of using phones without the bugbear of charges will also aid democracy.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I want, first and foremost, to express my very sincere appreciation for Mr Giegold’s work on this own-initiative report. I also recall that we share with him and with others an active presence in Parliament’s Social Economy Intergroup. My political group, as you know, believes that the social model is one of the fundamental characteristics of the European integration project. Therefore, this is not just a simple policy, or one of many; it is a policy that characterises our entire project. In this day and age, with the attacks relating to the need for public spending cuts as well, we still firmly support this priority. We know that it may be as a revised or modified social model, but we believe that it should be retained, defended and reaffirmed as a priority. Therefore, I believe that, in this same vision, we must also promote business entities, such as cooperatives, which produce goods and services and have a very special role in the so-called European social economy. These businesses reassert the fact that it is possible to be productive, to do good things, to be efficient even if the goal is not profit but rather, for example, employment, welfare, labour development and contributing to the life of the local community. This is why it is important – I am finishing here, Madam President – for Europe to make the appropriate instruments available for an active policy and make a good statute – not the one that exists now, which is unusable, but a good statute for cooperatives which can be a way to help this very important sector.

 Mr President, I too applaud the positive outcome of the transitional period, and hope that a definitive solution will be found in the financial programming that will deliver a stable, definitive and rapid response to a real need, which is unfortunately growing, because the number of poor people, the new poor, in Europe is continuing to rise. New areas of the population that were formerly self-sufficient now do not have enough food to live on, and food is a primary basic right. These are poor workers, single mothers with children, and people suffering from invalidating illnesses. The spectre of hunger has once again raised its head in civilised Europe. I believe that we cannot remain indifferent, just as we cannot support the reasons of those – including many of our colleagues, unfortunately – who think the responsibility should lie first and foremost with the Member States, that we should focus on nutritional education, and so on. In my view we should first of all take this action and then abolish food subsidies, not the other way round. Luckily, however, outside Parliament, Europe is made up of young people, volunteers, associations and political groups that want this House to deliver more fairness and solidarity in Europe. This is what we are working towards. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Internet applications and services still have great potential both for the economy and for a more informed and inclusive society. Now that the telecoms package is being transposed into national legislation, there is a risk that the European framework may become fragmented. The Commission’s monitoring role will therefore be important. I would also say that the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) will have an important part to play, and some of us would have liked it to have been stronger during the drafting of the telecoms package as well. The priorities that we want to emphasise in this debate are: a guarantee of net neutrality, development of broadband infrastructure and of more open software, security of access and interoperability of systems, promotion of the use of digital technologies throughout industry and the services sector, production of digital content and new services, inclusion of people who are currently excluded – I am thinking of people with disabilities, amongst others – and support for pluralism in information provision and culture. It should also be laid down and guaranteed that operators cannot adopt blocking or throttling practices or discriminate against users and that they should ensure the utmost transparency in their commercial offers and in all their business activities. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this year and the next are crucial to the future and unity of Europe. The work programme should therefore be included more fully in this framework of exceptionality, which certainly means focusing on key objectives, giving more concrete efficacy to our actions, concentrating investments towards those bodies which can, in turn, put into action other private resources, but also, as my colleague has said, seeing the Commission – President Barroso, if I could just have your attention for a moment – playing a more active role, which is better directed towards the reality of certain countries and of the entire euro area and of the whole of Europe. We hope that the Commission will take on this role, and I say this even as a representative of a country which, at this moment, is changing its government; which is not a technocratic government but rather a technical government that demonstrates not the rejection of political forces and politics but, if anything, the generosity – and I say this as a force that was in opposition in my country – of parties that are ready to do what is useful for the country even without direct representation. I believe that the theme of stable and equal growth should regard the theme of supporting businesses in two ways: access to credit and innovation. The Commission and Europe are capable of achieving this in a concrete way. When we recapitalise and help to recapitalise banks, even, perhaps, with public support, we should demand that this credit go to the real economy – first and foremost to the real economy. When Horizon 2020 becomes one of the main dossiers, we should initiate wide-scale research on innovation for enterprises, whether these be large or small. The chapter on the digital agenda is also very important because the creation of this unique market will be of great help to society. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D
),

The favourable outcome of the vote concerning the resolution on the situation in Egypt and Syria, with particular regard for Christian communities, is confirmation of the fact that Europe continues to look after ethnic and religious minorities. Unfortunately, the situation has now become even more worrying due to a trail of blood and death, in Egypt above all, but also elsewhere in the world, which the European institutions cannot ignore. Parliament is alive to this and intends to take action to ensure that such episodes are not repeated. There is no use in denying that tension exists between Muslims and Christians, but stopping there would only afford a partial view of the situation. History teaches us that religions can coexist, as long as the climate is right. The current difficulties are worsened by hidden troublemakers, who fan the flames to deepen the conflict and impede the transition to democracy. We need to clarify the role of the armed forces in this phase, as they have all too frequently turned into the agents of repression, rather than guarantors of transition. We appeal to the representatives of all religions, philosophies and schools of thought to contribute to civil and peaceful coexistence. Europe – the home of fundamental rights and freedoms – will do its part to ensure that these principles are respected. Patrizia Toia,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis in Europe is interlinking the problems of public budgets and private capital with those of the productivity of our businesses in a vicious circle, and the spectre of recession is looming. Therefore, if small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are our top priority, I would call on the Commission, alongside Parliament, to make absolutely sure that our good principles are put into practice and that the Member States turn the legislative initiatives of the Small Business Act (SBA) into highly effective, high-quality, concrete measures. Just think, Commissioner, what would happen if the Late Payment Directive were implemented early in all the Member States, and what a great benefit to SMEs it would be! The SME tests are important, but we are still at the method stage. Of course, it is only right to check that the laws we make really are suited to SMEs and further their interests, but we would urge you to persevere and examine the issues very thoroughly when setting up this framework of opportunity that you have sketched out. We also appreciate what the Commission has been doing and we are ready with the budget and the other options that we have to support it. I would just like to say a word about credit. We have to make our position clear to the banks – I am saying this to you, Commissioner – because SMEs need help … (The President cut off the speaker) Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the preparation of the common strategic framework for research and innovation funding represents a huge opportunity for the development and economy of Europe. It is a matter of pulling the lever that can truly usher in a period of growth and also of new skilled employment, such as that done by researchers and young people who devote themselves precisely to the new opportunities in innovation and technology and associated professions. One observation in particular emerges from this work, which is that we in Europe must put increasing emphasis on the kinds of research and innovation that find practical application, originate new companies, result in new patents and do not remain pure basic research or pure knowledge, which is certainly important, but not to the extent that it actually triggers development. The second observation is the relationship with local bodies, regions and territories, which are an important tool for territorial planning and for bringing together research, universities, centres of excellence and businesses.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report looks at global food security. This means that what is at stake here is not only hunger in the world or in the very poorest countries, but that the subject of food supply affects all communities, including those in the most developed countries. I would like to pick out a few key points of consistency between European policies and this target of global food security, because we in Parliament are quite accomplished at preaching, but often we are not consistent in our decisions. I only wish to highlight three innovative areas, which I think we ought to develop further. Firstly: food supply is currently jeopardised by price volatility, caused by speculation in food markets – through derivatives and so forth – that must be contained, if not banned outright. Secondly: the subject of land grabbing, which I think needs to be addressed in some form of treaty or negotiation, because democracy and the survival of many populations are at risk. Thirdly: consistency between food supply and energy policies. In our efforts to produce new energy, we must not make it impossible to produce food for the people of the world. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, hidden behind the widespread prosperity of our continent is an often invisible Europe that we refer to in numerical, statistical and sociological terms and not as real people. These people are often women and children or the elderly – the most vulnerable population groups in other words. However, Europe will have no credibility in the eyes of the public unless it learns to be consistent, and we want to be consistent, in this Parliament and at this stage in Europe’s existence. Therefore, if we say that the Union is based upon values and human rights, I do not think we can suspend or cut so drastically a programme for people who suffer from food poverty – in other words, for those who lack the right to food or the right to access food and hence lack fundamental rights – on account of an unresolved legal issue. We are talking about an agricultural fund, a social fund – and if it is a social fund, Commissioner, it should not impinge on other social programmes, but be a new ad hoc fund with appropriate resources. We say that we want to guarantee food security for Europeans, but the most important right with regard to food security is the right to food itself, followed by the right to healthy food. We need, therefore, to be consistent. With that in mind, we must find a legal solution that provides continuity and that, with the help of non-governmental organisations in the voluntary sector, guarantees the most fundamental human right: the right to food.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is time to take some bold decisions in this Europe if we want to do more than just survive. The crisis has severely disrupted normal life for European citizens and businesses and, if we do not react, it could mean that the quality of the social and cultural life, the welfare and the future of young people and Europeans, are irreversibly affected. As well as creating valuable cohesion and prosperity, overcoming the crisis means finding solutions to the causes identified: solutions for tackling speculation, which should also be restricted where necessary through the introduction of strict rules for the financial markets; solutions for combating the recession; solutions for combating the imbalanced development model that has put individuals below profit; and solutions for combating the resurgence of nationalism, which is today preventing Europe from making the choices that it has to make. Above all, it is time to provide tools and resources – new and old – so that we can forge ahead and start the engine of growth, with research, innovation, training and support for productive investment, infrastructure and jobs, because without jobs, people have no dignity or rights. Thanks to Mrs Berès and other Members, this report outlines a possible strategy for a Europe that is proud and aware of its role. It is now up to Europe’s leaders, if they exist, to implement it.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that one point that we all agree on and have established is that this programme for frequency harmonisation and coordinated spectrum use can serve a dual purpose. I believe that this is a key point to be remembered at all times; in other words, through the programme, we can develop the great potential for economic exploitation of this field by the telecommunications sector, the audiovisual sector and new services, while, at the same time, giving a boost to economic development and to other sectors linked to the telecommunications sector. We can also develop the potential for cultural and social development that this dual purpose permits and requires. Commissioner, in my opinion this programme should also be seen as an opportunity, so that we respect and uphold certain fundamental principles through the choices we make. Firstly, the principle of media pluralism. The review of the system for managing radio frequencies at European level is very important, and I believe that we must clearly prevent the accumulation of frequency rights and the creation of monopolies and oligopolies, which unfortunately exist in some European countries and which are becoming stronger and gaining a foothold in the broadcasting sector. Secondly, the principle of balance between the liberalisation and opening up of the market to new operators, and fairness, so that the commitments entered into with those operators who have provided substantial investment can also be promoted, supported and maintained on the market. Lastly, transparency and the guarantee of well-managed and well-administered frequency allocations. We are talking about auctions not only to focus on an aspect of the market that should be reconciled with all the possible social uses for spectrum, but also to say that discretion should not be used and unfair advantages should not be given with regard to radio frequencies. This point also deserves close attention. To conclude, unfortunately I do not have the time to expand on the social aspects, but they have been discussed at great length by all the members of my group. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteurs and Mr Barnier for their generous contribution to Parliament. We support the idea of an internal market which is able to understand and meet the social expectations and the implications that the social dimension requires. It is not a pipe dream; it is realistic and also modern. It is this vision that makes the market stronger, because focusing only on the economic element, essentially reducing the market to a question of economics, has shown that it will solve neither problems of growth nor of cohesion. This means, in short, that we must now fully realise the ideal of a European social market economy. In today’s texts, we have this. There is recognition of the social enterprises, cooperatives and their role, of mutual insurance companies and of foundations, which represent 10% of European companies and many of our jobs. These are a reality with real businesses demonstrating economic pluralism and the pluralism of business. They work with capital but not for capital and want to create work, welfare, quality of life and innovation, and to demonstrate that these values should and can be part of the internal market in Europe.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I join all my fellow Members who have spoken in noting that we are at last talking about a common industrial policy again, and I hope action and also specific decisions will be forthcoming again soon. I am grateful for the Lange report, the excellent work done by our fellow Member, and Vice-President Tajani’s communication. This decision means some important things, the first of which is that the revitalisation and recovery of Europe’s economy and the resilience of employment, as has been said, depend partly, and perhaps especially, on the recovery of the whole manufacturing sector, both the more advanced and the more traditional parts of it, and on the support it is given. That is because it is still possible to push the boundaries in manufacturing, something that was not so obvious until a short time ago. Secondly, the recovery of industry in Europe also means that our competitiveness is not only in play in the financial or tertiary sector, but here as well, and it is not too late for us to take up the challenge to make Europe competitive in industry vis-à-vis
 the rest of the world. The third point, as has been said, is that the new industrial policy focuses on factors rather than sectors; it focuses on factors and instruments that can genuinely promote new companies and a new capacity for resilience and modernisation. I feel it is important to highlight once again these new factors on which we need to act: credit – we are calling for new initiatives in addition to those already announced by the Commissioner on the subject of credit – raw materials, energy prices, innovation, research, the need to enhance the capacity for the technological transfer of the results of research and innovation within companies in Europe, in new products and new ways of organising production. We must make good use of a highly unique industrial fabric in Europe, particularly in certain countries, which is that of small and medium-sized enterprises, the quality of enterprises and of their products, and the unique nature of European industry. I think we should rediscover these manufacturing traditions and manufacturing roots in many countries in order to innovate and change them. Lastly, there is the question of location, which is very important. European policies are successful if they find a region able to tackle them. We therefore thank Mr Lange and look forward to an excellent collaboration with the Commission in order to arrive at concrete results very soon. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is not easy to find so much unanimity in Parliament This means that the work was really outstanding and Mrs Van Brempt and all the other shadow rapporteurs should be made aware of this. It has been said that the resulting instrument is very positive for several reasons. It is positive because its procedures and timeframes are fast; positive because it is aimed at highly qualified project categories; positive because it is aimed at urban contexts, in other words, at local authorities which, by making specific decisions, are able to bring about real change in the state of affairs and improve air quality, housing quality and urban transport quality; positive because it is aimed at profitable projects and can therefore yield a return of resources; and positive, lastly, because the strategy will bring many more resources into play. In the face of all this, however, picking up on an objection raised by many Members, including Mr Geier, Mr Turmes and Mr Cancian, I wish to say to the Commissioner that the sticking point will be the implementation, the choice of financial intermediaries, the relationship with local authorities and how their financial difficulties are dealt with. Commissioner, this instrument raises the possibility of opening the way to other projects, to a stabilisation of this instrument and its extension to other sectors. The topic is crucial. The same thing must not happen that happened with the Recovery Plan and with the small and medium-sized enterprises that are still waiting for the EUR 30 billion approved by Parliament and the Commission at the end of 2008.

 I just wanted to inform you that my voting machine was not working for the Hoang Ngoc report. I was voting against it. Patrizia Toia,  
rapporteur. 
− (IT) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report which we are debating this evening and on which we shall vote tomorrow is part of a major effort to implement the 20/20/20 package, which I believe is still one of the most far-sighted and significant things to have come out of the last European parliamentary term. If asked what I would save from the last five years, I would definitely place the 20/20/20 package at the top of the list. I believe that it is important to add that some very intense work went into this report, on the part of both the European Commission – a communication and a recommendation preceded this report – and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and others. They enriched the initial report and our work with many suggestions, additions and amendments. I believe that there is still a slight difference of opinion within Parliament over one point, and I hope that it can be overcome with tomorrow’s vote. It concerns the more or less binding nature that we wish to attribute to the contents of this report, which I would like to make a point of saying was drafted in a context of great understanding and great unanimity. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) represent an important sector, not least, in fact, because of the weight they carry in the European economy: they account for 7% of the labour force – of the European labour force – and 6% of GDP, thus a significant share of the European economy and of the European productive and labour force too. They are also very important not only, precisely, for what they represent, but also for the contribution they can make and for the essential, significant role that they can play in terms of trying to achieve this transition from our economy to a situation in which the economy, though still developed, produces fewer emissions and has a lower carbon content and will thus pollute less for our future and for that of the generations to come. In short, they can represent – not in words, but in concrete actions – changes that can lead to a way of producing, living, travelling and consuming in our society, and to that industrial revolution that, for many, will actually characterise the future of social and economic life, not only on our continent but throughout the entire world. How can ICTs make this major contribution to transforming our economy? Firstly, by changing the sector itself: the report is intended to demonstrate how this sector can, first and foremost, look within itself to see how it can produce communication, microelectronic and other instruments that consume less energy, and are thus inherently more efficient. Next, they can make an enormous contribution in the major sectors, in the housing and transport sectors. The latter two – I am quoting data from the Commission – are sectors in which greater efficiency, according to the European rules and the targets also laid down by the 20/20/20 package, can lead to a very substantial reduction in these emissions – since, today, the transport sector consumes 26% of the energy in Europe, and 40% is consumed in homes for heating and cooling, depending on the season – and can achieve very high levels of efficiency. This is without mentioning that the scope, in the case of the major sectors, affects our lives in very significant areas. I am thinking of the entire banking sector, of the relationships within public administration, of the entire e
-government sector and of all the services, in short, which, with the application of these technologies, will be able not only to reduce their carbon emissions but also to save time, with a consequent improvement in the quality of life of Europeans and in the quality of social life. This is, therefore, highly significant. However, I believe that this report will be all the more significant if Parliament approves its binding character tomorrow. I would like to offer just two examples, Mr President, if I may: smart meters and the smart grid, and smart cities. 
Only yesterday, 700 European mayors concluded a new agreement in this House, before our President and the European Commissioner, aimed precisely at improving the efficiency of cities, which are home to more than 70% of European citizens and which can thus make a major contribution to increasing efficiency and economic and social development.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is not just a routine debate but it is supposed to be very specific and to ask clear and precise questions – what resources are there and where to get them – and I hope that Parliament is expecting equally clear and precise answers, today and at the forthcoming Councils on 12 and 25 March. We want to tell the Commission and the Council firmly that the European Union, which has flown the flag for the fight against atmospheric emissions and climate change in front of the world, now has to be consistent if it does not want to lose credibility. It must do everything it can to achieve these goals. We must be well aware that talking about a low-emission economy means a kind of Copernican revolution for the production system; it means changing many things, having clear priorities and political will but, above all, sufficient resources and instruments. We also know that this Copernican revolution is vital for our production system, European industry, to remain competitive. In many countries, in many research centres and in many universities, the intellectual resources are ready, the capabilities are there and the will is there: it is now time to set things in motion. Everyone has to do it, as the Commissioner and the Council have said: the Member States, entrepreneurs and the private sector have to do it. I believe, however, that the vital task of putting this complex partnership together belongs to the European Union. Patrizia Toia,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the initiative that we are about to launch is very important for two reasons: the first is the subject of the research, which concerns the fight against neurodegenerative diseases, and the second is the joint programming methods for the research. Clearly, we would have preferred Parliament to have been more directly involved in the pilot project – this has been said and it is the subject of our question. While we must press on now and not bring matters to a halt, we are nonetheless asking for guarantees that our opinion will be taken into account in the Competitiveness Council’s deliberations, and that a more certain legal basis will be defined in future so that Parliament can be fully involved and there can be a greater sense of ownership in this field of research. We must now intervene with adequate means and resources to prevent and eradicate the widespread scourge of Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and the other diseases, which are destined to become more common as our population ages. We call for efforts to be focused on extensive, large-scale studies, aimed both at diagnosis and at identifying cures. Research into biomarkers, into early diagnosis methods based on a multidisciplinary approach, the compilation of vast databases, and the search for curative medicines and appropriate treatment and service models would appear crucial. I wish to make just one request in this House: that we ignore neither the individual circumstances of patients, which are too often excluded in the context of these types of disease, nor the involvement of patients’ and relatives’ associations. From a methodological point of view, we believe that joint research projects are very important because they fulfil an essential requirement: that of pooling efforts and resources and overcoming these divisions, these duplications, and therefore being able to create a critical mass that is sufficient to produce satisfactory results from this type of research. If we consider that, in other parts of the world, joint public and private efforts manage to invest tens of millions of euros, we realise how much there remains for us to do and how much we still have to do, by directing our efforts towards joint projects, towards strategic lines of action and joint programmes between the Member States and Europe and towards common programmes between public and private operators, without disregarding that international framework that puts us in contact with major scientific developments at international level.

 I voted in favour of the draft European Parliament legislative resolution on EU accession to the Protocol for the Protection of the Mediterranean Sea against pollution resulting from exploration and exploitation of the continental shelf and the seabed and its subsoil. The Protocol entered into force on 24 March 2011, following its ratification by six contracting parties (Albania, Tunisia, Morocco, Libya, Cyprus and Syria), and so far has neither been signed nor ratified by the Union. Given that, following the discovery of new reserves of fossil fuels in the Mediterranean, offshore activities are likely to increase, a potential accident could have immediate large-scale effects. For this reason I think that the EU’s ratification of the Offshore Protocol would constitute important leverage to ensure a good level of cooperation and the continued concrete commitment of all Mediterranean countries to the achievement of the maximum possible safety of offshore activities.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the legislative procedure began in November 2010 and has been a demanding task from a technical and political point of view, lasting a good two years and involving three Presidencies. It is therefore appropriate to thank all those who have been involved: the shadow rapporteurs, Parliament’s Secretariat and the political group secretariats and MEPs’ assistants – and, of course, the Commission and the Council. Agreement was reached at first reading, a fact that I consider highly significant. The objective of this regulation is to lay down harmonised rules on the manufacture of agricultural and forestry vehicles with a view to ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market and, in particular, the application of a large number of important criteria to improve operational, road and occupational safety for users, that is to say workers, and standards of environmental protection. In this context, the introduction in Articles 7 and 8 of new operational and occupational requirements may be considered a real success for the whole of the European Parliament, which has succeeded in covering risks which, at present, affect numerous operators, often with fatal consequences: one need only think of protection from electrical discharge or indeed from overturning. In addition, we must not underestimate the importance of worker health and safety, and so we have made provisions for the market surveillance of vehicles, systems and components, in order to ensure that all the provisions are implemented properly and carried out effectively. To sum up, the regulation helps to make industry more competitive, since it simplifies current legislation on the approval of vehicles, making it more transparent and reducing red tape. In fact, 24 base directives and around 25 related amending directives on technical requirements are being repealed and replaced by a single regulation. These aspects are important, because this regulation seeks to achieve other objectives, beyond helping to create a regulated internal market and to provide a framework enabling a competitive, balanced and transparent system. In addition, I believe we are also contributing to strengthening the sector, and in short we are putting in place the conditions for both widening the productive base and increasing employment. The work that has been done is therefore highly important and extremely useful: the compromises found between the political groups are the result of a major collaborative effort undertaken in the right spirit, with the desire to present Parliament with a consensus regulation.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the Vice-President for his contribution. I would not know where to put a tractor, so it is just as well that it is staying where it belongs. I do not think there is anything more to add: the debate has shown the degree of consensus surrounding the proposed regulation on agricultural and forestry vehicles. Now I hope that this consensus will be completely confirmed in the vote in the Chamber. This is what we have worked for, and so I really hope this result can be achieved.

 I voted in favour of the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2008/106/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the minimum level of training of seafarers. Training of a seafarers is an essential element of maritime safety and it is therefore of the utmost importance that crews trained in different countries in accordance with different systems have the necessary skills to carry out their onboard duties safely. The present proposal is aimed at bringing relevant EU legislation on training and certification of seafarers into line with current international standards, improving the wording of the legislative text for the sake of clarity. I therefore consider the proposal to be essential for avoiding conflict between international obligations and the EU obligations of the Member States. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 I voted for the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime. The new directive proposes to establish minimum standards on the rights, support, recognition and the widest protection within the territory of the EU of victims of crime, regardless of their legal status, whether in terms of content or implementation. Since confidence in justice is a priority for all citizens, especially for victims who feel their rights are unheard and out of reach, I think this proposal for a directive is an appropriate means of closing the many gaps and overcoming the many obstacles that currently exist in the single market and in the European area of freedom, security and justice.

 I am voting in favour of the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on administrative cooperation through the Internal Market Information System (‘the IMI Regulation’). The proposal aims to establish a set of common rules which will allow them to further exploit the IMI system’s full potential and encourage a smooth cross-border exchange of information between different authorities in the Member States, guaranteeing, at the same time, a higher level of protection than traditional communication channels. On these grounds, I believe the proposal for a regulation is an essential element to complete the single market and is clearly in the interest of citizens. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is increasingly being called upon to play an important role in the geopolitical changes that are affecting vast areas of the world. I believe that it is ever more urgent to raise the profile and quality of foreign policy, especially because many of these changes are taking place not far from Europe. To achieve this, we need to convince the Member States to invest in European common foreign policy, thereby reinforcing the choices made in the Treaty of Lisbon. Baroness Ashton, we need to move from the current activism – which cannot be denied and is manifest in the many trips you have made to every corner of the world – towards a more central role that will not only leave its mark, but will also adjust the existing equilibrium in favour of European foreign policy. It is to be hoped that it will be possible to dedicate a special session within Parliament to debate the foreign policy and the strategies to be put in place. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in reality, this debate is merely recording our powerlessness in the face of the tragedy that is unfolding in Syria, and I would like to know whether we are simply acknowledging this state of affairs or whether we intend to implement an appropriate, strong political initiative to try and restart diplomatic activity and adopt the necessary choices in the field, starting with the humanitarian corridor. Europe cannot be a passive bystander to the events taking place. Those who think that this situation should be prolonged must be aware that they are taking on a major political and moral responsibility. Is it true, Baroness Ashton, that you feel conditioned by the divisions and inconclusiveness of the Member State chancelleries? If so, this must be said. We need to call loudly upon all the European governments to support your work and your European action consistently, and I would like to hear this call clearly from yourself, Baroness Ashton, here today in the European Parliament.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the choice made by the Council on 7 June does not just concern European internal policy; as you can imagine, it also has an impact outside Europe. Everyone here has said that the free movement of people is one of the greatest European achievements in a Europe that is defined by it. However, restricting that free movement actually implies and portrays a feeling of mistrust that the Council is trying to distil among European countries and into European public opinion, which risks destroying the European project. For some time we have been calling for innovative and modern European governance on the migration issue. What you are doing, though, renationalises immigration policy. You are making rights and freedoms take a backward step, but these choices are likely to have a negative impact on another front, in that they reveal a certain schizophrenia in the action taken by Europe in its various policies. Together we have decided that one of the pillars of the new neighbourhood policy is mobility, a core element of the new European approach, for example towards a changing area such as the Mediterranean. What message are we sending out to these countries, apart from a message of distrust and lack of credibility? Pier Antonio Panzeri,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at long last we can say that the official announcement of the appointment of Mr Morsi, leader of the Justice and Freedom Party, has brought this first phase of the Egyptian political saga to a close; it was never a given, with two highly controversial judgments of the Constitutional Court sending out shockwaves in the days before the results were announced. The first judgment saw the supreme court declare the political isolation law under which Mr Shafiq was made ineligible to stand in the presidential elections as unconstitutional. The second judgment ruled that the electoral law used for the general elections was unconstitutional, thereby dissolving parliament, which could also have consequences for the constituent assembly. Just to complicate matters, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces also issued amendments to the constitution, severely weakening the president’s powers and abolishing autonomous legislative power until a new constitution has been approved. In his first speech as president, Mr Morsi sent what was, for us, a cheering message of unity and conciliation, as he sought to mollify the various sections of Egyptian society. In terms of foreign policy, he affirmed that he would make good on existing international obligations. Now we will have to see whether he is as good as his word. In any case, after a period of extreme uncertainty and instability, the election of a new president could finally open the way to a new phase that might, on the one hand, spur Egypt on to quickly consolidate democracy and rights and, on the other hand, enable efforts to be made to revive the economy and put an end to the ongoing financial crisis. We need, in this area, to make the role of the European Union clearer and more visible, including via the EU-Egypt task force. The EU must be ready to work with the new president to strengthen bilateral relations, to support and see through the transition to democracy, and to overcome the economic and financial problems that could jeopardise the country’s stability.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, it cannot be enough for political and institutional leaders to show their rightful indignation at the horrors unfolding in Syria, and I think you, Baroness Ashton, are aware of that. What is happening beyond our borders requires an appropriate response capacity, and frankly I do not think even the European Union as a whole has sufficient response capacity to meet the challenges facing us. How long must we stand and watch the massacre in Syria? We can understand all the current difficulties resulting from the fragile balance of power in the region; we can understand, yet not agree with, the positions of Russia and China, who will not allow the United Nations to take more incisive action; and we can also understand the mistrust in certain spheres in Europe towards the forces opposing Bashar al-Assad, not least because of their sources of funding. However, we cannot tolerate what is happening any longer. The European Union should go beyond its current activism and take a stronger lead. We have to disprove the idea that the Assad regime can do what it likes because the international community has shown itself to be impotent and that the European Union is too tied up in the economic and financial crisis to allow itself the luxury of intervening in the events in Syria. The decision to create a humanitarian corridor has not been put into practice. I think, though, we should make a fresh start on that and back up that decision with all the means at our disposal, bar none – and I stress, bar none – because that is a vital prerequisite for initiating the transition process and the transfer of power. We now need to turn our words into actions, and that is a task that is clearly yours to shoulder. Pier Antonio Panzeri,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Ms Lunacek has done a great job. I think that the process of consolidation of democracy in Kosovo is a very important factor. Our goal now is to encourage the government authorities in Priština and all the political forces represented in Parliament to persevere in the area of democratic reforms, reforms that are capable of modernising the country and opening a new phase in the political, civil, and economic life of Kosovo. There are still many shortcomings to address – earlier, the Council mentioned them – and they must be addressed with vigour and determination, and first and foremost they must be addressed by the Kosovo authorities with the consistency required. Admittedly, the situation is evolving. We can only welcome the historic agreement reached between Belgrade and Priština on inclusive regional cooperation and on the representation of Kosovo in regional forums. This may seriously promote stability throughout the Western Balkan region and is therefore of great importance for the European Union as well. It is in this context – as Commissioner Füle reminded us – that we welcome the fact that the Commission has initiated a feasibility study for a Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and Kosovo. We must now persevere on this path, because this path may not only bring peace and make the relationship between Serbia and Kosovo more profitable, and may bring these countries even closer to the EU, but also because it may help overcome the prejudices towards Kosovo on the part of those countries that have still not recognised the existence of Kosovo itself. There is thus a task that must be performed by Europe, but first and foremost a task that the Kosovar authorities must fully carry out in order to achieve these goals. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, there is one point on which Parliament has found a broad consensus over the last few weeks. This concerns the need to change the neighbourhood policy towards southern Mediterranean countries, particularly in view of the changes taking place which are producing significant improvements in the spread of democracy, and opening a whole new chapter in the EU’s approach to these countries. Now we need to be consistent and not oscillate between extremes when implementing this neighbourhood policy. It would be absurd and inexcusably incomplete if this policy merely called for more rights and democracy in these countries, and resolutely ignored everything else, starting with economic and trade issues. We have often stated that rights and democracy are established above all also through new economic and financial policies capable of stimulating growth in these countries. Democracy and social and economic growth are inextricably linked. The agreement with Morocco is part of this context. It aims at and must encourage mutual convenience in terms of free trade and the process of integrating the Mediterranean area. I am concerned about Mr Bové’s style of protectionism because, instead of helping the democratic process and rights in these countries, it in fact becomes an objective obstacle to them. For all these reasons it is important that Parliament should approve this agreement, and I hope that tomorrow this will happen. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, a huge effort has been made by the two rapporteurs to redefine European Neighbourhood Policy, which is necessary considering the great changes which are under way, particularly in the Mediterranean region, which is being affected by a new wind transforming a large number of its countries. The huge leap forwards which this new phase has brought about must be achieved with strength and determination, to build the conditions for our support for the transition processes taking place. However, we must be careful because the movements that have begun in these North African countries are not linear: there are and there may be increasing numbers of counter-trends and we cannot be sure or confident of how things will end. Nevertheless, we have to remain involved and not turn our backs on the situation. We should instead monitor these changes, paying closer attention and increasing our involvement. Of course, we should focus our attention on economic and financial issues, on the opening up of markets, on a process of regulated mobility, but now we also need to be more rigorous in demanding that the new laws uphold human rights, equality between men and women, and political and religious plurality. These should be the cornerstones of a new neighbourhood policy if it is to be effective and not run into the mistakes of the past. I hope that the good work carried out by Commissioner Füle continues in this direction. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, despite there still being some pockets of resistance by supporters of the old Libyan regime and even if, while Colonel Gaddafi is still around, the National Transitional Council still fears possible backlashes, it is right and proper to focus our attention on the post-war challenges. The European Union’s role in the process of reconstruction and stabilisation of Libya is extremely important. Aside from the immediate priorities of food, medicine, a plan for security, public order, border control and the highly sensitive issue of withdrawing arms, it is important to prepare for medium- to long-term action. This begins with the contribution necessary for the election process that will open up to institutional capacity building in the transitional phase, and to economic and social development. After the aggressive stage of the crisis which saw the European Union isolated, it is right to think that this is the time to strengthen Europe’s role with the right amount of determination. We do not just have a humanitarian duty, however important that may be, when thinking of the many migrants in Libya. We cannot fail to be present at the table that will redesign the geopolitical structure of the region, which now has another important protagonist in the shape of Turkey, as we are seeing at the moment with Prime Minister Erdogan’s triumphant visits to various Arab countries, just as we cannot delegate management of the post-war phase solely to the group of countries that took part in the NATO mission. There are already signs of competition on the Libyan stage between some Member States which is not subtle and will not have a beneficial outcome. In fact, in the race towards the new Libya it is not difficult to see economic and energy-related interests. The plans for building a democratic Libya are not so clear, and this is what requires hard work and dedication. This is where the importance of the role of the European Union comes in, not least because the road before us is not an easy or a short one, and above all we must bear in mind that a democratic outcome is by no means guaranteed.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow we will vote on an important and compelling resolution that shows Parliament’s will, despite many difficulties, to adopt a clear position on the events that are affecting countries such as Syria, Bahrain and Yemen, together with all the associated problems. It is true that what is happening in other countries, like Tunisia and Morocco, shows that the route to democracy is viable; it may follow a different path, but it is possible. This observation, however, does not dispel the public perception of the policies pursued by the international community and by Europe itself on these events involving the Mediterranean region. This perception questions the idea that foreign policy can apply double standards as it unfolds. In essence, we wonder why things are done one way in Libya and another way in Syria. Certainly, it is clear that different standards apply in foreign policy: from political realism, to the strategic nature of certain areas, to the reluctance of large countries to adopt more definite positions. In any case, this is a contradiction that continues to dog us and which we must be able to tackle. How? In two ways: there is a need for European policy to take more of a leading role, for greater consistency to give credibility to our presence throughout this area; there is a need to give political weight to the idea of a Euro-Mediterranean operating structure that can provide a genuine and lasting reference point for both the north and south sides and that can deal with existing problems. This work needs to be done immediately with the necessary effort and determination. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the turbulent events laden with uncertainties and hopes that are changing the political geography of the southern shores of the Mediterranean are increasingly posing a challenge to Europe and its external policy. In view of what is happening, it should be increasingly important for the European Union to be able to rely on a sound, consistent external policy capable of dealing with a difficult present and planning for a problematic future, in which international relations will be altered and the world will be profoundly changed. In view of the strategic repositioning of countries such as the United States, China and Russia, and growing shortages of raw materials and energy resources, Europe should develop a crucial, decisive role, but it is quite clearly showing itself to be unprepared for such challenges. For some time now, it has been moving too slowly towards coordination of the external and domestic policies of its Member States. There has been no substantial progress. Evidence of this is, on the one hand, the lacklustre action deriving from its external policy and, on the other, the obstinacy of certain countries that are nostalgic for a colonial period that can no longer return and insist on believing that they protect their interests better by doing things alone and not delegating anything to European authority. We need to turn over a new leaf. Baroness Ashton, you have an important role; please fulfil it to the utmost, in the knowledge that the time available is quickly running out. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the criticisms that we have heard here this morning in connection with the petition presented are understandable. I think there is still a long way to go before we can ensure that a possible general agreement on agricultural products with Morocco receives consensus approval. On the one hand, the agreement must respect the need for balance, and not cause serious difficulties for European agricultural producers. On the other, it must respect the need for clear and transparent rules of competition on agricultural markets. This is the path to follow in order to ensure that the relationship between the European Union and Morocco is a positive one. I therefore invite the Commission to look for suitable solutions that do not lose sight of the producers’ interests, but which also do not lose sight of a renewed policy of generosity towards Morocco, particularly in view of the events taking place in the Maghreb. It would be very useful to understand, and I do not want us to end up effectively importing tomato pickers, instead of agricultural products and tomatoes. It is therefore important to carry out a thorough investigation in order to create a new European policy. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, with this review of the EU’s neighbourhood policies, we are setting forth on a journey that will not end any time soon. The events in the Mediterranean signal a process of profound change and they will have lasting consequences, not only for the countries of the region, but also for Europe. We must be aware that the transition to full democracy will not be easy and that these transitions are accompanied by many risks and uncertainties. For this reason, there are numerous things we must do and these will take time. Europe’s response must be characterised by a strategy based on immediate and long-term actions. We must facilitate access to European markets and allow greater mobility. We should organise a conference to explore the possibility of cancelling or renegotiating the debt of these countries which have chosen the road to democracy; we must make adequate financial resources available and provide assistance to the democratic process by strengthening parliamentary institutions and political parties, ensuring the full participation of all citizens. This should all happen within the framework of a revitalised Euro-Mediterranean dialogue. At stake is the strategic, political future of Europe. I believe that Europe must understand that we have to work to the east and the south, but right now, there is a special priority to the south. These policies need fundamental change; we must finally open a new chapter. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, beyond the measures that have been announced, I wonder if European policy is doing enough. It naturally takes time for the European Union to establish leadership, especially in foreign policy, but as we know, certain situations arise and unfortunately do not allow us all the time we would like and actually call for fast action and far-sightedness. Now it is clear that we are still falling short of requirements as far as affairs in the Mediterranean region and particularly Libya are concerned: we need to reflect a little more to recognise that perhaps we will need stronger action to understand what has been happing and also to deploy concerted action towards the Mediterranean. It is in fact clear to everyone that if we look at Libya, there is a substantial difference between the whole of Europe taking joint action and action only being taken by willing countries, as is the case at present. No, my message to the representatives of the Council and Commission is that we are not there yet. The Council has not answered certain questions, and now must do so quickly. I wonder if beyond the humanitarian effort, we really know what to do if the application of Resolution 1973 is not enough and if some countries go beyond their mandate. Secondly, I would like to know the Council's view on the issue of operational command: NATO told us that it is performing a technical role, but not providing political guidance. Do we think we can get along like that, without seeking a stronger and more united European Union voice instead of fobbing the job off onto the few who are willing? Finally, within the framework of ongoing operations and the relationship with the Arab League and the African Union, it is essential to prevent our intervention from ultimately being seen negatively, with the risk of creating uncertainty and dangerous shifts. Are we aware? Perhaps not altogether: these are questions that do not deserve bureaucratic answers but need appropriate policy responses, starting with tomorrow's Council meeting.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the spirit of this debate enables me, Baroness Ashton, to remind you that the Union for the Mediterranean’s Parliamentary Assembly concluded its meeting last week in Rome. It set out several paths that the Commission would do well to return to, in particular, in terms of its suggestions on how to support the democratic transition processes in progress. Hence, I urge you and I urge the Commission to follow the developments in Tunisia intently. This country is objectively a driving force for democracy and is setting a benchmark for the entire region. Regarding Libya, we need to be fully aware that having decreed it part of the international community, the severance of relations with Mr Gaddafi’s regime will have consequences, particularly given that his regime is showing greater resistance than those of Mr Ben Alì and Mr Mubarak. This means that we must act on four fronts right now – and political timescales are decisive – with credibility, sincerity and consistency. We must come up with a suitable European financial plan. I understand the evocative note struck by many, but we need an Ashton Plan rather than a Marshall Plan. We also need a European immigration and asylum policy, a deterrent policy including the closure of airspace, and full support for the opponents of Mr Gaddafi’s regime. Baroness Ashton, it is up to you and your foreign policy ties with the Council to make these points count in the coming days, but also to avoid Europe’s foreign policy being caught unawares again by the events that are changing the Mediterranean.

Mr President, I voted for the motion for a resolution on the progress of Croatia’s accession to the European Union within the framework of the enlargement process, because I attach great importance to starting this process and to the progress made by Croatia. In essence, we hope that the enlargement will extend beyond Croatia and end up encompassing the whole of the Western Balkans. This is one of the key points of Europe’s neighbourhood and enlargement policies. My vote is therefore, without doubt, in favour of the Swoboda report. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the current flood of migrants is a serious problem, and it is a European one. What is needed is not complaints, however, but effective cooperation to tackle the current crisis in a constructive and far-sighted manner. We must take action at two levels, and we will need broad shoulders to bear our responsibilities. The first level concerns the immediate situation. Additional funds must be made available to deal with the crisis; we need at last to prepare a European round table, putting on the agenda the possibility of sharing out the immigrants fairly among the various countries; and, lastly, we have to meet with the provisional Tunisian Government to demand that resources and instruments be put in place to stem the current exodus. The second level is more strictly political in nature. It is absolutely vital to radically review our neighbourhood policies. Action is needed based on a renewed policy of economic, financial and social cooperation, an intelligent immigration policy, and effective support for the economic reforms and the democratic transition process under way in Tunisia. It is only by taking such action that we will be able to tackle and solve the problems now facing Italy and Europe. Commissioner, I am sure you will agree with us all that it really is time now to stop talking and start acting. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Baroness Ashton, I get the impression that you are not yet sufficiently aware of what is going on in the Mediterranean region. I have to say that the slowness of the EU institutions in addressing the Mediterranean question can only be explained by a lack of awareness of the situation and an inability to sense the changes that are afoot. We are coming to the end of a political and historical era in which Europe’s policy towards the South has been muddled and counterproductive. The economic crisis, difficulties faced in migrating and the lack of changeover among the ruling classes have created an explosive combination that is affecting Tunisia and Egypt now, but is likely to spread to other countries. To address some of my fellow Members also, I would say that we will not get away with thinking that all we need to do is to simply give our support to the demonstrations that are currently taking place. Europe needs to show greater political maturity. To do this, we need to retune Europe’s political antennae. Europe’s foreign policy needs to come out of its semi-secretive mode and take a leading role on the international stage in supporting the democratic transition processes currently underway. In particular, we need clear policies in a number of areas: a new partnership and neighbourhood policy, and a new security policy for the Mediterranean region; greater willingness from the whole of Europe to address the Mediterranean issue; and a policy of joint action so that Europe will be acting in the region alongside other players, such as the United States and Turkey. We need a major change of course and this calls for an act of considerable humility on the Commission’s part in reopening the debate on foreign policy towards the Mediterranean and taking a fresh look at the Union for the Mediterranean, whilst at the same time ensuring that Europe has a role within it. This is crucial for Europe, and we need to be fully aware of this. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, requests to debate this topic have been made several times, and commitments have been adopted each time to put the required initiatives into practice in the Sahel region, whether to stabilise the region or to ensure greater security. As we know, given the lack of borders and the huge size of the region, the Sahel is an ideal area of transit for drug traffickers and terrorist groups, specifically al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. The weakness and instability of the states in this region are the main problem and, as has been pointed out, the threats directly affect the peoples and countries in the region, particularly Mauritania, Mali and Niger. The main task the European Union has to address is to draw up a credible security strategy based on the various facets of possible European action: cooperation and development policy, regional programmes, coordination strategies for highway security, and security training policies. Hence, the European Union not just should, but must intervene as quickly as possible, and therefore we are looking forward to the Commission drawing up a complete strategy, as you announced, Baroness Ashton, as well as strong intervention on the ground. To conclude, my request is clear: we need to pay far greater attention to what is happening south of Europe, because many things are about to change and we had better not be caught unprepared. It could only do the EU good to be more far-sighted. Pier Antonio Panzeri,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the work done by Mrs Gomes in my view makes a serious contribution to what the Commission should do in defining the framework agreement. Libya undoubtedly plays a decisive role in the fight against terrorism, in peace and security in Africa, in the fight against illegal immigration in the Mediterranean, and in the energy sector. Our aim in the context of the European Union’s strategy must therefore be to consolidate Libya’s integration into an international political and economic system based on shared rules. To achieve that, a number of conditions need to be imposed on Libya, and that is what the recommendation is calling for. First of all, in the matter of immigration, Libya is clearly a transit country. This is an extremely important subject, but it cannot be seen simply in terms of security, stopping immigration and refoulement. The subject involves the need for a government ruled by the streams of economic and social policies equal to the challenge of migration, the issues of the recognition of political refugees and the ratification by Libya of the Geneva Convention and, lastly, the problem of the readmission of immigrants based on concrete guarantees to safeguard the immigrants’ living conditions. Then there is the question of launching economic and democratic reforms to make decidedly more room for democracy in this important country. We shall have to take this issue into ever greater account, as the events in neighbouring Tunisia are showing. Lastly, this recommendation calls for reflection on the issue of bilateral agreements. Such agreements can certainly make a valid contribution to defining and solving problems, but they are not the final answer. For example, the problem we have with Italian fishing boats shows that the bilateral agreement option does not address these problems. Now, however, the review of the partnership and neighbourhood policies also involves the call to rethink the Libya question in a new framework, which means including Parliament. Many of us have called for the Council’s mandate for the framework agreement to be made known. In this respect, Commissioner, there is a real need to break step and involve the European Parliament more and more in defining new policies for the countries to the south of Europe.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we share the concerns about what is happening in Tunisia and express our sadness about the many people who have lost their lives during the protests. The new and confused situation that began after the flight of former president, Mr Ben Ali, must now lead to the objective that many have asked for: the start of economic and social reforms to match the expectations of the vast majority of the population and the opening up of democratic forums, to ensure that civil society and the various opposition forces are increasingly involved in public life and in government. Obviously, all countries have the right to determine their own path, but we are keen for these reforms to be carried out and for the changes to be real and not merely window dressing. What is happening in Tunisia at the moment poses questions for all of us and poses questions for Europe, with all its delays and mistakes. In 1995, the European Union launched the partnership programme with the Mediterranean in Barcelona. This was supposed to include economic, political, military and even social and human cooperation, but not even in the two key objectives has this been achieved. In terms of the economy, there has been a drastic reduction in regional and infrastructural projects because the funds never arrived from Member States and those from the Commission remain in standby. The promised free trade zone does not exist, but the most obvious failure is on the political level, and we need to be fully aware of this, Commissioner. The Union for the Mediterranean was launched in 2008, but remains a façade. The summit that was supposed to be held in November 2010 has been postponed indefinitely. The problem is that the various European governments are not interested and do not see any interest in real cooperation. They prefer to maintain relationships with questionable regimes that are wedded to the defence of their undemocratically managed national resources, whilst millions of young people live without any future prospects but emigration, which is increasingly difficult. It is no great surprise then that, spurred on by the economic and social crisis, the protests in Tunisia have turned into a tidal wave capable of having a heavy impact on the existing power structure. European political realism is no longer useful as a result of the fear of Islamic fundamentalism, and perhaps the time has come to finally shelve that post-colonial attitude that tends to re-emerge every now and then in relations with north African countries. Indeed, taking Barcelona as a starting point, Europe needs a new vision of its southern reaches and the Mediterranean, which must be more credible than in the past. This implies a complete overhaul of the partnership and neighbourhood policies that have been followed thus far, and I would insist that you attend to this, Commissioner. We cannot hide the fact that both the Commission and the Council were even ready to start discussions with Tunisia for an advanced status agreement. On the basis of what criteria it was thought that all this was possible is still to be explained. We need to change tack – change gear – and we are telling the Commission and the Council that this can be achieved by showing more conviction in giving Parliament a role in the elaboration and application of a new idea of partnership with the countries of the Mediterranean. All of this is not solely in the interest of these countries but is, above all, in the interest of Europe. Many of the problems that Europe appears to have can only be tackled and resolved by a productive and virtuous relationship with all the Maghreb countries. Supporting economic and democratic reforms, as well as simultaneously deploying all the necessary antidotes to fundamentalism and terrorism, is a difficult road but is the only one to take. There is reason to hope that the tragic and bitter lesson being imparted by Tunisia can serve to give all of us a better understanding of what is worth doing and what is worth changing in terms of Europe’s actions.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to say to Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra that, ahead of resolving the conflict between Plato and the truth, perhaps we needed a little more time before coming up with this resolution, for at least two reasons. Firstly, we could have collected all the information to help guarantee that Parliament would take a more solid stance and, secondly, a series of meetings and hearings had got under way in the relevant committees Parliament took the legitimate decision to move ahead immediately, In any case, this does not diminish the requirement for these hearings and the need to keep the negotiations with Morocco open. I therefore believe that, after the vote, it is a good idea to apply our efforts in three specific directions: establishing a new leading role for Europe, with its diplomacy and neighbourhood policies; contributing to a positive outcome to the negotiations opened by the United Nations; and, finally, using all parliamentary instruments – beginning with the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the mixed committee – to ensure that the meeting goes ahead and helps find solutions. I think it would be helpful to work determinedly towards these specific objectives. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, someone might surely object to the reasons that have led the European Parliament to debate and pass judgment on a legislative act that a democratically elected parliament like the Israeli Knesset is adopting. Such objections are understandable, but there are at least two basic reasons why this debate is necessary. The first is the unique nature of the situation in the Middle East, resulting from a conflict that has lasted too long and does not only involve Israel. The second is the important role played by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in that area, both on the humanitarian aid side and in connection with development cooperation policies. Besides, the Israeli authorities themselves should assess that role carefully, because without the work done by all the NGOs, the tensions in the region would be greater and much more serious. For that reason, it will be perfectly natural to suggest to the Knesset, when it intends to legislate on this subject, that it should set out two clear objectives in addition to the changes already made: to ensure transparency for funding, applying without bias to everyone, including organisations like the settlers’ NGOs, for example; and to make it possible in practical terms for all the NGOs to work, since their work is important, not least for the future of the peace negotiations themselves.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I call for the words ‘all the people’ to be deleted when reference is essentially being made to the dialogue. Therefore, the final sentence should be: ‘considers that both parties should take a pragmatic approach to the dialogue for the benefit of Kosovo and Serbia’. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it has already been said that tomorrow, we will vote on the motion for a resolution on Kosovo drafted by Mrs Lunacek. Today’s discussion and tomorrow’s vote are very important and are a useful contribution to the process of stabilising Kosovo and the Western Balkans as a whole. If it is to honour the commitments it has made, Europe must work to ensure that three primary objectives are fully met in Kosovo: a stronger and more complete integration of the Albanian and Serbian communities, full implementation of the rule of law and the strengthening of Kosovo’s democratic institutions. Moreover, these are essential conditions if Kosovo is to move more decisively towards the European integration process. In this context, the European Union must be very demanding with itself and with the authorities in Kosovo, through its presence there, so that the democratisation process can move forward in the country and can embark on the road to European integration. We need to be aware that there are still many things to be done. The European Union must play an active role, which means also following the guidelines provided by the European Parliament. I therefore believe that this much hoped for process – and I do hope that this motion is adopted by the European Parliament and that all of the groups come together in some way – has a very important role, which I believe is negotiation, dialogue and opening an honest relationship between Serbia and Kosovo for two reasons: to stabilise the relationship between the two countries and to prepare the entire region in the best possible way for a European future; and we hope that this will happen in the not too distant future. We as Parliament and the European Union must assume this responsibility with the necessary determination. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, nothing can justify what happened and I am sorry to say that we are faced with an act of rank amateurism by the Israelis. Perhaps the Israeli leadership is not yet properly aware that Israeli security will be achieved only if the peace process goes ahead and not by raising the tension. Against this background, the resolution tabled to Parliament is an important response by this institution to the difficult question of Gaza. This affair, with all its dramatic overtones, nevertheless forces Europe to step up the quality of its dealings with the Middle Eastern question. Mrs Ashton, I think you are aware that today, we need new leadership within Europe; stronger action with the aim of setting the indirect negotiations on the right path. Stop this senseless settlement policy and lift the blockade on Gaza. By adopting this resolution, the European Parliament offers an important benchmark. Make use of it so that European action can make a serious contribution to overcoming the conflict and winning over all extremist positions, while also achieving the goals of the two states.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we are taking an extremely significant step forwards by adopting this report, and it will be very useful with a view to the Barcelona Summit of 7 June, a summit which, as we know, is set to be difficult given the deadlock in negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians, and also owing to various uncertainties and difficulties regarding the definition of the administrative set-up of the new secretariat structure. Faced with these problems, the Peillon report has been drafted in the only way possible, highlighting, on the one hand, that the conflicts must not hinder tangible progress towards multilateral cooperation in specific sectors, while acknowledging, on the other, that the Union for the Mediterranean will not be fully successful unless these conflicts are settled. Therefore, the real challenge now involves a clear, robust political commitment which must come out of the Barcelona Summit, finally enabling the structures of the new institution to function and commit to providing the funds necessary for the major projects that are its main objective. Europe must realise that it needs to turn its political and economic efforts and its own interests southwards, because it is here that it can find the solutions to many of the problems currently plaguing it.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are aware of the differences that exist between the various regulatory frameworks of the individual countries, and we also know that various interpretations of European and national case law are currently leading to a large number of infringements and disputes within the Member States. The lack of a European Union policy is no longer sustainable in the light of the challenges posed by the cross-border nature of online gambling services. Moreover, the rapid spread of the Internet and of electronic trade in recent years has given rise to an increase in the supply of online games and to the consequent emergence of cross-border issues, which remain unresolved. For this reason, I am convinced that the European institutions should rise to the common challenges, such as the protection of consumers – and more specifically of children – and the prevention of crime and fraud, but also to the challenges concerning the fight against the illegal and unauthorised supply of services, which the national governments alone cannot cope with. The Commission must therefore respond to Parliament’s requests and strive to obtain a European regulatory framework. It must do so by showing the necessary determination. Commissioner, your good will is not in question, and that is why I say to you that the consultation is a good idea and that the green paper is also a good idea, provided that it is used to identify the correct legislative framework and is not just an end in itself. The old Commission very often drafted too many green papers and white papers without any decisions being taken. However, I believe that you realise, Commissioner, that we need decisions and not just words. Pier Antonio Panzeri,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we had to give an opinion on the existing relations between the European Union and Tunisia, it could only be a positive one, including as regards the stabilisation of the region. It is true that important progress has been made in economic terms, and there are also encouraging signs from a social point of view. However, in political terms, following the presidential elections on 25 October, we are faced with the problem of supporting the journey towards democratic reforms with greater concrete action. As we know, the European Union’s objective, in pursuing its foreign policy, is to develop and consolidate democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Tunisia has made some important commitments in the context of the Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan on democracy, governance and human rights. The action plan lays down a series of priorities and, amongst these, particular attention must be paid to implementing and consolidating reforms, and to strengthening political dialogue and cooperation, particularly in relation to democracy and human rights, foreign policy and security. It is within this framework that the institutions must be strengthened. The latter allow the increased participation in political life of the various members of Tunisian society, greater development of the role of civil society, continued support for political parties to broaden their participation in the democratic process, and greater respect for freedom of association, freedom of expression and media pluralism. We are convinced that these objectives can be achieved, and it is reasonable to expect tangible progress to be made. Our commitment is to safeguard the friendship which binds the European Union and Tunisia while consolidating the existing relationship, including in view of the conflict which could arise concerning the idea of an advanced status for that country. However, concrete steps really must be taken by Tunisia itself. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I consider the resolution that we are discussing today in Parliament to be genuinely positive. To dwell on part of this, I consider that the topic of European enlargement to the western Balkans is, and must remain, one of the linchpins of European action in the coming months. I would like to compliment the Swedish Presidency and, above all, Commissioner Rehn on their work. We must nevertheless feel more involved in the process of enlargement. Some countries must undoubtedly step up their action on the legal front in terms of the fight against crime and reforms. Yet we must not lose sight of the political aim, which is to consolidate democracy in those countries and have them follow the European path in economic, social and infrastructural terms. I am thinking, for example, of countries such as Kosovo – and in this regard I agree with the amendment tabled by Mrs Lunacek with regard to the Roma issue – because this is a country we cannot sideline merely because five European countries have not yet recognised its independence. To sum up, we need the right amount of courage and a far-sighted policy that is up to the challenge that the process of enlargement sets all of us. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, believe that this cooperation agreement with Tajikistan really is very positive and can help to achieve what I believe are some important and precise objectives. The first objective concerns the strategic position of that country, which can genuinely be of use in promoting an area of peace, security and stability. The second objective, I believe, is and must be to encourage the growth of that country from an economic and social point of view, because we know that it is one of the poorest countries in the region. Lastly, we must ensure that freedom, democracy and rights are the fundamental elements that govern the application of this agreement. Leaving aside any limitations that may be found, I believe we should welcome the report on which we are voting in this House. Pier Antonio Panzeri (S&amp;D).

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when debating foreign policy issues, such as today’s issue involving Iran, there is always the risk, as we know, of lagging slightly behind the events taking place. However, there is no doubt that the European Parliament, if it wants to, can play an important role in urging Europe and the international community to take the current events seriously and to implement all of the initiatives needed to ensure that the process of introducing a democratic system in Iran can actually take place. Following the close attention paid by the international public to the post-election period in Iran and the street demonstrations that the Iranian regime sought to repress with the use of violence, it is important to ensure that silence does not descend on the situation in the country. Being realistic about things does not mean taking the Iran issue off the agenda. It is also up to us to keep this level of attention high, and it is also up to the Swedish Presidency – which I thank for the points it has made today – to promote a strong initiative, together with the United States, Russia and other countries, in order to change the way in which issues in Iran, from democratic rights to the nuclear issue itself, develop.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry that I do not agree with your optimism; based on what I know, I would call it Rio -20, because we have gone back about 20 years. No binding document, no definition of the future we want, but of course, without Mr Obama, Mr Cameron and Ms Merkel – who alone represent more than 30% of the entire gross domestic product and who were, in fact, in Mexico at the G20 summit – what could have been decided? Only safe ideas for those who want business as usual, such as the green economy, masterfully represented as one of the instruments available in order to achieve sustainable growth, and for the adoption of policies, which should not, however, be subject to rigid rules. The divisions, inconsistencies and injustices will therefore remain and the separation of economic, social and environmental spheres will continue to cause disasters. Yes to recognising climate change, reducing natural disasters, energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions, and yet nothing concrete – as if to say, the house is burning and we are not doing anything to put out the fire. Other evident sticking points: that the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) did not become a real environment body and that no High Commissioner was appointed for future generations. What can we do now? Only be aware that interdependence can help us cope with the crisis we are experiencing and therefore that a new governance is absolutely necessary in order to move forward. The Commission could set an example: get the financial institutions responsible for a large part of this crisis around a table and ask them to commit to a plan of growth, inclusion, fairness and development, which respects and protects the environment and people. For its part, Parliament can come up with a universal statement of interdependence and democracy, which also guarantees right of access to natural resources and then ask the biggest States in the world to join in. For once, it would not be up to the young people or banks or large corporations, but the democratically elected representatives to decide the future we want. Vittorio Prodi  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, I have been defending the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) programme since I arrived in Parliament and I now feel the need – after letters, oral and written questions, resolutions, meetings, debates, hearings and newspaper articles – to remind those who seem to have forgotten what the benefits of this programme are, as listed in a publication written, among others, by the NEREUS Network of European Regions Using Space Technologies. Here are just some of the areas that the EU will put at risk without GMES: air quality, monitoring of climate change adaptation, EU water policy, the INSPIRE programme for geospatial information, civil protection and emergency services, agriculture and forests, services to the marine environment, monitoring of illegal activities, energy management and urban mapping. To these I would like to add the support, in particular to African countries, for all the technology currently needed to manage the environment. Given this non-exhaustive list of the merits of GMES, could Commissioner Barnier – who I am sure is an advocate of the benefits of GMES – explain who it is that does not wish for the GMES programme to operate as it has done so far, and why? Why is the Commission hiding behind Council decisions, when we have evidence that at least eight major countries have asked to put GMES back into the multiannual financial framework? Who is insisting (and why?) on adopting an intergovernmental approach with an agreement that would make Parliament’s control of one of the most important space programmes much more difficult, rather than facilitating it as required by the Treaty of Lisbon? Let it be known that we are friends of GMES: the Commission seems to agree, and claims simply to be following the orders of the Council, the Council itself substantially agrees, and the regions are clamouring for GMES to be fully implemented. It must also be noted that, at this time of crisis, GMES is one of the few sectors where jobs are not being slashed and in which European companies can still boast a competitive edge. Parliament has repeatedly expressed its full support for GMES. Commissioner Barnier, please tell those in the Commission and its services who are against GMES that it is time to stop. We have to work for Europe and for its young people, so as to make their future less hopeless. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Vittorio Prodi  (S&amp;D

Mr President, it is clear that this is possible and is also one of the types of data that Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) can consistently deliver.

 Mr President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, these are truly European items of infrastructure that are vital for implementing European policies. Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) is specifically for security, the environment and the management of mitigation policies, of global warming and the review of extreme meteorological events. It must be included in the European Union’s multiannual budget. If that is not possible, this may be the time to make use of project bonds, which also have an anti-recession function. I am convinced that this is an investment in our future and that it will pay dividends in a very few years’ time. Commissioner, let us go forward along this path. Vittorio Prodi,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution on the Rio+20 summit highlights the crucial principle of fairness. Fairness on an international scale that guarantees developing countries their right to development; intergenerational fairness that does not make those who come after us pay the price for our decisions; fairness that thus develops into genuine solidarity and a vehicle for a new kind of sustainable development. We must reject the old concept of the three independent pillars – economic, social and environmental – and instead recognise the interdependent nature of these elements, because they are indivisible. Determining the conditions for genuinely sustainable development requires us not only to develop new standards, such as the Beyond GDP project, but also to guarantee the active involvement of all parties at all levels of governance. It is precisely by focusing on the indivisible nature of fairness, solidarity and global governance that we can break out from behind the barrier of false freedoms and return to social models based on the individual and the common good. Rio+20 is therefore an appeal for a noble ethics and it is in such a context that both the financial and the technological proposals made by the European Parliament gain value. These span the tax on international financial transactions, support for environmental conservation projects, a broader horizon of comprehensive fiscal reform replacing taxes on labour by taxes on resource use and assessment of the impact that production of biofuels can have on food supply and biodiversity, with the focus on global assessment of impact of technology on the environment and society. Our proposals are intended to prepare the ground for an international conference that would mark a true political turning point in planning the development of our planet. Vittorio Prodi  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, overall the report by Mrs Andrikienė report is an excellent report, which the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists &amp; Democrats in the European Parliament have worked hard on to provide ideas of the utmost value. Human rights have constituted one of the fundamental pillars of the European Union since its creation and respect for them is an essential point that the European Parliament must encourage every day. Wider acceptance of human and fundamental rights, globalisation and changes in our society require a new and different outlook that does not fit any of our existing canons. It therefore becomes essential to guarantee equal access to natural resources, as one of the fundamental rights of each individual. In the coming years, climate change will lead to an enormous number of refugees fleeing the poorest areas of the Earth and it is our duty to begin to take note of these potential migratory flows so that we can establish appropriate policies that will enable respect for the dignity of these people to be guaranteed. The expression ‘climate refugee’ has not yet entered the vocabulary of current international law. Naturally, we remain committed to the fight against desertification, just as we do to adjusting to climate change. These are the topics I have attempted to add to the text of the report, so that a serious debate can be opened on the issues. Vittorio Prodi  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to the Commissioner and to the entire EU delegation, who have helped to keep the process alive. However, we have not solved the real problems: firstly, we need to give political expression to the Bali Declaration – in particular, with regard to what we in Parliament have already called climate justice – and we need to generalise and simplify the emissions trading system, because it is inconceivable to have a market mechanism where half of the emissions quota is given away free. Secondly, I would like to stress the need to promote instruments for monitoring, reporting and verifying, in particular, those of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) range of services, of the satellites that will provide absolutely vital data in this area.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Vice-President Ashton, the defenders of human rights play a crucial role throughout the world, often putting their lives on the line. Respect for human rights is one of the basic values of the European Union and has always underpinned its construction. This is why it is now important to keep focusing attention on compliance with these rights as a whole. The work done in Parliament on this subject is crucial in ensuring this and I therefore thank the rapporteur Mrs Hautala for her excellent report to which the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament made a crucial and constructive contribution. We must, in fact, seek to look beyond. I believe the time has come to take clear responsibility, in other words, to begin to treat respect for human rights as a complex phenomenon; we must now seek to achieve a higher and more comprehensive acceptance of these rights. I am firmly convinced, Mr President, that fundamental rights should include the right of equal access to natural resources, to water and also to food, the right to health care, the right to education and the right of access to information. With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, I also feel we are bound to make the most of the new External Action Service by making sure it encompasses organisations and figures distinguished by their respect for human rights. This morning, in fact, Mrs Ashton mentioned the Russian Federation and our dealings with the Federation in this context. Such challenges, which we face a daily basis, are often underestimated. The European Union can and must continue to play a leading role on the international stage in taking up such challenges. Vittorio Prodi,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, climate change is a real threat that we must be ready to face despite the varying impact it will have on our countries. The degradation of ecosystems will cause a severe blow to the health of our economies and of European citizens. We have already in the past called for climate diplomacy and justice: now we have to build it, speaking with a single voice. I am convinced that the European Union must maintain the lead in the battle against climate change and that any delay in implementing that action will increase environmental, social and economic costs out of all proportion. We must first of all recognise the central role of local and regional authorities and the need to work with them to coordinate environmental and economic innovation facilitated by technological progress. By adopting the White Paper, we call on the Commission and Member States to promote public-private partnerships to help finance all of the initiatives tied to the adaptation policies. Each square metre of our territory has to be cared for to preserve the soil and retain water so as to prevent erosion and to supply the aquifers, including through direct reinjection of surface waters. In order for adaptation to be possible, a systemic approach which includes renewable energies will be necessary. I would like to warmly thank all of my colleagues who contributed to the success of this report. (Applause

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the 13th session of the UN Human Rights Council is an extremely important occasion. I would simply like to mention one or two cases that are not addressed very often. Specifically on the subject of prisons, but not those for terrorists, I would like to point out the truly inhumane conditions of the prisons in Rwanda and in Libya, where totally innocent people held in detention are sentenced to death. Furthermore, I would like to mention the issue of the Sahrawi people, which has remained unresolved for so long now, and I would also like to mention the rights of climate refugees who are driven from their countries by dramatic forms of climate change.

Madam President, Mr Carlgren, Mr Dimas, ladies and gentlemen, this morning I would like to talk about an 84-year-old missionary, Father Ettore Turrini, who has spent 59 years in the north-west of the Amazon. He has always fought to protect the indigenous people and their forest from anyone seeking to destroy them in the name of short-term interests. In travelling round the forest, Father Ettore has had seven air accidents, but he has carried on and has obtained tens of thousands of signatures through his activities, which he will submit to President Lula, to many ministers and to the Italian President, Mr Napolitano. He has been indefatigable. We met last Sunday and I told him that I fully shared his position, but that perhaps the world is coming to its senses and reaching the conclusion that these forests are essential as the world’s lung, for the local climate and also for carbon capture and storage. I told him that in Copenhagen, we will also find resources to compensate those countries that keep the forests intact. I told him that we are setting up monitoring instruments – GPS and INSPIRE – to measure how governments behave and that by 2030, we will put a stop to deforestation. In Copenhagen, we will be able to do all this and I will participate in the summit on behalf of Father Turrini as well.Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 As it stands, the management of intergovernmental agreements between individual Member States and third countries is more complex than ever before. Not only do we not know their exact number, but since there is no obligation to inform the Commission and the other Member States, we find ourselves faced with agreements that contradict or are incompatible with EU legislation on the energy market. Consequently, a set of regulations that brings about a clear break with the past seems equally urgent. Hence, legislation should require final agreements to be notified to the Commission and made subject to its approval. Moreover, it would be a good idea if the Commission were to be granted an ex ante
 compliance check, thus avoiding any time and resources being wasted. Unfortunately, however, this approach – which is the only option that is really compatible with the very idea of the EU – is once again being steamrollered by the interests of the Member States and their desire to act freely in delicate areas like the energy sector. It is nevertheless regrettable to note that the moderate and conservative forces of this House have also taken the same position, while they should always seek to ensure that EU interests take precedence.

 The quality package proposed by the Commission aims to establish a coherent legal framework for the EU’s policy on agricultural product quality. The proposal is, overall, worthy of support, thanks especially to the changes and amendments made by this House. Specifically, it is of the utmost importance to recognise the role, importance and responsibilities of producer groups, which can and must play a crucial role in product protection and marketing according to the established standards, thereby limiting the risks of abuse or, even worse, counterfeiting, as far as possible. I feel compelled, in particular, to highlight the changes made regarding the traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) scheme. In this case, the Commission’s proposal seemed incongruous and detrimental, especially the idea to abolish TSGs without reservation of the name, forcing associations to repeat the whole bureaucratic process to get new recognition. Thanks to Parliament, good sense prevailed instead. We believe that the introduction of a simplified procedure for TSGs registered without reservation of the name can ensure their survival and, above all, extend safeguards and reduce counterfeiting, benefiting producers and consumers alike.

 The management of highly migratory fish stocks calls for the constant cooperation and direct consultation among the countries whose fleets exploit such stocks, avoiding the risk of unilateral action that could be potentially harmful to long-term resource sustainability. Moreover, the EU has the responsibility to ensure that this cooperation requirement is respected and that Member States do not take unilateral action in disregard of the general interest in the conservation of the marine ecosystem. However, beside effective measures, in order to fulfil this task it is necessary to endow the EU with appropriate monitoring tools. As with other sectors, unbridled competition among the Member States may have adverse consequences. I have thus chosen to support the measures in the directive, in particular those designed to impose quantitative restrictions on EU fish imports, in cases where the fish is caught from stocks of common interest under the supervision of a third country. Similarly, I welcome the introduction of tools that can ensure that such measures are effective, proportionate and compatible with international legislation, as well as meeting environmental, commercial, economic and social standards.

 The report is one of the cornerstones of the reform of the common fisheries policy in that it increases the sector’s competitiveness, particularly for producers. It also includes aspects of prime importance for the health and confidence of consumers in the sector. In this respect, safeguarding the interests of consumers and satisfying their demands for clarity and transparency should be the goal of our common policies, because they can become a way of encouraging people to spend. This is all the more important during a slump in sales, when all the indicators show that people tend to purchase goods in a more conscious and informed way, which means they look for quality. That is why we are firmly convinced that the product packaging should show not the date when the fish were landed but the date on which they were actually caught. The landing date, however, which is supported by the moderates and conservatives, is not only misleading for the consumer but also unduly favours large fleets that are able to stay at sea for several days over smaller vessels that can only stay at sea for a few hours. Once again, we would have expected a more rational attitude from the moderates, who seem to have given in to the interests of the larger groups. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 Negotiations on energy efficiency measures are proving increasingly difficult and complex, particularly because of some large Member States which are not always fully prepared to support ambitious agreements and perspectives which, in the short term, may give rise to costs and negative effects on their competitiveness. In this case too, despite some improvements, we are faced with a directive which, although it contributes to achieving the 20% energy efficiency target by 2020, will not be sufficient in itself (a result between 15 and 17% is estimated). In our view, there will thus have to be an increased commitment to ensuring that long-term perspectives and requirements find a way to establish themselves in the face of the selfish interests which, in the short-term, can have a strong influence on Member States’ governments and, in particular, at a time of acute economic crisis. A structural and lasting solution to this crisis must instead be sought in measures that address and solve the roots of the serious issue of energy poverty. We need to think afresh about the way out of this situation. It is not possible to return to the production and consumption models that preceded the crisis and therefore we need to be ambitious and courageous in order to create new opportunities and new jobs.

 I chose to defend and strongly support Mr Färm’s report because – in addition to its content as a whole – I would argue that it represents an extraordinary turning point both in the relationship between institutions and for the future of EU economic policy. For the first time, the European institutions have paved the way for testing project bonds, or rather for one of the instruments for which Parliament has often expressed its support. While noting that unfortunately, the conditions needed to actually start implementing European bonds in a fuller and more forceful way still do not seem to be in place, today’s report opens up the possibility of testing the will of other European institutions to following the declarations. Implementing connecting trans-European infrastructure is of key importance strategically and therefore lends itself extremely well to testing the issuance of bonds intended to finance infrastructure projects. I fully support this report, and I hope that other European institutions agree that we need to find new ways to finance strategic investments in order to relaunch the European economy.

 The entire Mediterranean basin shares the same natural environment, and its shores are connected by the same history and culture. Significant opportunities exist in southern Europe, which cannot be seized without coordination or vision. The ‘Mediterranean climate’ results in similar ecotypes: the same types of agricultural product are produced and form a single, albeit diverse, range of products. Likewise, environmental problems are the same all over. Mediterranean biodiversity is particularly abundant, but also under serious threat. Appropriate, synergistic responses are called for. Within the EU, the Mediterranean area is unstructured and its performance in terms of cooperation and interconnection is very poor. Moreover, outside the gates of the EU, those populations living in the Mediterranean region have very low standards of living, despite last year’s events. The development of these societies is an essential requirement for them, and an opportunity for Europe as it could capitalise on greater security, more ‘sustainable’ control of immigration flows and direct participation in this growth area. This would positively impact on the performance of its own economy. For these and many other reasons, it is important to support the establishment of a Mediterranean macro-region.

The adoption of this regulation sends a clear signal of support for the safety of the millions of European workers and citizens who travel every day on Europe’s roads. Thanks to Parliament’s hard work, significant amendments have been made to meet the demands voiced on many occasions by trade unions, workers and many small enterprises: the introduction of tachographs for all heavy goods vehicles weighing in excess of 2.8 tonnes and the introduction of weight sensors are two clear examples of the good work done during recent months within the committee and then in the Chamber. Too often, the needs of the market and strong competition between operators adversely affect working and health conditions for lorry drivers, and also seriously jeopardise the safety of the millions of European citizens on the EU’s roads and motorways. The balance that has been achieved in this regulation between the needs for security and control and the flexibility to be given to self-employed workers and small enterprises is an excellent outcome, and has therefore been broadly supported by the majority of MEPs.

 It is evident that it will be difficult to achieve the Europe 2020 goals on employment rates, and yet, in the serious crisis we are going through, the strong and effective effort needed to reverse this trend is missing from national reform programmes. Commitment to younger generations has shown no sign of a turnaround, and yet in the discussion on future cohesion policy the Union has the opportunity to specify and introduce performance mechanisms into the regulations being examined by Parliament so that every euro spent under the new multiannual financial framework (MFF) is aimed at creating new, good-quality youth employment. A European investment strategy should be launched, centred on infrastructure modernisation, human capital and laying the foundations for a sustainable economy. To finance this initiative, the Union must add additional resources to its budget: these exist and mechanisms must be found to make them available. It is therefore necessary to introduce a tax on financial transactions, to set up an EU-wide strategy to reduce fraud and tax evasion and to allow Eurobonds to be issued. Without these tools, the risk of an irreversible decline and marginalisation of Europe’s economy and policy on the world stage will become more and more real. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 I decided to vote against the report by Mr Gauzès because, once again and for the umpteenth time, it employs a rationale that I did not and do not think is valid and that, as time has gone on, has played a crucial part in the worsening of Europe’s economic and social situation. I have fought and I contest the theory that the underlying cause of the crisis is to be found in the high number of countries that have been unable to put their budgets in order. On the contrary, the facts demonstrate that this is a crisis of growth and of a lack of investment. Confronted with this reality, the recipe put to us once again is mistaken and will once again prove to be counterproductive. In the past, we have fought hard against this outlook, opposing and voting against the ‘six-pack’. Since then, faced with a deterioration in the economic and, above all, social situation, rather than championing a change of direction and a radical change of gear, we have been going backwards, casting out the economic analyses which, in reality and in contrast to those from the right which have put us in this situation, we know to be right and potentially capable of putting a stop to what is becoming an irresistibly slippery slope.

 I decided, albeit reluctantly, to vote against the report because I think it is totally insufficient and inadequate for dealing with the pressing and mounting problems that this social and economic crisis has forced upon us. I decided to vote against because I think the growth measures that the report introduces are completely insufficient. Without even considering that the golden rule, albeit in a minimalist and even innocuous form, was rejected, the other growth measures also do not seem much compared with the straitjacket of austerity and the blind respect of budgetary restraints. The redemption fund, the groundwork for eurobonds and Heading 3 have been approved by a very narrow majority, due to the staunch opposition of conservatives, who, having obtained approval for austerity measures, have done everything to boycott all references to investment. That says a lot about what the Council’s attitude will be. We must find the courage to relaunch our ideas and initiatives with fresh vigour. If not, we will be complicit in the vacuity of the conservatives and their inability to improve Europe’s future prospects. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

Madam President, that the situation is dramatic is there for all to see. Add to this drama the fact that there is a clear gap between what we say, denounce and debate in this House and in the other European institutions and what we tangibly do for the younger generations in Europe. It is this gap that we have to close; this is the effort we have to make. In this regard, I propose two questions and two corresponding suggestions. The first is this. Can we bring in a constraint, even a legally binding one, such that in the coming years or months, every euro spent must be on policies for youth employment, thus creating the conditions for a true European platform/plan for youth employment? Let us not forget that the resources at our disposal are very limited. The second is that in the coming weeks, project bonds worth EUR 230 million are due to be issued. Can we give priority to projects which are able to increase youth employment in the short term? Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 The report proposes to help the Member States most affected by the financial crisis and unable to guarantee the necessary private funding for completing revenue-generating infrastructures. Private partners are not in a position to invest due to liquidity problems and the difficulties in accessing loans, so part of individual Member States’ financial allocations to the Commission is to be transferred in order to create a fund to cover the risks linked to the loans. This means that, in order to allow the completion of ongoing works, some Member States will in fact deprive themselves of part of their allocated funds. As far as we are concerned, while we support the instrument, we should have preferred intervention of a more structural nature for dealing with the endemic lack of liquidity in many Member States, in order to improve expenditure performance and avoid having to resort to drastic measures that could reduce resources. In this regard we are convinced that these difficulties could be overcome by introducing a derogation from the Stability and Growth Pact, in order to allow the national cofinancing of projects considered particularly important for economic recovery and job creation.

 The resolution retraces the link between effective measures to stimulate growth and defining a clear and united EU strategy for halving tax evasion by 2020. Lost revenues caused by the underground economy has pernicious effects on the European economy and a negative impact on the amounts invested in growth and employment. By recovering these lost revenues (20% of public spending and some 105.8% of total health spending), governments could wipe out their public debt in eight or nine years. At the same time, they would be able to increase public investment, helping towards the achievement of the goals of the EU 2020 strategy. We therefore welcome EU-wide initiatives and strategies that will cut back bilateral agreements and bring an end to banking secrecy, accelerating the exchange of information. Combating tax evasion must become an absolute priority for the EU. So far, much has been said but little has been done; now is the time to take incisive action. Paying taxes is a basic civic duty and a matter of social justice that can generate the funds required for leaving the crisis behind and reviving the real economy, without once again heaping further burdens on workers and the most vulnerable sections of society.

 The updating of Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 and Regulation (EC) No 987/2009, which we are approving at first reading today, thanks to the agreement already reached with the Danish Presidency – needed to reflect the changes in the legislation of Member States on social security and coordination of social security systems – is a text that is widely supported by this House as it has succeeded in accommodating the positive needs of the sector trade unions.

 The report deserves to be supported, especially because it underlines the fact that cohesion policy – by its very nature – has to take into account the specific characteristics of regions and of outermost regions, but, more generally, that it has to take into account all specific features. The very existence of funding for the ‘cohesion’ of regions with different levels of development in fact presupposes the need to operate in situations that are structurally diverse, in terms of their geographic features or socio-economic gap. To deny this basic fact would be to deny the very aims of cohesion policy, and the report also needs to represent a reminder when the regulations for the future 2014-2020 cohesion policy are being defined. Alongside the need to focus efforts on objectives that are considered to be fundamental, it is important to remember that, in order to achieve these very objectives, the different starting conditions of the areas in which the instruments are actually operating have to be borne in mind. If this is not done, efforts could be not only in vain, but even counter-productive. In addition, the report is also an opportunity to reiterate that future funding must absolutely not be less than at present. We can only get through the crisis by revitalising investment and, even more so in disadvantaged areas, the EU institutions have a duty to prepare the ground in order to make this possible.

 The necessity for the international economy to orient itself increasingly towards a system of production based on the reduction of carbon emissions is one that is being imposed on us by the ever more imminent risk of irreparable climate change, as well as by the need to move our system of production gradually away from the consumption of finite resources. Given all that, the obstinacy with which the forces of the right have wanted to put forward the nuclear option again seems simply incomprehensible, and in many ways also outside time and history. It is outside time and history, as are all recommendations on the safety of nuclear power stations, which have several times been served up to us and promptly been refuted by the facts. It is still more unthinkable in a country such as Italy, where almost 30 years after power stations were decommissioned, we still have waste heaps that have not been disposed of and where, not long ago, a new referendum firmly rejected the reintroduction of nuclear power. We therefore demand that a correct objective, the reduction of emissions and the transition to an economy based on renewable sources, should not become the pretext for allowing a means that has proved to be unsafe and dangerous, and one which Europeans have for this reason chosen to replace, creep in again by the back door.

 Since it marks only the first step in the long and tortuous route to the adoption of the 2013 EU Budget, the adoption of the ‘general guidelines’ has to be the occasion for strongly emphasising the role of Parliament in future negotiations, especially with the Council, with the powerful aim of influencing the guidelines to be adopted by the Commission in its draft budget. It must be clear here and now that the budget approach cannot avoid the urgency of restarting sustainable growth and quality employment, in line with the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. The European Commission and the Council cannot continue down the path of austerity that leaves no margin for the requirements of economic growth capable of generating new jobs. We have the duty to identify measures supportive of growth and employment and finally go beyond the mere requirement of balancing investment and austerity. For our part, moreover, there is a pressing need to draw attention to the worrying payment situation: we must not allow a repetition of what happened in 2011 and 2012, and the Council can no longer purport to decide a priori
 the level of payments based on political considerations, without taking into account the repercussions on past commitments. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 The vote on this own-initiative report gives us the chance to emphasise the need to plan and open a Commission initiative to re-launch the Statute for a European cooperative society as soon as possible. We have to see the adoption of this report as an incentive to take action in the shortest possible timeframe and not fail to grasp the important opportunity provided by the UN having declared 2012 to be the International Year of Cooperatives. The fact that only 17 cooperatives out of around 160 000 in Europe have signed up to the Statute shows the urgency of intervening to make the Statute more attractive, though without losing sight of its most important and positive aspects. The value of cooperatives in the European economy is common knowledge and, during our debate, it became clear just why cooperatives have managed to withstand the economic crisis better than other business types. It is therefore our duty to support them and to work vigorously and consistently to promote the European cooperative society as a positive framework for the development of European cooperatives.

 It is universally accepted that, during this prolonged economic crisis, the EU institutions should lead by example in implementing austerity and rigour, starting by freezing their administrative budgets. This should be done in a manner that is both effective and tangible, so as to be credible as regards the sacrifices that we are asking our fellow citizens to make day after day. Making savings, strengthening interinstitutional cooperation, sharing best practices between institutions and modernising policies on human resources, technology and environmental policy can, and must, become strategic objectives for the European Union institutions. This vote allows us to stress once again and with greater clout the fact that we must counter the need for drastic cuts in unproductive spending by multiplying our efforts to free up and make as many more resources available as possible so that we can get the global economy back on track as soon as possible and return hope to those who now easily succumb to the sirens of populist, anti-European sentiment. Citizens’ opinions of the institutions that govern them depend on the institutions’ ability to come across as sensitive to their needs and to the current difficulties, and, most importantly, the ability to put together suitable policies in order to ensure that we recover from this crisis as soon as possible.

 Parliament’s confirmation of the guidelines for the employment policies of Member States adopted by the Council in 2010 is an act that is not completed by a mere formality, even if the committee responsible voted to follow the simplified procedure. We have had the opportunity to hold another debate on the initiatives Member States will have to adopt in order to achieve the Europe 2020 strategy objectives, and to respond, in particular, to the by now unsustainable unemployment situation that young Europeans, more than anyone else, are facing. Opportunities such as this, and the Annual Growth Survey and its transformation into ‘annual guidelines for sustainable growth’, on which we are being asked to vote, allow us to make the future of the young generations of Europeans the focus of our debate and to play an active and immediate role in the interaction between Member States and the European Commission.

 The report follows the controversial confirmation of the European programme for providing aid to the needy. The text is a compromise between those who were in favour of the programme’s continuation and those who wished to see it come to an end. Therefore, the compromise reached avoids the risk of a sudden end to the programme which would have threatened the survival of that sector of the population which is dependent on this food aid. Recent statistics have shown that the crisis is affecting increasingly large and central areas of the continent. This means that increasingly wide sections of the population in rich countries risk finding themselves in poverty. In this context, the attitude of those who, in the name of futile austerity, insist on rejecting such important interventions which have such a limited impact on the EU budget seems increasingly short-sighted and counterproductive. This compromise is very welcome and a new agreement to guarantee the programme’s funding for the future would be especially welcome. In any case, the hope is to investigate the possibility of strengthening the campaign against food wastage, with a programme capable of using recovered food through distribution and rational use, and redistributing it to the weakest and most at-risk sectors.

 The crisis has highlighted the lack of direction in the dairy product market, making regulations to stabilise farmers’ incomes and improve transparency in the trade a matter of urgency. The long period of fixed quotas and high institutional prices, which created guaranteed outlets, has paralysed the market. The participants in the production chain have not been forced to respond to market indicators and had no incentive to innovate and increase productivity. However, we need to do the best we can to secure a smooth transition to the complete abolition of quotas, avoiding an overly inflexible and abrupt effect that could increase the risks faced by the sector and producers. Accordingly, the switch to advance contracts for the delivery of raw milk between producers and dairies looks to be capable of re-balancing bargaining power, particularly because it allows for joint negotiation of conditions through producer organisations. In the same vein, we welcome the possibility of planning and managing the volumes of certified quality (protected designation of origin – PDO) dairy products, as requested by Parliament. Consequently, it is essential that the urgent reform of the system does not cause problems for producers of the very best of the EU exports. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 I should like to point out the most positive aspects of this report, which offer a good rendering of Parliament’s position on the growth and employment survey. It is very important that the Commission, the Council and the Member States take all necessary steps to ensure that the headline targets of the Europe 2020 strategy are met on employment, education and poverty reduction. In particular, the level of youth unemployment in Europe means that specific measures need to be taken as a matter of urgency and the report puts forward a helpful method to support young people, ensuring that every young person in the EU is offered a job, an apprenticeship or additional training after a maximum period of four months’ unemployment. In terms of instruments capable of providing for financial cover, the report also calls for the introduction of a tax on financial transactions, which the report claims is one issue where the EU cannot remain inactive and to which Parliament must offer robust support. Lastly, it is important to strengthen Parliament’s role in identifying instruments for growth, which is the reason for the clear request to the Commission to transform the Annual Growth Survey into Annual Sustainable Growth Guidelines in future years, thereby allowing us to propose amendments.

 By adopting this report and the corresponding report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs (EMPL), Parliament has taken up very clear positions vis-à-vis the Commission and the Council with regard to the policies that must be in place as soon as possible in order to boost growth and employment. Too many Member States have lost sight of the headline targets of the Europe 2020 objectives on employment, education and reducing poverty. They have focused solely on the sovereign debt crisis and remained blind to the fact that only medium- and long-term measures capable of fuelling growth – namely, education, research, innovation and energy – can provide the answers to the tough period that the Union has been going through for too long. The call for the introduction of project bonds to finance key infrastructure projects, as well as the call in EMPL’s report for the introduction of a tax on financial transactions are useful proposals that can no longer be delayed, and Parliament is ready to get behind them. Lastly, the proposal on making the Annual Growth Survey subject to a codecision procedure does justice to the fundamental role that Parliament could have in the debate on the future of European growth and identifying development policies.

 The directive is certainly progressing towards better management of humanitarian funds, starting with improved transparency and more vigorous checks to prevent fraud and corruption. Above all, it is essential to take action to remedy the general character of the reports submitted, from which it is particularly difficult to obtain sufficient information on the results, output and outcome of projects. Furthermore, I welcome the report’s strong emphasis on the need to create continuity between emergency interventions and development programmes. In particular, it might be worthwhile considering a period of cooperation between emergency bodies and development bodies by implementing some form of transfer of deliveries. It is only with difficulty that those who effectively manage emergencies then also prove ready to deal with the problems associated with development projects. It is vital to go beyond the current system which risks creating discontinuity, cancelling out or undermining the potential long-term results. Lastly, the call for greater visibility for actions, not for ‘publicity’ purposes, but to enable better streamlining of interventions, is valuable and should be supported. This is why I voted in favour, and we must hope that account is taken of the recommendations contained in the report during the process of reform of the framework partnership agreement (FPA).

 A regulation defining collective redress is not only desirable but it is also urgent and cannot be delayed, especially when we consider that, in the majority of cases, the ‘collective’ victims come from the weakest sections of the population, both in terms of education and from an economic perspective. This implies that, in the majority of cases, the infringements perpetrated against these groups go unpunished due to economic barriers (the cost of an individual case being disproportionate to the possible compensation) and psychological ones (fears about the length of procedures) and difficulties in accessing the necessary information. Vice versa, bundling the claims would not only strengthen their legal position but would also make it possible to simplify the processes and reduce their costs. On the other hand, there remain quite a few problems, both with regard to the different jurisdictions in individual Member States and to the need to curb misuse of the instrument. In any event, it is advisable for the EU to have a common horizontal approach to the issue, without following the US class action model and without amending national laws, and to establish a horizontal reference framework instrument that enables citizens and companies to enforce their rights under EU legislation.

 First of all, I must point out that I intend to vote in favour of the resolution, even if only in order to maintain the unity of Parliament and to strengthen the position of its President within the European institutions. In this sense, I appreciate the reference to the failure to involve the President of Parliament in the informal meetings held as part of the European summits, an infringement of rights that should be quite rightly condemned and deplored. The problem is also one of defending and reinforcing the positions of political groups fighting for a united Europe, which are confident that the crisis can only be satisfactorily resolved if tackled in a unified manner and if the risk of nationalistic, egotistical breakaway tendencies is prevented. Every day, these groups, particularly in some areas of continental Europe, have to deal with demagogical and populist propaganda that denigrates the EU and its institutions. Our vote is also one of support for these forces. However, it is also important to emphasise that Europe cannot be bound up and represented only by the austerity measures in the ‘six-pack’, a measure we opposed because we felt it was wrong, and which we still believe to be both incomplete and inadequate. We are therefore voting for a strong and united Europe that will once more combine growth and social equity. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 The report results from complaints submitted by European citizens and shows how weak the role of the European institutions and their directives can be if they are not adequately backed up by a comprehensive monitoring network. Accordingly, the report primarily represents an extraordinary demonstration of how a democratic process originating from the grassroots can work and bring results. In particular, the report highlights the serious delays in implementing the Waste Directive in some areas of Europe, as well as numerous violations of it, including: excessive dependence on landfills, in breach of waste disposal policies; a lack of transparency in procedures for assessing the impact on the environment; and the inaccessibility of information for citizens. In any case, the recent issues affecting Campania – one of the regions discussed in the report – have shown that tangible results can be achieved if the EU method is pursued to fruition, using all the available – and perhaps coercive – tools, making it possible to overcome flaws and structural shortcomings. The role of citizens and their petitions is to be welcomed, but even more so the ability of the European institutions to fully comprehend their strength and their role. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 The growing number of countries with which the EU has reached an agreement on the protection of geographical indications (GIs) must be welcomed. The results of this go well beyond economic figures and reflect on the prestige and good name of the outstanding products of European agriculture and foodstuff production. All too often, instances of vacatio legis
 enable the international distribution of brands that fraudulently imitate the packaging of GI products, even though they do not match their characteristics. This is misleading for consumers and hurts both the profits and the image of businesses that strive every day to keep up the quality standards of protected goods. Recently, a striking case involved the exportation to the United States of fake San Marziano tomatoes. Even faced with the evidence of this abuse, the Commission admitted it could not step in because there is no bilateral agreement in place with the US for the protection of registered trademarks; for the right to protection to be granted, we would have had to appeal under the relevant US regulations. This is a paradoxical situation, which needs to be sorted out in short order. By voting in favour of this recommendation, we want to take the opportunity to ask that the time required to manage these agreements be cut down. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

The exponential growth in waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) means that hard-hitting changes to the legislation governing its recycling and production cannot be put off. The growth in the sector is directly proportional to the effect on the Europe 2020 objectives for a resource-efficient economy: to achieve this, national legislation is no longer sufficient; what is needed is systematic European legislation. In line with these objectives, in addition to avoiding further damage to the environment and in order to hold on to precious resources, what we need are high collection rates, appropriate recycling standards, targeted action against illegal exports and a fairer distribution of responsibilities and costs between producers, consumers and public authorities. Parliament’s amended text seems to be in line with these requirements and, in addition, puts forward two particularly sensitive aspects that deserve attention and support. Firstly, it includes eco-design, not only with regard to energy consumption standards, but also with regard to a simplification of the procedures for dismantling or recovery of raw materials. Equally important is the requirement for the costs incurred in the recovery and treatment of raw materials to become an integral part of the product’s price, so as to form an incentive for the purchase of products with lower impacts. I voted for this recommendation for these reasons. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 The report is part of the debate on the CAP 2020 reform, seeking to guide its content, in order to better adapt it to the significant challenges that farmers will face, and seeking to turn those challenges from potential risk factors into opportunities to advance the process to transform agriculture in an environmentally sustainable and energy-efficient way. To achieve these results, without jeopardising the survival of a large portion of small operators, especially those located in the outermost areas of the continent, it is necessary to take action on those levers that make running farms economically sustainable. The report sets out actions to eliminate distortions which, upstream, limit farms’ profitability. All Eurostat findings come together to show the disparity between the increase in input costs and that of farm gate prices. The report, which I voted in favour of, has the merit of precisely indicating the sectors for action, both hoping for an enhanced and more constant commitment to tackling the formation of cartels among suppliers of the main inputs (seeds and fertilisers), and setting out an environmentally sustainable and economically beneficial transformation of resource supply systems.

 That the level reached by the data on food waste has an ethical significance, as well as a social, economic and environmental one, is no longer surprising. Yet, despite the ever increasing amounts – according to Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) estimates, it may even reach 50% of the total produced – of goods lost along the entire food chain, in Europe, there is still no clear, unambiguous and uniform definition of the concept of ‘food waste’. As if that were not enough, just a few months ago, we had to fight a fierce battle to refinance the fund for the distribution of food to the needy. In contrast to this is the data, deplorable in many ways, according to which Europeans and North Americans waste up to 115 kilograms of food per capita. This situation is no longer acceptable but, at the same time, it is hard to resolve. One of the main virtues of this report is that it does not reduce the problem to its most obvious manifestation – waste generated by the end consumer – which, however deplorable, is but one part of a broader and more complex problem. Conversely, we need to identify intervention strategies tailored to the specific causes of waste for each of the five sectors (production, storage, processing, distribution, consumption) that make up the food supply chain.

 The work carried out at the conciliation table by the European Parliament delegation is both praiseworthy and positive. The financial conditions of Member States meant that no more could have been achieved. Yet difficult times like these require the will and the courage to make innovative political choices that in some ways represent a break with the past. The conservatism of some Member States (especially, but not only Germany) is dangerously slowing down the process leading to the introduction of measures which, conversely, increasingly appear to be both urgent and unavoidable. At the same time as the budget lines were being approved, not without difficulty, the Commission was beginning consultations about the eurobonds, which were met with a negative reaction by some national governments. However, eurobonds are just part of the possible solution. In the 2012 budget, the evident widening of the gap between commitments for appropriations and payments is symptomatic of how the current system of delivering EU resources is inefficient and inadequate, and that it is therefore time it was changed to reflect an actual system of own resources based not only on the tax on financial transactions (TFT) and a new value-added tax (VAT), but also on a new way of taxing energy sources.

 The need to introduce a framework of legal certainty that would oversee a common practice, in other words, the use of a financial instrument which was included in the previous general regulation and not in Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 and which has continued to play an important part in the management of unit trusts, is in response to clear evidence of its functionality. It is no coincidence that Member States have continued to use them, even in the absence of clear indications. It was therefore certainly urgent to clarify and increase the transparency of procedures. However, we wish to express particular support for the provision for re-use of the reimbursed assistance, which would be managed in a separate account and used for the same purposes. This instrument would guarantee suitable and effective reinvestment of the funds, and could also be a way to alleviate pressure on cofinancing by Member States. Overall, the granting of repayable funds and the setting up of a special credit line for individual beneficiaries to use both seem to be moving towards an expansion of the range of funding possibilities, which is all the more important at a time of serious financial difficulty for many Member States. For this reason, I have to support this report. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 There can be no disagreement with support for a measure which represents a real and substantial breath of fresh air for Member States with the greatest economic and financial difficulties. In the same way, there can be no opposition to backing a measure which represents an attempt to maximise the use of European funding, avoiding the risk of funds not being spent due to a lack of available funds on the part of Member States, and of a consequent further deterioration and weakening of economic and social conditions. Although limited to Member States that have had access to financial stability mechanisms, the measure should therefore be supported and approved without further ado. However, this does not mean that we should not draw attention to the fact that it is a demonstration of the failure of the stability pact and ‘six-pack’ as wished for and approved by the right-wing majority in the Commission and Parliament. More specifically, this ‘contingent’ action restricts itself to mitigating the effects, which are, by their nature, ‘structural’, of the vicious cycle created, in particular, by the failure to exclude appropriations for investments from the rigid criteria of the stability pact, also because of the failure to introduce a golden rule on investments. Stop-gap measures are welcome, provided we are aware that the strategy pursued was wrong and that corrective structural measures are urgently required. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 In the European collective mentality, the image of literacy as a goal to achieve suggests areas outside the continent or, at the most, limited, peripheral areas. However, it is also a problem in ‘western’ and ‘industrialised’ areas. It is no coincidence that recent studies have shown that in Italy, 71% of the population is below the minimum comprehension threshold of an average difficulty text. Despite these statistics, no coordinated policies to tackle the problem have been found in the individual Member States, which will make it difficult to achieve the target set for 2020. It is important, in line with the European platform for tackling poverty, to underline that there is a need to coordinate the two areas of action, creating a synergy able to reverse the rate at which ‘poverty’ affects the percentages of early school leaving and, more generally, of poor school attendance. National governments, in the grip of the financial crisis, have almost all reduced educational funding. This risks boosting the vicious cycle of ‘low school attendance-unemployment’. This is why it has become so much more important for the European institutions to take action and provide support, through the targeted use of Structural Funds and implementation of alternative financial instruments.

 It would be unthinkable, including in terms of the developments under the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), not to support the association agreement with Ukraine, which, moreover, has a fundamental strategic role in such an essential sector as energy resources. However, the well-known political and judicial issues cannot be considered of secondary import. Hence, as Ms Tymoshenko herself said recently, we need to strengthen the political significance, which must go hand in hand with the economic and commercial aspects of the agreement. As the document under scrutiny suggests, this must become the mechanism for incentivising development and the onward march of reform. This is by no means an easy path, as the rejection of the amendment decriminalising the abuse of power and the continued imprisonment of Ms Tymoshenko and other opposition figures show. This is not a matter of meddling in the domestic affairs of a sovereign state, but of shrewd and active supervision of the personal and political freedoms that are basic conditions for rapprochement with the EU. Support for the agreement must therefore be understood in this light, without losing any respect for the rights of minorities and democratic principles, which are, in any case, well expressed in the document itself.

rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, policies to tackle new and old forms of poverty, which, unfortunately, are on the rise in today’s Europe and in the Europe of the crisis of recent times, along with one-sided austerity policies, above all, on the part of the Member States, require new financial commitments and new resources not only with regard to the European budget, including within the framework of financial prospects, but also with regard to European policies – as just mentioned – from the European Social Fund to the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), as well as to the budgets of individual Member States. Above all, as regards individual states, we should utilise the European Semester to monitor year after year, in practical terms, the policies they dedicate to this fundamental challenge. In order to give credibility to the objective to reduce poverty and social exclusion for around 20 million European citizens, it is necessary to have coherence between the enormous resources that Europe and the States should make available and the concrete policies that we can put into practice. It is calculated that around EUR 2 billion are needed between now and 2020 in order to realise the objectives that we are proposing. The challenge that we as the Committee on Budgets are identifying and focusing on is this: coherence between the financial resources that we make available and the policies that we put into practice. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D
),

In the context of the very broadest aims of the Europe 2020 strategy, the European platform against poverty and social exclusion should be thought of in view of the unique characteristics of what is an intrinsically complex, multifaceted and multiform phenomenon which, as the economic crisis has made itself felt, has taken on even more striking and worrying dimensions. The gradual increase in the number of areas affected, or at risk of being dragged into a state of poverty or ‘severe material deprivation’ as a result of the financial crisis, means that we have to strengthen and differentiate our responses. Vice-versa, we are watching with concern at the distortive effects which, in this sector too, may be caused by the reckless decision not to exclude investment from Stability Pact funds. Even in a context of scarce financial resources, the platform offers a positive message that is in line with the need to develop specific, Europe-wide, socio-economic initiatives, moving beyond mere emergency action or temporary support and thus heralding a genuine reversal of this trend. Specifically, it highlights the importance of launching a much sought-after global initiative to bring in a guaranteed minimum income rule, which – if it can be adjusted to and made compatible with economic development – will help reduce and prevent poverty and social exclusion.

 Demographic change, as underlined in the Fifth Report on cohesion, poses one of the central challenges for the future of the European socio-economic system, and it is a challenge with a wide territorial context that cuts deeply into the management of services and infrastructures. Without in any way detracting from the task of individual Member States, this challenge, which could also become an opportunity, directly implicates European institutions and, in particular, regional development policies. These policies are characterised by different strategies that are adapted to guaranteeing the demands and needs, respectively, of areas with populations on the rise and in decline, as well as the varying needs of urban and rural areas. In response to these challenges, European Funds (both the ERDF and the ESF) can be used comprehensively to ensure that equilibrium is restored to demands and, to this end, we should welcome the prospect of also making use of specific demographic indicators to assign European funds as well as to redistribute finances at the level of individual States. I express my vote in favour in the hope for policies capable of correlating the effects of demographic change with the fight against old and new poverty. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

The exhaust emission limits for agricultural and forestry tractors were changed in 2005. When that change was introduced, the requirements were also applied in full to agricultural tractor engines without any specific impact assessment concerning the technical feasibility of doing so. However, there have clearly been difficulties in applying the measure to tractors – generically called ‘narrow-track tractors’ – used for automated cultivation procedures on terrain which presents certain distinctive features, such as orchards and vineyards. The technical impossibility of installing compliant engines, whilst maintaining the tractors’ operational functionality and manoeuvrability, if not corrected, would cause serious difficulties to some of the most advanced and productive agricultural sectors, further exacerbating the effects of the ongoing economic crisis. In complete compliance with the European policy to fight for emission reduction, which needs to be developed, the current unusual situation in the economy in general, and the sector in particular, fully justifies the decision to postpone the application of the standards for three years. This will allow the parallel development of the essential design and technology necessary for the application, also to narrow-track tractors, of after-treatment systems able to guarantee compliance with emission restrictions, without compromising operational requirements.

 The procedure which began with the publication of the Green Paper on the future of value-added tax (VAT) has to be supported. The need to restructure the system rules out any further delays, as the mechanism introduced on a provisional basis has proved to have numerous shortcomings, particularly with regard to the risk of fraud. The hope for the future is that a new VAT system, together with the taxation of financial transactions, will, as the Commission claims, become an important own resource for the European budget. In the meantime, we invite the Commission to act quickly and to continue along its chosen path to the end, actively encouraging Member States to put in place all the necessary preliminary conditions in order to avoid multiple and overlapping elements and to allow for smoother bureaucratic procedures and reduced administration costs. In times of trouble, it is important to devote significant energies to fighting the waste of resources caused by evasion and fraud. Therefore, I support the report by Mr Casa, and hope that in its proposal, the Commission will take due account, above all, of the call to adopt mechanisms to make cross-border fraud control less random, by making optimal use of mechanisms that have already been tried and tested in individual Member States, or by using all the resources made available by the latest technology.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the structure of the cohesion policy we are debating today is very commendable. I would like to focus these few comments on three issues. Firstly, I consider cohesion policy to be one of the fundamental tools for reducing imbalances between and within Member States. It is therefore also one of the fundamental policies for combating the long economic and financial crisis that we have been experiencing for some years now. Secondly, I think the idea of involving new regions and citizens in cohesion policy is a sound one. However, we would do well to discuss these issues with a clearer idea of how much this new policy will cost, what effects it will have on general cohesion policy, and how we are going to distribute the resources in the context of the reform of the financial perspective from here to 2020. Finally, I think the central role of the urban issue in cohesion policy is decisive. It is important to have made some progress in this direction with Mr Vlasák’s report, with which I strongly agree, and I believe that this report will allow us to better define the legal framework of the urban issue and also to introduce tools such as the municipal operational programmes as operational programmes capable of giving a new quality to cohesion policy. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are about to vote on a highly important strategic document that provides a solid framework of reference for financial perspectives after 2013. It begins with the request for coherence between objectives and instruments, and between the new role that the European institutions must perform – in the light of the Treaty of Lisbon and the recession – and the resources that, together, we decide to invest. Such coherence also implies a serious response to the demand for innovation from the public, from the recipients of EU policies, and from Europe’s social groups and industries. We did the same for cohesion, which is a crucial issue for deciding what we want the European Union to be in the coming years. Experience shows that cohesion is now a vital nexus of the European project, and an important asset for everyone to safeguard, protect and renew. On this front, the effort made on the idea of introducing an intermediate category of regions is particularly important, above all, because in a number of cases, the years of recession that we are emerging from have intensified internal divisions, further increasing the importance of effective and adequate support for less developed regions in Europe, combating wastage and bringing development policy sharply into focus. However, I maintain that the challenge of intermediate categories and the safeguard clause is one that we must take on in order to begin a new phase in Europe’s cohesion policy and also to realise, within the cohesion policy, the more balanced and sustainable development that we want to assure for Europe over the coming years. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Ivan. The report lists the innovations introduced in the changes to control and reporting systems. These too bring out a greatly varied picture, especially in terms of Member States’ reporting of irregularities and fraud. The report repeatedly highlights the unusually low levels of fraud and irregularity reported by various countries in relation to agricultural expenditure, structural funds and pre-accession funds. It is here that we really must have some clarification on the statistics which have been submitted. The context is made more complicated by the unresolved inefficiencies in recovering losses. In any case, one figure seems clear and confirms a long-running trend. The struggle for legality and transparency in the expenditure of European resources, in comparison to tax avoidance and evasion, cannot yet count on the full collaboration of Member States and governments with the European institutions. In this light, it seems that the calls for reform of the EU’s public procurement rules and the need for what I would call a public European register for the beneficiaries of EU funds are timely. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the economic, social and financial crisis of the last few months and years, the new Treaty of Lisbon with its new powers, and the challenge we have set ourselves with Europe 2020, require the mobilisation of massive new financial resources. The paradox we are witnessing, including in this debate, is that right now, both the Commission and the Council appear to be silent and incapable of deciding and making choices. However, we know that if we want to come out of this difficult economic and social phase, if we want to address the major issues of the environment, the development of cohesion policy and agriculture in the coming years, then we need to invest more heavily in Europe and Europe’s function, and hence its essential function, which is to say, its budget. To do so, we must not be afraid to discuss, even at a time of budgetary restrictions, the idea of investing more heavily in resources and to have the strength and ability to develop debate and discussion that tackle the issue of increasing resources and that of more effective and flexible use of resources. This is the challenge we face. Andrea Cozzolino,  
rapporteur. 
− (IT) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when the Treaty of Lisbon is giving Europe a more incisive role in the lives of millions of Europeans, the challenge of transparency and legality is crucial. Hence the report that we are presenting is the result of a highly coordinated effort. The work was confined, first and foremost, to the scenario outlined by the Court of Auditors, whereby the financial impact of irregularities fell from more than EUR 1 billion in 2007 to EUR 783 million in 2008. The fall concerns all spending areas except direct expenditure and pre-accession funds. Areas of major concern still exist in relation to the Structural Funds too. However, absolute amounts and values alone do not tell us where the urgent problems are hidden and where the situation is under control. Our analyses and meetings over recent months have led us to prioritise two requirements. Firstly, the urgent need to make the Member States more responsible for identifying fraud and irregularities, and for sharing the information needed to combat fraud, waste and distortions in expenditure and in the collection of taxes. Secondly, the importance of presenting proposals and working hypotheses in order to make it easier to implement measures in the Member States, with administrative procedures and management strategies that give priority to the quality of the projects and to their impact on the living and working conditions of European citizens. In order to achieve these objectives, we propose that Parliament insist on certain priorities: firstly, we propose that OLAF draw up 27 profiles, analysing with due care and attention the strategies followed by each individual Member State in combating fraud and irregularities in the use of European resources, with a precise map of the authorities responsible for performing checks in each individual country and data on the quantity and quality of the checks performed and on their effects. Secondly, reducing the number of irregularities and significantly improving the regulations. We are embarking on a legislative and regulatory simplification programme, intended in particular for the Structural Funds. Moreover, the fight against corruption, financial crime and breaches of public procurement rules must be stepped up. In this year’s report we have made progress on this point with the support of the entire committee. Thanks to an intense, concerted effort, proposals have been drafted on the main problems in this area. From the relationship between the EU and tax havens, to the databases on beneficiaries of European funds, the report makes a practical contribution to increasing the transparency of expenditure and to strengthening the anti-fraud and anti-corruption strategies. Lastly, with regard to OLAF, it is crucially important to guarantee its full operational independence, the full cooperation of the Member States and an appropriate human resources strategy, which it most definitely needs. We must keep the debate alive and kicking in Europe so as to establish the role of a single European Prosecutor. To conclude, I believe it is vitally important to fight together for the transparent and efficient management of European resources. In this regard we must ensure that the problems that do exist are not exploited in any way in order to call into question instruments of fundamental importance to the European project, such as cohesion policy and development aid. Rather, we must look clearly at the problems, at the distortions that still exist in the various European spending areas and use these data to take new, determined steps forward, thereby making the management of our finances more efficient and transparent. I believe that, by making this effort, the various European institutions really will make progress in the construction of a Europe that is stronger, more integrated and able to better satisfy the needs of Europeans. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been stated, the European Court of Auditors 2008 report first and foremost gives us some positive news: the percentage of EU expenditure, characterised by high levels of irregularities, has gone down from 60% in 2005 to 31% in 2008. This is a significant result; it signals a positive approach that we must continue to follow. As far as the Structural Funds, and more specifically cohesion policies, are concerned, there continue to be problems and difficulties. I believe that we should focus our attention on these areas in the coming months and years. With regard to the Structural Funds, when compared with the Court’s analysis of the period 2000-2006, the management and monitoring systems for the period 2007-2013 are giving rise to stricter regulations and greater reliability and transparency in terms of expenditure, as well as to greater accountability on the part of the Member States. The Court of Auditors strongly emphasises the need for greater simplification. Therefore, much work needs to be done in order to further simplify the rules. Quality of economic growth and transparency in the use of Community resources are two objectives of the same battle which we need to wage. I believe we need to do this by also making our debates concerning ourselves and, above all, concerning the citizens, more public. Cohesion policies, the Structural Funds and regional policies are, and will, remain a crucial element of the European project. They have given substance to the European Union’s fundamental values. We must work together to guarantee efficiency and transparency in the coming years. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the focus is usually on the pre-summits when the summits themselves count for nothing, but in this case, we are forced to focus on the post-summit because we had understood that something important had happened. Mr Van Rompuy, if you had gone into a national parliament in any country in Europe and made the speech that you made here today, I think people throughout Europe would have understood precisely the opposite of what they had read in the newspapers three days ago, that you had made Europe take a giant step forwards. I think it is essential to come here to this House not only to tell us what happened at the summit, but also to say what the Council intends to do after this summit. If you do not tell us that, you will be throwing away the chance to tell the European public that we are working towards a united Europe and to getting a step closer to rescuing the countries in difficulty. In your reply, Mr Van Rompuy, I would also like you to tell us exactly what you think of the position taken by the Dutch and Finnish Governments. It is your duty to say what your thoughts are on that, because otherwise we will have the impression that the Council ended with a statement that does not correspond to any genuine political will. You should be very careful about this, as I hope not too many journalists heard it, because you know how much influence the media has these days on the fate of countries and the evolution of their spreads.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, you were quite right to say that this is not a perfect agreement, Ms Malmström. If we at the EU had done it ourselves we would have done it differently, but this is not a directive, it is an agreement between parties. An agreement is always better than no agreement though, and this one does help us to move forward. It will also enable further improvements, because each year a European agreement – not secret agreements like those made with all Member States – will return to Parliament and be verified by this House. Therefore, we have to acknowledge a political fact: through this agreement, Europe is negotiating with the US and comes directly under US jurisdiction. I would like to thank my group for allowing free voting and for allowing the delegation from the Italian Partito Democratico
 to vote in favour of the agreement. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, the conclusions of the European Council were not what we were expecting, given that the Treaty of Lisbon does, in fact, provide the elements and possible coverage to put forward credible solutions. We had called for Eurobonds and a financial transaction tax, an increase in the bail-out fund and a review of the role of the European Central Bank. As you yourselves have said this morning, however, nothing was decided on any of those points. The Council’s response was budget discipline to curb the erosion of financial resources, but without investing in growth. This was a meagre outcome based on an agreement among 26 countries, reached after a tortuous procedure, which we have always rejected. Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, by excluding the Commission and the European Parliament, the Council chose to add a democracy deficit to the budget deficit. We have a two-speed Europe, Mr President: the Europe of the Member States and the Europe of the people. Parliament supports the Europe of the people, and I call on President Barroso to have the Commission side with us. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have understood that there are countries in the Arab world and in North Africa that need us. Public opinion demands that Europe be in touch with this wind of liberty, this eagerness for dignity, and it is a demand that is made of us and when I say ‘us’, I mean Europe. It is right for Europe to ensure that the international community is present, but that demand, the demand from these countries, is to ‘us’ directly. We can rightly undertake every diplomatic effort so that the international community intervenes, but it cannot intervene if Europe does not have a policy for the Mediterranean. We must strengthen this will to have a policy for the Mediterranean. It is said, and has been said very well, during the debate on the Syrian issue: ‘let us meet Turkey’. However, Baroness Ashton, we must have a clear idea of our relationship with Turkey, and it cannot be an intermittent relationship. One day, we want it to be close to us and the next, we do not want it close to us; this is not feasible. Europe needs to be clear on its relationship with Turkey and today, we understand how important it would have been in the past to bet on Turkey … (The President cut off the speaker) David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, to question Schengen is, in our view, to question Europe. If Europe is going to be even weaker, as right-wing governments desire, it will be increasingly tempting to ask ourselves whether remaining in Europe still makes sense, as the Italian Interior Minister, Mr Maroni, has done. The answer, however, is greater involvement of EU mechanisms. In essence, we need more Europe, not less Europe, and the Commission needs to say so more forcefully. The best of Europe was shown on Sunday night when, in an extraordinary chain of human solidarity, the people of Lampedusa saved 500 shipwrecked people who were heading towards certain death. The worst of Europe, if the news carried by The Guardian
 is confirmed, would be NATO military forces who do not intervene to save men, women and children adrift. If we are sure about which of these we prefer, Mrs Malmström, then during the European Council in June the Commission will have to convince Member States to formulate a European policy on immigration, because Europe à la carte
 would be tantamount to the collapse of the European dream. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last night, there was another tragedy in the Mediterranean. Immigrants from north Africa died trying to reach Italy and Europe. There are 130 missing and 20 bodies have already been found. When it comes to immigration, we must never forget that we are talking about men, women and children, not just numbers. There must be no more reticence; the Council and governments must act. Civil and democratic Europe must show its sorrow and, for this reason, Mr President, I ask you to invite the House to observe a minute’s silence in memory of the victims of immigration.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow’s vote is one of the steps which will soon lead to the accession of Iceland to the European Union. Iceland has made significant progress, as Mr Preda said. I will mention a few examples: the strengthening of judicial independence, a special commission of inquiry to investigate and analyse the processes that led to the collapse of the Icelandic banking system, the creation of a joint Parliamentary Committee between the European Union and Iceland, the situation regarding entry into the euro area, increased experience in the renewable energy sector. The very thorny issue of ‘Icesave remains open, and on Saturday there will be a referendum which will bring Icelanders to the polls. Although the outcome of the referendum is a matter of debate, I think it has very strong democratic value because it gives the people of Iceland a sense of responsibility and involves them even more in this delicate stage of negotiations. Although the first referendum did not bring a positive result, the Icelandic Government has worked hard to create a broad coalition capable of explaining to citizens the reason for Iceland’s commitment to reimbursing the UK and the Netherlands for the damage they suffered. Europe’s role at this time should be one of patience and respect, without exerting excessive pressure which might cause some sort of self-defence and closure in Icelandic society. With regard to fisheries and agriculture, I believe that Europe and Iceland must find the best solution to meet the criteria established in the Treaty and to preserve the Icelandic economy, ecosystems and the country’s specific characteristics. The accession of Iceland to the European Union will mean that Europe moves towards the North Pole, with significant positive effects in the political, economic, environmental and scientific fields. It is clear that belonging to Europe, sixty years on, is still an attractive possibility. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, you must have realised that this House enjoys plenty of solidarity, but this is not enough. To introduce and empower a European immigration policy, we must do together what others cannot do, in other words, achieve the consensus of governments. Take your proposals and put them before the Council. We shall support you, because you must have realised, apart from some xenophobic remarks, that you enjoy great respect and great solidarity in this House. Parliament will reaffirm this tomorrow, saying no to the refoulements
, yes to the implementation of Directive 2001/55/EC and yes to the implementation of Article 25 of that directive. Tomorrow, we will do our bit in Parliament. However we need others to do their bit; for governments to be much less selfish; for us to be seen sponsoring the solidarity needed to implement a European policy. Your work is naturally central to this effort, because without the governments, Europe will be weaker. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Mediterranean has made a dramatic return to the global political agenda and Europe has found out that it is very weak indeed. We failed to invest in a neighbourhood policy with the Middle East and the Maghreb, we did not give our backing to an area of free trade or a common immigration policy and what is happening in North Africa is having an effect on the Middle East, where the peace process has stalled. Baroness Ashton, Europe must help Israel and the Palestinians to restart negotiations on the basis of proposals that are now supported by both the Council and Parliament. The changes under way also affect Israel and, by investing in change, we can bring together security and peace. Europe must exert pressure on Israel to weaken its grip on the occupied territories and to halt the settlement policy, which is a necessary condition to restart negotiations. As we are currently seeing, these days, nobody is impervious when the desire for freedom explodes like this. Any further delay in resolving the conflict risks compromising Israeli and Palestinian hopes of reaching a fair solution and compromises the future of such a fragile area of the Mediterranean and the Middle East.

Madam President, once again, we have witnessed the inability of the Italian Government to protect the pro-European reputation of Italy and the interests of its businesses on a crucial point such as the adoption of the European patent. Twenty-five countries out of 27 and the overwhelming majority of Parliament support a proposal that regulates the field of patents and that has a real effect on the most innovative enterprises and those that are most orientated to international markets. By ruling ourselves out of this decision, we in Italy will expose our enterprises to the risk of not being suitably protected in Europe and across the world. It is quite incredible that a government that does nothing to spread Italian culture throughout the world, that cuts funds to cultural institutes and fails to value the language of the country that is host to the largest number of World Heritage Sites, can ride roughshod over the language issue while our enterprises have actually always asked for patents to be drafted only in English, which is now the lingua franca of the global economy. However, we have reached a result that allows anyone submitting patents to do so in their own language. Madam President, there was nothing that made it compulsory for Mr Barnier to force this through with such a hasty vote before the opinion of the Court of Justice which, as we know, will be expressed during the first week of March and will deal mainly with two crucial points: the use of one’s national language to defend oneself before the European Union Patent Court and the very legitimacy of creating a patent court. As we well know, these are important issues to resolve before taking any decision. Hence, the Italian delegation of the Democratic Party (PD) decided to abstain. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are pleased to have this debate with the Commission on the North African migration crisis. We have seen these people arrive in Lampedusa only to find no facilities able to receive and identify them. In fact, the Italian Government dismantled the existing reception centre and reduced the facilities there some time ago, under the banner of ‘Zero immigration’, thus preventing Italy from being able to tackle illegal immigration. We know that this problem concerns Italy, but it also concerns Europe. Considerable financial investment is needed to solve it within a coordinated policy framework, while complying with international treaties and ensuring that refugees are protected. In your response, Commissioner, I would like to know precisely when the Italian Government asked the European Commission to intervene, because there have been certain controversies, of which you are well aware.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are here today in this Chamber to remember that the European Parliament and democratic institutions must protect and support the relatives of the victims of terrorism and provide the sense of justice that European public opinion demands. In the resolution we have tabled and are shortly to vote upon, we point out that relations between Brazil and the European Union are based on mutual recognition and respect of the rule of law and of fundamental rights. There are therefore no question marks over our friendly relationship with Brazil. I should like to point out that, in Italy, the defendant, Cesare Battisti, has been found guilty of four murders. Although a fugitive, Mr Battisti had the legal assurances in his trials – which were all conducted in the presence of his defence lawyer – that the Italian justice system had run its course, with all levels of justice exhausted, and that they sentenced him to two life sentences. Mr President, even France – where Cesare Battisti had previously fled – decided back in 2004 to accept Italy’s extradition request, recognising his crimes and the corresponding sentences, because Cesare Battisti is a criminal who must be brought to justice. Brazil’s contradictory behaviour is difficult to understand, not least because the Brazilian authorities have not officially recognised him as a political refugee, which is one of the reasons to suspend the bilateral agreement between Italy and Brazil regarding extradition. This is why the decision of the Supreme Court seemed incomprehensible to the victims’ families and the wider public. Mr President, we are representing a Europe of rights and of rights for all. The victims have the right to know that those guilty of such heinous crimes will serve their sentence in the prisons of their own countries. David-Maria Sassoli,

Mr President, the situation is very serious. We think that this issue – which is also being trailed by Europe’s media – ought to be dealt with by the European Union and by Parliament, as well as urging the Commission to look into it, since it is a real humanitarian emergency. In this case, the Member States must do everything to try and help these refugees to leave that territory and we think that they could be accepted in European states. We call on the Commission to do everything possible to carry out this action, including using the funds available through the European Fund for Refugees. David-Maria Sassoli,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to add a paragraph to the resolution, which we feel is important and will not affect the structure of it too much. It concerns paragraph 9 of the joint resolution. I shall read it: ‘invites Member States to tackle this humanitarian emergency through the voluntary resettlement in the European Union of all the asylum seekers involved in this crisis; asks the European Commission to coordinate this operation and use available funding through the European Refugees Fund’.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last week we witnessed a disconcerting spectacle in the new body over which you preside: Mr Sarkozy and Mr Berlusconi called into question the treaties signed by their countries. We realised that the French President and Italian Prime Minister, in serious difficulty in their countries, wish to have a Commission that bends to their will. The former refuses to accept criticism, and the latter even wants to deny Commissioners the right to speak. We must remember, as Parliament has reminded us, that the Roma are European citizens on European soil. The treaties must be upheld. We have the instruments to do this, and we must not be afraid to open infringement procedures too. Moreover, if we do not defend the principles of European integration, how will we be able to agree on strategies to emerge from the economic crisis? The forces on the ground, Mr President, have had their say. Parliament, its Presidency and the Commission must respond to the populism advocating a fear-driven Europe with an enhanced social Europe and enhanced citizenship, and we believe this to be the challenge that this political generation must meet. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, for the second time during this parliamentary term and in this House, we find ourselves discussing the problem of press freedom. This shows, Commissioner, that it is a keenly-felt problem; it is a major problem in the eyes of the European public. I would remind you that, in May 2004, Parliament issued a resolution calling upon the Commission to take action to protect media pluralism and press freedom, but we have not heard the Commission speak up in all these years. As you know, the problem is now growing. The issues concerning Italy, Romania and Hungary are different but their background is the same. As you are well aware, Italy continues to experience a serious conflict of interest that is exacerbated by government occupation of the public broadcasting service. In Romania, the press is actually considered a threat to the nation. In Hungary, the government wishes to put journalism under scrutiny. The European institutions naturally cannot condone any government influence over the media. Freedom of information is not a commodity that can be evaluated only in accordance with market criteria. Rather, it is the public’s right to form its own opinions about politics, the quality of governments, and public life. There can be no more excuses for the European institutions; the Commission must take decisive action to reinforce common European standards. Your intervention, Commissioner, could offer European citizens the certainty that Europe is an area of rights and freedom. David-Maria Sassoli,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, members of the Council and of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, clearly, the start of accession negotiations with Iceland represents another step forward in the European integration process. We are talking about a country which has signed European partnership agreements for years, which has been a signatory to the Schengen Agreement since 1996, and which is one of the founding members of the World Trade Organisation. So far, Iceland has demonstrated that it meets many of the accession criteria, though there are some aspects that still need to be improved. I refer to the judicial system, mentioned by Mr Preda: it is important for Iceland to adopt clear mechanisms in order to ensure the independence of the judiciary and to resolve the problem of appointments of judges, prosecutors and supreme judicial authorities. The Icelandic Government must work harder: it is the Icelandic people who must be convinced about wanting to participate in the European challenge. There are, of course, some issues that still need to be defined, and one of those is whaling. The conference in Agadir on 25 June confirmed the moratorium on whaling, and Iceland must act in accordance with this decision and stop whaling even for scientific purposes, since it is often a cover for commercial whaling. Lastly, there is one point on which I think greater conviction is needed by Parliament and that is the Icesave issue, which has highlighted the need for a solid law on conflicts of interest in that country. Madam President, the negotiation stage can begin in order to reaffirm that Europe is not a geographical area or a closed system, and that, if they so desire and if they conform, the countries neighbouring Europe can participate in the development and the construction of the European project. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis is deep and Europeans are asking us for one thing: to put politics back in charge of the economy. This is the responsibility that we must take on by revitalising the Community method, safeguarding our currency and promoting measures to protect our citizens and provide employment. Making the financial markets accountable is a moral, but also a political duty for us, and Europe must speak with one voice at the forthcoming G20 summit. This is a problem that you, Mr Barroso, must address. Your Commission must endeavour to keep the governments at arm’s length and convince them that no one will emerge from the crisis on their own. United, Europe will win, or divided, it will fall. You must be like an orchestra conductor, Mr Barroso, making all the musicians play the same tune. What should the music score contain though? Firstly, regulation of the financial markets and the rating agencies, economic governance of the euro area, taxation of all financial transactions and investments for growth, and not just budget cuts. A striking example was your Commission’s positive opinion, according to the Italian Government, of Italy’s financial package, a package that will bring the local authorities to their knees. No one has ever achieved growth on the basis of budget cuts alone and today, what we need is growth. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteur, Mr Cashman, for the work he has carried out, and for reminding us of the importance of the New York summit. Europe has a great opportunity: that of presenting itself as a world partner for development. The information we have is still alarming: in 2009, a billion people suffered chronic hunger, and this figure has risen today with the economic crisis. We must add to this the damage caused by climate change, a factor that continues to magnify the problems that we have been trying to keep under control. We must recognise that the targets we set ourselves in 2000 were certainly ambitious and could only have been met by donor countries. In the light of these commitments toward developing countries, it is sad to see that some European countries are falling so far short of their agreed commitments. It is disappointing, for example, that my country – Italy – is now contributing a distressingly low 0.16% of GDP. We must introduce a binding commitment for all countries to reach 0.7 % of GDP by 2015, as established by the European Commission. All countries must feel it is their moral duty and political obligation to uphold this commitment. The outstanding work by the rapporteur, Mr Cashman, enables the European Parliament to play a key role in defending people’s dignity. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a Europe of the people and not a Europe of the States. The crisis we are experiencing is the crisis of European policy’s inability to govern the market. In order to save the euro, political institutions need to be strengthened and intergovernmental logic needs to be left behind to allow for European governance. This is not rhetoric because a few minutes ago in Berlin, German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, sounded the alarm stating that the euro is in danger. Voicing alarm without indicating strong and convincing measures risks further weakening the single currency for investors and the market and making all of Europe weaker. Imagine the response of the markets in the coming hours, considering that just minutes ago, the euro collapsed again. When we exit the House, Mr President, we may find ourselves poorer and more insecure. New European governance alone will allow us to defend the single currency, promote growth, employment and social inclusion. We must discard the old approach of coordinating national policies and equip ourselves with strong decision-making instruments. New European governance must assure three levels of intervention: a policy for growth, suitable financial instruments and emergency management. The EUR 750 billion rescue package was important but we have realised that it is not enough. Today, we need a strong political initiative that can guide the market to allow for greater mobility of the resources. The monetary and budget policies have proven inadequate in assuring productivity and competitiveness. We must not be afraid to invest, above all, in Community interest projects such as infrastructure, energy, the environment, knowledge and human capital. Mr President, Parliament has a great responsibility: to reinforce the capacity of Member States to leave intergovernmental policy behind and launch European spirit anew through its own independence.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a moment ago, a disgraceful speech was speciously made in this House against the President of the Italian Republic. I believe that the Bureau of this House should not allow people to bring national political issues into it, particularly when dealing with institutional and political matters of great importance. I would remind you – and remind all fellow Members – that the Italian Republic is not for sale, and that the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, is the guardian of the Italian Constitution. On behalf of the Italian delegation of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I call on the Bureau of this House to be more vigilant with regard to the topics debated and the speeches that are made. I am sorry that President Buzek did not intervene to stop a speech that attacked the President of the Republic, who, just one week ago, visited the European Parliament.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Italian police force last night arrested five people who were planning a mafia attack on one of our colleagues, Mr Crocetta, a Member of this Parliament and a former mayor of the Sicilian town of Gela. According to the magistrates, the attack could have taken place on any given day, starting from today, 20 January. I would remind you that the Belgian authorities have yet to provide a suitable escort for Mr Crocetta, who has been under protection in Italy for some time now, as Parliament’s Presidency is aware. I would ask the Presidency to show solidarity with our colleague on behalf of this House and of the European Parliament and to take action to ensure that Mr Crocetta receives adequate protection in his role as an MEP.

 Mr President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, the enormous tragedy that has struck Haiti requires an immediate response and many aid and rescue activities are under way, carried out by individual Member States, even if there is a good deal of competition between European countries. The new Europe with its High Representative ought to be capable of providing its own aid to the people who are suffering. The earthquake, moreover, has struck the poorest country in the western hemisphere, where 80% of the population live below the poverty line and 54% live in absolute poverty. Within this emergency, however, there is another: the emergency involving the children, the weakest sector of the population, who have been left with no family, no protection and no State. I would therefore like to call upon the High Representative for Foreign Affairs to examine actions intended to allow Haitian children up to the age of 10 to be taken in and looked after by European countries. Lady Ashton, Europe can take them in and offer them adequate living conditions; I mean for a limited period, until the conditions are adequate for them to return to their own country. All this could be organised, all this could be easy for the European countries, and it would be a fair way to respond to the need for solidarity, but also to avoid speculative and illegal actions being taken at the expense of children. We are talking about children, the most precious resource that we should protect in Haiti. David-Maria Sassoli,

Madam President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, our group is very worried by the situation in Yemen because there is a global threat there: the failed attempt to blow up a US aircraft, the threats directed towards foreign embassies and the intensification of attacks by al-Qaeda, the most recent being in Afghanistan, must be taken very seriously. Unfortunately, Yemen’s domestic situation does not help, and we should bear in mind the fact that it is one of the poorest countries in the world, with serious water shortages, high unemployment and an economy heavily dependent on revenue from oil and gas, which it is estimated will be exhausted within the next 10 years. I therefore believe action by the European Union is vital, in the shape of close collaboration between the European Commission, on humanitarian aid and development aspects, and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs, in relation to common security, collaboration with police forces and border control. I must also mention our concern over the clamp-down on representatives of the political opposition in that country, journalists and human rights defenders, which the humanitarian organisations operating in Yemen have been speaking about for a long time. Baroness Ashton, I therefore consider it a priority to ensure that humanitarian organisations can enter Yemeni territory and work in complete security. I also hope for an effort by the European Union to ensure that Yemen abides by the commitments made in 2006 at the international donors’ conference, namely to step up the process of political and economic reforms, to increase democracy and people’s living standards. Since the September 11 attack, we have realised that making at-risk areas secure depends on how much we are prepared to gamble on better living conditions. Baroness Ashton, democracy starts from here, from the ability to close the gaps between the rich countries and the poorest countries. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are preparing for the Copenhagen conference with a resolution showing our awareness that in order to tackle policies to combat climate change, it is necessary for all the geographical areas of the world to be involved. Also, it is the responsibility of the industrialised countries to establish with developing countries not only targets to be reached, but also the resources to be used to reach them. On this aspect, good work has been done in Parliament. The resolution sets out specific instruments and it is important that we have quantified the actions. The figure of EUR 30 billion proposed by us between now and 2020 can be viewed as an important figure, although it is a minimum, for supporting the initiatives of developing countries. Yesterday Mr De Boer, the United Nations negotiator, asked for USD 10 billion between now and 2012. After the choices made by the United States and China, it falls to Europe to take on new responsibilities and lead the fight against climate change. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to thank the Swedish Presidency for the work it has done and for having succeeded in putting in place the conditions for the final ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon. We sorely need the new treaty because it offers us the possibility of strengthening, of extending powers, for example, the powers of this Parliament, and of two new figures, who can represent political and institutional union. We therefore hope that the Council will be able to interpret the requests of the great European political families wisely, so that at the next meeting, an authoritative and strongly supported decision can be taken on the appointment of the persons called upon to occupy the new institutional positions envisaged by the treaty. What do we need? We need a President of the Council who is capable of guaranteeing consistency and continuity. We need a High Representative who, on the strength of his or her experience and authority, is capable of guaranteeing Europe a leading role in a multipolar world, and who, at the same time, will act as a link between the intergovernmental and the Community dimension of the Union. And then we also need a college of commissioners that is strong, united and balanced in terms of politics, geography and gender. It is particularly significant that this is happening 20 years after the fall of the Wall, the wall that divided Europe, and all this can rekindle hope in a united, strong Europe that will continue to drive the demands for solidarity and justice.

Mr President, in accordance with Rule 147 of the Rules of Procedure, I should like to remind you that, in the debate on human rights in the world in 2007, this House decided not to do as the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) proposed and make reference to persons who represent high civil or religious institutions for the purposes of strengthening political arguments. We therefore ask you to adopt the same measure with regard to the amendments to our resolution tabled by the PPE Group, which make explicit reference to the President of the Italian Republic, Giorgio Napolitano.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, every one of us is influenced by the circumstances in which we live, and you too will have been told before coming here to Brussels: ‘remember that you have a big responsibility, that we have a big responsibility’, that of making your country better. We know that our countries will be better if Europe is stronger and is able to respond with a sense of fairness to its citizens’ expectations. We are obviously aware that this is possible if we all act together; if we are able to pool our most precious resources, our Constitutions, that set of values and of legal rules, of rights, that are Europe’s true assets. So many controversies plague my country, but I would like straight away to reassure everyone that we are talking about a great democratic country, which has a great Constitution. Yesterday was a very important day for we Italians, because the Constitutional Court, faced with confusion and requests for impunity, reaffirmed a simple and time-honoured principle – that all citizens are equal before the law. However, we know that even great countries can go off course, can mix up public property with private interests. Nonetheless, we cannot allow the Member States to become weak. The right to independent information, without pressures or conditions on the part of government authorities, must be guaranteed, and this is a public good, a good for everyone, in every country. This good must be protected without hesitation by the Union. We must endeavour to provide common rules, to set limits beyond which information is no longer considered to be independent. There is an urgent need for the Union to intervene, to adopt a directive that lays down guidelines on pluralism and on the protection of a good that must be available to all. Mrs Reding, never forget that we are a Parliament and not a museum where things are left to moulder away. David-Maria Sassoli,

Thank you for your question, because it gives me the opportunity to explain myself. I did not have this opportunity in the time that was allocated to me. (The President asked the Members to allow the speaker to continue)
 As I was saying, I am glad you asked me the question because it gives me the opportunity to say that the directive that we are requesting from the Commission must be for all Member States. This is not an Italian issue: this is a European issue. I would also say that we want the question that we are to submit at Strasbourg to be amended. We want it to cover the debate on pluralism in Italy and in Europe. Thank you very much for your question. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Barrot, Mr Billström, ladies and gentlemen, we called for this debate to draw the EU’s attention to the grave violations of fundamental human rights taking place in Italy. Since May, over 1 000 migrants have been picked up at sea by the Italian authorities and handed over to Libya in the course of informal and indiscriminate refoulements without identifying the people, giving them the right to appeal or access to asylum procedures, with the danger that they will be subjected to inhumane and degrading treatment in Libya. As Commissioner Barrot confirmed when he asked Italy for details, we believe that these practices violate the fundamental principles which underpin Europe. This kind of action is compatible neither with the European Convention on Human Rights nor with Community law, particularly the Schengen Borders Code and the Repatriation Directive, nor with Italian law. Yesterday, the United Nations called on Italy to comply with international law and, also yesterday, 24 Somali and Eritrean refugees turned away by Italy lodged an appeal against Italy at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg for violating the European Convention on Human Rights. Moreover, ladies and gentlemen, illegal immigration in Italy has become a criminal offence, an aggravating circumstance. The mere fact of being a migrant entails discrimination and inequality, and gives rise to harsher punishments for the same crime. The fact of being an illegal migrant, as were the families of our Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Greek and Italian communities, blocks access to fundamental rights and to the most basic care, including health services, for fear of being reported. This is happening in Italy, Mr President, and has also been denounced by legal and constitutional experts and secular and Catholic associations. What does the Commission intend to do to end these violations? Parliament has always supported the fight against illegal immigration, but only in compliance with fundamental rights. We would like to know, Mr President, whether the Commission intends to take action on Italian legislation and examine the Italy-Libya agreement. Twenty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, we cannot allow certain governments to build new ones. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, your speech today, Mr Barroso, has not changed our opinion. Our view remains strongly negative. Throughout the years of your presidency, the Commission has shown itself to be incapable and lacking in autonomy. This was the case for the financial crisis and the same holds true for immigration policy: the safeguarding of fundamental rights and compliance with Community law must represent two sides of the same policy. You said in this Chamber that you intend to appoint a commissioner for justice and rights and a commissioner for internal affairs and immigration. Do not do that, Mr Barroso: immigration and rights must stay together so as not to endorse xenophobic policies. You have a majority here in Parliament, a right-wing majority, and clearly we are unable to identify with this majority. I understand the difficulties of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and the Democrats for Europe but, Mr Verhofstadt, do not tell us that the coherent approach that you called for in order to emerge from the crisis consists of the speed with which the Barroso Commission will be formed. It is obvious that we cannot identify with this majority. Our positions cannot be reconciled with those who do not resolutely fight for full and steadfast freedom of information, with those who do not fight to safeguard rights, and with those who view Parliament as a mere forum to represent national governments.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we have recalled in this chamber, next December the United Nations agency responsible for communications technology and information will meet in Dubai for the ITU World Conference on International Telecommunications. The aim is to renegotiate the International Telecommunication Regulations (ITRs). We cannot forget – I am pleased at the words used by Commissioner Tajani – the work that has been done so far, which cannot be up for debate, nor can we allow the authority of the European Union to be bypassed by a supranational organisation such as the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), to which, as we know, hundreds of States around the world belong, many of which are renowned for having problems linked to democracy, transparency and freedom of expression. We are not mistaken therefore in thinking that the pillars of the internet – in other words, freedom, participation, openness and innovation – are under threat. I believe it is necessary to safeguard the role of the internet and, more importantly, the role that the internet can have in reviving economic growth, as well as guaranteeing opportunities for all. Therefore, I hope the Commission will endeavour to ensure that in Dubai, Europe presents a united front and speaks with one voice. There are many controversial proposals on the table for the World Conference on International Telecommunications, particularly those that propose changes to internet governance that call into question the neutrality of the internet, with negative repercussions for consumers. The freedom of the internet or, more specifically, the freedom of expression and data protection, are therefore at risk. What some States have proposed would entitle a government to monitor not only the communications of its citizens, but even the data exchanged over its networks. It is a very small step from here to the curtailment of freedom of expression and censure, therefore I believe it is contrary to the fundamental principles of the European Union.

 I welcome this regulation, which aims to establish a series of harmonised standards on the production of agricultural and forestry vehicles. It is an excellent legislative text, in which there is the proper balance between the need to guarantee a high level of safety on the road and at work and to protect the environment. Adapting to safety standards is not just an obligation; it is an absolute necessity. This regulation moves things in the right direction, since it covers every aspect of operational safety in tractors, both as regards their movement on the road and in the performance of agricultural work. The proposed regulation significantly simplifies current legislation on approvals, replacing 24 base directives and approximately another 35 amending directives. The regulation was needed in order finally to harmonise the market for the agricultural and construction machinery sector too. I am delighted that the proposed approval at European level for all categories of vehicle takes account of cost-benefit considerations, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises.

 I voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a directive on consular protection for citizens of the Union because I believe that citizens who are abroad but whose own country is not represented should receive assistance from the diplomatic services of all Member States. Not only that, but the level of protection should be equivalent to that guaranteed by the Member State in question for its own nationals. Facilitating cooperation between diplomatic services locally, coordinating emergencies, giving out information to citizens including on the websites of the Commission and the Member States, should be objectives that the European Union should soon be able to guarantee for its own citizens.

 I warmly welcome the excellent report on passenger rights in all transport modes, which provides for clear and accurate information, transparency in ticket prices, assurance in the event of airline bankruptcy, the creation of a centre for claims and an EU-wide free direct line. Particular attention is paid to the needs of persons with reduced mobility who may, at times, be forced to pay in cases where there are inadequate facilities, and to the development of intermodal transport. I am also pleased by the inclusion of the request that the Commission should address the proliferation of unfair clauses in air carrier contracts, such as the unfair requirement that passengers must use both parts of a return air ticket in order. When the rights of passengers using coach/bus transport, dating from 2011 and not yet entered into force, are adopted, the European Union will have an integrated set of fundamental passenger rights in all transport modes. Even though the Commission takes the view that it is too soon, at this stage, to provide a single regulation covering passengers in all transport modes, I hope that Parliament’s requests will be heard by the Commission, since unfortunately we still see cases in which the rights of European travellers are inadequate.

 I voted in favour of the Sehnalová report on the establishment of the security system known as eCall, as I believe it is an excellent means of preventing road accidents and more. Thanks to this system, it will also be possible from now on to reduce the congestion caused by accidents, thus preventing more accidents from occurring. I regret the delays and the lack of progress in the voluntary deployment of eCall to date and I hope that all parties involved will act simultaneously in order to establish this service. I also believe there must be coordinated awareness-raising campaigns concerning the eCall system and its benefits for European citizens, with the aim of increasing both the understanding of, and the demand for, the service.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs who worked with me to draft this important recommendation, the secretariat of the Committee on Transport and Tourism and the secretariat of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament. After almost two years of lengthy and difficult negotiations with the shadow rapporteurs, the Council and the Commission, Parliament has managed to make considerable progress, in particular, by guaranteeing greater competition between rail operators, oversight by a strong, independent national regulatory body that ensures fair competition, the requirement, for the first time, to handle complaints within a set time ranging from six to a maximum of 16 weeks, the creation of a European network of national regulatory bodies and a rendezvous clause for the establishment of a European regulatory body. Moreover, the new rules – which should also lay a solid foundation for the financing of infrastructure thanks to contracts of a minimum of five years – and the agreement that we secured to strengthen the current rules and to create a single European railway area should offer all railway undertakings fair access to a wider range of services, such as maintenance and station services, including ticket sales, in addition to providing equal access to the rail network. In particular, with regard to the regulatory body, a key element of the railway recast, the new rules lay down more stringent requirements for the appointment of its staff and in order to guarantee its full independence: cooling-on and cooling-off periods and a declaration of interest that the regulatory body’s members must submit. The recast also provides for the regulatory body to make recommendations to licensing and safety authorities to prevent, for example, safety rules being used to limit access to the market. The recast will extend the regulatory bodies’ powers to ancillary rail services and to overseeing the separation of accounts. It will be made clear that regulatory bodies must review both the draft and final versions of network statements, which are an essential instrument to ensure that all the operators are aware of the market access conditions. Furthermore, in addition to acting in a limited timeframe in the event of a complaint, regulatory bodies will be able to intervene with regard to the introduction of mark-ups on the direct costs of infrastructure managers, control the criteria for the introduction of booking charges and regularly consult railway users. Thanks to Parliament’s involvement, we have also managed to obtain a network of regulatory bodies: the content of the information will be exchanged in a clear manner and will be guaranteed by the Commission, which will be required to evaluate how efficiently the regulatory bodies are cooperating with the new network and to propose supplementary measures to ensure a more integrated oversight of the European rail market, with the hope that in the future, a European regulatory body can be established. With regard to financing infrastructure, the multiannual contractual agreement no longer has a minimum duration of three years but five, and there is a provision requiring Member States to make good the deficit in the infrastructure manager’s accounts every five years at the most. A requirement has also been included … (The speaker interrupted her speech
) In order to have a single rail market, we need to provide non-discriminatory access to the market. Therefore, even if the separation requirements for service facilities have not been imposed on all kinds of infrastructure, the opening up of the services market is far-reaching, with an extensive list of essential services and non-discriminatory access to infrastructure and services. A ‘use it or lease it’ clause has also been included for services that have not been used for at least two years instead of three. With regard to charges, in particular, noise charges, we have reached a compromise that is optional for Member States – although it will be mandatory to comply with the applicable EU rules – that envisages a bonus system to facilitate the retrofitting of trains. As for the European Train Control System (ETCS), a compulsory system is planned for all Member States that must be implemented on European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) lines: the introduction of a bonus-malus system for trains equipped with ETCS systems in accordance with common criteria set out by the Commission. The differentiation of charges will be completely revenue neutral for the infrastructure manager. Despite my firm belief that there needs to be separation between infrastructure managers and railway undertakings, we have reached a good compromise on separation that provides for transparency of financial flows between infrastructure managers and railway undertakings in integrated companies, as well as a rendezvous clause for the presentation of a legislative proposal on separation and on the opening of the domestic passenger market by the end of 2012. I would like to remind Members that tomorrow, during the vote, amendments could be tabled. Should any of these amendments that are not part of this document receive majority support and be accepted by Parliament, the document would end up in conciliation. This would delay further still the opening of the debate on the fourth railway package. I therefore appeal to my fellow Members to understand the importance of adopting the railway recast tomorrow, so that we may then continue to work on the fourth railway package.

 I congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Ţicău, on her work. Certainly, the installation and use of a tachograph, if used correctly, can be an excellent tool to improve road safety and the working conditions of hauliers, while at the same time satisfying their legitimate needs for privacy. To protect drivers, more stringent rules on driving times and rest times are, of course, necessary. I therefore welcome the new rules that aim to improve tachograph functions, such as the use of wireless communications for roadside checks in order to lower the number of vehicles stopped, as well as the provisions on the training of control officers. With a view to ensuring road safety in the European Union at all possible levels, it is of prime importance to affirm a clear and full principle of co-responsibility, and I therefore consider positive the compromise obtained by the rapporteur whereby the parties concerned must carry out regular checks in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(4) of Regulation (EC) No 561/2006. With regard to the installation of tachographs in all vehicles which are not exempted, I would ask that we bear in mind that the obligations arising from compliance with the procedure must not overwhelm small and medium-sized enterprises with financial burdens and red tape.

 The recasting of Directive 2006/54/EC on the implementation of the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation has led to changes in the sector, but much remains to be done to reduce the gender pay gap. That is why I voted for the report on equal pay for male and female workers for equal work or work of equal value. I believe it is right for the European Commission to put pressure on the national governments to adopt measures aimed at reducing the gender gap and also to provide for sanctions in cases of infringements of the principle of equal pay.

 All consumers are susceptible to becoming vulnerable over the course of their lives, whether as a result of endogenous causes inherent in the person and the person’s cultural, psychological and physical situation, or due to exogenous causes inherent in the objective difficulty of accessing information. Hence, there is a need for greater special protection for vulnerable consumers that takes their individual requirements into account. Disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility require particular attention, especially as regards transport, and passengers’ rights must be improved by ensuring that information and fares are transparent when a ticket is purchased.

 Today’s vote on the progress made by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia takes into account the difficult challenges that the country has faced. Even if much remains to be done, I am pleased with the progress achieved in the social sphere and in the fight against corruption, when you consider that the country has moved up 40 places in the Transparency International anti-corruption index over the last five years. However, the recent serious episodes of violence are a matter for concern, and are the worst since 2001 when the country was on the brink of civil war between the Albanian Muslim minority and the Macedonian Orthodox Christian majority. In accordance with the 2011 progress report, I deplore the risk that the forms of power sharing could institutionalise the ethnic minorities and transform the country into a two-nation state, putting democratic principles at risk. I hope that the freedoms and fundamental rights established under the rule of law will be respected. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of piracy is not a new one here, and was dealt with by this Parliament in the 2009 resolution. Everyone is aware of the events involving two Italian soldiers, who were arrested for causing the death of two Indian fishermen. In this regard, I welcome the assurances of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Baroness Ashton, who has said she has been monitoring the case closely in order to bring it to a positive conclusion, and that the incident should be put, to quote her words, ‘into the broader context of international cooperation on counter-piracy and, more specifically, on the issue of regulating the protection aboard ships’. However, the episode forces us to reflect on the fact that the phenomenon of piracy in the Indian Ocean or off the Somali coastline is still an extremely serious problem. As part of its defence and security policy, the EU launched the Atalanta mission in December 2008 and, in the last few days, its extension to 2014 was approved, but the number of ships involved has fallen dramatically, from 35 in 2009 to 10 in 2011. As we know, the EU intends to exercise greater coordination over the naval forces and military personnel on board civilian ships belonging to Member States patrolling the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean. Do we therefore feel that it is useful to establish common rules of engagement? Generally speaking, what other coordinated initiatives does the EU plan to adopt to protect merchant ships from attacks by pirates? In addition, what measures does it intend to take against third countries that fail to safeguard merchant ships crossing between the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean?

 I voted in favour of Mr Schmidt’s annual tax report, which calls on the Commission to make proposals that will contribute to European competitiveness by eliminating distortions of competition which arise from the various taxation systems still in place. In terms of cross-border issues, the differences in the tax ‘excises’ on a number of products, such as fuel, drinks and cigarettes, can easily create cross-border competition distortions. The current economic and financial crisis has led to a significant rise in public debt in Europe, the reduction of which requires both expenditure restraint and tax increases, as well as streamlining of tax systems. Accordingly, we need to adopt measures that can make the national tax systems more favourable to common growth, ensuring that tax differences do not give business in one country an undue advantage over competitors in other countries.

The White Paper on Transport aims to improve the quality of transport in Europe. Mobility plays a key role in the internal market as it is a prerequisite for development and economic growth. While, on the one hand, the challenge is to develop sustainable transport, on the other, we must aim to build an efficient intermodal transportation network. Much remains to be done to ensure that the transport system is truly competitive in all areas and there are many issues and difficulties, especially in the road transport sector, which, in some countries, is one of the cornerstones of production and the economy. In this regard, I would like to see the creation of an authority responsible for road transport, which would be able to promote the harmonisation of Member States in this regard: for example, with respect to environmental sustainability, safety, training and professional certification, and which would supervise the process of liberalisation and resolve the challenges of the sector, in a manner similar to what is to be done in the railway sector.

 I voted in favour of the report on modernising customs because I think we need to simplify customs legislation in order to improve and influence competitiveness. Customs play an essential role in ensuring efficient safety checks and contributing, above all, to the fight against fraud. This, however, requires efficient IT systems so as to ensure product safety and to block the sale of less safe products. However, I did vote against the parts referring to non-preferential origin of goods, not because I do not support the principle, but because I think the reference to the definition of the product origin should not be in this report, which aims to establish criteria for improving customs competitiveness.

 I have voted in favour of this report which seeks to lay the groundwork for future debate on the reform proposal that the Commission is due to present in December, and that aims to simplify the process of working abroad for doctors, engineers, dentists and other professionals. If, on the one hand, professional qualifications should be recognised quickly by other Member States, on the other hand, the reliability and safety of their services should not be compromised. To this end, one notes that the professional qualifications of tour guides could cease to be recognised as, following the revision of Directive 2005/36/EC, their profession would be confused with that of travel couriers or tour representatives who would be able to conduct guided tours in all 27 Member States.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before beginning with a brief description of my report, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs who worked with me on the revision of the railway recast. I would particularly like to thank Mr Kuhn, Mr Tremosa i Balcells, Mr Zīle, Mr Cramer and Ms Wils. I would also like to thank the Chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Brian Simpson, the parliamentary group coordinators and all of my colleagues for the extensive debate we have had on a report that was particularly complex but also, I believe, important for the implementation of the railway system. It is a recast of the first railway package, which has not been correctly applied since its entry into force, and, in fact, 13 infringement procedures against Member States relating to implementation of the first railway package are currently under way. The objective of the railway recast is to achieve a single European railway market. It is an ambitious objective because the rail system is the most outdated transport system, which has not managed to catch up with other modes of transport. For example, the average percentage for rail freight in European countries is stationary at around 6-7%, while only 11-12% of passengers travel by rail. Therefore, it is clear that rules need to be harmonised, and that new systems and new elements need to be added and strengthened to ensure that railways can develop properly, particularly where they cross borders, which is the most problematic part for European integration. The creation of a single European market is therefore necessary, just as it was for the air transport sector. The creation of a single market will mean that citizens can use trains that can run throughout Europe, with better fares and a service on a par with that of other modes of transport. Currently, few trains can travel outside national borders. Now the aim is that they can compete with each other throughout the whole of Europe, something which – as I have said – is not the case today. The objectives which the first railway package attempted to deliver are therefore the aim of this recast and of all the measures for unification of the rail system that will follow. This means that, starting with the railway recast, some rules need to be revised. One of the most important points that we have discussed at length, and which I believe is also the key product of the railway recast, is the provision of a national regulatory body, a network of national regulatory bodies with clear responsibilities, a strong national regulatory body with resources like the energy regulator, which could – as many hope – allow us to have a single European regulatory body in the future. We have tried to provide clear rules for transparency and separation of the accounts of the infrastructure manager and the services manager, by prohibiting cross transfers between the network and the services manager as happens in the case of many holding companies, for example. We have tried to maintain the separation of accounts that has been in force since 1991, according to which public funds for infrastructures must be used solely to improve infrastructure and not to finance the business of transport companies, also because these subsidies prevent fair competition between all the service operators. As rapporteur I would have liked the railway package to be more ambitious. I would also have liked there to be a total separation between infrastructure and service operators. However, we have been given a commitment by the Commission that this will be put in place by 31 December 2012. Other important provisions concern ease of access to infrastructures, which is essential in order to guarantee that all new operators can use network services, and in addition to total separation, the Commission has made a commitment to present a proposal for national market liberalisation by 31 December 2012. We have also included benefits for operators that introduce significant technological innovations to reduce environmental impact, and we have included the possibility of an improvement in the sector by allowing 7-year instead of 5-year strategic plans as previously. Finally, we wanted to guarantee compliance with laws governing employment rights and safety in the workplace, and to maintain the right to strike. Debora Serracchiani,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is true, as my colleagues who have already spoken have said, that this proposal for a directive has been a very complex task, involving 724 amendments leading to 18 compromise texts. These compromise texts include Article 7, mentioned by the Commissioner, in which Parliament invites the Commission to make a proposal for national market separation and liberalisation by 31 December 2012. None of the proposals are in any way premature – instead, there is a clear invitation with an equally clear and precise direction. If this direction had been present from the start, it would probably have helped with the management of this extremely long railway recast. In the meantime, my assistant has had a baby, so this really has been a long and complicated gestation period, but I am sure that we understand the importance of expanding the railway system. We have said that we need a competitive railway system. In that case, we need to have rules. We do not necessarily need many rules, but they have to be clear, and to be complied with by everyone. We know that there is a problem of free competition on the railway market, particularly with regard to freight transport. The ambition of the railway recast is to create the single European market. Therefore, we are issuing a strong invitation to the Commission to make a clear proposal before the end of next year and, given that next year is so close, we propose that work should begin so that Parliament can fulfil its own legislative role, also because the text very recently issued by the Council is extremely cautious, including with regard to the proposals. Therefore, we hope that Parliament will give us a clear and full mandate to carry out a complete negotiation process that will truly open up the single European market to all the expectations to which – I am picking up on the shout of pain from Mr Cancian – we must provide a response.

I voted in favour of the report by Mr Kósa, which highlighted the physical and social obstacles that unfortunately still exist in many Member States and that restrict the lives of 80 million disabled people living all over Europe. To date, however, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has not yet been ratified by all the EU countries. Out of 27 Member States, 11 still have to sign, and even where ratified, implementation is still deficient precisely in accessibility to spaces and buildings. According to the EU 2020 strategy, one of the most important objectives is to increase the rate of employment. This requires removing all the barriers that hinder the access of disabled people to the labour market and developing national policies in line with the European Commission’s European Disability Strategy, including simple access to public and private transport. Social inclusion and employment must also play a bigger part in strategies and in European funding. Finally, I agree with the rapporteur on the need for a European mobility card for reciprocal recognition of care for people with disabilities, which would guarantee travel on any means of transport for all.

I voted in favour of the report on road safety by Mr Koch because I think that this issue has an important role to play considering that around 55% of fatal accidents happen on rural roads, 36% in urban areas and 6% on motorways. Over the last three years, road accidents in the capital cities of the European Union have caused an average of 1 845 deaths each year. Many of these victims are pedestrians, cyclists, elderly people and children. In order to reduce the number of deaths caused by road accidents, common and harmonised restrictive measures are needed across Europe, including the creation of safe road-traffic infrastructure, respect for driving and rest periods, and the establishment of safe parking areas for lorry drivers which are in line with the minimum social standards. I support the creation of the office of the European road safety coordinator by 2014, with particular responsibility for opening an investigation on the effectiveness of road safety policies in large and medium-sized urban areas and on the necessary elements for once again making travel safe for all citizens.

 I would like to thank Mr Fidanza for his constructive work. Tourism has enormous potential for achieving certain important EU objectives, such as sustainable development, economic growth and employment, as well as socio-economic cohesion. In recent years, growth in employment in the tourism industry has been considerably higher than in other areas. Indeed, the EU tourism sector generates more than 4% of GDP, with around 2 million businesses providing work for approximately 4% of the total workforce: around 8 million jobs. Therefore there is a clear need to support the sector, including by improving training and recognition of professional qualifications. At European level, the Union must put in place an integrated strategy with clear, high-level objectives, with effective, targeted measures that promote innovation and improve the quality of tourist services, providing, for example, ever greater accessibility for persons with reduced mobility. I support the creation of a European quality label and the idea of diversifying tourism through the promotion of culture, history and religion, and I would stress the importance of promoting tourism by giving due importance to Europeans who have spread European culture beyond this continent.

 In recent years, many businesses have been encouraged to invest in Libya. The serious instability and the political and institutional crisis that has affected several countries in North Africa, especially Egypt, Libya and Tunisia, have forced many European businesses to abandon Libya, leaving behind moneys owed to them, equipment, and so on. Council Regulation (EU) No 204/2011 of 2 March 2011 concerning restrictive measures in view of the situation in Libya, establishes that funds may only be used for humanitarian purposes and not to pay monies owed or damages suffered by businesses/companies that had been operating in Libya. As a result many European enterprises, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, are struggling to collect monies owed for the provision of goods and services in Libya. While on the one hand Europe must guarantee support to the Libyan people and contribute to the country’s reconstruction, on the other I believe that it must ensure that European companies do not suffer serious, irreversible damage due to a loss of liquidity resulting from uncollected moneys, and therefore it must guarantee their survival.

 Madam President, the new Hungarian constitution limits the possibility of intervention by supervisory bodies such as the constitutional court, and increases the powers of the executive, thereby bringing into question the normal system of checks and balances. Social rights have been negated, the state only providing subsidies to the needy if they agree to do community work. Finally, the right to self-defence has been sanctioned and weapons may be kept in the home even without a licence. The right to abortion has been banned and highly discriminatory laws against homosexuals have been introduced. All of this goes against Directive 2000/78/EC, which establishes a general framework for the fight against discrimination. I therefore ask the Commissioner what action she intends to take, in view of the fact that the fundamental rights in the new Hungarian constitution are hardly compatible with those of the European Union and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.

I thank the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, for his excellent report, which fits in with the recent debate on the implementation of the Schengen Agreement. The existence of effective controls along our external borders must be an important factor inasmuch as the security of the Schengen area depends on the efficiency with which each Member State controls its external borders. Although some problems remain unresolved, Romania and Bulgaria have proved to be sufficiently prepared to apply all the requirements of the Schengen acquis. We have discussed at length the practical efficacy of the state machinery of these two countries, as well as their levels of corruption; nevertheless, I believe that the application of Schengen should leave this out of consideration, given that – just as happened with the other Member States – it is sufficient to base a decision only on the efficiency of border controls and the preparation of police forces. Adding further requirements would create a precedent of discrimination which has not existed before, not even after the great enlargement in 2007. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 The arrival of streams of immigrants to Lampedusa in recent days shows that the immigration crisis is an ongoing issue that requires immediate action. We clearly need improved governance within the Schengen area, as established by the Commission Communication of 4 May. To this end, the solidarity mechanims must be strengthened in terms of redistribution of asylum seekers, organised mobility and new partnerships with third countries. Revising the mechanisms for applying the Schengen acquis
 must not be seen as an excuse to limit at will the right to free movement, but rather as a stimulus for new opportunities. I hope that concrete proposals will be made very soon to combat prejudice and discrimination, to combat lawlessness and to promote human rights, human dignity and peace. Governing immigration effectively and encouraging peaceful coexistence must be the daily commitment of a good policy that aims to promote development and security. Returning the massive flows of people to their countries of origin does not help maintain the distance between Europeans and immigrants. If anything, it risks increasing illegality, insecurity and economic costs. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 The nuclear accident at the Fukushima power station has caused an enormous disaster, with the radioactive contamination also affecting many people who were in the vicinity of the power station and who suffered injuries. Many hospitals are refusing to admit and treat them due to the risk of contamination. Although the Japanese Prime Minister has announced that the Fukushima power station will be decommissioned, the situation remains unresolved: the cooling system for one of the reactors is out of use and a considerable amount of radioactivity is being released into the environment. In the light of this, it is important to ensure that all the necessary humanitarian and financial aid is provided and to lay down international safety rules that are as reliable as possible, in order to prevent other disasters like that in Japan in the future. For this reason, I voted against the resolution, because it omitted the amendments calling upon the Member States to draw up possible strategies for abandoning nuclear power and immediately to inform regional and local cross-border authorities of their national programmes if their implementation could have a cross-border effect.

 Following the earthquake on 11 March, the consequences of the crisis in Japan for nuclear safety and the global economy have shaken the European Union, which is already grappling with instability in North Africa. I welcome the decisions taken at the special meeting of energy ministers, held in order to examine the implications of the accident at the plant in Fukushima, and trust in the determination of Member States to carry out stress testing of nuclear power plants in the European Union to be extended to non-European countries, and especially neighbouring countries. In this context, and giving due importance to the nuclear moratorium decision taken by some Member States, and the fact that public consultations on energy development are imminent, it is important that the Commission should report on the safety situation in European nuclear power plants that could affect neighbouring regions of Member States if an incident occurred.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the resolution on Turkey because the constitutional reform that took place 12 September last was unanimously recognised as an important step forward made by Turkey in relation to Europe. Naturally, there are still many more steps to be taken and in this vein, I would express my concern over the numerous arrests of journalists. I would like to underline that Turkey is the seventh largest commercial partner of the European Union, that the European Union is Turkey’s main commercial partner, and that trade – which has been carried out correctly for centuries – has favoured interpenetration and the peaceful acquaintance of one people with another. I therefore applaud the notable progress made in terms of getting started on connections between the European Union and Turkey, in particular, through the motorways of the sea that cross the northern Adriatic and the northern Tyrrhenian seas, which now see a flow of more than 250 000 truckloads per year in both directions, together with an important heavy-goods railway freight link from ports to destinations within Europe. In this way, it was possible to get rid of a significant amount of heavy goods vehicles on the road and I hope that this continues. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the reports on equality between women and men and female poverty in Europe and I am delighted that this has been debated on the very day that we celebrate the hundredth anniversary of International Women’s Day. Notwithstanding Directive 2002/73/EC on equal treatment between men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training, promotion and working conditions, further efforts still need to be made to achieve proper transposition. Suffice it to say that, although the level of female education has increased significantly in recent years and the number of female graduates is now higher than that of male graduates, women remain concentrated in traditionally female sectors and are frequently paid less and occupy fewer positions of responsibility in all spheres of society. The lack of access to support services for their dependents, such as children, the disabled and the elderly, to adequate leave schemes and to flexible working arrangements, all impede women from working. I would like to close by remembering the women of the world who are fighting for the most basic of rights and I would like this House to express its solidarity with the Iranian feminist associations that are today taking to the streets, inviting women to demonstrate without the hijab

 We hope that Croatia makes fast progress in the negotiations for EU membership. Speeding up Croatia’s accession is crucial if one considers its strategic geopolitical position as a gateway to markets in Central Europe. Hence the need for an integrated development of ports and connections to the European corridors, especially in view of the fact that Croatia will enjoy a significant flow of EU funding, of which 60% will be allocated to infrastructure. For this to happen, Croatia should continue to adopt the necessary reforms. In particular, it should strengthen public administration and the judiciary, fight corruption and ensure full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. I welcome the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Croatia on the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction. I am disappointed about the situation of the Croatian shipbuilding industry, a sector that was once the pearl of Yugoslav industrial exports, but which is now in almost total ruin. I hope that the Croatian Government is able conclude the restructuring process as soon as possible so that it can also close the chapter on competition. In particular, I emphasise the importance of the accession of Croatia in relation to the integrated maritime policy in the Adriatic, which will soon officially be an almost completely European sea.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, should like to thank Mr Cancian for his efforts in obtaining this difficult compromise. Thanks to this regulation, bus and coach passengers can enjoy rights similar to those of passengers on other modes of transport, such as trains and boats. The regulation, which applies to all national and international services wherever the distance to be covered is equal to or greater than 250 km, also protects passengers using regular services over shorter distances. I am referring, in particular, to disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility, who have been guaranteed non-discriminatory access to transport, the right to compensation in the event of loss of or damage to wheelchairs, as well as training on disabilities for bus and coach employees. I am also delighted that an agreement has been reached on compensation for death, including reasonable funeral expenses, or personal injury, and loss of or damage to luggage due to accidents. I also consider it a positive step that passengers can choose between continuing the journey at no additional cost or reimbursement of the ticket price in case of cancellation, a delay of more than two hours, or overbooking. In terms of information for passengers, I think it would have been useful to provide them with information on connections with other means of transport, thereby also ensuring dialogue between bus and rail passenger transport services. Lastly, I am very pleased that during negotiations, we managed to research and guarantee the maximum level of assistance for disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility, giving them the option of being accompanied at no extra cost.

Today’s vote on the EU-Libya Framework Agreement is the result of some tough negotiations, particularly on the issue of migrants. In Libya, the situation regarding human rights for refugees and asylum seekers is extremely dangerous. They have no legal recognition and there is no system in place to protect them. I hope that their fundamental human rights will be safeguarded, along with their right to asylum. Libya has not ratified the Geneva Convention of 28 July 1951 or the Protocol of 1967 relating to the Status of Refugees, and at the moment, does not intend to do so. However, in 1981, it did ratify the 1969 Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa. It is therefore bound to comply with the principle of non-refoulement of migrants requiring international protection, who must be identified in accordance with criteria that are no less strict than those established by the Geneva Convention itself. Under international law, people from countries such as Somalia, Sudan, Eritrea and Ethiopia have the right to humanitarian protection and political asylum, and I hope that the Libyan authorities will agree to cooperate with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

 We should not be shy or reticent about the European Union’s duty to uphold the freedom to profess one’s religion. In view of the undeniable exacerbation of violence against Christians in various parts of the world, the EU urgently needs to take a clear stance against any violation of the right to the freedom to profess one’s religious faith. The subject of religious freedom must be integrated in European policies, not least by including a binding clause on respect for religious freedom in our agreements with other countries. These principles are Europe’s banner, and we cannot make exceptions to them under any circumstances. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

The initiative is an instrument that allows citizens to call on the European Commission to submit a legislative proposal on any issue that they consider to be in their interest by submitting 1 million signatures, which represent 0.2% of the population of the European Union. Issues relating to the environment, social matters and disasters caused by the financial crisis are among the most sensitive topics that may mobilise citizens to call on the EU to legislate on these matters.

Every year in Europe, hundreds of thousands of people are sold as if they were objects and, fortunately, today we feel an ever-increasing need to protect the victims of trafficking in human beings from the use of false documents, from prostitution and from immigration. When we speak about trafficking in human beings, we must think about not only sexual exploitation, forced labour and illegal adoptions, but also the problem of trafficking in organs, which is becoming an increasingly widespread crime. The European legal structure is not effective enough and the European Union and Member States must do more. We need an established structure for coordination between the institutions and the agencies of the EU, as well as those of the Member States and international partners. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, to date, access to employment has been regulated only for a few specific categories of third-country nationals. Indeed, not everyone benefits from the general principle of equality of treatment in access to employment. As a result, the European Union must take steps to guarantee equal treatment both for third-country nationals legally residing in a Member State and for those who qualify for refugee status or who require international protection, pursuant to Council Directive 2004/83 of 29 April 2004. We need to prevent a growth in demand, for example, for seasonal workers, just because they can be paid less and because they have different – lower – costs with respect to European citizens employed to do the same job. We must also avoid, for example, the risk of many multinational companies transferring their headquarters to countries such as Morocco or Turkey and sending their employees to work in European branches because it is cheaper. For reasons of social justice, we must ensure that European citizens are treated equally in terms of remuneration, working conditions and social security. For this reason, I believe that it is right to include seasonal workers, posted workers, refugees and self-employed workers in this directive. It would be extremely dangerous to make distinctions.

The latest violent events linked to the dispute between Morocco and the Polisario Front over the Western Sahara require greater attention due to the negative effects they could have on stability in the region. The clearing of the camp at Laâyoune seems to have resulted in about a dozen deaths, more than 700 wounded, 150 missing and 160 arrested by the Moroccan authorities and is believed to have led to the killing of a Spanish citizen of Sahrawi origins, Baby Hamday Buyema. We must not leave the Sahrawi people all alone, but we need to finish off the negotiations conducted under the aegis of the United Nations, in accordance with the principles of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, particularly Article 2. The European Union must intervene and urge the Moroccan Government to avoid further bloodshed and release those Sahrawi who have been detained illegally. The resumption of informal talks between the parties, which took place on 7 and 8 November 2010, must represent the first sign that a fair solution can been peacefully accepted by the parties.

I would like to express my satisfaction over the importance attributed to matters concerning civil law, such as the legislative proposal on reinforced cooperation in the divorce law sector and the recognition and creation of official public documents on inheritance. I am particularly pleased to see the emphasis placed on the need to introduce specific actions and programmes to promote an effective European judicial culture, based on the supply of training measures, to be held under Erasmus schemes for judges and all legal operators. The actions identified in the plan are very important for improving the guarantees of European citizens in respect of the law, but it is necessary to adopt a more strategic and less fragmentary approach based on the real needs of citizens and enterprises in the exercising of their rights. While, on the one hand, we must consider the difficulties of legislating in a harmonised manner within an area of shared responsibility, on the other, we need to extend EU regulations in the sector of justice and internal affairs. In this way, the parameters of legal certainty will be increasingly clear and supported and we will pave the way for a genuinely common legal theory and practice with a European Union.

 As the exchange of data between the European Union and the United States is increasingly necessary and frequent in the context of the fight against terrorism and organised crime, a general and common legal framework must also be drawn up to protect personal data. This framework must provide for protection equivalent to that enjoyed by European citizens within the Union. The Commission’s negotiating mandate is therefore heading in the right direction. With regard to the sphere of application, this legal framework must also apply to existing bilateral agreements. I hope that the Council adopts the mandate as presented and that Parliament is kept fully and promptly informed of all developments in the negotiations, bearing in mind that Parliament will have the final word on the future agreement.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Mrs Meissner for her report on integrated maritime policy, and I agree with her on the need to strengthen maritime transport and the shipbuilding industry, to safeguard coastal regions and to promote innovation and research activities. Today, maritime transport plays a fundamental role in trade. As a result, we must encourage cooperation between small and large ports that face one another in the same sea basin and which can facilitate more fluid trade. Furthermore, in order to ensure intermodality, we must invest in port and dry port infrastructure, especially in ports that can be connected via European corridors. Lastly, I believe it is important not to overlook another issue, namely port security. All the measures relating to safety within all European ports must be harmonised so as to better protect maritime transport and prevent unfair competition from harming those ports which actually have to incur greater expense in order to guarantee a higher level of safety.

I voted in favour on the indication of the country of origin of certain products imported from third countries. With this vote I wished to emphasise the European Parliament’s commitment to promoting European industry, the competitiveness of which must today be safeguarded and supported. Furthermore, the right for European citizens to know the origin of the products they buy will be guaranteed. However, I do not believe that excluding specialised and recognised production sectors with a long history and tradition, such as the optical industry, is in keeping with EU policy.

 I welcome the proposal for a directive, which represents a decisive step forward in relation to the directive currently in force. Once transposed nationally, regionally and locally, it will appreciably improve payment, particularly by public authorities, to companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, which will be able to count on having a more secure cash flow. In many countries in Europe, when the public authorities are in a difficult situation, they are known to generally pay late and very often cause some companies to go bankrupt. A glaring example is Italy where, by the end of 2009, the public authorities were in debt to companies to the tune of approximately EUR 60 billion, and the payment delay averaged 186 days, with extremes of 800 days. One need only think of the amounts owed to the hotels that took in the survivors of the severe earthquake that hit the Abruzzo region in April 2009. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of this resolution because I believe it is necessary at EU level to have a specific European strategy for the development of mountain and island regions: a strategy that takes account of aspects such as promoting the economy and structures, employment policy, the protection of natural resources, civil defence, and environmental and energy policy. The principle of territorial cohesion is one of the European Union’s key objectives introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon with the aim of reducing regional disparities and removing natural or geographical obstacles. Concrete actions and specific development strategies are needed to do this. It is necessary to create equal opportunities between these regions and the rest of the European Union. One such opportunity might be to promote sustainable tourism in the mountain regions, thus creating an important subsistence base for the inhabitants of these areas. Also, that very Madrid declaration by European ministers on 15 April 2010 stresses a more effective coordination of the measures implemented with regard to tourism policy, and on promotion aimed at more innovative, sustainable and social tourism in Europe.

Unfortunately, due to the constant increase in air traffic, the number of victims of civil aviation accidents has increased notably. Suffice it to say that in 2005, there were 1 454, an increase of some 90% compared to 2004. We therefore need new legislation which reduces discrepancies in the investigation abilities of the Member States and which creates a ‘network’ between the various national investigation authorities, with the aim of rationalising skills, personnel and resources. Therefore, I am in favour of this proposal for a regulation which, on the one hand, will ensure the absolute independence of investigations into accidents and, on the other, will oblige airline companies to guarantee the rights of victims and their relatives in the event of an accident.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the completion of the internal market in postal services by the end of this year is an important step, but the Commission should carry out an impact assessment – as some of the previous speakers pointed out – on the postal market liberalisation in order to better understand citizens’ requirements. Indeed, how does the Commission intend to safeguard the rights of European citizens who live in hard-to-reach areas, such as mountain or rural areas, so that they may receive post regularly, and what instruments does the Commission intend to adopt to ensure this occurs? Moreover, I do not think that we should use this directive, which already exists, to justify social dumping. It is the Member States which must apply the directive and which possess all the means to do so. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 I voted against the agreement reached at second reading by Parliament with the Council on the draft directive on the use of animals in scientific experiments. I am not saying ‘No’ to the advance of research but I am calling for a reduction in animal suffering, since the revised directive proposes some practices that go against that aim, such as the possibility of experimenting more than once on the same animal. Moreover, I believe the use of other satisfactory scientific methods that do not require the use of animals should be developed further. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 The legal framework on same-sex couples within the European Union is very diverse and radical differences exist between different Member States. Episodes of discrimination against same-sex couples occur virtually on a daily basis, hence the need to ensure respect for Directives 2000/43/EC and 2000/78/EC on combating discrimination based on religion, disability and sexual orientation. The European Union must make more effort to guarantee same-sex couples the same rights granted to heterosexual couples when they move to another Member State in the European Union to study or work, by virtue of the directive on the free movement of European citizens.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal on the rights of passengers travelling by bus and coach aims to aid and protect passengers, in particular, persons with disabilities or reduced mobility. It is the first regulation on the rights of bus and coach passengers and should form a guarantee for such passengers, as in the rail and air transport sectors. The position at second reading aims to establish a series of rights for passengers deciding to travel by bus or coach. I agree with the argument of the rapporteur, Mr Cancian, whom I thank for the excellent work accomplished and I believe that the scope of application of the regulation must be amended, excluding regional services when they are integrated with urban and suburban services. It would be fair and proper to guarantee the rights of passengers in case of accidents, cancellations or delayed departures, as was decided at Parliament’s first reading. Equally important is the question of information on passengers’ rights. Indeed, it would be useful to supply passengers with information on connections with other modes of transport, thereby also ensuring dialogue between bus and rail passenger transport services. Regarding persons with disabilities or reduced mobility, it is necessary to guarantee maximum protection and I would propose a 24-hour advance notice period for requesting assistance as opposed to 48 hours. I would also propose greater guarantees for compensation for and replacement of mobility equipment for people with disabilities in case of loss or damage. Furthermore, bearing in mind the needs of passengers with reduced mobility, all architectural barriers ought to be removed and existing infrastructure improved to render them accessible. This regulation aims to improve the competitiveness of the bus and coach sector and facilitate connections between modes of transport but, above all, it aims to improve the travel conditions of passengers.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteur, Mr Sterckx, who has done excellent work on this report which deals with how to increase free movement in the maritime sector, for shipping within the European Union. I agree with Mr Sterckx on the aim of this directive, which is to exempt all intra-European maritime goods transport from unnecessary administrative formalities. Indeed, in order to have a maritime transport space without barriers, it is not only important for the various competent authorities to work together well, but also for the various simplification systems to be implemented in parallel. This is in order to ensure the effective operation of the European maritime transport space without barriers, to make maritime goods transport more attractive, and to ensure it is used to the optimum extent. Harmonisation of administrative procedures between the Member States will ensure the smoother running of maritime traffic between the various EU ports and will revive maritime goods transport, which today represents only 10% of the total. Maritime transport is, at present, still hampered by the administrative formalities imposed on it. Electronic systems should therefore come into operation as quickly as possible in order to allow a faster data exchange system. Furthermore, interoperability is important for genuine simplification of administration. In fact, sending information by e-mail does no good and is of no use if the information systems are not technically interoperable. With regards to language, I believe that the use of a common language would certainly benefit European maritime transport. This would enable communication to take place more smoothly, and thus cause less confusion and fewer administrative delays. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 The report on the future of transport aims to support and develop an efficient and sustainable transport system in Europe. In order for this to come about, it is necessary that the internal transport market is fully completed and that all obstacles resulting from the late, or lack of, transposition of EU legislation in the Member States are removed. A transport fund will also be necessary in order to guarantee financing of the trans-European transport network projects and the systems to support the network. The TEN-T projects are a priority for transport policy, but the problem of missing infrastructure must be removed, as well as the geographical and historical obstacles of cross-border routes. Lastly, the issue of road safety – among other things – is one of the key points upon which the transport policy should be based in future. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 The development of an efficient and sustainable European transport system requires the revitalisation of rail freight, by means of coordinated action between Member States and cooperation between railway infrastructure managers to develop intermodality, market opening and the management of freight and passenger traffic. The proposal for a regulation aims to improve the rail freight service by means of a procedure for identifying the European corridors that must ensure a high-quality freight service. Freight corridor 5 has already been drafted at ministerial level in 2006, according to the Baltic-Adriatic corridor, pan-European corridor VI and Priority Project 23. It is therefore right to proceed with the commitments we have undertaken and pursue our established objectives; a point returned to several times during the TEN-T conference in Zaragoza.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteur for his excellent work on the European Union membership of the Human Rights Convention, which benefits European citizens: due to this convention, there will be a new court, external to the European Union, to ensure that the rights of European citizens are always respected by the European Union and Member States. Under the principle of democracy, the European Union and its Member States should always have the right to be able to defend themselves. I therefore believe it is crucial that every nation belonging to the convention should have a judge to explain the context of every appeal, just as I think it important that the European Parliament should have an informal body to coordinate information exchanges between Parliament and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council, and that Parliament should also be consulted during the negotiation process. I would also like to add that European citizens have the right to understand the mechanisms governing this membership, just as they have the right to know what their rights are. Therefore, I believe it is essential for the Council of Europe and the European Union to consider establishing guidelines, with a clear explanation of all the effects and implications that membership will entail.

 The affair of the Icelandic volcano and its current consequences lead us to reflect that the European Union must not be unprepared for an emergency or unexpected occurrences, but must protect passengers above all else using existing or new management instruments or measures.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr Leichtfried for his excellent work on the report on aviation security charges, which considers, among its various aspects, one important point: consumer protection and passengers’ rights. There have to be clear and transparent rules because, if airlines charge passengers extra for security measures, this information should be made available, in my view, to ensure that passengers are not out of pocket. I believe that it is only right that consumer protection organisations should take part in the consultations and thus gain an insight into the pricing of security measures, which they can then check against the ticket price. Only in this way will it be possible to guarantee greater transparency and information for passengers. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the recent rail accident in Brussels, which many Members have mentioned, the spotlight has once again been on the safety of the railways. Directive 2004/49/EC on safety of the railways in general stipulates that railway undertakings and infrastructure managers should bear the full responsibility for the safety of the system, each for their own part. In the specific case of the accident that occurred in Belgium, human error seems to have been the cause. We shall, of course, await the investigations. It would appear, however, that the train was not fitted with an automatic braking system. Is the Commission aware of which networks and which trains within the Member States are not fitted with this safety device? Moreover, does it intend to draft a legislative proposal so as to ensure that the Union’s entire network is fitted with this system? Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Croatia’s membership of the European Union accentuates the gelling of a European identity that is able to express the common values of our new Europe while incorporating, rather than glossing over, the individualities of its many occupants. The Republic of Croatia has made appreciable efforts to come up to the required standards, particularly in combating organised crime through new anti-mafia measures, but it needs to make further efforts, particularly in the judicial field, before the 2010 negotiations can conclude. The institutions of the Republic of Croatia can make further steps forward to come into line with the requirements of the first protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights, signed in Paris in 1952, by considering the return of nationalised assets to their rightful owners.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is committed to combating all forms of terrorism. When we speak of tackling terrorist offences, we need to ensure that fundamental rights are fully upheld and that the measures adopted to fight terrorism are suitable and effective. The rights of defence and fundamental procedural safeguards must therefore be fully complied with by the EU institutions, including when they draw up lists of individuals and bodies, in this case linked to al-Qaeda, that are subject to restrictive measures. It is equally essential that these measures are subject to proper democratic and parliamentary scrutiny, as rightly required by the Treaty of Lisbon. It is therefore clear, as also affirmed by Parliament’s legal service, that each measure of this kind must follow the ordinary legislative procedure, enabling the representatives of Europe’s citizens to fully perform their roles as legislators and guarantors.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur of one of the dossiers on Europol, I can only reassert what has already been said by the Members who have spoken before me. Thanks to its role in the collection, analysis and exchange of information, Europol facilitates investigations in Member States and has thus become an important tool in the fight against crime. We need to be more effective in tackling crime, but at the same time, we must resolutely assert the authority of this Parliament. The Council has decided that it will, in any case, adopt the texts of the Europol package on 30 November, without waiting for Parliament to obtain the power of codecision on this matter with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December. The aim of rejecting the proposals is not to stand in the way of Europol assuming its new role as a European body, but to have the powers of this Parliament, the European Parliament, extended, especially on important matters relating to freedom, security and justice. Finally, I think that it is right to give Parliament greater powers of scrutiny over Europol’s activities in order to check that the handling of data held by Europol does not undermine the rights of European citizens.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am aware that, on 30 September, the Commission presented a study on the indicators of media pluralism in the Member States. However, in 2008, this House adopted a report by Marianne Mikko in which the European Commission and the Member States were asked to safeguard, and I quote verbatim, ‘the multiplicity of opinions in the media, to guarantee the pluralism of information, to ensure that all EU citizens can access free and diversified media’. Even earlier, in 2004, Parliament adopted a report by Mrs Boogerd-Quaak on the risks of violation, in the EU, of freedom of expression and information. In this report, the Commission was asked to submit a communication on the safeguarding of media pluralism in all the Member States. To date, the Commission has still not given clear responses to Parliament’s requests. You will notice, Commissioner, that I have mentioned neither my country nor its Prime Minister. However, I, as a European citizen, am asking you in this House what the Commission intends to do at European level to ensure that media pluralism is guaranteed in all the Member States.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the motion under debate today sees the full implementation of the agreement that the budgetary authorities concluded in December on the 2012 portion of financing for the ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) research project. The ITER project, which involves the European Union as well as major countries such as Japan, the United States and China, requires a further EUR 650 million in appropriations and therefore the expenditure ceiling set out in Heading 1a of the financial perspectives needs to be revised by the same amount. Through this motion we therefore give the green light to this EUR 650 million increase in commitment appropriations. The agreement on which this important aspect of the 2012 budget is based has been a crucial aspect of these budget negotiations. In fact I would say that it has been a fundamental condition for the 2012 budget conciliation to reach a positive outcome and for the negotiations to conclude. It has allowed us to substantially increase the funds in 2012 for important programmes such as Lifelong Learning, Competitiveness and Innovation, the Seventh Research Programme, and especially for allowing us to fund ITER using transfers as little as possible. That was very important, representing a positive outcome that allowed this House to approve the agreement. ITER is therefore added to the 2012 budget without any negative impact on the implementation of other programmes and without becoming a burden on other programmes; that is a very significant fact. Furthermore, this agreement and this motion marks the real beginning of the sensitive matter of implementing the 2012 budget. Even through we focus all our attention on the negotiations for concluding the draft budget, there is then the important step of putting it into action, which starts with this step and will see us take particular care over the sensitive matter of payments. My hope is that, during the implementation of the 2012 budget, we will be able to re-locate the hitherto excellent spirit of cooperation between the Commission and Parliament in particular, which was crucial for finalising the budget and will be even more important for supporting its implementation.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank all my fellow Members for their substantial support for the report we are discussing today. I would like to emphasise that, predictably, during the debate we quite naturally looked into the substance of the ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) project. However I want to point out that today we are really giving life to the agreement signed in December, which enabled us to wind up the negotiations over the 2012 budget. We are therefore implementing an agreement reached in conciliation, which not only saw us finalise the budget conciliation but saw us finalise it in the best way possible, in view of all the negotiations we carried out last year, so that this important instrument is funded using transfers as little as possible. This is truly an important achievement, because we will not harm the other programmes financed out of the budget. To me, that seems to be the outcome that we should prize most highly. Above all, it gives me particular pleasure to point out that the conciliation process was the final step in negotiations that we managed to conduct with enormous cooperation and collaboration. Long may it continue. Francesca Balzani,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 18 November, Parliament and the Council reached a common position on the budget three days ahead of the conciliation deadline. This is a good sign: at a time of great uncertainty and difficulty, it means that the European institutions want to look to the future first; it is also a decision to shoulder their responsibilities. From the start, Parliament has put the EU 2020 strategy, the major crisis-prevention strategy for future growth and wellbeing, at the centre of the budget. Drafting a budget is no easy task for anyone today, not even for Europe, but Parliament made a choice, which was fully accepted during the conciliation. Thus, we have more resources for growth, research, employment, lifelong learning, immigration policies and international policies in Europe. Payments, however, fared badly in the conciliation. They fared badly, which is nothing new. Indeed, it is unfortunately the case that there is strong disagreement – clear and ongoing disagreement – over the issue of payments between Parliament and the Commission on one side, and the Council on the other. Disagreement that will have to be solved, that will have to be overcome, because this is a situation that we clearly cannot tolerate any longer. Unfortunately, however, conciliation is not the ideal forum in which to open discussions, in which to open conciliations, because – and the experience of the past year has clearly taught us this – opening major discussions in the strict and rigorous confines of the conciliation procedure is liable to simply jeopardise the forthcoming budget. The Commission’s faultless projections of funding requirements – and I want to emphasise this point – the Commission’s extremely authoritative and reliable projections, which Parliament endorsed, are thus rendered useless. I hope that this can be resolved. It is clear, in my view, that we will not find a permanent solution to this problem until the European budget is equipped with its own resources. However, what we, as Parliament, certainly can do – in line with the commitment to intervene promptly should payment needs increase during the year, which we signed and attached to the budget – what we certainly can and must do is to strive to ensure that this commitment is honoured and, above all, to work together to ensure that this commitment is not a victim, in terms of its form and schedule, of the next budgetary conciliation, because what we must do – and this is the decision that we made with ITER, that we made this year on the subject of payments – is to refrain from opening conciliations within the conciliation procedure. I should like to thank everyone: all my fellow Members who made an enthusiastic contribution to the drafting of this budget; the Polish Presidency, which played an important role and provided impetus; and especially the Commission, Commissioner Lewandowski, who maintained an exceptional balance throughout the entire delicate conciliation procedure. Then there are the policy advisors from our groups, and finally our assistants, who worked long into the night on this task. Francesca Balzani,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we live in a time of crisis – not only economic crisis but also a crisis of confidence. This crisis of confidence affects all citizens, but especially the youngest, who as a result find it harder to summon the courage and desire to build their own futures. The European Union has set a challenge to tackle this crisis, which is also a challenge for the EU itself: the great Europe 2020 strategy must genuinely combat this lack of confidence and help us back onto the path towards a better future and a better life. That is precisely why Parliament has put funding for this strategy at the heart of the budget for 2012, starting with its very top priority: higher employment, better employment and quality employment in a Europe that focuses on innovation and research. Hence, we in this Parliament have asked and are asking for greater resources for three key programmes, which are the true engines behind the 2020 strategy: the Lifelong Learning Programme, the Seventh Framework Programme and the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP). Today, therefore, what we need is consistency, to follow up on our intentions, to send out a positive message and hence start really building this future. Not funding a strategy to combat the crisis because we are in a crisis would be a gloomy message that would be hard to justify. Right now, our citizens are expecting us to act consistently and with sincerity. However, they are not the only ones watching us: this year the markets are also particularly attentive to our decisions and our ability to take the necessary decisions – in the right ways and in the right timeframes – in order to get back on track. Sending out positive messages is therefore a particularly sensitive issue. In this respect, it would not only be great to produce a budget that makes a genuine start on putting the 2020 strategy in place, but it would also be really important for us to do so in an atmosphere of major institutional collaboration. Parliament decided to place huge trust in the estimates of the Commission precisely in order to send out a positive message. The Commission is undoubtedly working as well as is feasible at this difficult time, which is why Parliament deemed its estimates on payment requirements to be reliable. There is another emergency: the institutional frameworks of many Mediterranean countries are currently undergoing change. Europe cannot remain removed from this process; we cannot stand in the wings but instead we must take a central role in international politics. We therefore need to react to the crisis and assume renewed leadership on the international stage. We request the use of the Flexibility Instrument for these two fundamental objectives. It will therefore be important to overcome these two challenges, instil confidence, prove our credibility and prove our reliability to citizens and the other institutions that are watching us. That is not all though, for I believe that this year there is yet another real challenge ahead: doing it in a transparent way. Indeed, our budget reading is not tactical or a negotiating tool: it is exactly the budget that this Parliament believes is essential for 2012, because I think this year it is also important to find a common position quickly and in good time, in order to communicate the essence, the ability and the image of a Europe that knows how to galvanise itself at the right time.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank all my fellow Members, as well as Mr Lewandowski and Mr Dominik, for this very interesting debate, which has seen a very important issue come to the fore. There is real unity in Parliament on this budget reading and I think this is due to something that has perhaps rarely been seen: Parliament has not limited itself to asking, but has also proposed painful cuts. As a number of my fellow Members have pointed out: on Heading 4 alone – one of the most difficult – Parliament has taken on the responsibility of making almost EUR 90 million of cuts. The motion has therefore been drawn up through effort and hard work, and – I would stress –not to fund Parliament’s priorities but to fund the Union’s priorities, because the Europe 2020 strategy is not a priority for Parliament but rather a priority for the Union. Today we are here to fund it, asking to invoke the Flexibility Instrument for EUR 240 million. We are talking about a total budget of EUR 150 billion, within the financial perspective of 2006, set up before the 2008 crisis, before the Europe 2020 strategy and even before the Treaty of Lisbon came into force. Here, today, we are asking to invoke the Flexibility Instrument for EUR 240 million, to start to fund the EU’s priorities, which we have put on the table as a way to fight the crisis. I therefore hope that our shared vision of the priorities that you have mentioned on a number of occasions, Mr Dominik, can reach its zenith in the conciliation procedure. It is difficult to talk about priorities if you do not want to take that extremely important step of turning written priorities into priorities that are realised, true, real and tangible. The year 2020 is almost upon us: we cannot wait for a new Financial Framework to start funding it and, as many fellow Members have said, it is not only citizens that are waiting to see what we do but also the markets. Therefore, I really hope that in the conciliation procedure we, as a budgetary authority, can find the unity that Parliament has found and I hope we can do so quickly. Francesca Balzani,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I simply have a technical amendment that is required in order to start the vote. In lines 05 04 05 02 and 05 08 06, the amendments BUDG1207 and BUDG1206, as recorded in the meeting reports, do not include the amendments to the amounts. These should be incorporated and adopted so as to correct the amounts in the draft budget. In relation to Amendment 1207, that means an additional EUR 2.5 million and EUR 3 million in commitment and payment appropriations, respectively, for line 05 04 05 02. In relation to Amendment 1206, that means an additional EUR 1 million in commitment and payment appropriations for line 05 08 06. However, the notes that follow particular agency budget lines must be adapted to make them consistent with the definitive amounts decided upon. Francesca Balzani,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the institutions involved in the budget procedure, namely the Commission, the Council and Parliament, described their position in the Council’s reading in July – the Council and Commission with figures, Parliament with a definition of its priorities. These positions are apparently very different, and often far removed from each other – I am thinking in particular of payments and research funding – but there are also points of convergence, and we must concentrate our efforts on these areas of agreement if we are to reach a common position. Parliament has an extremely difficult task, as it must also look to the future and play a proactive role. This is the most challenging area for elected institutions: they must operate with their feet firmly in the present, and hence be acutely aware of the tough times we are experiencing, the consolidation being carried out by Member States and the sacrifices being demanded of our fellow citizens, while always working to ensure investment, economic recovery and a more prosperous future. This year especially, the budget should strike a delicate balance between opposing desires: to maintain the stability of the present, but also to continue to look forward and start laying the foundations for the future straight away. This Parliament will make strong calls for funding for the 2020 strategy, starting with the creation of quality employment, but there are also new areas of responsibility, some of which are sensitive: I am thinking of the new responsibilities granted to us by the Treaty of Lisbon, and of the European Securities and Markets Authority. Then we have the level of payments, which should be correct from the outset, from the time of budget approval, and also undeniable emergencies such as migratory pressures and the situation in North Africa. Consequently, with regard to the documents on priorities, on which we have already voted, we will continue, in a consistent and transparent manner, to develop and create instruments that will enable us to implement our policies.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with the mandate for the trialogue the budget procedure entered its most concrete phase, the phase in which the budgetary authorities actually enter into discussions which may produce useful and significant results. This is why, above all, I hope that this trialogue is an opportunity that will be taken, an opportunity not to be missed. We embarked on the budget procedure in a spirit of great realism. The Member States are currently implementing tough national budgetary consolidation policies, and these policies have to find an important balance between the need to tackle the crisis and the need to relaunch the economy and investment. This is precisely why at this time the European Union budget, which has a great and unique ability to give added value to expenditure, investment and resources, can and absolutely must play a fundamental role. A fundamental role in which it is crucial that the Europe 2020 strategy should be taken as a starting point. This Parliament has made the Europe 2020 strategy a central issue of the budgetary discussions right from the start. The 2012 budget can and must be the first step in taking concrete measures towards this strategy, which is the tool that has been chosen precisely for the relaunch of our Union. In this sense, giving a financial dimension to the Europe 2020 strategy brings into play and gives a central role to our consistency and credibility. We cannot build such an ambitious strategy without implementing it immediately, precisely at a time when it is crucial that this tool for relaunching the economy be made to fully deploy its effects. Consistency, credibility and the ambitious Europe 2020 strategy therefore also become decisive and fundamental in guaranteeing the stability we need today within the European Union, as well as with regard to our single currency. There are also other facts and policies that are coming to the fore. I am thinking of democratic processes in the Mediterranean area and the need to guarantee an external dimension to the European Union, which at this time can truly play a role and resume an important position of leadership for itself. Let us not forget that the budget is not just an instrument to be approved when there has to be a forecast for the following year. It is also a tool that has to function throughout the course of the year. In this sense it is an issue requiring delicate handling not only with regard to the payments for the following year, but also with regard to implementation of the 2011 budget for the current year. Consistency, credibility and strong, decisive, single-minded use of the budget as a fundamental instrument for fighting the crisis and compensating for Member States’ consolidation policies – these are all issues that require a serious commitment on our part, that must truly ensure we once again play a crucial role in the security of the European Union, and above all – and this is my major concern – that invite us not to waste the opportunity of the trialogue. The trialogue can and must truly be a valuable opportunity for a concrete and useful exchange, which this year will bring us to a shared vision of the budgetary choices we need to make. I find that sharing choices when working on a document as important as the budget is another excellent sign of our ability to work within the Union, which is particularly important at this time.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that this very interesting debate, which follows on from the one we had in the special committees, shows that there is a great consensus in this Parliament as regards the fundamental strategies. Among the many others, the most important point is the budget, which is undoubtedly the only and most important tool for constructing the delicate balance between consolidation of the public accounts and the need to support growth. It is the only real bastion we have against the risk that consolidation might depress the European economy in a severe and irreversible way. The budget is therefore a focal tool. The European Parliament is not asking for a generally ambitious budget, but for an instrument that is strong on all the priorities that are today clear and easy to see. In the Europe 2020 strategy, the priority is first and foremost investment in work. Here in the Chamber today we have again mentioned research, development, social cohesion and energy, all priorities for which the budget is the most important indicator of the seriousness of our intentions. The seriousness of our intentions implies our strong institutional credibility. Today this focal budget is therefore a very important element among many, because we have once again drawn attention to the fact that it then becomes a driving force for transforming our commitments into reality, which is no small thing. The budget therefore becomes an important element for restoring stability to the European Union, and also to our single currency. Therefore, I hope that already in this trialogue this strong sense of responsibility that we all share, and it could not have been otherwise, will open the way to calm, responsible and constructive negotiations for the future of our Union. Francesca Balzani,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the document we are examining today is not merely a report on the priorities of the next European budget, but also and above all a strategic document looking at the new role that the European budget must play in the context of greater economic governance. This is the first year of the European Semester, which has been designed precisely to establish the greatest possible coordination between the Union’s budget and those of the Member States, the greatest possible synergy and the utmost complementarity. All of which essentially means one thing: convergence, and making the budgets of the Member States converge with the major goals of the European budget. Today, these objectives – these European objectives – can only be those laid down in the Europe 2020 Strategy: a grand, ambitious strategy with five highly important targets and seven big flagship initiatives. These are big, important goals, but they are also very specific. The first target is extremely important and involves building a more fully, better employed Europe by making the right investments. We therefore have a huge priority for the 2012 budget: we must not waste time in executing the 2020 Strategy, beginning with the first of the targets, that of higher employment in Europe. Immediately setting out the dimension of the 2020 Strategy in our budget is therefore essential and a matter of urgency. Two things are fundamental in order to achieve this: we must plan and we must look to the future. Planning means ruling out mathematical approaches to the budget, which are absolutely senseless. Mathematical, general and indiscriminate increases are of no use at all. Instead we must look at what exactly are the programmes and the actions that can contribute to the 2020 Strategy. Looking to the future has an absolutely crucial significance: taking the utmost care over our commitments and not simply over our payments, because commitments are the tool with which to build the sustainable financial future of our Union. Flexibility is another important subject. We are at the end of the planning period and so the budget is particularly rigid. I therefore think that it is really important that, right from the start, we consider all the available flexibility instruments as fundamental and indispensable for the budget we are going to draw up if we want it to be not only possible or essential to take the first step towards the 2020 Strategy – which absolutely must not be a failure, as we have seen in the past – but also if we want it to be a useful and effective budget. I am convinced that it will only be possible to reach all these major objectives if we work together patiently, right from the very start, to build a renewed climate of institutional cooperation. Institutional cooperation is one of the major challenges of the Treaty of Lisbon, which we always talk about rather carelessly. Institutional collaboration means really finding a renewed feeling of equality so as to work together on this sensitive issue, the budget, which is not only one of the most strategically important instruments to build our future, but also one of the most tangible and practical. Francesca Balzani,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the word ‘responsibility’ has been mentioned a number of times during the speeches. There is, however, one responsibility that I really think takes priority for the institutions: above all we are responsible for implementing our programmes and ensuring that EU citizens are not left with just our words. We have the responsibility to be consistent in what we say and what we promise. Today’s major projects are those set out in the 2020 Strategy. The first target of ‘more work’ is not only very ambitious but also very precise, since it can even be measured using unemployment reduction parameters. This seems to me to be a very specific and very ambitious goal and I think it is essential to start working to achieve it. As long as we continue to consider the 2020 Strategy as too big and too ambitious to be squeezed into a practical document like the budget, I think we will achieve nothing more than increasing the risk of another failure, which is exactly what nobody wants, starting with the Commission, if I remember the first communication on the 2020 Strategy correctly. There is, however, another important issue: austerity is not a policy, it is not an instrument, it is a condition against which we must take action, and not only by consolidating our expenditure, but also by using the European budget, an extraordinary instrument that is radically different from the national budgets and gives us the chance to do something different this year. This is precisely what the European Semester is for. Clogging up the first six months of the year is not its only use. It enables us to come up with a global strategy and to create synergies; and creating synergies between the budgets of the Member States and our budget is an extraordinarily European system to give more value to public resources and to create a real method to turn the 2020 Strategy – long and ambitious as it is – into a European reality. Francesca Balzani,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament has been called upon to express its opinion on two agreements that have been signed with the United States and with 11 Latin American countries, which will draw a line under a long and difficult affair. This affair has witnessed the European Union challenged at the World Trade Organisation, and more importantly has witnessed it as the losing party. It is a thorny issue, as the disputes relate to the principle of non-discrimination in international trade, which Europe has been accused of breaching in the way in which banana imports are organised within the Union. This is because we have a two-track system in that we apply one system to African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries and a different system to other countries. This system allowed ACP countries to bring this product to the European market without paying any import duty, unlike other countries, which have to pay a duty of EUR 176 per tonne. This agreement therefore brings the situation back into balance and most importantly allows ACP countries, which are in a fragile state of development, to export their products to the EU duty-free. At the same time, the other countries that have signed the agreements will be able to export bananas to the EU subject to the payment of import duties, which however will be gradually reduced over the period 2011–2017 from the current rate of EUR 176 per tonne to EUR 114 per tonne. However, as well as finally bringing the EU back into line with its commitments as a member of the World Trade Organisation and therefore in some ways restoring its credibility, including as an institution, the most important aspect is that these agreements make allowances for ACP countries in a vulnerable state of development, as they provide for instruments to give them financial support. These instruments will allow those countries to invest in diversifying their production and will therefore hopefully strengthen their economies. At present, these measures, worth EUR 190 million, are to be provided until 2013. I believe that these agreements are a positive step, not only because they draw a line under disputes in which the EU has been the losing party, with the ensuing consequences in economic and disciplinary terms and in terms of its institutional credibility as I already mentioned, but also because they lead to a balanced solution that respects the needs both of these ACP countries and of European producers in the outermost regions, who certainly cannot be abandoned to unbridled competition. I therefore propose that Parliament should approve these agreements, whilst asking the Council and Commission for firm commitments. In the first instance, they should provide, as quickly as possible, for an evaluation of the impact that these agreements will have between now and 2020 – quite a long timescale, therefore – on ACP countries and on European producers in the outermost regions, whose economies are closely tied to bananas. Secondly, Parliament should ask for a firm commitment to evaluating the effects of the financial accompanying measures earmarked for the ACP countries eighteen months before they are due to end. This would ensure that those countries could receive further assistance and support measures if necessary, so that they are not left to go it alone and are supported in combating, counteracting and mitigating to some degree any negative consequences that the entry into force of these agreements may have within the European Union due to the price adjustments and hence to changes in the competitiveness of bananas from other countries. I therefore believe that by resolving a tricky issue this agreement definitely provides a way out that also takes into consideration the needs of those weaker countries which, as I have already said, have always been our main concern, including during the long debate we had in the Committee on International Trade. I hope they will find strong support and a favourable solution in these accompanying measures, in particular in terms of monitoring and the commitment, which Parliament is asking of the Commission and Council, to look at the impacts of the agreement and the effects of the aid measures, and to extend and increase them if necessary in the future.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think this debate has been very interesting and has partly restated some of the anxieties and issues which we have already looked at in the Committee on International Trade. I should like to re-emphasise an important fact that I think we lose sight of every now and then. These agreements represent the implementation of a specific commitment made by the European Union, in its role as a member of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). We must not forget this. Through these agreements, the EU is undertaking to resolve a serious problem with important countries, which it is having to sort out because it has breached the principle of non-discrimination. These are therefore agreements that restore our credibility and proper position as members of the WTO. This agreement follows on therefore from disputes and tensions, amid a climate that will certainly have been damaging for other areas of our relationships. As a definitive settlement agreement it is trying and succeeding to create a new balance, with particular attention, as we have said and have also stated in the resolution, to countries in fragile states of development. The accompanying measures will now certainly be monitored, and to my mind this is the most important point. It is important to have established the accompanying measures, but it will be even more important to have the evaluations of their impact and to have the commitment, which I am delighted to have heard today from the Council and the Commission, to keep constant track of the situation as it develops and above all the willingness to assist with further measures if they should prove to be necessary. POSEI (Programme of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity) itself has been incorporated into the resolution as a sensitive point that must be monitored due to the delicate balance between the financial contributions made under POSEI and the new situation regarding the outermost regions. Therefore the impact of the agreements on the outermost EU regions where bananas are produced will also be monitored and watched carefully. The Council also mentioned the need to work on transparency in the agri-food chain, which I am happy about, as it is an important point. We have been talking about producers the whole time, but there is also the major issue of banana distribution within the EU. There are many things that must be done going forward, therefore. We need to monitor the effects of the agreements, the implementation of the accompanying measures and the suitability of POSEI to protect Europe’s producers. We also need to use other instruments such as transparency in the agri-food chain and hence widen the scope of examination to take in the distribution chain as well, which has a major impact on the final cost of the fruit. We need to look at consumer protection, which is something that deserves our attention as much as all the other interests involved in this business. However, all these things, not least consumer protection, must start with the current situation and establishing the outcome of these disputes in which the EU has had to make concessions to the United States and the Latin American countries. I hope therefore that these agreements will be adopted, because I believe they form an essential basis for making the instruments linked to the delicate balance of the banana market work and can guarantee clear practices that will benefit other interests also, such as consumer protection, which is linked to transparency in the agri-food chain. These will in turn bring improvements to the banana market and to our European producers, which are impossible without a sound basis such as that provided by finalising these disputes within the WTO, to which the European Union belongs.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the amending budget we are discussing today and will be voting on in the coming days is an important document. It marks the last step for implementation of the European financial stabilisation mechanism, which was sorely needed in May to calm the severe storm that hit the euro and, therefore, the EU. One certainty came out of that storm: there are no individual Member State problems any more, because the individual problems inevitably become the problems of them all, and so a common response is required. Europe has found the courage and the strength to provide this common response that we are, in fact, discussing here today. This new budget line marks a clear boundary. It is the first step towards a new common approach to the financial policies and also, in the future, to the economic policies of Member States with regard to the European budget. It is the first step towards that integrated semester in which the budget decisions of the individual Member States and the EU budget will be compared more closely. The budget is therefore once again an instrument – which has always been the fundamental implementation of EU policies – that is taking centre stage and proving to be a fundamental vehicle for building Europe after the Treaty of Lisbon as well. Above all, it draws our attention to the importance of sound and responsible management of public resources as a prerequisite for real development and for a future of real European growth.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union and Turkey have strong trade links. The customs union has made it possible for the volume of trade between the European Union and Turkey to reach the significant figure of EUR 100 billion per year. Above all, the geopolitical position of Turkey makes it an important link between the Mediterranean area, the Middle East, Asia, and the Caucasus and Black Sea regions. Turkey is also a country which is at odds with Europe in that it has completely different demographic dynamics, is a young country, and one which first tackled the crisis and the challenging reforms which these dynamics required. So it is a complementary country because it is different to the European Union from many points of view and therefore there is a great degree of reciprocal potential: it is this that we must concentrate on. We must be careful not to waste this potential, but turn it into fruitful investments. It is true that the European Union is an important trading partner, but Turkey is looking ever more to Russia, Africa and the Middle East. Also, the customs union still does not apply to public procurement or services and there are still major obstacles to international trade. We must therefore work to remove the obstacles to this potential – and I believe the report that we are discussing today, and upon which we will vote in the next few days, is moving in this direction – because there are areas in which we must really make this potential grow: energy, the environment, services networks and infrastructure. This report therefore represents an important step and I think the work of Mr Kazak should be supported and I would like to thank him for it. Francesca Balzani,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the mandate for the trilogue is an important action, especially this year, because the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the single reading require as much clarity and as much cooperation as possible between the budgetary institutions from the outset. This budget is going ahead, developing and taking shape at a difficult time. The margins available for commitment appropriations amount to EUR 1 200 000 000 – and so are very narrow – but the matter is made even more sensitive by the fact that 70% of the appropriations come under Heading 2, the heading that covers policies for agriculture, conservation and natural resource management, and hence the fight against climate change. The budget is also difficult because of the many open procedures that will largely determine the quantities of resources that will actually be available. Such procedures include the budget review, financial regulation and the Interinstitutional Agreement, implementation of the External Action Service, but above all the meltdown and the instability of financial markets. The very meltdown that endangered the euro also demonstrated that the budget and resources are crucial to any European response, thus illustrating their importance, but also their limitations. Under these circumstances, the European Parliament must draw a line, and establish which of the priorities should have the highest profile in its main accounting document. As a group, we have chosen to tread a fine line between the need to uphold the purpose of this mandate, and the need not to debase its political meaning. Our central priority is therefore not to repeat our past mistakes, and this means we must guarantee appropriate resources for achieving the objectives of the 2020 strategy, but also keep enough resources for actions under Heading 2, particularly actions that help tackle unemployment. It is also important, however, to ensure that the fight against climate change remains central. There are therefore many challenges to be faced. We also recognised one challenge as central at the beginning of the mandate: the need to make a real effort to coordinate and restore consistency between our European budget and the budgets of individual Member States, because the consistency and coordination of the economic policies of the Union and its States are fundamental values for the future of the Union. Francesca Balzani,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the 2011 budget guidelines are the first step towards the next European budget, a very definite step. In the Committee on Budgets, we have made a great effort to establish the main identifiable priorities that highlight European action. The first priority is young people, not only because they are the resource on which to focus for innovation, research and development, but also because they are the basic starting point for farsighted social policies. However, the 2020 strategy is also a main priority: tackling unemployment, climate change and, above all, the need to genuinely and practically implement this new strategy for the future, allocating sufficient resources to it, without compromises and without cuts. However, these guidelines are also a very realistic first step. There is much less leeway in the financial perspective and this means that there are insufficient resources to carry out what is most important: new actions. This is particularly sensitive with regard to the first heading, the heading on competitiveness, growth and employment. There is, however, another important issue: the budget also needs to be highly flexible and to be able to respond quickly to citizens’ needs, to people’s needs and to changing needs. So there are priorities, but there are also essential conditions in order for the budget to really be a useful instrument to help Europe grow. These include sufficient resources, clear-cut implementation of future strategies, above all, the 2020 strategy, and lastly a definitive solution for a flexible instrument that – alone – can enable us to face future challenges. Francesca Balzani  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when we reach the end of a budgetary procedure and it is possible to assess the work carried out as a whole, I think that we need to ask a very frank, straightforward question: is this a useful budget? This budget is a transitional budget, one marking a shift towards the Europe of Lisbon, a shift within the major economic and financial crisis which has affected the entire world. This budget is therefore awkward in two respects. It needs to respond to the crisis, but reflect awareness that during a crisis, the resources available are scanty. It needs to make a positive contribution to economic recovery, but also cut, reduce and contain spending where possible. This budget will make EUR 141 billion available for next year. That is not much more than was available in 2009, but huge efforts have been made, a great deal of work has been done on the priorities and on channelling the available resources to the current priorities. The focus is on two budget lines: competitiveness and the environment. Competitiveness, because it contains social policies, employment policies and the delicate challenge represented by the Structural Funds, which still constitute the cornerstone of redistributive policies within Europe. This budget line will be allocated about EUR 65 billion for next year. The environment too, which encompasses agricultural policy, will be allocated approximately EUR 60 billion. This 2010 budget, however, relates, above all, to the economic recovery plan. This plan attracted strong support last year, but it was not fully financed in 2009. Today, thanks to significant efforts to redeploy resources, EUR 2.5 billion can at last be invested in energy infrastructure and broadband. Substantial efforts have also been made, however, to shape this budget in accordance with the Lisbon strategy, to provide even more resources than those provided by the Commission in the draft budget for the Erasmus programme, for lifelong learning, because there is a question which we must ask ourselves honestly, namely, whether this is a useful budget, but, first and foremost we have a fundamental yardstick: the usefulness of the budget must be tailored to Europe’s citizens. It must be a useful budget for every constituent citizen of Europe, and it is on the basis of this usefulness, tailored to the people, that I believe we must initiate and continue a sensitive debate on the review of the margins of availability and the resources that we wish to give to Europe for its policies. Francesca Balzani,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is precisely on the budget that Parliament can and should bring to bear all of its power as an institution directly elected by the citizens, in order to ensure that this vital instrument for growth, and also for fairness and justice, is fully able to meet citizens’ needs. The budget must have the ability to be tangible and dynamic, to listen and to respond. We have worked towards making the 2010 draft budget as flexible as possible at this time of particular economic and financial crisis. However, the budget must also be credible, feasible and tangible, and in this regard, it was fundamental to avoid making financial resources for the coming years too inflexible by restricting excessive spending beyond the maximum expenditure ceiling contained in the perspectives of the multiannual financial framework just to cases that really are an absolute priority. This is the case with the Recovery Plan. Again with the same aim, namely establishing a budget truly able to meet citizens’ needs, we have formulated specific amendments regarding payments in order to free up the maximum amount of resources possible with immediate effect. The European budget is structured on two tracks: commitments and payments. The commitments represent serious political intentions, but also real, concrete actions. Therefore, payments have been increased to EUR 127 billion in line with the draft budget tabled by the Committee on Budgets, compared with EUR 120 billion proposed by the Council and EUR 122 billion proposed by the Commission. Still with the same aim, with the same political approach, as a group we are strongly opposed to the creation of reserves, which are not genuine resources immediately available to citizens. The policy of establishing reserves at times of crisis should be reduced to the absolute minimum, to cases in which a reserve really is technically indispensable. In times of crisis, there is no point merely writing figures in the budget, but instead we should build a useful budget, immediately ready for action. Other matters also deserve special attention. As a group, we have taken the important responsibility of re-tabling the amendment to increase the milk fund to EUR 600 million, as decided by a unanimous vote of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and therefore with the participation of all the Members and groups, and also re-tabling an amendment for a microcredit project amounting to EUR 37 million which, and this is extremely important, does not jeopardise the implementation of other programmes under heading 2. There is a particular risk at times of crisis: that budget resources will not actually be increased, but transferred from one budget line to another. It is to counter this risk that Parliament, as a directly elected institution, with a role different to that of the Council and the Commission, must be especially careful in its actions, not least with regard to scrutiny.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as a member of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament who, even in the last few days, has watched with great sadness as one fire after another has devastated vast areas around the city of Genoa, in the Liguria region of Italy, I feel there is a truly urgent need for Europe to pay attention and to intervene in order to prevent these sadly recurring disasters. There should be no recurring disasters. We should work every day to ensure that there are no more cyclical disasters. This is why I believe that Europe alone can and must intervene effectively with binding acts to preserve these precious areas which, each year, are in danger of going up in smoke and which really are the heritage of us all, because it is true that fires are breaking out more and more frequently in southern Europe, and even when it is only a tiny part of this southern Europe that is burning, in reality, it is the whole of Europe that is going up in flames. We need to intervene with prevention policies and with suitable forestry policies – and by prevention I also mean intervening by means of a precise, thorough and targeted campaign against all forms of speculation directly or indirectly linked to these disasters – but I think that we also need to ensure broader, easier and quicker access to essential resources in order, at least, to mitigate the devastating effects of these disasters. I am referring first and foremost to the Solidarity Fund, an instrument that should undoubtedly be employed more quickly for the areas affected. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the single market is a major achievement and is now, more than ever, a key element in realising the ambitious objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. Twenty years of the single market is a long time, but there is still a lot to do. So it is fundamentally important that this celebration is used as an opportunity to relaunch the single market, and it is also important for us to look ahead and see what we still lack. For example, a common energy policy is now essential if all of Europe’s citizens are to be guaranteed secure and clean energy supplies at more accessible prices. Removing obstacles and relaunching the single market will prove decisive in Europe’s current economic and social crisis, because they will contribute to innovation, growth, development, the promotion of competitiveness and above all to job creation.

 Mr President, energy efficiency is one of the pillars of EU climate policy. That is why today’s vote is particularly important. It is the result of a satisfactory and timely agreement in terms of the content, in that it obliges the Member States to prepare a strategy based on indicative national targets that take account of EU objectives and, at the same time, enables energy companies to comply with energy saving requirements in accordance with the principle of reasonable flexibility. The goal of a 20% increase in energy efficiency by 2020 is therefore within reach. I believe that credit is due, above all, to this House, because if the most disruptive Member States within the Council have at last accepted this good compromise, that is due to the tenacity with which Parliament’s negotiators, starting with the rapporteur, safeguarded these goals. This is an important step for the creation of green jobs and, ultimately, to boost competitiveness and sustainability. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of this report because only a simpler and more coherent approach can effectively support vine growers in the future. According to the Commission’s proposal, Member States have to decide once and for all by December 2012 whether to transfer funds from the wine envelope to the single payment scheme (SPS). The draft report instead aims to avoid Member States planning five-year programmes at this stage, before they know the outcome of the common agricultural policy (CAP) reform. The proposal suggests converting the existing five-year measure into a one-year measure. We need to provide adequate support to vine growers and we must do so in the clearest way possible, while still ensuring a certain amount of predictability as regards funds assigned to farmers. Clarity and timely action are the key words in our policy to support vine growers, for a Europe which is a friend to the land. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, attracting investment in Europe requires concrete measures and courageous reforms. We need to ensure free and fair competition between enterprises. In a globalised and crisis-hit economy as we have at present the main thing we need to do is make businesses more competitive and increase their capacity for growth and job creation; jobs are the most important thing of all. Europe must once again become an attractive place in which to invest and work. The current crisis is a global one, and Europe must play its part to make business stronger, more competitive and above all more attractive. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, now that the European Union’s first two macro-regional strategies in the Baltic and Danube regions have materialised, there has been growing interest in this aspect of development. A macro-regional strategy ensures better cooperation among the EU’s various intervention mechanisms, going beyond the appropriations allocated to cohesion policy. I believe that the regions of the Mediterranean basin that share the same natural environment and the same history and culture have every interest in cooperating in this way. Significant opportunities exist in southern Europe, which can best be seized with the coordination and overview permitted by the definition of a macro-regional strategy. I am referring to the proposal for an Adriatic-Ionian macro-region in particular. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the committees have already stressed their opposition to this agreement. Tomorrow, it is up to Parliament to confirm this vote and put an end to this controversial dossier. The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) is a treaty that seeks to introduce a new framework for the protection of intellectual property rights, but does so without distinction, without distinguishing between commercial use for financial gain and consumer use by individual users not seeking profit. I think we need to fight the fake goods market, to combat counterfeiting, but without undermining the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In a nutshell, I believe that commercial interests must not allow us to eliminate civil liberties. For this reason, ACTA is the wrong way to go about this, which is why tomorrow’s vote is very important. Tomorrow, therefore, we need to say no to ACTA to ensure the transparency and protection of citizens’ rights. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, after seven years of income support for workers, the Indian owners of the Videocon plant in the city of Anagni have filed for bankruptcy and initiated procedures to dismiss 1 300 employees. A major company, the second largest in the region of Lazio, is closing down, and with it, related firms. This company was acquired with the intention to force it into bankruptcy and to shift production to third countries. Therefore, the institutions must now work to provide a future for Videocon and its workers who are going through a time of crisis, and who, for seven long years, have been living in a state of total job uncertainty. Italy and Europe must step in and deploy all the instruments necessary to provide work and a productive future for this important plant. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of this report because only a harmonised and coherent approach by Member States will allow for effective promotion of Europe’s energy objectives externally. If we want to achieve the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy and of the road map for a low carbon economy by 2050, we need to improve our cooperation in terms of energy policy today. From this point of view, both increased diversification of EU supply sources and the development of renewable energy sources will be essential. In this context, effective coordination with industry is crucial in order to encourage in concrete terms the investments able to favour economic growth and development and, at the same time, those able to ensure clean and safe energy. The challenge is open and Europe must play the game for sustainable competitiveness in the energy market. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

Mr President, I voted for this report since I believe that the time has come to build a more balanced partnership with China, based on reciprocity, fair competition, friendship and trust. The Chinese economy has grown significantly over the last 30 years. It has benefited from trade and is set to become the strongest global economy towards the middle of this century. We therefore need to open a new stage in EU-China trade relations based on transparent rules, an equal partnership and common development. Hence, we must encourage China to further open up its market to European companies and allow them to invest under the same conditions as those governing Chinese investments in Europe. A new partnership, then, so that China will no longer be viewed with concern by our businesses, but as an important opportunity for development and growth for our economy and, above all, for work and employment.

 Mr President, this document concentrates on the importance of regional airports as potential vehicles of territorial, economic and social cohesion. These infrastructures can, and must, perform this role, especially for citizens living outside major urban areas. The rule whereby the threshold for an airport to receive State aid was decreased to 200 000 passengers per year is good. Regional aviation can ensure that free movement in Europe is a reality not just for people living in major capital cities, but also for European citizens living outside of these areas, ensuring that these cities and regions enjoy not only the benefits brought about by greater mobility, but also by generating tourism.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on Europe Day, this regulation is a good example. The harmonisation of roaming charges is fundamental for the process of completing the internal market of the European Union. There is always much talk of a single market and the removal of tariff barriers, and yet barriers between European countries in the telecommunications sector as regards roaming charges seemed insuperable. Now this is no longer the case, and it will no longer be the case up to and beyond July 2014. Tariff reductions are finally real and tangible, and this is good news for citizens throughout Europe. The agreement binds all operators in the 27 Member States, without exception, to reducing roaming charges for telephone calls, messages and Internet connections, starting no later than 1 July next. This is an important and significant saving, at a time of crisis and grave economic difficulty for so many families. What is more, I am pleased with the measure that will enable users who are abroad to opt for the services of the most convenient operator as from 2014. No more chains, therefore. However, all this is not enough; it is only a first step. The real objective is ‘zero’ roaming; the real objective is the total abolition of roaming charges. Building a fair and competitive market also depends on Europe’s capacity to safeguard the needs and rights of its citizens. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the creation of a risk-sharing instrument must provide tangible assistance for the Member States worst-hit by the economic and financial crisis. The European Union must do more and support the Member States facing major difficulties in enacting projects such as infrastructural works. Consequently, we must ensure the continued implementation of the programmes cofinanced by the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund. This has to be done because these are key projects – especially those capable of generating net revenues, such as the construction of motorways – which can contribute to the economic and productive recovery of the affected countries.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, passing this measure will necessarily help to increase the level of investment and thus secure the European Union’s industrial future. We need to give industry the stimuli it needs to encourage investment capable of favouring economic growth and reducing CO2
 emissions at the same time. A low-carbon economy must not therefore in any way reduce the competitiveness of the European Union; quite the reverse, it must increase it. Finally, it is important to maintain the investment needed to encourage the development of renewable energy sources in order to guarantee savings and clean energy. On this issue Europe must speed up if it does not want to remain behind. Deeds and not words are what is needed for the ambition of having a genuine green economy capable of driving growth and sustainable development. Thank you. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, these guidelines for employment policies will be a great help in achieving the target of increasing participation in the labour market and reducing youth unemployment. Today, the future of young people is increasingly uncertain and insecure. There is no point in concealing the fact that sustained economic growth is crucial for the future of Europe. The youth unemployment figures are dramatic and unacceptable. The European Union must be committed to a medium- to long-term strategy for better, full and good-quality employment, especially for young people and their mobility, but also in terms of gender quality. At the same time, there must be parallel efforts to improve education and training systems at all levels. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important programme and an ambitious plan – to turn Europe into the world leader in terms of broadband speed, mobility, coverage and capacity. As has already been said, we need to aim to offer broadband for all. Europe is behind. The United States and China have already liberalised most of their radio spectrum. Therefore the agreement to open up the 800 MHz frequency band for wireless broadband Internet services by the end of the year, and to speed up mobile broadband to at least 30 Mbps is to be welcomed. These are important objectives. I believe that a European digital agenda could be a source of development, growth and unemployment. We have to act decisively in order to reclaim our leading role in the global knowledge economy. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 I voted for the report on collective redress because I believe that completion of the European single market also, and above all, involves harmonisation of consumer protection measures. However, it is crucial that Europe should not repeat the errors already committed in the US, where the practice of class action has become a primary source of profit mainly for a handful of powerful legal firms, only in very rare cases acting as an effective consumer protection tool. In this field, the European Union can do better than the US, first of all by encouraging the parties to reach alternative agreements not requiring formal recourse to legal means, thus simplifying and speeding up the process; and subsequently, by establishing a legislative framework that does not leave room for abuse, hence, with specific timeframes for proceedings, and rights to protection in line with European legal traditions. Only in this way will it be possible to prevent a useful tool for protecting citizens becoming a means of unfair competition between private entities. The report on which we voted today is a move in this direction, and is therefore a good starting point to build on in the future. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, open, free and fair trade is essential for ensuring and maintaining a level playing field for European businesses. Nonetheless, both companies and trade analysts, as well as the European Commission, have identified non-tariff barriers as the main hindrance to free access to partner countries’ markets. Since trade restrictions of this kind are highly technical in nature, they are perhaps being misused and it is extremely difficult to remove them. That is why a good starting point for overcoming these obstacles may be to work closely with the WTO and other trade organisations. The European Union needs to address this issue vigorously by seeking to remove barriers so as to complete the single market and by prioritising this issue in the new trade policy within the Europe 2020 strategy. Businesses need this, and so does development. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis is no longer simply a threat; it is a reality that is, in fact, capable of changing the social and political order, and which accordingly requires a powerful, ambitious response. While the success of the Europe 2020 strategy depends on the commitment made by the EU as a whole, the Member States must consider economic and budgetary policies as a matter of common interest. Some countries may be able to make faster progress on their own, but together we can all go further. We therefore need to become more coordinated when adopting and implementing budgetary measures and measures to combat tax fraud and tax evasion effectively. In this context, promoting international commercial links and enhancing the internal market are elements that are crucial to increased competitiveness and economic growth. However, the Europe 2020 strategy needs to have a broader regional and social dimension. Only by directly involving local bodies in the planning and implementation of programmes will it be possible to ensure greater awareness of the objectives to be achieved.

Mr President, the economic crisis that has affected labour markets since 2008 has caused the loss of 5.6 million jobs. That is why we need to reinforce human capital by updating skills and linking education and training more closely with work, just as we need to focus on small and medium-sized enterprises and on young people joining the world of work. There is, however, one point that baffles me, on which my group tabled two amendments that were rejected by this House. For this reason, my concerns remain and I did not support the report. This point in question relates to the way the single contract was presented by the Commission. The contract does not offer adequate legal guarantees or rights on working conditions, social security and the protection of workers under all types of contract. I maintain that the issue of the right to work and the right to social security is a very important point. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the experience of recent years tells us that we need a more robust economic governance framework, just as we need to broaden and strengthen the surveillance framework, making it credible and effective, and to introduce penalties, which will be an effective deterrent only if they are applied in practice. Ultimately I believe that Europe cannot solve the economic and financial crisis with austerity plans alone. The books need to be balanced, but it takes more than all that. We can do more and better, especially where fairness, development and employment are concerned, and that is why I felt I had to abstain on the Haglund report. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is important for the Stability and Growth Pact and the complete economic governance framework to support and be compatible with EU strategies for growth and jobs, with the aim of increasing competitiveness and social stability. We therefore need to introduce penalties for punishing fraud, pay the fines into a central fund for the permanent crisis mechanism and regulate the financial markets more. Ultimately I believe that the austerity measures being discussed today are in danger of weakening social justice policies. This is not the case with the Ferreira report, which I endorsed and which includes some valuable points in relation to social balance. It is the rest of the package that is wrong, because it focuses solely and exclusively on rigour and austerity and fails to promote growth. Europe will have a future only if we are able to marry fiscal discipline with the objectives of development, growth and employment. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report is an important step in the right direction. Research and innovation are both vital for development and economic growth. It is therefore urgent to propose a common framework for reorganising the existing schemes and programmes. Although Europe is the richest macro-region in the world, it has not actually invested properly in research, development and innovation. Suffice it to say that investment in these areas has been appreciably higher in the United States and Japan. We therefore have to act quickly to remove the inequalities that remain between the various countries of Europe. That will be the only possible way to prevent the scientifically or technologically more advanced countries from continuing to benefit more from existing European programmes. I therefore reiterate the need to reorganise the existing schemes and programmes and provide for new schemes with a view to producing a sustainable and inclusive growth strategy, while bearing in mind the objectives of stability, economic convergence and employment. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the key to establishing a sophisticated approach to the issue, one that does not relate exclusively to internal production factors, is to link trade policies to development policies: in other words, human rights clauses, labour standards and corporate social responsibility must become part of every agreement. Europe’s trump card in this respect are innovation policies aimed at guaranteeing supplies through a wide range of measures, the identification and extraction of raw materials in Europe, investment in new technologies for recycling and reusing materials, and compliance with fair and responsible agreements with non-EU suppliers. The framework programme is, moreover, one of the tools for reviving innovation policies, which are an important, indeed crucial element with regard to development and also with regard to work and employment.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the Sommer report because I firmly believe that Europeans should be able to make a free and informed choice about what they eat. In adopting this report, Parliament is giving the green light to clearer rules on food labelling. These rules concern not only the energy content and the percentage of fat present in the labelled food, but also the obligation to indicate the origin of the meat used. These are common-sense rules that have the merit of allowing citizens the freedom of choice, so that they can follow a healthy, balanced diet and know what they are eating. This regulation is a vehicle for citizens to be able to voice their specific requirements with regard to their choice of foodstuffs. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

Mr President, I voted in favour of this report because I take the view that the Member States should be equipped with a solid legal basis for deciding on the future of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), and especially because it needs to be acknowledged that the agricultural and environmental impact – as well as the socio-economic impact – can justify bans and restrictions. Indeed, I should like to point out that more than 60% of European citizens are against the development and cultivation of GMOs and that, as it stands, there is still no bedrock of scientific advice capable of dispelling all doubt about their impact on territories, cultures and consumers. Our legislative action must therefore once again be guided by the precautionary principle, because until we are certain that GMOs are not harmful for crops or consumers, we have the duty to protect European citizens from their potential damaging effects.

Mr President, this is a good report and one that is very important for the balanced, harmonious and sustainable development of our communities. Genuine solidarity between Member States allows our regions to be more attractive, more innovative and more competitive. Simplifying access to assistance, more effective controls and quality spending are the objectives for a better functioning of this instrument. We need greater investment in research, knowledge and innovation to boost growth, the development of small and medium-sized enterprises and employment. I have one final comment: creating a new intermediate category must not result in existing categories being deprived of resources, but must introduce and aim solely and exclusively at the deployment of additional resources.

Mr President, I voted in favour of the report by Mr Sosa Wagner because it effectively highlights the strengths and weaknesses in the European Commission’s approach to revitalising energy infrastructures: the need to identify the infrastructures required, the criteria for selecting projects of European interest in view of financing that will attract and boost private investment, the urgent need to deal with the dangers in Eastern Europe of relying on a single source which, as we have seen in recent years, can cause serious supply problems, and lastly the opportunity to invest part of the EUR 1 000 billion over 10 years provided for by the Commission for the reduction of pollution, combating climate change and improving supply quality for clean and safe energy.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Fukushima disaster has reopened the issue of nuclear safety. The problem of radioactive waste needs to be addressed and solved. To be brief, there are two issues that I consider top priority. The first is the ban on the transfer of waste. Every country must be able to discharge its own obligations and, above all, the ‘polluter pays’ principle is a fair one. The second issue concerns safety, and the health and safety of workers in particular. This is a point that I consider extremely important, and we have to give people peace of mind. We have to give the people of Europe peace of mind by ensuring that this subject is managed with the utmost transparency and above all, I stress, the utmost safety. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, the report on the mid-term review of the Seventh Framework Programme is especially significant. There are four reasons – which I consider to be paramount – why I voted in favour of the report: 1) the simplification and streamlining of procedures in order to make it easier to access funding; 2) the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are essential for growth and employment; 3) innovation for a competitive manufacturing sector capable of meeting the challenges of the market; and 4) the risk finance facility, which so far has produced very good results. Lastly, I should like to point out that the triangle of knowledge, education and research – on which the future of the cohesion policy rests – can only be consolidated in Europe through a steadfast commitment to research. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

Mr President, the report by Mr Garriga Polledo is a very important piece of work that allows us to set out a new financial framework for a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe. We need a budget that is designed for the challenges of the present day and that can provide a strong and innovative response to current needs. Its top priority must be research and innovation for small and medium-sized enterprises, to stimulate growth and employment, while the second objective is to reform the common agricultural policy in order to promote and support the competitiveness of agriculture in Europe. However, particular attention should be paid to the future of the cohesion policy, which I consider to be a very important instrument and one which provides financial support for investments that drive economic growth and, above all, the creation of new jobs. On this subject, I would like to revisit a point that I think is particularly important: the establishment of a new intermediate category. I believe, of course, that this new category cannot be created by siphoning off resources from existing ones, which are essential for supporting the balanced, harmonious and sustainable growth of our communities.

Mr President, I voted in favour of the report on the labelling of textile products because I think that Europe could and should do more to support enterprises in the industry. The proposal made by the Commission was purely technical and aimed to simplify the current provisions regarding labelling. Yet Parliament achieved two significant results. Firstly, textile products comprising non-textile parts of animal origin – fur and leather – must show this information on the labels in order to allow consumers to make informed choices. Secondly, by 2013, the European Commission must present an impact study on the introduction of labelling, clearly showing which garments have been produced in Europe, and which outside of Europe. The latter objective is an important milestone for the competitiveness of European textiles in Europe and the world. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mrs Merkies on her excellent work. I believe we have to invest more in innovation, research and knowledge, and we have to do so more boldly. Innovation must not be swallowed up by research. Innovation and research are not the same thing, and I welcome the fact that the report points out this strategic distinction. The report sets some important objectives: it targets ordinary people and workers through social innovation; it introduces measures to facilitate access to credit and finance for small and medium-sized enterprises; and, above all, it establishes an increasingly close and direct relationship linking together businesses, research centres and our universities. Facilitating and simplifying life for small and medium-sized enterprises through a one-stop shop and focusing on talent, creativity and innovative ideas are essential conditions for growth and development. Europe must take innovation policies seriously if we want to find a way out of the crisis and build a better future for our younger generations. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, after the tragedy of Fukushima, we all need to stop and think. Nuclear power is once more in the spotlight, and I believe we need to think above all of the future, of our children’s future. It is true that we need energy, but we need clean energy and safe energy. Safety is all well and good, but it is not enough. A moratorium is not enough; we need to go further than that. The tragedy of Fukushima tells us that there is no such thing as zero-risk nuclear power stations. Above all, it tells us that we need to organise a rapid exit from nuclear power and to focus our attention on renewable, alternative power sources. Europe needs a new energy policy in order to halt the construction of new nuclear power stations because of the terrible impact these power stations could have on safety, the environment, the climate and future generations. A radical change of perspective is necessary, for a safe future based on saving energy and the use of renewable sources. Francesco De Angelis,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if we are to restore confidence to the market, we need to prioritise the needs of consumers, workers and businesses. If we want to strengthen the rights of citizens, workers and users of public services, significant attention should be paid to guaranteeing the social dimension of the future Single Market. Growth, development and social awareness must go hand in hand. There must be economic growth at the service of citizens. From this point of view, the package of regulations regarding standards for companies contains some good proposals, including the action plan to increase access on the part of small and medium-sized enterprises to capital markets and new lines of financing for innovative firms and regional development. Small and medium-sized businesses are the heart of our economy and the growth engine of the internal market. Mr President, it is up to us to ensure these goals if we are to get out of the crisis and promote a new model of development, sustainable growth and new quality jobs. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Balzani, for the excellent work she has accomplished. Getting to the heart of the matter, there are four points in this own-initiative report that I think are crucial. The first, in general terms, is the explicit reference to the European Union budget and its redistributive nature, which are the cornerstones of European solidarity. The second, in specific terms, reaffirms the principle that outstanding commitments – which are particularly high in the cohesion sector – ought to be carried out and not, as the Council suggests, simply cut out. The third sets out some doubts – entirely reasonably in my view – as to the effectiveness of an estimate criterion based on performance in the previous year. The fourth urges the Commission to formulate proposals for the creation of new resources and, in particular, new resources must be designed to combat the persistent effects of the crisis with a robust and effective commitment to policies for innovation, research and growth in economic, productive and employment terms across Europe.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that the fragmentation of the rules on consumer rights creates a very significant obstacle to cross-border purchases and sales and is also a problem for the effective creation of a real internal market.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, news of the earthquake swarm that has been affecting the Far East and Japan in particular since 11 March has left us all astonished by the scale of the human tragedy that is unfolding. For these reasons, I think this resolution represents a necessary first step to guarantee the people of Japan all the humanitarian, technical and financial support they will need in the coming months and years. I believe that the incident at the Fukushima plant should force us all to reflect carefully, scrupulously and calmly on the risks of nuclear power. Europe must invest and must also direct the Member States to concentrate more closely and more effectively on alternative energy sources. Our thoughts go out to Japan today and our commitment for the future must be to avoid similar situations being repeated in Europe and elsewhere in the world. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs Schaldemose for her report which, above all, must be praised for proposing concrete measures to strengthen the surveillance systems for movement within the common European market of products that are safe for European consumers. It is an own-initiative report but it has the merit of going in the right direction to complete the single market and the protection of European consumers. Ensuring safety means providing traceability systems that are reliable throughout the products’ life cycle. In this respect, the report puts forward effective proposals: the creation of an information database on product safety; the strengthening of the Community Rapid Information System (RAPEX) regarding unsafe products from third countries; and greater resources to allow the surveillance authorities to withdraw products with serious risks from the market. I will conclude by emphasising that it is our job to ensure that the products circulating on the European market are safe for the most vulnerable consumers, especially children, the elderly and the disabled.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Nedelcheva, for her contribution. Talking about equality between men and women in the world of work today is not, and must not be, merely an exercise in rhetoric. On the contrary, female employment is a strategic issue for Europe, in both cultural and economic terms. As is evident from the available data, if the employment rates for women were similar to those of men, gross domestic product would increase by 30%. The current crisis must not, therefore, force us to take backward steps but, on the contrary, must make us move forward towards active policies on female employment. We therefore need targeted employment policies that allow the impact of the crisis on women to be assessed and counter-cyclical solutions to be considered. The report has the merit, moreover, of focusing on positive policies to promote the employment of women, the issue of vocational training and female entrepreneurship. I will conclude by saying that there is another phenomenon to face: the serious problem of violence against women. Europe now needs to have a comprehensive directive on preventing and combating all forms of violence against women. Francesco De Angelis,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, industrial policy is a key element for growth and employment in our regions and countries. At a time of severe economic crisis, therefore, we welcome the Commission’s initiative to provide Europe with a common medium- to long-term approach, and we fully support Mr Lange’s outstanding report for at least three reasons. The first is that the report takes an approach to the subject of industrial development that does not break down industrial and business interests into market sectors, but puts them together according to common objectives. The second reason is that it underlines the importance of regional structures through more effective support for clusters, innovation networks, knowledge transfer, research, and the improvement of skills and infrastructure development. The third reason – and I am finishing – is that it highlights the role and function of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are looking to Europe to find a way out of this crisis, which is liable to seriously jeopardise their future. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 – (IT)
 Mr President, more than 100 million workers depend directly or indirectly on small and medium-sized enterprises today in Europe. Yet small and medium-sized enterprises are experiencing an unprecedented crisis: lack of liquidity, bureaucratic obstacles and constraints and administrative barriers. Herein lies the crux of this motion for a resolution: Parliament is calling for credit and loan guarantee programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises and a vigorous European drive that is more than just a pipe dream to combat the new – and for many prohibitive – business-banking requirements, particularly with regard to higher collateral guarantees and risk premiums. Lastly, I agree with the need to significantly increase funding within the framework of the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme, and to revive the issue of simplification with strength and determination: streamline and simplify, so that firms wishing to access funds are able do so without having to resort to very expensive outside consultants. These are the reasons why I voted for this resolution: the SMEs and the 100 million European workers employed in the sector expect it of us. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Bendtsen’s report is positive for at least four reasons: – it reaffirms that energy efficiency is the most effective and fastest way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and that a firm commitment to provide resources and investment in this area will result in economic growth and job creation for small and medium-sized enterprises; – it makes valid proposals concerning workable financial instruments and calls on the Commission to firmly focus on professional training, access to information for small and medium-sized enterprises, and the refurbishment of existing buildings; – it sets specific objectives and confirms Energy Performance Contracting as an instrument for purchasing guaranteed energy savings and a launch pad for creating jobs and reducing European citizens’ bills; – lastly, the report will be all the more useful if binding emissions targets can be set without any ifs or buts. We must make the 20% target an achievable one; we cannot let this opportunity pass us by, since it would send out an encouraging signal to Europe. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my appreciation for this resolution, which is an excellent piece of work in four respects. Firstly, it reasserts that energy efficiency and energy saving are economically advantageous priorities to reduce Europe’s energy dependence and combat climate change. Secondly, it emphasises intelligent infrastructure. Thirdly, it urges us to fully implement current European legislation. Fourthly, it strives to bring about an energy policy with a robust and consistent international dimension. Finally, I should like to underline the importance of energy security and investment in research, development and innovation to protect the interests of consumers, businesses and citizens as well as possible.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Van Brempt, for her excellent work and for an agreement that will at last make it possible to free up significant resources for the development of renewable energies and energy efficiency in the context of the challenge for green growth. The programme includes priorities that the Member States should take into account, particularly in achieving the objective of competitive modernisation of our energy infrastructures. Lastly, I wish to emphasise what I considered to be the qualifying points of the criteria for access by public authorities to finance, in particular, the commitment to work on multiannual strategies through a system of multi-level governance from territories to local authorities up to regional institutions and the institutions of the European Union, even in the context of rationalising the available financial instruments. This is an important result for the public and for small and medium-sized enterprises. Francesco De Angelis,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs Weiler for the excellent work she has done. With this provision, Europe is putting an end to a procedure that has brought a great many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to their knees. Parliament is taking action to protect SMEs – the most vulnerable businesses and the ones most exposed to the effects of the crisis – from problems of liquidity and access to credit. The current practice of delaying payments is pushing a great many small businesses towards bankruptcy, with adverse effects on employment. That is why the provision is important: it sets the maximum payment period at 60 days, increases interest on late payments to 8% and outlaws the use of contractual terms that are unfair to the creditor. In other words, it lays down definite time periods, incentives and, most of all, no exceptions. These are measures designed to protect SMEs, stimulate our economic and productive fabric, and boost employment. It is now the turn of the Member States to take swift and effective steps to implement this directive, which confirms that Europe exists, is useful and can make itself felt.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the launch of the European Union 2020 strategy effectively marks the end of the previous Lisbon Strategy phase and it will have to tackle the negative structural effects that the financial, economic and social crisis has produced and is continuing to produce. I believe that if the 2020 strategy is to be effective, it must focus on two key aspects, the first being a system for evaluating progress which factors in the use of the carrot and stick mechanism; the second being a vigorous policy of investing in infrastructure, in addition, of course, to tools for regulating the financial system and policies aimed at restoring social dialogue and cohesion. Infrastructures are the cornerstone of the relaunch of innovation policy in industry, SMEs, manufacturing consortiums or research institutes and in the relationship between these and universities and local institutions. The van Nistelrooij report should therefore be warmly welcomed since, in addition to providing an in-depth picture of the work that has been done to date in the Member States, it starts to deal with the question of criteria for harmonisation of financial instruments and operational plans aimed at innovation. The harmonisation of rules, procedures and administrative practices for the management of EU projects and the simplification and streamlining of procedures are the solutions that the stakeholders on the ground and citizens have been asking us for for a long time. I believe that on this point, Europe can and must do much to promote growth, development and employment. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the five rapporteurs who have worked so hard on these matters, and since I can only deal with one of these questions, for the second I will wear something on my head in order to demonstrate my conviction that no fish, under EU law, can be landed without fins, and so I do not understand why sharks may be landed in this manner. Thus, in honour of sharks I am wearing a fin for the remainder of my speech. I want to support the position taken by Ms Lövin and oppose the Group of the European People’s Party’s alternative motion for a resolution. I think that this alternative motion for a resolution tabled by the PPE Group, signed by the Chair, poses a very serious problem because it deletes an important part of this report involving the conclusion of fisheries agreements in the Mediterranean. Without fisheries agreements with other countries, our Mediterranean is condemned to certain death. Removing the possibility of conducting a fisheries foreign policy in the Mediterranean means killing the sea. I would therefore ask the Chair to withdraw this motion before tomorrow, and call on all Mediterranean MEPs to vote against it if the motion is not withdrawn. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is the fourth time I have had to give an explanation of vote – which does not happen very often – under these conditions. The report by Mr Alfonsi that we have adopted today is of particular importance, especially for the Adriatic region in our country. The macro-regional strategy has a considerable impact both on European planning and on its implementing acts. I believe regional strategies will be extremely important for the implementation of these rules, not least for the sector that I personally am involved with – fisheries – during the revision of our fisheries policies. Unfortunately, this sector is not given due coverage in this report, although that does not make it any less important. Besides, the constraints of the Mediterranean are well known; these constraints in both the management and the implementation of certain policies often jeopardise Europe’s comprehensive strategies. I do not think I can say anything else in all this uproar. Guido Milana,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank Mr Stevenson for his excellent work and the structure he gave to his report, which addresses the two main issues. This is not a simple management plan for herring, but is about guaranteeing fishermen a future to some extent, and a plan of action that ensures the sea is protected for years to come. But the key point in this report is – and remains – the question of delegated acts. I believe that the Council should accept the line taken by the Treaty of Lisbon and I think that the time has come for Parliament to have the courage to take a very clear and strong position on the matter of delegated acts, with perhaps a more authoritative voice than would come from the debate in the Committee on Fisheries or a discussion on a report concerning herring. We assert the right to deal with these matters under the ordinary legislative procedure. I know perfectly well that this issue concerns not only many other kinds of fishing, which will be in a worse situation following the current reform, but also agriculture and other subjects. The right course is to respect the will of Parliament. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to avoid repeating what my colleagues have already said, I personally believe that Europe really has no strategy either for the system of controls or for the means of implementing international agreements in the Mediterranean. We must not forget that the Mediterranean comprises eight European and 22 non-European countries and that its bluefin tuna attract many fishermen from outside Europe. I therefore believe – regardless of whether Mr Romeva i Rueda’s good work could have gone further – that this debate is pointless if it does not lead to the Commission preparing a proper international relations proposal. What is really needed is to establish new relationships on this subject, and on many others concerning fishing in the Mediterranean, in an effort to create the right conditions and making resources available for those countries that apply the same European rules. It would serve the interests of the tuna, of European fishing, and of Mediterranean fishing in particular. Guido Milana,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries.

 Madam President, the Committee on Fisheries has carried out an exhaustive job, considering that this is a post-Lisbon codecision matter. In this sense, the execution rate was 97.20%, hence a good execution rate as recorded in the accounts. Despite this, however, under one of the headings, a specific heading, the heading for fish markets, number 1102, had very little execution, for which the Commission gave some quite satisfactory explanations, but these do not suggest that there will be much change in the following years. Equally, one of the issues underlined is the execution of international fishing agreements. In these, the commercial aspect is too dominant compared with the aspect linked to growth in the sector: 72% is a commercial agreement. Therefore, the fishing agreements probably need to have a slightly different execution that takes into account the policy objectives of these agreements. I will close, Madam President, with just one more small comment, which is that there are reports that have been challenged for almost a decade, the closure of which is still being delayed. This is a just a point of form with regard to the execution as a whole. Thank you in particular for the time allowed to me. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the excellent report by Mr Rinaldi has been a success in the House. I totally agree with the excellent opinion of the report. Nevertheless, I would like to raise a small issue. Compared with this new world that is trying to seek democracy and different economic conditions, our Europe is a Europe divided by the Mediterranean. It is precisely this special focus on the Mediterranean that I would like the Commission to have, as regards both environmental issues and economic trade in the Mediterranean. The Mediterranean is a fishing area. We are building a new fisheries policy in Europe in which Europe will set some very strict rules. On the other side, however, there are no rules. Therefore, why not use forms of fisheries agreements, support for these countries so that they apply the same rules that are applied in Europe? This would be healthy for European fishing, healthy for the sea and environmental conservation, and would ensure that this division becomes ever smaller but an increasingly homogenous place on which to build the future of Europe and of this new world.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank Mr Arsenis, Ms Patrão Neves and Mr Romeva i Rueda and their assistants for contributing substantially to the success of this initiative. Fish is a common good, as it provides 15% of the protein intake of more than 3 billion people, and the livelihoods of over 500 million people depend on fishing and aquaculture. This makes it a truly global common good. By approving this statement, we are indicating a clear path to the Commission on the need to encourage responsible conduct, both among the fishing community and on the part of consumers. The debate on the common fisheries policy now has one more reason to support actions to broaden the scope of European policy from a narrow vision, concentrating on fishing methods and a policy of inward-looking rules. Instead, we suggest a strategy which treats the sea as a privileged place so as to increase its function as a breeding ground, both within EU waters and through innovative fishing agreements with third countries. What is more, this is not only about protecting the environment and maintaining biodiversity, but also about responsible fisheries, economic and social sustainability, which is clearly in the interests of both fishermen and our economy. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you have done very well, Commissioner, to promote this initiative and this regulation, but I would like to return to one problem – the only thing I want to pick up on in my speech – which is the under-execution of funds. The Commission must intervene because here we are facing an example of under-execution of funds. You have moved very intelligently to accelerate this process. Mr Ferreira makes some excellent points, because there are a number of questions over this issue: I do not think that we can transform the common fisheries policy over these two years, but I think we can direct our resources appropriately, especially to the most vulnerable countries, which are in greatest need of assistance at the moment. I would add, Commissioner, that in order to make this expenditure effective, I would also suggest that the procedures for the execution phase should be simplified; that is something I would focus on. Sometimes, a closer look at the execution of spending and simplified procedures can further assist in this process. I would like to pause for just a second if I may, Mr President, on the Court of Auditors. We must be wary of considering the Court of Auditors’ report as applicable to the whole of Europe. Within the report, there are many different areas where efficiency was different. Thank you and excuse me, Mr President, for running over time. Guido Milana,

 Mr President, my remarks are intended directly for the Commissioner and the Minister. Commissioner, a year and a half ago, I urged you to act courageously as, in doing so, you would have had the support of Parliament. Now it seems to me that, instead, the idea prevails that Parliament is a sort of deadweight, a frill, in the procedures and that the Commission often prefers to take a stance that differs little if at all from the Council’s, which avoids having a genuine relationship with Parliament. Today, we are debating the reform of the common fisheries policy. Parliament is asking questions, while ministers are already mediating the Commission’s proposal. This goes beyond the application of Article 43(3). We must really reinstate the principle that the Treaty of Lisbon conferred on Parliament, and I believe that on this point, we must take a cultural leap in our relationships, rather than work in fine detail, trying to grasp whether we are on the right track by following this or that procedure. This is a different problem. I believe that we are still not aware of the role that Parliament can play when it comes to the fisheries sector. Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, we shall vote on the report that has been presented to us in a distinguished manner this morning by Ms Patrão Neves. If Parliament supports it, this resolution will immediately draw very important lines in the sand for the coming reform. I am not absolutely persuaded by the proposals regarding the socioeconomic aspect of the proposed reform. They effectively amount to driving the workforce out of the sector, not about finding alternative employment. I believe that here too we must take a culturally different direction. The list of issues you have drawn up is really short, as it does not set out a scenario for substituting fishing by some other occupation, where, say, aquaculture or tourism could have a key role. I believe that these measures have simply been relegated to a question of transferable rights, which, Commissioner, give absolutely no guarantee of a socioeconomic application for the reduction in fishing, because … (The President cut off the speaker) Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

Mr President, I am presenting an oral amendment with regard to the introduction of respect for human rights in this resolution. The text, which should be inserted after paragraph 7, is as follows: ‘calls on the Commission to introduce into the fisheries agreement with Morocco the clause on respect for human rights, as set out in the European Parliament resolution on human rights and social and environmental standards in international trade agreements’. I believe that this amendment improves the resolution and gives a timely reminder to the Commission, during the negotiation stage, to take into account the international context which often meets division in Parliament, particularly in this area. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a dreadful agreement, a dreadful extension and a dreadful performance over the years: these are the keywords in this debate! Well, we must consider this phase closed. If the Commission – or, rather, the Commissioner, who did not draw up this agreement – asks us to consent to the agreement, we must put this phase behind us and concentrate in particular on the new agreement and on what will happen in the coming years. As someone who has upheld the Sahrawi cause for many years, I am not sure if it is a good idea not to have any further relations with Morocco. We cannot replace the agreement, the lack of which would not help us resolve the conflict, which has been going on for more than 30 years. What Ms Lövin said was music to my ears. I wholeheartedly agree with her, although I do not think the fisheries agreement is the way to solve the problem. We certainly will not find a solution when the UN has had a mission in place for 30 years that has been incapable of resolving all the humanitarian issues involved. We should therefore say ‘yes’ to the resolution and ‘yes’ to extending this agreement, because the resolution should encourage the Commission and spur it on to negotiate hard, both to ensure that the new agreement truly responds to these requirements, and to ensure that it is a sign that the Union’s foreign policy must heed. Baroness Ashton cannot ignore the Sahrawi question any longer! Guido Milana,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it was wonderful to work with Mr Koumoutsakos. We worked well together, we had a good trialogue, and therefore my thanks are not merely formal but truly meant. We have become friends during this debate, and I think this friendship will probably lead us to give the Commission a hand because, Commissioner, the problem is the future. What we have achieved today has been thanks to Parliament, because if it had been down to the Council – incidentally absent today – we would not have achieved this result. A proposal of EUR 50 million was cut by the Council, and it is only thanks to the tough stand taken by myself and Mr Koumoutsakos that the Commission has been able to receive this EUR 40 million. The Commission can count on us for the future. It can count on a Parliament that believes in what it says. This Parliament is convinced to the extent that it knows perfectly well that the sea is made up of seas, coastlines and activities, and that there needs to be a common vision of these things. Coastlines cannot be the subject of urban and land planning that ends at the foreshore. The EU and Member States need to appreciate that town planning includes the sea – it does not end on the coastline. The activities themselves need to become compatible with one another. We need to initiate real planning in which tourism, fishing, mining and – why not? – the amazing wind energy that can be developed offshore can be an asset and mutually compatible, in the same way that fishing and fishing activities cannot be treated separately and considered only in terms of fishing methods and quantities. There, the focus will have to be on pollution-related issues, because dwindling fish stocks are not just the result of fishing. Commissioner, you have a major ally in Parliament. The problem will not be how to spend this EUR 40 million, but how we will all manage to have sufficient resources between 2013 and 2020 to do such important and wonderful things. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in this case, too, you have strong support from Parliament. Ms Lövin has carried out an extraordinary task, an excellent preliminary job, even though on some points and issues, she could have gone further. I have a different opinion as to whether or not it is appropriate or justified to set up a European coastguard, although I will support her position. I have a different opinion, but I will, in any case, support her position. Commissioner, there is only one real issue, and that is that the Commission needs to have a global role. We have said this in many different ways, and I think that this is the real key, to establish a real foreign policy for this activity. The relationship with the United States, China and Japan is crucial in this sense, because the essence of this activity lies within this relationship, within the construction of common rules and the resulting behaviours. Therefore the true goal is to increase awareness that fishing, in this sense, is a common asset, and a global common asset. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report was adopted with a huge majority in Parliament. I voted for it, but I would have liked to vote on something different, something bolder. In my opinion, Parliament has missed an opportunity to go further. It is quite true that the single European railway area can and must result in a much better relationship with consumers than we have had so far. Why stop, however, at a single national regulatory body and not push on towards a single European regulatory body? Why stop short of the issue of unbundling, bringing in a clear separation between ownership and service management? Yes, the budgets have been separated, but probably this time in Parliament it was not this House’s authority to make its voice heard that has prevailed, but rather the representatives of the abundant privilege and competition present today in the European railway market. We will only manage to truly change the fortunes of freight, improve people’s lives, improve the free circulation of goods when this single European space is worthwhile. Essentially, keeping well away from the train tracks is good for the health and not for economic policy; perhaps by getting too close you will get run over. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
).

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the budget sets out a few clear and important objectives within the scope of the Europe 2020 strategy; for this I should like to thank the rapporteurs, Ms Balzani and Mr Fernandes. It is essential to focus on investments and not merely on the careful management of the budget. The only alternative is to look on passively at the speculative way of thinking that dominates at present. We can no longer allow ourselves to follow individual interests and instead must finally act as a single, united structure, ready to face up to confrontation. I welcome the commitments adopted on the pilot projects and the preparatory actions in Heading 2, just as I welcome the fact that funding for the Integrated Maritime Policy is not to the detriment of other initiatives and programmes in the fisheries sector. This will allow us to implement policies for better marine resource management, through research and thoroughgoing exchange of data on fish stocks, bringing in new planning methods in the Adriatic area that can be used as best practices in other marine areas. I will conclude with a quick aside: with regard to future debates on the common fisheries policy (CFP) and in particular on the European Fisheries Fund (EFF), I hope that a greater effort will be made on fisheries control, which is at the heart of the fight against illegal fishing and is also a key issue in restoring stocks. Fish should be seen as a shared asset. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT) 
Mr President, I too welcome the vote on this report, even though a few points might well have been developed a little further. Reflecting on all the regionalisation and localisation of employment contracts cannot, however, fail to take heed of the important task of unifying workers’ rights. In other words, the greater the opportunity to develop territorial, business and sectoral autonomy to stimulate productivity and create the conditions for competitiveness, the greater the need to create the conditions for some fundamental rights to be applied on a supranational, or European, basis. That is why I am still puzzled as to whether this initiative could lead us to tackle the important issue of whether there can be a European policy on fundamental rights. Otherwise the alternative is that we will enter what I think will be a bad period in which there will be rich and poor workers, even though they are doing the same job. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Ms Koppa’s report is exceptionally current in what it really implies, and it comes at a time when the debate on Palestine is particularly important. Initiating this trade highlights the fact that we can no longer use this country just as a potential market, since until now, our exports to Palestine have been worth EUR 50 million and our imports from there only EUR 6 million. Instead, away from Israeli control, the country is preparing itself to play a role as an exporter to Europe, which we hope can truly help to change the fortunes of the Palestinian people in particular. I therefore voted wholeheartedly in favour of this report. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, many thousands of people die every year due to natural disasters and tens of billions of euro are lost. These are dramatic figures, and disasters are not always avoidable. Ms Gardini’s report is right on the mark in this respect, because it essentially identifies the two fundamental points in the new European civil protection strategy. The first is a thorough prevention plan, which can no longer be just the sum of the national prevention plans, and proper rules concerning prevention procedures. The second is the real, concrete idea of European civil protection, which cannot result from mere coordination but must be based on a genuine network. We have to move on from an emergency response requested by a country in relation to a disaster and the subsequent intervention, seen almost as a concession by another country, to a genuine strategy. With this hope in mind, I think the resolution adopted today is a useful one for the people of Europe. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is just a good initiative, but I think we will later have to develop a European policy on tourism. The European framework is a good idea, but I would like to focus on two issues. There is no sea or coastal tourism, we might say, but a coastal planning policy. I think the time has come for Europe to protect this important sector by producing an initiative in which ideas about the sea and coastline are not limited to a kind of town planning that ends at the foreshore and does not involve the sea as a whole. I think it will be useful to have an integrated policy on this, just as there will be a need to develop everything that lies behind the claims about rural tourism: rural tourism can be an excellent source of income for disadvantaged areas and areas where there is no work any more, where it is important to stop depopulation and instead encourage people to settle. For that, it is not enough just to make claims. We would need to suggest that Europe and the Member States take action on taxation. Perhaps developing tourism in rural areas could mean paying less tax; maybe that would create a real opportunity for tourism as a resource and for the people living in those areas. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have just three small points I should like to make, all centred on the fact that we need ‘more Europe’ in this area. I think it is an inescapable fact that on certain issues, we must not merely hope for more Europe, but actually set about building it. For example, more Europe means starting to really think about common traffic police and uniform safety rules. More Europe means having a European policy on training, not simply delegating it to the individual Member States, but instead putting together a proper training policy for schools, for young people and for slightly more at-risk categories, among whom motorcyclists were mentioned a moment ago, but we could talk about lorry drivers as well. More Europe means everyone having the same devices in their cars to improve safety conditions, such as alcolocks and anti-tiredness devices. This, in my view, would be a strategy well worth pursuing with businesses in the sector and European carmakers. Indeed, if all this was incorporated in a common policy, then I really think that conditions would, perhaps, improve. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt this is not purely a trade agreement. This agreement clearly contains a significant element of ‘political’ assistance. This does not involve treating Palestine and Israel in the same way; it is clear that their situations are different. The agreement with Israel is purely a trade agreement, a trade agreement that in some way supports a process leading to the constitution of a state, a process that brings improvements in the living conditions experienced by that population. Furthermore, the trade agreement with Europe has until now been mediated by Israel, and the result is one where imports form one tenth and exports nine tenths of our international trade. That means that we have seen, or rather, until now Europe has seen Palestine as a market and certainly not a place where producers should be encouraged to target the European market. It is my belief then, with compliments to Ms Koppa, that in this international context we would be doing the right thing tomorrow by using the vote in Parliament to send a strong, authoritative message that will help drive the process at the UN and the Warsaw meeting at the end of the month. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the single market, the freedom of movement and the Treaty of Lisbon are all elements which came about irrespective of changes to our method – either the European method or the national method – of lawmaking. We need to act on the commitments made in the light of these opportunities. In particular, we need to truly initiate a phase to simplify the legislative system, a simplification phase which must lead to a different kind of dialogue between Europe and the individual States. I would start precisely with our documents, and I would take this opportunity to suggest a kind of clarity test for our documents. When we draw up a white paper or a green paper, everything should be more understandable, and I would say that, in order to truly launch this virtuous phase of introducing legislation, the real, perhaps strategic proposal for our Europe, is to give particular responsibility to a European Commissioner who would have the specific task of clarifying legislation and relations between the States and Europe itself.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I support the adoption of this report because it has the effect of ensuring that the conditions applied to the Black Sea are proposed in other European areas, too. Regulating fishing in an area in which only two of the six countries bordering the basin are European is an important development. It is very similar to the situation in the Adriatic, for example, where different countries – EU, non-EU and candidate countries – with totally different rules exist side by side. The second reason is that I believe that the establishment of a European coastguard should be highlighted and viewed as a genuinely important development: it could actually be one of the first areas for discussion when planning how to protect the sea, fishermen and consumers. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT)
 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have taken the floor simply in order to lend my support to this report and to highlight two aspects in particular. The first, because it is part of the debate currently under way on the review of the common fisheries policy and on the fundamental decision relating to the regionalisation of a policy – a centralised policy – that has shown how utterly weak it is in recent years. This regionalisation phase is particularly relevant in the case of the Black Sea. I believe that the points contained in Ms Iotova’s report describe a specific situation, but one that is found in the rest of Europe, too: the situations in the Adriatic Sea, the Tyrrhenian Sea and the Aegean Sea are no different. In other words, the interaction between European fishing and non-European fishing, in particular, is often very harmful to European markets and to European consumers. The second aspect that I should like to highlight quickly is that of the call for a European coastguard. There can be no policy without controls. Controls are carried out today by different forces in Europe; I believe that the time has come to recognise that one of the main security forces in Europe, namely coastguards, can be managed jointly, can become more interdependent and, indeed, can form a single European body. In the hope that this will happen, I fully support the contents of Ms Iotova’s report. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Fukushima accident continues to produce very serious consequences, with radioactive water leaking into the sea at levels 6 500 times above legal limits. The risk of contaminated food products is high. Europe has established very strict controls but this applies only to fresh products. No rule has been issued to safeguard processed products, in particular tinned fish. We import 370 000 tonnes of tinned tuna. The principal suppliers are the countries of South-East Asia, which import fish from Japan. This means that tinned fish imported into Europe may contain Japanese fish. The provision of precise information about place of origin is crucial and urgent. Today consumers know where the tin was produced but not the place where the fish was caught. The Commission has recently acknowledged this and plans to close this gap with the reform of the common fisheries policy, but that will not enter into force until two years from now, just as the Sommer report, which is being debated in this plenary session, will not take effect until three years from now. We should not indulge in scaremongering but consumers have the right to urgent and clear information. The Commission should intervene as soon as possible. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I should like to express my overall satisfaction about the adoption of Mr El Khadraoui’s report. I believe it represents a step forward for consumer and environmental protection, including in terms of the positions of individual Member States, which sometimes complain of delays. Essentially, I think that by adopting this measure, Europe has demonstrated that it is further ahead than many Member States, which will clearly have to remedy this situation in short order. I come from a country whose government was rather tardy in expressing its interest in this directive. I therefore hope that Parliament’s decision will be productive and function as a stimulus so that the attitudes and the level of attention for this issue will be substantially improved in the not too distant future.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that this measure will mean that issues related to the Mediterranean are about to embark on an even more binding phase than has been achieved through the acts implemented to date. I believe that the act we are focusing on today is much more important than the effects of the 2006 EU regulation. I think it also offers a response to some limitations of that regulation which, because it is unilateral, has left large sections of the fishing industry with the idea that Europe is doing its bit but the other Mediterranean countries are not. I think it is strategic for us to address the issue from this aspect and with these characteristics. I believe that the work done by Mr Rivellini, which has been broadly welcomed, deserves formal thanks in this session.  However, I have the distinct feeling that the fact that we cannot resolve this issue on first reading and will move to a second reading, particularly over the interpretation of Article 28 of this regulation, raises one question: Parliament is siding with the Commission this time. Parliament is saying in essence that it is a good thing for these delegated acts to be the responsibility of the Commission and there is some resistance by the Council and, by the way, its absence today is significant. This act means that Parliament is now convinced that the operation of maintaining biodiversity, maintaining the abundance of fish in this important sea, will help secure the future of the fishers. That said, I think the next stage in the process must place the focus back on the idea of codecision. These delegated acts are delegated for a reason, and thus, today, they are the responsibility of the Commission, but the international agreements, when they come, have to be firmly the responsibility of Parliament. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think we have two problems, one relating to the method and the other to the merits of this matter. The problem with the method is that we are making use of an artifice, for which we thank Mrs Fraga, which is that of the oral question, to talk about something that should really, after the Treaty of Lisbon, be a Parliamentary right. I think this practice should end; we cannot resort to a strategy to see through an ordinary legislative procedure. Codecision occurs when this process is cultivated as the process develops. Today, we are having this debate, it will end, the agreement will go ahead and we will say yes or no at the end. This method should be changed. On the merits, however, because I agree with many things other Members have said, I simply wanted to stress the importance of measuring the effects of fisheries agreements to ensure these are not just mere trade agreements enabling us to buy cephalopods for EUR 1 per kilo in Mauritania. They must be able to measure sustainability but, above all, the impact on the economy of that country, to appreciate the quantitative change in employment figures, to appreciate the rate of innovation of small-scale fishing and to appreciate the use of these resources. It is not purely and simply about commercial trade, but a fisheries agreement, with all its implications. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

Madam President, a new season of rights is upon us, but these rights could have been more widespread. We must be aware that at distances of less than 250 km, the rights of the most vulnerable, of disabled people, old-age pensioners, and persons with reduced mobility, are not addressed at all in this measure. If it is true that homogenised quality standards are being established, it is just as true that excluding local transport seriously limits the number of passengers affected. Implementation over the course of the next four years will allow the sector to prepare itself as well as possible, but we will also need to monitor the establishment of the enforcement bodies. The result of this process represents a victory for Parliament and is a positive sign of our attention to citizens’ needs. However, compromise always implies mediation – and in this case concessions – of this House’s aims. Basically, we have shown that we are good interpreters of needs, in contrast to the Council which has shown that it only represents interests. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not want to break up this joyful atmosphere. It is true that we have come to the end of the phase begun in 2005, during which diplomacy helped to ensure that events unfolded in the best possible way. However, there are still many unresolved problems. This is a young country and will be a young country once secession has taken place. It is a country that still needs to establish its borders, address the issue we have heard mentioned several times of the conflicts in the Abyei region, the issue of the oil pipeline, which is the most important thing in that country, and also the international aid system. I would therefore like to make a very simple point to the Commissioner. There are two or three things that we need to do. We need to establish a strategy for Southern Sudan, and recognise this new State on 7 February, without waiting until 9 July when the results of the election are made official. We also need to put our international service into action immediately, and establish a delegation in Southern Sudan. This is the only way to support a process; this is the only way for smart, strategic diplomacy to support this country on the path to democracy. I would note that the first thing that the country needs to do is to draw up its constitution, and Europe can be of great help in this. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, it is important to link the condemnation of these attacks and the call for urgent, concrete measures to protect Christians around the world with the more general demand for respect for the freedom of religion and freedom of conscience and thought. There is no difference between someone who is murdered while attending mass and someone who is sentenced to death for adultery or for belonging to a Muslim, Christian or Jewish minority, or for having been born in a particular place rather than for practising a religion. The right to freedom and coexistence is universally recognised by humanist culture and international conventions. In contrast, we are seeing the world divided between those who uphold human rights and those who want to brutally extinguish them. Only an attitude open to dialogue and against any form of intolerance can provide a basis for protecting identities and values. A lack of respect for these can even lead to the expulsion of entire communities from their historical homelands. There is a great deal of work for Europe to do in this respect at a political and diplomatic level as well as in the cultural and social spheres. Today, we urge the Council and the Commission, and especially the High Representative for Foreign Affairs, to adopt clear guidelines for our relations with third countries in the context of the new European External Action Service. Bilateral agreements, too, must attach greater importance to the subjects of religious freedom and human rights more generally, violations of which should lead to the suspension of these agreements. I am also thinking that Europe should take a leading role in promoting dialogue between religions. A lack of such dialogue often goes beyond individual incidents and leads to real wars, in which religion conceals other, more complex reasons for conflict. Lastly, we must also look closer to home: there is no lack of cases of intolerance in Europe. Our cities are, in practice, multicultural, and that fact brings with it religious traditions and values that must be respected and afforded freedom of expression. There is, therefore, no alternative to dialogue and mutual respect. It is important to repeat the appeal made by religious communities. (The President cut off the speaker) Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have only one regret in this Chamber this evening, and that is that we are only discussing the Sahrawi people because the Moroccans have invaded the camp outside Laâyoune, and that is a shame for democracy in this Parliament. Parliament should have found the will to discuss this issue of its own accord, as it has been rotting on international negotiating tables for 30 years. This is the most significant political fact. We were forced into it by acts of violence, not because we autonomously decided to guarantee human rights. What is the fact that a referendum for self-determination should be held there, if not a question of respect for human rights? Precisely because Morocco is our friend, because Morocco is the strong party in the relationship, we must forcefully request that it is no longer possible to postpone this desire and follow up with all consequent actions. We must seek to create the conditions so that the aim of the UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) is not only to realise the conditions for a referendum which is constantly being postponed. We must try to use all the means at the disposal of the European Union to bring this event about and ensure that the referendum does justice to a people’s 30 years of suffering. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one minute is not long enough to cover four reports. I therefore congratulate the three other rapporteurs, but I will only comment on Mr Ferreira’s report. Adherence to the principles of biodiversity must be central to the actions which the European Union undertakes with regard to fishing and aquaculture. The compromise amendment is the result of the good work carried out by Mr Ferreira, who has clearly understood these concerns. We must not have preconceived ideas when looking for ways to improve fish farming standards, but we must be rigorous in the control and application of regulations which are as precise as possible, in order to avoid the risk of altering the environmental balance. In this way, the greatest support for organic production is a decision which is made in the general interest and which encompasses the protection of biodiversity. That, in fact, is the best way of optimising the production of native species. Commissioner, I hope that, as part of the common fisheries policy reform, this further measure with regard to aquaculture can be included in one simplified regulation. This will simplify matters greatly, and I hope that a single regulation on aquaculture will make the procedures as a whole even simpler. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 30 years ago, Morocco denied for many years that there was a war with the Sahrawi people and today, it is still denying that there is disproportional repression of these same people. Yet, in the Western Sahara, there are dead and wounded people of a population that is only claiming the right to live in freedom in its own land. Morocco has largely closed its borders to anyone who could witness these events. No information and no members of parliament are allowed in. A member of the French parliament and our fellow Member, Mr Meyer, were denied access. Europe looks on passively. There is no news from the Commission on this matter, which makes us subordinate to United Nations mediation, which continues to fail just as it has done for the past 30 years. Baroness Ashton, who is responsible for foreign policy, has not taken a stand on the subject. We need to react by Parliament making a stand. We need to react against Morocco, curtailing all initiatives on commercial agreements, beginning with the renewal of the fishing agreements. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur. When it comes to integrated maritime policy, we must go beyond the stage of good intentions and give fresh impetus to a strategy that will represent a route to growth and development in the European Union, making up for the huge amount of time lost in the prevention of environmental disasters, and in the fight against climate change and pollution. Only this morning Mr Pirillo reminded Parliament of yet another catastrophic event that occurred the other day in the town of Paola, in Calabria. The Commission must prove that it is making a real effort, that it is not just using its instruments of governance but actually implementing targeted legislative measures, and duly learning its lessons from past mistakes caused by an approach that was often too sectoral in nature. We are fully aware that this is a very complex process, but we are at a difficult and demanding juncture where no lapse in attention can be tolerated and where adequate investment and shared governance mechanisms are needed both at interinstitutional level and in international cooperation for the regional basins, among which the Mediterranean stands out because of the complexity of its jurisdiction. That is why it will be crucial to view the management of the Mediterranean basin as an asset shared by all the coastal States, on the basis of the res communis omnium
, or common heritage, principle. Otherwise, the increasingly widespread practice of unilaterally declaring exclusive economic zones or the like in the Mediterranean Sea, as well as running counter to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, would undermine the idea of effective, shared governance. I would point out in this respect that, only a month ago, this interpretation on the part of Libya resulted in an actual armed assault on a European fishing boat, and it would be wrong to argue that this is just a matter between Italy and Libya. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

Madam President, the revision of the agreement between Parliament and the Commission establishes the basis for improved collaboration between the two institutions. Much progress has been made with regard to procedure, legislative planning, parliamentary scrutiny, requirements to provide information and the Commission’s presence in Parliament. However, the point which I am most eager to highlight is the progress made with respect to the interinstitutional aspect of international relations. The role given to Parliament should not be considered as strengthened: it is a requirement. We hope that no one casts doubt on allowing the presence of European Parliament observers at multilateral and bilateral international conferences as anything but an act of responsibility. Indeed, denying the status of observer to Members of the European Parliament in bilateral agreements, such as, for example, fisheries agreements, prevents, de facto, full knowledge of the area being negotiated, upon which Parliament will subsequently be required to express its opinion. I believe that it is not possible to do without these preconditions, as otherwise we would end up with Parliament rejecting bilateral agreements which, by definition, cannot be amended and which, in the absence of a partnership, would make the vote a mere formality. Guido Milana,

 Madam President, Commissioner, Members of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, on 4 May we in committee unanimously voted in favour of the report on European aquaculture, which is essentially aimed at promoting the sustainable development of the sector. I would like to begin by thanking everyone who worked on this report over the last few months, providing me with valuable support. This text was, in fact, drafted over many long months of work, consultation and concerted action, and I hope it will provide the foundation on which to promote a suitable aquaculture policy in a serious, practical and effective manner. I also think that, in the light of its technological potential and innovative aspects, the healthy and sustainable development of aquaculture represents an extremely important resource for the European economy. In adopting the report, the MEPs have first of all demonstrated great awareness, highlighting that they have fully understood the urgent need for legislative clarity in this area. In other words, they have proved that they are indeed aware of the negative consequences caused by the lack of a single regulation on aquaculture, the confusion among operators in the sector, the complex and excessively bureaucratic procedures, the highly discriminatory situations, the market distortions and the low level of competitiveness of European production. The report maintains that there is a need to provide greater impetus to the sector by establishing a specific aquaculture fund that is either independent or part of the European Fisheries Fund, to be used to support research and innovation, to further the virtuous coexistence of sustainability and competitiveness, and to focus serious attention on employment issues. Admittedly, many measures are needed in the short term in order to deal with and resolve all of the problems that currently plague this sector, and they are not easy to implement. I am talking about an integrated maritime development plan, which is essential for making aquaculture facilities in freshwater, sub-coastal and offshore areas compatible with areas for tourism and other activities of financial importance, all within the framework of the regulations on environmental protection. I am talking about the drafting of a regulation that will consider the specific aspects of each type of aquaculture farming, to be introduced above all with the intention of lowering production costs and of guaranteeing environmental protection. From this perspective I believe that the contribution made by both technological innovation and scientific research is crucial. The task will be to actually establish facilities to reduce the dispersion of feed into the water. To this end it will be necessary to increase the utilisation of plant instead of animal proteins without altering the nutritional value of the catch. With regard, more specifically, to scientific research on feed, we will also have to focus on waste and processing scraps to prevent likely imbalances in the maritime system caused by dangerous overfishing for fish feed. The use of the European quality label helps us to compete with products imported from third countries and to meet consumers’ needs and health requirements. Indeed, I believe that it is now crucial that we introduce product certification and supervision of the sector to enable these products to be identified, and adapt the labelling systems accordingly. Last but not least, we need to design facilities that take greater account of the wellbeing of fish, farm density and slaughtering methods. Moreover, these are all measures that should be applied to organic products, too, which are in fact the result of production that is on a smaller scale and less damaging to the environment. The employment aspect must not be underestimated, since the aquaculture sector may also be the best place for fishermen who have lost their jobs. A full vote by Parliament will certainly be the best incentive for the Commission, after its communication and our reasoned opinion, to go beyond the stage of recommendation to the Member States and actually propose the measures needed in order to develop a European policy and to stop Europe being the producer of 1.2 million tonnes of fish and the consumer of over 5.5 million tonnes. Thank you, and excuse me for running over. Guido Milana,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the debate and for your positive comments on this document, which has all the same enjoyed widespread support over the last few months. Commissioner, you have a historic opportunity. In 2001 Parliament discussed this same subject and published a communication, but there has been no follow-up. However, today I believe that the time is ripe. Since 2001 world aquaculture production has increased by 6% while European production has barely increased by 0.8%. Indeed, with such a broad consensus – which I believe will result in a majority vote by this House in an hour or so – you have the real possibility to put our work to good use. What is more, the Council has also encouraged you in this direction by fully endorsing the stance that Parliament is taking. I believe, therefore, that this occasion must be fully taken advantage of in two ways. I would have liked to have said this to Mr Stevenson, who is no longer here: delegislation and simplification absolutely do not mean lowering the level of guarantees for operators and consumers. Often, delegislation can mean making the guarantees clearer for both consumers and producers. Therefore we need to make an effort along these lines. There is only one point on which I too disagree slightly. I believe that you are too resigned to matters to challenge the European framework surrounding the powers of the Directorates-General. Have the courage to do so, Commissioner. Have the courage to do so, because simplification in the interests of Member States and European citizens only helps to strengthen European integration. If there is one thing that is clear to me, it is the specific point that Parliament is making to you today: that one should not always be restricted with regard to the powers of the Directorates-General. There is someone who assigns those powers, I therefore ask you to reflect on them too. This does not mean taking away a duty or function from the authority supervising the environment. It does not mean taking away a function from the authority supervising consumer protection. It means having a Europe in which these functions are fully integrated. That is basically the sole aim of the single regulation: to streamline the regulations in order to make them simpler and more practical for operators. I have one last comment. After the speech this morning I am tempted to go on holiday to Scotland, and I may just consider doing that, but I would not be against Greece either, if I could change your mind there about the last few points which divide us. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to highlight two points and also thank Mr Romeva i Rueda for his extraordinary work. The first point is that this is an important occasion because we are adopting a law at first reading for the first time. The second is that this work has a deadline and that deadline, as Mr Romeva i Rueda already stated at the beginning, is the next Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) meeting, in four years’ time. If what we have written and will adopt today works, then in four years’ time we will probably not have the problem of inclusion in the CITES. That is my hope. I do not want this so much for the sake of fishermen, but for the sake of tuna. The effectiveness of our action derives from our ability, over the next four years, to apply the regulation that is adopted today and to develop supervision conditions. I would like to say a few words on this aspect. We have an extraordinary Control Agency in Vigo, which does a good job of controlling tuna fishing in the Mediterranean. Yet this agency, which has limited funding and needs greater resources, single-handedly coordinates controls, or rather it offers the individual Member States the possibility to do so. I think we need to take a look at this agency and try to create the conditions to grant it direct responsibility for controls and a greater degree of authority that goes beyond simple coordination. Please excuse me for running over. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I support – and I have also tabled amendments in this regard – the inclusion of bluefin tuna in Appendix II. Supporting this certainly does not make feel me like a criminal. On the contrary, I feel very much on the same wavelength as those who, before me, starting with Mrs Gardini, upheld a different position. It is deeply flawed to put tigers, polar bears, elephants and tuna on equal terms. The FAO would never allow itself to say anything different or to support a different position for these other endangered species. Holding a different view on how to manage the tuna issue certainly does not mean forgetting that biodiversity is a value that must be defended at all costs. The spirit of the motion for a resolution is absolutely worthy of support. However, at a time when some people seem to be taking a step backwards in terms of estimating tuna biomass in the sea, rapidly moving towards inclusion in Appendix I probably means overlooking the side effects of this choice, which are severe and sometimes irreversible in many sectors of our economy. In some ways, the same goes for the issue of coral and for its inclusion in Appendix II. Here, too, there is data that does not definitely indicate the extinction or endangerment of deep coral, coral that is at a depth of more than 150-200 metres, which is what is covered by the measure. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT) 
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make just two observations. I think that we ought not to argue about greater privatisation, competition or what have you. It is clear that the logic of rushing to reduce costs is a negative factor in terms of safety standards. When there are attempts to reduce costs because a major competition mechanism is launched, it is inevitable that safety standards should fall. The real issue is that I believe the Commission ought to initiate a more rigorous phase based around a more strategic role for the European Railway Agency. It ought to take on a role of greater coordination, control and supervision over the national safety agencies, and it ought to do so in a much speedier manner precisely because of the differences between the various countries, which my fellow Members have already alluded to, regarding contradictions between national and European legislation. In my view, there are huge delays on this aspect. The model ought to be that of the European Aviation Safety Agency, and it should have the same binding powers over actions and enforcement. If there is a call to be made to the Commission today, it is that it should move more swiftly in this direction. The Commissioner has said that we need to wait for the results of the investigations into the accidents. On the contrary, I believe that these results will add nothing to the existing situation. Another element, Commissioner, which probably does not fall within your sphere of responsibilities, and which is probably also outside the scope of this evening’s debate, is that, all too often, the legislation as a whole does not ensure that anyone suffering loss or damage as a result of a railway accident – given that the rate of railway accidents is still low – receives immediate acknowledgment from the person bearing liability for it.

 Mr President, we still have a long way to go, but today we may have taken an important step towards finally introducing and levying a tax on financial transactions. I understand the prudence, the caution, the need to do things gradually expressed by Mr Šemeta and the technical issues rightly raised by Ms Vestager. Precisely for this reason, though, I hope that Parliament will express a clear, political will, with a broad majority, in order to encourage and drive forward the initiatives necessary to address the unresolved problems, especially at Council level. We all want to closely examine the impact of this tax, but it is not right to stir up unfounded fears which could even lead to contradictory and counterproductive choices. I refer, for example, to the rationale behind the proposed exemptions. If we are careful to reduce the impact of the tax, it is important to have as broad a tax base as possible, with a low rate, and not to attempt to extend the exemptions ad infinitum
. To those who are concerned about the consequences for small investors, I would point out the progressive nature of the tax, so those who carry out several transactions are affected more, and it is clear that the competent authorities must, in any case, ensure that there are no attempts to offload the possible costs onto end users. I therefore hope that Parliament will vote in favour of this tax by a large majority. Leonardo Domenici  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to ask Mr Barroso some questions, but I am happy to ask them of Mr Rehn. Commissioner, have you and the European Commission read that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) does not expect Italy to balance its budget in 2013 or very likely in 2014 either? Does this forecast stimulate any particular thoughts? I am speaking about Italy, but I could very easily be speaking about other countries. The strangest thing is that the IMF tells us, of course, that if there were no recession, Italy would have a surplus of 0.6%. That is great. However, the problem is that there is a crisis, there is a recession, and it is difficult to pretend that there is not. Mr Rehn, in Europe, are we making choices based on an analysis of the actual situation we are experiencing, or are we simply applying a doctrine based on abstract principles? I believe that we continue to focus on objectives that are not in line with the economic cycle. Commissioner, today, we have been told about the European Commission’s plans for growth, but are you sure that growth based on supply-side policy principles is enough, without considering the at least equal importance of a policy that acts on the aggregate demand side? Commissioner, I shall end with an appeal. I beg you to speak truthfully to European citizens, truthfully about the crisis and the concrete fact that we still do not have any choices to take at the moment. Leonardo Domenici  (S&amp;D

Mr President, yesterday in Florence, an extremely serious event took place which has caused horror and anguish: an armed fifty year-old man opened fire on five citizens of Senegalese origin in two markets in Florence – two of these victims have died and three are now in a serious condition in hospital. The murderer then committed suicide. The man was a member of the racist and xenophobic far right, who wanted to kill people who were strangers to him, guilty only of having black skin. Florence is my city, and before being elected to the European Parliament I was mayor of Florence for ten years. Florence is a civilised and democratic city, with a gold medal for resistance to Nazi fascism. Yet this abominable racist crime took place in Florence, a demonstration of the fact that Nazi fascistic madness can appear anywhere and we must never think that it has been wholly eradicated. Mr President, I ask you to express the European Parliament’s grief and to repeat this House’s commitment to combating every kind of intolerance and racism and working to improve respect for the dignity and rights of all human beings. Leonardo Domenici  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis is not a new phenomenon; it has existed for several years. Perhaps now is the time to undertake a critical review of the policies implemented up to now: have things always been done well? Have we always analysed the situation correctly? Has the right approach been chosen? Has the European Central Bank which, as Minister Rostoski said, has saved Europe, always taken the correct course of action, even when it has raised interest rates through fear of inflation? President Barroso has identified a problem: the speed of the markets and the slowness of policy; yet is this the only problem? Of course, if we consider that we are still implementing the 21 July agreement, this ought at least to suggest that we need to prepare for and organise summits and their conclusions better, but policy will always lag behind the markets. We therefore need to look further, concentrating our efforts on combating unemployment and encouraging growth. These are the areas that the European Commission should focus on; even today in President Barroso’s speech, there was more substance with regard to the deficit than with regard to signs of growth and development. The Commission must overcome its failings and state that the priority is the fight against unemployment, job creation, the redistribution of wealth and public investment strategies, while also amending the rules in the new European Stability and Growth Pact.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Tusk, your speech fills us with hope, the hope that the Polish Presidency will help combat the Europe of national selfishness, which fails to look to the future, and will help further a Europe that genuinely thinks of itself as being real, integrated and sharing a common destiny. However, as you rightly said in your speech, presidencies have specific problems to tackle and solve. In the short time that I have, I wish to draw your attention to two crucial issues relating to the economic and financial crisis. The first issue concerns the reform of the financial markets. This is not a technical problem but a major democratic issue of our time. Too much time is being taken: we need to settle issues such as the one relating to the reform of short selling and over-the-counter derivatives. The second issue is that we have the matter of the tax on financial transactions to address; we need to look at this issue in detail, and we hope that the Polish Presidency will make a real contribution in this regard. Leonardo Domenici,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to join in thanking Mr Langen and the other Members with whom we have worked to finalise this complex report. I think that Mr Langen made a particularly important point when he said that we wish to maintain the scope of this regulation, keeping faith with the mandate of the G20 in Pittsburgh in 2009. The basic objective was to bring the majority of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives onto regulated platforms in order to prevent their continuing exposure to a high level of risk and speculation. When it comes down (as it did) to exchanging or guaranteeing USD 400 million without collateral, that is, without adequate reserves, the risks we are running become clear. Having said that, however, I should also like to raise two problems. The first problem is the relationship with the Council; the second problem is the coherence of the proposal for reform of the financial markets that we must take forward. I raise the problem regarding the Council first and I say it very clearly. The feeling is all too often that the Council represents an obstacle to reforming the financial markets swiftly and well. I hope that the new Presidency will take on this problem because this time too we have to factor in an extension that is due in large measure to positions, difficulties and disputes arising in the Council. It is a problem that also affects the procedure that we wish to follow. The second question relates to the coherence and specificity of the provisions. There is not only the measure on OTC derivatives but also the measure on short selling and other matters. I would like to draw attention to two points: the specific issue of the commodities market, a special market that requires special anti-speculation measures, and the problem of the exposure in derivatives of local authorities in EU countries. I think that these are problems on which Parliament must intervene. Leonardo Domenici  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we are witnessing a paradox. The package that should correct and prevent imbalances and asymmetries is based on an imbalance and a lack of symmetry. It is like a body that stands on two legs, but one is much longer and more developed than the other. The leg that controls fiscal policy is muscular and articulated, while the one that controls development policy, which should provide impetus and long-term drive, appears spindly and lacking in strength. I think that this inharmonious result in the final structure of the package is down to a difference of opinion about the origins and nature of the crisis. The difference between those who believe that disorder and imbalances in public finances are at the root of the crisis and those who think that the underlying problem has to do instead with the lack of rules and transparency in the markets, economic and trade imbalances and social inequality. We risk confusing cause and effect. We all want public finances to be controlled responsibly, but the goal of reducing debt is not sufficient to kick-start growth and competitiveness. The main thrust of these measures lies in procedures and sanctions. Far less emphasis – too little emphasis – has been placed on investment and sustainable growth strategy, which Europe should promote and implement. We know that our actions can lead to widely differing results, even without our intending it, and can even have the opposite effect to the one we are seeking to achieve. This is the heterogenesis of purpose. I fear that this problem lies at the heart of this package. Leonardo Domenici  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Podimata’s report contains many important aspects that are not limited to the issue of the financial transaction tax. The report is packed with analysis and suggestions and I hope it is widely supported by this House. It could be the basis for the genuine new European tax policy that we need. On the subject of tax harmonisation, this report also contains proposals that move towards a tax harmonisation that gives new strength and subjectivity to Europe, although it is clear that at the moment, the debate focuses mainly on the financial transaction tax, to be applied as a first step across Europe. I think this is the time for courageous decisions, which should be applied in a balanced way, but still indicate the direction forward. I believe that Europe has a responsibility to show the world the way ahead; I believe that this House has a responsibility to send out a signal and a political message. Let me say one thing to Mr Schmidt, whose intelligence and lucidity I really respect: be careful with the arguments we use, because if we say today that we cannot levy a financial transaction tax because there are tax havens, we will make European citizens feel helpless at a time when many of these financial institutions are starting to go back into the black. Not only the Socialists are saying this. In my country, Italy, this proposal is also supported by many autonomous and independent groups; it is also supported by the Catholic, democratic movement for the promotion of development and balanced growth.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although the theme of good tax governance has always been of great importance, it has become even more relevant and significant following the major economic and financial crisis of two years ago. European and international summits – the G20 – have discussed and continue to discuss it, particularly when they are concerned with fighting tax evasion and tax havens. All this is important. It is a sign of commitment and willpower, but we should not delude ourselves into thinking that an announcement is all it is going to take. We need an effective and ongoing policy. There are still many problems to be dealt with. It really is still much too easy to buy or set up a front company in order to avoid taxation. Just look around on the Internet: there are thousands of websites offering companies for sale, even in European Union countries. Often, all you have to do is send an email and attach a photocopy of a scanned passport in order to set up a company. We must put a stop to the practice of creating fictitious legal entities to evade tax. The report I am presenting is based on the European Commission communication of 28 April 2009 on Promoting Good Governance in Tax Matters. The report moves towards putting forward firm proposals, and calls for a strong commitment from the European Commission and Council, so that these proposals can be implemented. The fight against tax havens, tax evasion and illicit capital flight must be considered priorities of the European Union. Hence the principle of good governance, based on transparency, exchange of information, cross-border cooperation, and fair tax competition. The point is that we need increasing tax cooperation and collaboration in the European Union. The general objective that we must set ourselves is for automatic information exchange on a global and multilateral scale, but this must, obviously, start within the European Union. As Mrs Alvarez has already said, we must completely abolish bank secrecy in European Union countries and hasten to put an end to the temporary derogation that allows the application of a withholding tax, which is often evaded or underestimated, instead of an exchange of information. I do not wish to dwell on the tangible proposals that the report contains. I will, however, stress that we still particularly need the following things: to extend the scope of the 2003 Savings Directive, to fight VAT fraud, to create an EU public register listing the names of individuals and undertakings having set up companies or accounts in tax havens and to give new impetus to tax harmonisation projects, beginning with the common corporate consolidated tax base. The European Union must also send out only one message internationally, and fight for the improvement of OECD standards to achieve the automatic sharing of information, instead of sharing on request. Mr Kovács, having listened to the other reports as well, we need strong commitment by the Commission and we now also need these priorities to be emphasised to the new Commission at the time of handover. As the European Parliament, we are entitled to call on the Council and the Commission to account for their work. I thank my fellow Members, and especially the shadow rapporteurs, for the contribution they have made to this work, which I hope will be adopted by Parliament. Leonardo Domenici,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my thanks for the comments on our reports, the products of a collective effort. I hope that these comments are a good omen for a positive vote by the European Parliament. I believe that – as Mr Stolojan and Mr Casa also said – our reports deserve support, if only on behalf of all our fellow citizens: honest taxpayers, who are the first to suffer from fraud and tax evasion. The aim is to make everyone pay, so that each individual has to pay less. I would just like to make two comments. Mrs Lulling spoke, at the beginning of the debate, about tax colonoscopy. I know from experience that a colonoscopy is not a pleasant examination, even if it can be very beneficial to human health. In the sphere of tax, there is a very simple way of avoiding it: it is simply not to conceal, not to hide one’s own income and not to evade one’s legal obligations. The second comment is that it is right to always be concerned about how public money is being used, but it is also right to do so when governments are forced to use that public money to bail out banks and financial institutions that have speculated their money.

Mr President, we are here to debate again a topic of great importance. The positive outcome of the negotiations on the treaty for visually impaired and blind people will finally open access to millions of books across the world. We are dealing with a fundamental right, not with charity. Commissioner Barnier, I remember and recognise your personal commitment more than a year ago here in this room. We are now taking the very last steps before an agreement. In Marrakesh the Commission and the Member States must find a compromise to the deadlock we are now facing. Two points are still open. Excuse me if I go into detail. Are you going to change the provision in the current text on the commercial availability requirement which is basically watering down the meaning of the Treaty, which would be, paradoxically, even less ambitious than a memorandum of understanding? We must delete commercial availability. Secondly, are you allowing for the possibility of sending a book to an individual rather than two organisations? Remember the opportunities offered by current technology. Let us come back to the core reason for the treaty. The current legal framework and the functioning of the market are not sufficient to provide a real solution to the book famine that the visually impaired still live with. Our goal is to have a good and effective treaty for the benefit of blind and visually-impaired people. We will not just be unlocking a problem affecting millions of European citizens, we will also be showing our loyalty to our constitutive values – human dignity, culture, equality and freedom of access.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to congratulate Ms Geringer de Oedenberg for her most patient and persistent work, which has led to a result that we look upon favourably, despite a number of question marks. The directive we are going to adopt is important, not only because it increases the number of people with access to artistic and original works – which, in itself, is highly significant – but also because it marks a break from a position which, to date, has had a negative effect on the spread of culture: a reverence for copyright to the extent of wishing to defend it even if there is no right holder, who might have died or is unconcerned. Moreover, the narrow-mindedness of collecting societies is an obstacle to the spread of culture, which is why we have arrived here with delays and with great difficulty. I refer, for example, to attitudes on access for blind people to cultural works and attitudes on private copying. On this issue, we have found ourselves confronted with a kind of wall, which today – thanks to this measure – we have been able to demolish or at least breach. The measure we are going to adopt has great political significance and the step forward we are about to take surely deserves our approval. There are, no doubt, some shortcomings – so I also understand some of the concerns raised by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance – but these do not add up to a reason to fail to grasp this opportunity and the significant innovation that this step represents. Fortunately, Mr Barnier has tabled the regulation on collecting societies under debate in our committee, so we are addressing this critical issue in order that the whole range of arguments and topics relating to copyright can be dealt with in the right way. It is a good proposal, which we think needs amending and improving but is worthy of support, thus convincing us yet further to vote in favour. Luigi Berlinguer  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to draw this Chamber’s attention to the fact that yesterday, it was officially announced that the Higgs boson has been measured and definitively identified. The particle that gives mass to all the others and their existence, and this happened on European soil. Science brings our earth to life, it gives us civilisation and well-being and, for a time, we can aspire to becoming a scientific hub once again. Utopia is characteristic of man, who invents a utopia and wants to build it, and it is through science and this wonderful ambition man has that today someone who is blind, who has no eyes, can see with his hands or read a book with his ears, and a young South African boy who has no legs can compete in the Olympics in a race. Well, Europe must be the home of science! This great event that will open up new frontiers of knowledge must be completely supported by Europe. Luigi Berlinguer  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) has been a very serious political mistake, not to mention a legal one, because it has caused a worldwide reaction of immense proportions, and that is enough to say that it is a political mistake. Why immense? Because it has created the suspicion that access to the Web, which is a great modern revolution, would really be inhibited. Why is this? Because it has made the mistake of lumping together counterfeiting and piracy, which are two totally different issues. The way to combat counterfeiting has nothing to do with copyright. Then there is another mistake, in that it has excluded Parliament from an important activity that it has been doing for some time: creating a new copyright, although some people would like to retain the old copyright law, which existed before the Web. The point is that we have to work on copyright and put ACTA aside, as it is an obstacle. We have to reject it, exclude it, because it is an obstacle to our work. Fortunately, the Commission, after months and years of hesitation, has brought two important measures to the attention of Parliament: orphan works and the one regarding copyright management companies. This is positive; let us work on this rationally rather than just emotionally, but without letting ACTA get in the way. Luigi Berlinguer,  
rapporteur. 
– Madam President, let me thank all the colleagues of the Committee on Culture and Education for their collaboration in preparing this report on the Bologna process on the consolidation and development of a European university system. I have a dream that every student applying to a university in any Member State should be enabled to get a degree, a qualification valid in all the territories of Europe, within the whole European labour market. This is definitely one of the ways to build up European unity and European citizenship. This is the deep meaning of this report. (Loud applause) Luigi Berlinguer,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I too would like to echo the warm greetings extended to Mr Lechner and the assessment of his work, which he carried out with competency, tenacity and determination: a labour of love, sometimes this draft regulation met with an obstacle and he withdrew it and began negotiating again with the Council, with the Commission, and with the Committee on Legal Affairs. I believe he can be proud of this. I note that there is unanimous consensus in his favour. Turning to this regulation of ours, I too am convinced that this is an important thing, which may not hit the headlines in the press, may not be considered high politics, but the construction of the European Union also involves meeting the needs of citizens in their daily lives – first and foremost of those millions of people with interests in more than one Member State dealing with procedures that are difficult to unravel, tedious and which sometimes touch on sensitive issues at the heart of a family which politics generally finds difficult to grasp. The European Union should take pride in being based on such sensitive attention. The solutions that have been proposed are new and intelligent ones. For example, those drawing up a will have been given the freedom to choose between their habitual residence and their state of origin. This makes decision-making more flexible, since there are such major differences between one State and another that the question of succession could always be rather tricky. But the law has also been made more certain, because once the legal solution has been chosen – either habitual residence or country of origin – this requires limitations of the jurisdiction and of the conflicts that can arise and therefore it is a more peaceful way of proceeding in this area and so there is more freedom and more certainty. Then there is the certificate of succession: now, we may believe that certificates are of little importance, but they create the conditions to ensure the heir is in a condition of greater flexibility and certainty with regard to all the possible difficulties that may arise. That is a positive aspect of this law. It is true,  this law is by no means perfect: there are problems concerning whether there is an executor of the will or not, the feasibility of direct inheritance, and so on, but I just want to say another word of a political nature. We hope that the Council will approve this text, and we hope it will become law. However, we must not lay this text to rest, because we cannot have England in a different condition – with the United Kingdom left like that – because Europe cannot do without the United Kingdom, and so we must therefore make sure that we overcome these difficulties. Thank you. Luigi Berlinguer,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has produced a massive amount of laws and standards to establish European legislation, and has created the European area known as the Stockholm Programme. There is an imbalance between this monumental amount of legislation and the use which citizens make of it, which is numerically, in percentage terms, very limited. On the other hand, national judges, lawyers working within individual States have grown up with the legislation of their own country and are mainly trained in this sense, whereas we believe that the true European judges are national judges capable of changing their mentality and imbuing themselves with a knowledge of European law. Therefore, before talking about training we need to discuss a great communication campaign aimed at citizens and legal practitioners, so that they can be the vehicles for this great innovation andso that they can increase capacity to profit from the benefits provided by this legislation. Primarily, though, it is a grassroots movement that must be created, through in-service training – we cannot provide judicial training of professionally highly qualified adults as if it were a lesson for schoolchildren. We must stimulate curiosity in dealing with their cases, encouraging them to connect with other colleagues and to come up with solutions, given that today common law and civil law are converging, and are not as far apart as they once were within our judicial culture. This is the real point. In our proposals, and I am happy that the European Commission is now convinced of this, we are calling for a reversal of the trend: bottom-up, more legal status than judicial training. There in a very interesting example in the Netherlands, called Eurinfra: it is a network of leaders in every court who spread this knowledge and push magistrates on this issue. This is the substance of our project, and we hope to have the full support of the Commission. Luigi Berlinguer,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the purpose of this report is to relaunch the initiative on the Bologna Process, keeping in our minds and in our sights an important goal, which is that qualifications awarded by universities across Europe must have overall recognition and validity. Once someone has earned a qualification at a university in a Member State, it must be such that all other universities recognise it, this is the main objective. It is a mistake to consider university education as a matter that is exclusively internal to Member States. The true dimension of the university and place of study is international, because studies and research are international, and professions are now international. We need to free the professional market from the shackles and ties which today impede employment mobility within Europe. This is a precondition that has economic value and also provides a response to a great aspiration on the part of young people. Who is this task incumbent on? It is up to individual Member States to organise study courses, but recognition abroad is not a task that can be performed within the State, it is up to the European Union to provide and make a policy to encourage this. Article 149 of the Treaty of Lisbon states that it is the task of the EU to recognise qualifications, contribute to the development of the quality of education and higher education, and develop its European dimension. For this reason, our report points out that, as well as the responsibility of the Member States, there is also a need to underline the EU’s responsibility; and the biennial meetings of the ministers of education, such as the upcoming one in Bucharest, must gradually come under the remit of the EU. What is to be done then? Our report identifies a number of measures, within the framework of a series of procedures, a gradual approach to achieve them: to support any actions that tend to give a European profile to universities within the EU; curriculum flexibility; learning outcomes and consequently monitoring for the assessment of learning outcomes; assessment for the quality of what happens in universities as a condition to create that trust between different higher educational establishments which lies at the heart of mutual recognition. The final goal is to set up automatic procedures that attest to the validity of qualifications throughout Europe. Secondly, remove social barriers against young people, against students from weaker sections of society, which today are being exacerbated by the cuts on the part of many governments. Change the teaching, to make it more learning centred, develop life-long learning, build a European higher education sector to enter into dialogue with the European research sector. These measures are instruments of growth. More than 900 years ago in Bologna, a great jurist, Irnerius, spread the idea of creating with the Alma Mater
 the unification of European culture. It was a time when there were no States. Now that States do exist, there is a supranational dimension and today for that reason we call upon the EU to promote a European university citizenship. Thank you. Luigi Berlinguer  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what we are asking for is a new treaty to regulate exceptions for the visually impaired on cultural works and on books. This is not charity – it is a fundamental right to access culture. The European Union and, in particular, the Commission, has not been particularly active: it has not done enough and has, in my opinion, been too conservative, almost to the point, in essence, of boycotting the Treaty itself. I refer to the amendments proposed by the European Union in November in Geneva. Fine words need to be followed up by concrete action. Voluntary agreements are not enough: it is a treaty that we need. So we must remove the legal obstacles that block the circulation and usage of works in Braille and in electronic format, the latter being particularly suitable for the visually impaired. We must no longer come up with the pretext that the treaty represents a danger for copyright per se

Madam President, Commissioner, in Europe growth is now a necessity we can no longer put off. It depends also on liberalisation measures addressing the obstacles and privileges that are strangling the internal digital market as well. Among these is the need for a new copyright regime, in particular for collective rights management, given that copyright represents 7% of our European gross domestic product (GDP). Reform is urgent, Commissioner, and we have awaiting it for a long time now. It has been announced many times with deadlines and dates that have never been respected, as you have indirectly admitted. We have been waiting for this directive for over two years, just as we have been hoping that the subject of Directive 2004/48/EC on the Enforcement of Property Rights and Directive 2001/29/EC would be addressed by an up-to-date scheme of exceptions. One had hoped that it would come to pass within this parliamentary term. Yet today our debate is contaminated with ‘ideologisms’ that artificially set artists in conflict with the right of free access to the web, in a paralysing conflict that is both noxious and sterile. All this must be resolved with innovative legal and technological ideas for a new concept of artists’ rights, which begins in the first place with their management. Although interesting proposals and opinions have been put forward, no progress has been made on this idea. Mr Barnier, you had significant success with patents, for which I congratulate you because I hold you in high esteem. On this issue, however, you are stalling. Why? Both you and the rapporteur, Ms Gallo, have spoken of genuine difficulties which, as you have said, partly justify this delay. The problem is that existing collective management companies and record companies represent powerful interests that are defending their patch. That is the main obstacle. I say no to territoriality, no to reasonable derogations, no to broad collective licences, no to incentives for new business models, no to greater transparency, no to interoperability for format shifting. All this is what makes for delay. What we need are well-fashioned reforms that do not create oligopolies capable of distorting the market, the cultural industries and small players and of stifling diversity and the cultural wealth of Europe. That is why we are hoping that this ‘spring’, awaited so earnestly by all, will finally arrive. Luigi Berlinguer  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the absence of a European patent can no longer be tolerated. Businesses in Europe are being penalised when it comes to patenting by costs 10 times as high as those faced by their US and Japanese competitors. Besides, the fragmentation of copyright in patents is one of the causes holding back economic recovery. The Commission is offering us enhanced cooperation with a specific language regime, something that we do not welcome. Nevertheless, there is something new. 25 out of 27 states are participating. The political framework has changed. Positive development may be possible, with an enhancement even of the proposer’s language, for example. We must all now work to achieve better respect for all. Besides, we want the Italian language to be protected and enhanced, but our government has cut funding and is very neglectful of this aspect. It is on this other ground that we shall be urging it on, but we must achieve a European patent. Luigi Berlinguer,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, due to the change in the agenda approved yesterday by this House, I would firstly like to express my approval for the fact that the Committee on Legal Affairs has unanimously approved the draft report that we are voting on today. The fact that the construction of the European judicial space finds such a broad consensus in Parliament is important. The Stockholm Programme envisages that everyday life should be intrinsic to the process of constructing a Europe of citizens and not merely of political forces or institutional representations. It sets out to resolve the everyday problems of Europeans by the real and unified creation of an effective market of labour, goods and services, entrepreneurial activity without internal borders and without red tape, to strengthen the common basis of rights of succession, contracts, consumers, timely payments, the family, children and more. It will also be the duty and responsibility of the justice system, national judiciaries, solicitors, accountants and workers who operate within individual States to build Europe, to interpret the laws that unite our continent. Our past is marked by different judicial and legal traditions – Common law and Civil law – with differences between the French or German systems and histories that are sometimes very different. We respect national prerogatives and the principle of subsidiarity, but we realise that in order to build Europe – and fortunately we are still on that road – we need progressive convergence that is based on the great constitutional tradition of fundamental rights for which Europe stands. Mr President, the Action Plan that we will approve sets out to construct, reinforce, extend and disseminate a solid European judicial culture, a European legal mindset. That is why I will vote in favour. Luigi Berlinguer  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in recent days, the Veneto region of Italy has been hit by serious natural disasters, in particular, the provinces of Vicenza, Padova and Verona. These catastrophic floods have affected around 500 000 people in various ways and have caused hundreds of millions of euro of damage. This tragedy has brought all productive sectors, small and medium-sized enterprises, and various other sectors, to their knees. I should like to appeal to my fellow Members and the European institutions to do everything possible to support these people and find solutions to respond to this disaster, within the limits of the rules set out by the European Union Solidarity Fund and the Structural Funds. I should also like to note that Italy also has another reason to weep today, although for a completely different reason: the collapse of Pompeii. I only wished to note it here in order to emphasise the significance and importance of an event of this type and the need for Europe to keep an eye on these things as well. Luigi Berlinguer,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we called for this oral question and a parliamentary resolution to make the Commission aware of the vital importance of fostering a common judicial culture throughout Europe as part of the Stockholm Programme. I would like to say at the outset that this is important but also that, with a view to the communication that the Commission will have to produce on future pilot projects, as already discussed, we would like to clarify some points. First of all, we would like the parliamentary consultations to start soon so that we do not get to the initial phase, when we begin to draw up an idea for these future projects, too late when the projects have already been more or less fully formulated. I say this because we have some basic observations to make. National judges and prosecutors in individual states are now crucial pawns in the construction of Europe because, by interpreting national rights in a European light, they can lay the ground for settling disputes and regulating the daily lives of citizens. By doing so, they engender a sense of European citizenship; they engender a European sensibility in everyone who inhabits these lands. This comes about because the people are made to feel the tangible benefits of introducing European elements and hence Community law, above all, into all State laws so that our citizens can live better lives. This offers real advantages for overcoming problems that would otherwise remain unresolved. By saying this, my aim is to turn the whole system slightly on its head. For example, we do not agree that these projects should be along the lines of Erasmus projects because the number of judges and prosecutors involved in Erasmus-style projects would be very low. This could not be otherwise due to the high costs of physical mobility in this field and the numbers would not therefore be very significant within the judiciary as a whole. The most important question concerns the term ‘familiarisation courses’, which we introduced in our paper. Judges are not schoolchildren sitting behind their desks waiting to be taught a lesson. They are mature and highly professional people with little time to spare and who cannot therefore easily move around. Despite this, they hold a valuable store of knowledge and should be stimulated to pit their knowledge against the new problems of European law and European culture. This will create fertile ground for exchanges, virtual rather than physical, using technologies, the Internet and the various opportunities such exchanges can create. Their starting point should be not so much a general approach but rather the individual cases, the individual problems that judges and prosecutors have to deal with. The cases and problems are new and must stimulate the professional growth of these legal operators, providing them with the stimulus they need to make an effective contribution, based on autobiographical reflection on their experience and what they have learned, to respond to the challenges represented by Europe in positive terms. As you see, Mr President, Commissioner, we intend to break with the tradition of the courses that have been held so far and that we feel are not really fit for purpose. We would like to know how much and what funds are available and express our doubts over the idea – as we stated in our communication – of a Central European institution to oversee this process because we are in favour of a bottom-up movement and against centralisation. This is a new approach. What we wish to point out, however, is that unless we shape a European mentality among judges and prosecutors, who will, in this way, offer their services to justice and the citizens who call for it, we will not make Europe. This is therefore not only an important charter for European justice; it is an important charter for the development of European unity as a whole. Luigi Berlinguer  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, concluding negotiations with Croatia during 2010 is a feasible aim and the Swoboda report is a balanced examination of our progress and the steps we still need to take. Justice is now the area in which hard-hitting reform is still required. It is not enough to complete the necessary system reforms, adopt new laws and cooperate as required with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. I stress the need to build a true legal culture and mentality in line with European standards. Crucial to this is the independence of the judiciary, which is a central issue, and also the training, recruitment and career of magistrates, in other words, the fact that the government must not impose conditions of any kind on judges. I call on the Commission to consider the need for hard-hitting measures that address these issues during the final stage of the negotiations. Luigi Berlinguer  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, two innovations have been introduced by the Stockholm Programme as compared with the Hague Programme: a fair balance between rights and security and legal protection in both the criminal and the civil spheres. Security is a right: it means not being attacked in one’s own workplace, walking the streets without risking one’s life, not being the object of violence as a woman, not being exposed to acts of terrorism. The Member States and Europe must guarantee security. However, security measures that diminish the guarantees of freedom are measures that remove certainty from the law, and are thus the source of insecurity and barbarities. Think of Guantánamo. Europe is the fatherland of rights. The Stockholm Programme defines them today with an abundance of detail. There is a fair balance between, on the one hand, the discipline of measures to prevent crime and, on the other, the daily lives of citizens and their family, social, economic, work and study relations, which are all regulated by civil law and the civil justice system. That is the citizen’s Europe. It should be constructed within the Member States and the Community institutions. European society is more united, and mobility is more pronounced than is commonly believed. Mobility is now a right. The borders between the Member States are not impermeable walls, but nets through which society filters daily. The Stockholm Programme constitutes the institutional cornerstone that provides for judicial cooperation and mutual recognition, a European justice system (made up of the national systems and the Community system), both national and Community law, European citizens and European courts (both national and Community courts). European rules are dictated by Community rules and by the case-law of the European courts, but they also derive from the conduct of workers, businesses, students, and judges, both national and belonging to the European networks between operators of justice. It is a bottom-up process that the Stockholm Programme wishes to support. Parliament has done a great job with this resolution, which I hope will be adopted here by a large, unanimous vote, for which we have worked extremely hard. The Council should take it into proper account. The Treaty of Lisbon has not yet entered into force, but it is here, and present. Minister, may the Council be ambitious, and may it take to heart what we have drafted here and the many demands arising from it. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, an excellent compromise has been achieved which puts Europe on the right track to achieve the goals of the climate package. One of the successes is having maintained the target of 3% in relation to the energy efficiency of public buildings, an ambitious target at a time of economic crisis, which has great environmental value and will act as a lever for the EU’s economic growth. The directive lays the foundations for redesigning energy saving strategies, for which both private and public operators will need to call on experts in the sector, without whom the established goals will be difficult to achieve. That therefore paves the way for encouraging national training programmes for audit and energy saving experts. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, we have to face the evidence that all the available data are pointing to, which is the depletion of fish stocks. Some fish stocks have been seriously jeopardised, and therefore our objective must be to guarantee sustainable fishing if we wish to increase future fish production in our seas. Today’s debate is an anticipation of some of the central issues of the common fisheries policy. The lack of reliable data means that it is not possible to reach a shared definition of over-capacity, and it is crucial to avoid the risk of adopting measures that could penalise fishermen, given the serious crisis that has hit the sector. Fishing needs to continue to be an important source of employment and sustenance for families. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 as regards electronic identification of bovine animals and deleting the provisions on voluntary beef labelling is of fundamental importance for the defence of quality rearing, the protection of consumer information and food safety. By proposing the abolition of voluntary labelling, the Commission is weakening these aspects and preventing the consumer from having access to additional information, such as the sex, age and diet of bovine animals – elements I consider fundamental for two reasons: because they can help the consumer to make a more informed purchase and because they give added value to the product. The criticisms the Commission has made of the voluntary labelling system are based on heavy administrative burdens not offset by sufficient advantages. I should like to know on what basis this assertion is founded, given that the simulations provided by independent associations instead show that these costs are contained, and therefore justified in order to guarantee information that protects and benefits the consumer. For these reasons, I do not agree with the repeal of Articles 16, 17 and 18 in the Commission’s proposal. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in order to attract investment, the European Union must set up a political and legal framework based on objectives for sustainable growth, as per the Europe 2020 strategy. High-quality products and a strong propensity for research and innovation are the strong points of our economy; if they are to play a more important role then they need a true internal market, where businesses can compete openly. The Programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs 2014-2020 must provide a real opportunity for small and medium-sized enterprises. We need to create a new energy model that is not conditioned by the rising price of oil and can offer European businesses affordable energy access. The creation, as set out in paragraph 16, of a European observatory capable of monitoring the reduction of tax and bureaucratic barriers, and the implementation of cohesion policies, is an interesting idea.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, water is an essential and vital public good, which must be protected by means of an holistic approach to preserve it and rationalise its use. Improving efficiency and sustainability is a duty that we must not shirk, not least in view of the challenges of climate change. The target that we have set ourselves of achieving ecological and chemical ‘good status’ for our water by 2015 is a sine qua non
 of Europe’s environmental policy and a commitment to be strictly monitored. The European Union’s water legislation needs to be enforced and stricter penalty measures should be introduced. Some 20% of water in Europe is lost due to obsolete infrastructure, which it is crucial to improve if we want efficient water resource use and sustainable water management that can address the problems of water shortages and drought.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to congratulate the rapporteurs on the compromises reached in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, as they strengthen the Committee’s proposal by ensuring greater protection for vulnerable groups of consumers and an increase in the information provided. The exclusion of gluten-free products in the initial proposal is a prime example. It would have penalised a continually growing group of people affected by an illness caused by intolerance to an allergen, which does not allow them a complete and balanced diet able to provide an adequate nutritional profile to ensure physical well-being. In future negotiations with the Council a cross-cutting regulation may be proposed in conjunction with regulation (EU) No 1169/2011. In this case the generic term ‘gluten-free’ must appear with the term ‘suitable for coeliacs’ to make a clear distinction between products free from allergens and those for proper nutrition.

 We all remember the extensive damage caused by the flooding in Liguria and Tuscany, which rendered thousands of homes unusable, destroyed networks and infrastructure, and led to the loss of several lives. The economic damage is extremely high. I am astonished that, faced with this emergency, the funds provided for by the Solidarity Fund have not yet been granted. The rapid intervention of the fund is, in fact, essential for its credibility, and we cannot allow mere red tape to delegitimise the instruments that we have put in place. At a time when, following the crisis, citizens are starting to lose faith in Europe, it is vital for the institutions to respond in a timely manner, especially during an emergency.

 With today’s vote, Parliament has shown once again that it fully recognises the importance of volunteering in terms of mutual intercultural enrichment, social inclusion and active citizenship. I would say that it is Europe’s duty to promote and raise the standing of this activity among our citizens. In terms of the creation of social capital and cross-border development, I must stress that by promoting volunteering, the European Union can grasp a precious opportunity to assert and give form to the solidarity and socio-economic cohesion that inspired our founding principles. To that end, I agree with the creation of a European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps and the introduction of instruments providing for greater recognition of the professional skills acquired.

 Mr President, despite the progress that Turkey has made on human rights, I regret to say that violence against women is still one of the country’s most pressing problems. The official Turkish statistics are alarming: 39% of Turkish women are victims of violence. The establishment of the Committee on Equal Opportunities within the Turkish Parliament and the Gender Equality Commission within the Ministry of Education represent a step forward. The recognition of Turkish women’s rights must be an essential part of the negotiations for accession to the European Union. They must be granted the same rights to education, access to employment and to justice that men have. I voted in favour of the report because I hope that Parliament’s requests will be accepted in full by the European Commission. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 The citizens’ initiative introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon is a tool for participatory democracy, which involves citizens in decisions and actively helps to establish the political agenda through a shared path towards stronger European integration. Being able to present the initiative in a public hearing with the direct participation of the relevant parliamentary committee helps to strengthen our dialogue with European citizens, at a particularly difficult time for the solidity of the economy and for consolidation of political Europe. The times we are living in are characterised by the development of Eurosceptic movements, which is why I believe that the initiative is an important step to bring European citizens closer, even physically, to the EU institutions. For this reason, I voted in favour of the amendment to the Rules of Procedure. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, China is an important trade partner for Europe, and I firmly believe that our relations must be strengthened, without neglecting the numerous and persistent obstacles to fair, balanced trade. A new chapter in EU-China trade relations needs to be written, based on reciprocity and compliance with the rules. It is regrettable that China continues to apply non-tariff barriers that limit European companies’ presence in the Chinese market, giving rise to additional costs without creating opportunities for trade. Non-tariff barriers, breaches of intellectual property rights and human rights abuses remain among the biggest problems to solve. I hope that cooperation with the Chinese Government will eliminate the remaining obstacles by 2016, when the World Trade Organisation is due to grant China market economy status.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Armenia is fundamental and strategic for strengthening bilateral relations in the South Caucasus. The renewal of the association agreements with the EU will be crucial in order to pave the way for strengthened regional cooperation. With the EURONEST delegation, I have had the opportunity to visit Armenia and to see for myself the progress that has begun to take place in democratically building the rule of law and respecting human rights on the basis of the partnership agreements initiated in 1999. The participation of Armenia in parliamentary cooperation with EURONEST is an excellent indication of their willingness to adhere to European values and principles, for which there is broad consensus in civil society. I voted in favour of the association agreement and I feel that Armenia should commit itself to resolving the conflict in the south so as to avoid undermining the stability of the country.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the goal of reducing CO2
 emissions by 80-95% by 2050 enables us to lay the foundations for a post-carbon European economy. It also requires us to launch a new industrial revolution based on new thinking about the system of production, involving the whole socio-economic sphere, to create better awareness of energy consumption and the efficient use of land. Research will play a key role in fully exploiting renewable energy. With firm and binding objectives, we shall be able to prepare industry for the transition while preserving its competitiveness at the global level. Europe must take pride in having set out at every level on the road to protecting the environment and combating climate change. There is no way that we can negotiate with the environment, and that is why we must insist on solutions that lead to zero emissions, and why I am convinced that nuclear energy must not form part of the energy mix. As the rapporteur for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE), I am grateful to Mr Leinen and Mr Davies for their excellent cooperation. Thank you. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the report on the European Fisheries Fund (EFF) because I believe it is necessary and should not be delayed, in order to align EFF expenditure in all the EU countries as a matter of urgency. Therefore, I agree with Mr Ferreira in asking for its application at first reading. Ms Damanaki did well to propose an urgent measure for countries with little investment capacity, as this has often been reduced to historic lows as the report shows. The debate about the reform of the common fisheries policy has already begun and therefore, EFF expenditure needs to be accelerated also by increasing the cofinancing threshold by 10%, in order to avoid there being resources from the old programming period still to be spent from the time the new reform applies. It is important to avoid overlapping between the EFF and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF). Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the progress made by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia shows its strong desire to join the European Union. It is a strategic country in the Balkan region, is involved in several European initiatives, and is giving proof of cooperation and openness. The reforms of the judicial system, administrative decentralisation and initial, if weak, signs of a willingness to discuss freedom of expression are very hopeful signs for the future. However, the following issues are still worrying: respect for human rights, corruption levels and the lack of pluralism in the media. This country still has a long way to go, and the years leading up to its entry must act as a stimulus to speed up the necessary reforms for the country’s democracy to develop. I believe in an enlarged, strong Europe, and therefore I voted in favour of the resolution. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the progress that has been made, we do have to admit, unfortunately, that women are still subject to many instances of inequality in all areas, including active participation in decision making and the political process. This is a feature of all Member States and even of this House, since women occupy just 34% of the seats here. In order to achieve equality between men and women, we must first of all remove the cultural obstacles and start to talk about gender policy. The parties themselves have got to initiate this first step towards change. Various positive measures are put forward in Ms Pietikäinen’s report, which I wholeheartedly support. These include the measures on quotas for women which, while not the ideal solution, are the only feasible approach until we see a change of culture and outlook, as I said. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, the current economic crisis, together with the austerity measures adopted in some countries, has created new social categories at risk of poverty, including young people and elderly people. Given the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, the Annual Growth Survey must ensure consistency between the various priorities in its political guidelines in order to ensure that budgetary needs are based on social justice. I agree with the rapporteur on the need to act immediately in order to improve employment conditions for categories at risk of social exclusion and to make tackling youth unemployment a priority. Future national reform plans will need to include training programmes able to develop lifelong learning and to create qualified jobs with dignified pay and conditions. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, today’s vote is a first step in the direction of economic governance in Europe, as hoped for by Mr Delors as early as 1993. The introduction of Eurobonds, which I hope will come about within a reasonable timeframe, is part of a wider process that will lead the countries in the euro area to strengthen the coordination and achieve the integration of their economic and fiscal policies. The three options indicated in the European Commission’s Green Paper propose three different types of Eurobond, with a decreasing degree of solidarity between Member States. The serious economic crisis we are currently experiencing shows that no country is safe from financial speculation. To sceptics, I say that Eurobonds are, to date, the only practical answer to reviving growth and development in Europe. This is why I voted in favour. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the hundreds of petitions to the European Parliament from various EU countries clarify the extent and severity of the waste management problem. An interesting aspect of the report is the attention paid to the disposal of illegal waste that affects many regions. In my region, as a delegation from the European Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety was able to ascertain, high levels of caesium-137 have been detected. This is typical nuclear waste even though there are no nuclear power plants in Italy. It is clear that this is a Europe-wide problem. There is illegal trafficking of waste that must be monitored and curbed, but which has so far been ignored by the European Commission. It is therefore easy to state that only a few countries, including Italy, do not apply European standards. Instead, given that illegal trafficking of waste extends beyond national borders, we need to think about how to deal with this at a European level. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, this own-initiative report highlights how crucial the issue of the supply of inputs is for the competitiveness of European agriculture. Over the last decade, European farmers have seen an intolerable increase in production costs, which is not adequately reflected in sales prices. European agricultural production still depends, to a large extent, on oil. Over the last decade, the price of oil has risen by 60%. In order to address this challenge, the new CAP must increase the use of renewable energy by implementing self-sufficient energy production in farms, using agricultural waste and so forth to feed biomass and biogas plant. This will give us sustainable agriculture and a reduction in costs. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it has not been easy to find a balanced compromise to combine the objective of greater protection for human health and the environment with a faster and more efficient authorisation system for the industrial sector. However, I would have preferred a European authorisation from the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) for new biocidal products immediately, and not in stages. That said, the centralised authorisation system will definitely have positive repercussions on the internal market, because it will allow equal application of the requisites in all the Member States. In order to streamline bureaucratic procedures for small and medium-sized enterprises and facilitate the entry of biocides onto the market, we needed to remove comparative assessment, still required for biocides that have been proven to be safe for use. This places a hefty bureaucratic burden on companies. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, of all the EU’s instruments, the ‘Intelligent Energy’ programme has been the most successful. It has funded over 500 projects, involving more than 3 000 partners – the majority of which are small and medium-sized enterprises – not to speak of the added value that the programme has given to the renewable energy and energy efficiency sector. Like my fellow Members, I am concerned about the future of the programme, which has played a central role in awareness raising actions, the exchange of good practice, and energy policy implementation in the European Union. I therefore ask the European Commission what it intends to do in order to continue the programme, as stopping it would put an end to so many hopes. To conclude, I would like to ask what the programme is for the Multiannual Financial Framework that will provide the necessary funding. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

Mr President, I can only welcome today’s report on the review of European Neighbourhood Policy and, in particular, the vital proposal to strengthen the EU’s Southern partnership, following the historic events which took place last spring, for the democratic consolidation of the area. Funds for countries on the southern shore of the Mediterranean were allocated before the crisis and, in the light of the concrete needs and modernisation of society in these countries, they seem inadequate; I think we should increase support for the instrument for civil society.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank Mr Perello Rodriguez for the excellent work which he has done. It certainly cannot have been easy for such a complex directive to manage to combine the demands of consumers with those of business, just as, to encourage free movement within the European Union, it was not easy to lay down rules on composition, manufacturing specifications and labelling of fruit juices and similar products. We are now at the second amendment of Council Directive 2001/112/EC, which has been necessary in order to continue including provisions of the Codex Alimentarius in European legislation. I am extremely satisfied and I consider the fact that we have avoided the serious risk of finding orange juice on our table which is actually a blend of oranges and mandarins, unless it has been properly labelled as such when sold, a victory both for consumers and for our market. The new changes will finally allow consumers to understand the difference between fruit juices and fruit nectars, and if the fruit nectar naturally contains sugars, then the label can state that the juice contains natural sugars. Important progress has been made, above all, with regard to nectar, and I believe that the directive is going in the right direction to help consumers make informed choices in terms of what they purchase. In Europe, the fruit juice market represents 10% of the non-alcoholic beverage market. I hope that in future, we will be able to encourage purchases of locally produced products that reflect high quality and sustainable development in agriculture in line with European food security principles. The annual demand for orange juice from European industry is estimated to be around a million tonnes, whilst internal production only provides 10% of that. It is therefore obvious that we should increase production of citrus fruits and I hope that the new CAP will include financial incentives to encourage an increase in the cultivation of citrus fruits and the associated creation of a virtuous food and agricultural supply chain to utilise fruit that cannot be used in the fresh market due to small defects or size in the production of fruit juices. This request is obviously directed at Commissioner Cioloş, who is here today. To conclude, Mr President, I believe that this directive achieves two fundamental aims: a more complete labelling system and an increase in product quality. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, with today’s vote, Parliament has laid the foundations for future discussion on the new directive which, as anticipated yesterday by Commissioner Barnier, will be presented on 13 December. I approve of the report given by the rapporteur who, in collaboration with all the rapporteurs, has managed to synthesise the view put forward last June by the Commission with the Green Paper. I feel I should underline two key elements at the heart of the report: language and training. I believe it is necessary, in particular with regard to health care professions, to introduce an accurate means of evaluation of the level of linguistic ability that should take place prior to the authorisation of allocating work, and to raise the minimum training requirements common to all Member States, with a view to ensuring ever greater security to European patients.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the last five years, gambling has spread over the whole of Europe. In Italy, according to the state monopolies, online gambling increased by 153% from 2008 to 2009, and by 29% from 2009 to 2010. These worrying figures provide evidence of the widespread impact of this phenomenon. We must consider this issue seriously. Although online gambling falls within the jurisdiction of the Member States, common actions must be established across Europe to protect vulnerable consumers and to tackle illegal gambling. The report on the initiative opens the door to actions which I hope will soon be initiated and I agree that there is a need to implement preventative measures with a view to reducing addictive behaviour. The trials taking place in some countries could set the measure for ‘best practice’ to be replicated all over Europe, with the aim of monitoring the phenomenon and promoting responsible gambling.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today’s vote has drawn attention to the beekeeping sector, which plays a crucial role in European agriculture by helping to maintain biodiversity and provides an income for around 600 000 workers in the European Union. I consider the programme launched by the European Commission for monitoring the health of honeybees to be a useful one that has the aim of identifying the reasons behind their increased mortality rate in recent years. The impact of pesticides on the health of bees must be explored in more detail. I have voted in favour of the report and I am disappointed that the reference to a correlation between some pesticides and bee mortality has not been supported, as proposed by the rapporteur. I call on the European Commission to provide greater financial aid to the beekeeping sector in the new common agricultural policy (CAP) for 2014-2020. Mario Pirillo,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the mobility of European workers is one of the pillars for full implementation of the internal market, as well as leveraging development and the economy. It is estimated that there is a need for around a million health care professionals in Europe. This means that we need a quick and efficient system for recognising qualifications, and the professional card could facilitate this process. However, in the health care sector, mobility must be combined with safeguarding and ensuring patient safety. This is the direction taken by the report voted for by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for which I was rapporteur. Mobility and patient protection must be considered two sides of the same coin. Therefore, extension of the rapid reaction mechanism to the health care professions is not only commendable, but also necessary. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I voted for Mr Tatarella’s report, which seeks to postpone by three years the entry into force of Stage IIIB for the placing on the market of more efficient tractors for the reduction of CO2
 and pollutant gases. In the case of tractors, a number of reasons led to the parameters laid down by Directive 2005/13/EC being revised: the sudden fall in sales caused by the current economic crisis and the lack of technical solutions capable of limiting CO2
 emissions. It will be particularly important to transpose the amended directive rapidly so that it may be applied without delay. I hope that the European Commission will take into account the European Parliament’s call for it to examine in advance whether the technology available will be capable of meeting the requirements of Stage IV, scheduled for 2014.

Despite this time of economic crisis, I hope that the national governments will prove capable of protecting them by putting in place policies in line with the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020. I welcome and endorse the report tabled by Mr Kósa, who, by drawing on his own experience, has managed to give heartfelt, practical suggestions in order to offer people with disabilities non-discriminatory access to social protection and to health and education services.

 Mr President, with today’s vote, we have laid the foundations for the future revision of the Procurement Directive. Simpler bureaucratic procedures and principles for participation in public tenders are a fundamental means of speeding up implementation processes and ensuring the full realisation of contracts between public authorities and the private sector. The increased use of information and communication technologies would allow businesses and public authorities to save money and time, and would provide greater transparency and accessibility. I would like to stress that the criterion of the lowest price should no longer be the determining factor when awarding contracts: it should really be replaced by the criterion of the most economically advantageous tender, in order to draw economic, social and environmental benefits.

I fully support the content of the report and hope that a legislative proposal will soon be presented, one which leads to the creation of a European anti-mafia committee able to expertly review and fight the phenomenon of organised crime through the institutions. Culture, education, development and work in Europe are defences capable of preventing criminal organisations from recruiting young people.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to the many Members who have signed this oral question. The EU’s objectives in terms of the fight against climate change have resulted in the implementation of what are very demanding EU policies and measures for European industry. The target of reducing CO2
 emissions is, at present, a unilateral commitment that is exposing a large proportion of Europe’s industrial system and, in particular, its energy-intensive industries to a high risk of carbon leakage. The emission reduction targets, while worthy in their aims, should be pursued in a realistic and practical way. We are calling on the Commission to adjust the tools for applying the Emissions Trading System (ETS) and the financial compensation measures envisaged as carefully and as accurately as possible, in order to prevent any imbalances in the EU internal market. Under Directive 2003/87/EC, as amended in 2009, thermal power companies will be obliged, from 2013, to purchase allowances for all of their CO2
 emissions, which means that the increased costs will be passed on in electricity prices and hence, that production costs will rise significantly. According to Eurostat data, the ETS will cost European industry an estimated EUR 8.5 billion more each year in increased electricity prices. Indirect emissions, as opposed to direct emissions, do not benefit from a compensation system to prevent differences in treatment between industries in the same sector that have different production processes and which face obvious distortions of competition within the European Union. If an equivalent compensation system is not established for indirect emissions, there is a very great risk that companies will relocate. Choosing sectors exposed to carbon leakage on the basis of the NACE code classification system is simplistic and restrictive, since it does not allow for the specific type of energy-intensive production to be identified, with the result that compensation cannot be granted to subsectors. In the case of steel production, there are two production processes: the electric furnace and the full cycle, which uses fossil fuels and a small amount of electricity; it will receive almost all of the free allocation of allowances for direct emissions. The electric furnace process, on the other hand, will receive only 30% of the free allowances due to the lack of a compensation system for the electricity portion, even though it emits a fifth of the CO2
 produced by the full cycle. Therefore, because of the type of production process used, the same product will see its price increase in Europe. Fears of such a market imbalance have been voiced by many parties, by many industrial sectors, as can be seen from the responses to the public consultation launched by the Directorate General for Competition. How does the Commission intend to proceed with regard to State aid for energy-intensive industries, in order to ensure the continuation of European industry and to guarantee jobs and prosperity? Could the revenues from the sale of allowances not be used to offset the imbalances that will be created from 2013? Are we certain that the sale of allowances will not lead to speculation? How does the Commission intend to rectify competitive disadvantages? Mario Pirillo,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I must thank all my fellow Members, from all the political groups, who have spoken and who have strongly supported my question. I cannot say that I am satisfied, because the catch-the-eye procedure will follow, and then the Commission will speak; this makes no sense to me, and I hope that we will adapt the Rules of Procedure accordingly. I must say that I will be making this statement to the press but, if I may be so bold, I am truly disappointed by the response that the Commissioner, as the Commission’s representative, has given to my questions. I think that the Commission wants to wash its hands of this problem; it is a major problem as my fellow Members have described magnificently. I hope that the Commission will answer my questions, the questions I asked in my speech, and I hope that it will give serious consideration to this major problem that is affecting Europe: this industry that we boast about in Europe and then undervalue.

The principle of European solidarity among Member States in the event of a disaster is the central pillar of this report, supported by liaison and interaction initiatives within the European Union. The merging of the humanitarian aid crisis rooms is a step in that direction.

Emphasising the importance of the quality of the tourist services offered as a decisive variable in the choices made by tourists was an appropriate decision to increase the competitiveness of Europe’s tourism industry. Niche tourism – religious, spa, mountain, rural, etc. – should be encouraged through measures to improve it in terms of quality and quantity. Lastly, I hope that the harmonisation of the hospitality industry classification systems will continue so as to define unequivocal quality standards for all Member States. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

The efforts made to make the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development more favourable to small and medium-sized enterprises have not improved their participation rate. Simplification has not hit the target. As the report by Ms Matias clearly indicates, there is a need for administrative simplification and a significant reduction of financial reporting requirements.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the gas and electricity market is an instrument for driving economic growth and job creation, crucial factors in restoring the Union’s competitive edge and enabling it to overcome the crisis without delay. We must therefore prevent abuse and manipulation of the market, where monitoring and the application of penalties, along with the prohibition of insider trading, are a national responsibility. The recent introduction of the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) enables market transactions to be monitored, and the national and European registers of market participants make it possible to register transactions in wholesale energy products, thereby promoting transparency. Today’s vote, which is the result of close cooperation between the Polish Presidency, the Commission and Parliament, has laid the foundations for a more transparent market that safeguards consumer interests.

This role, if legally recognised, could create forms of official employment that make it easier for women over 50 to work.

I welcome the fact that, with today’s vote, we have identified the need for more transparency in the financial markets with regard to raw materials and, at the same time, that we have paid a great deal of attention to the supply problems faced by small and medium-sized enterprises and to measures in this area that can help increase their competitiveness. I think it is crucially important that emphasis has been placed on the requirement for trade agreements with non-EU countries to include explicit clauses on the protection of human rights and corporate social responsibility.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with today’s vote we have certainly moved towards an improvement in the safety and inspection of offshore oil and gas activities, in order to prevent a repeat of incidents such as the one which occurred in 2010 on the platform in the Gulf of Mexico, claiming 11 lives and causing very severe environmental damage. I welcome the proposal to coordinate our civil protection forces instead of creating supranational bodies. Better still, I hope that cooperation will be strengthened between the inspection bodies in order to establish common and independent standards at European level. I think that the proposal to establish a Mediterranean Offshore Authorities Forum is a positive one. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

Mr President, today we voted on the vexed and controversial issue of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Offering Member States the chance to prohibit or restrict the cultivation of GMOs in their territory means that the European Union will surrender its leading role on this most delicate of issues. Many questions remain to be answered. Do we know what the long-term effects will be on the ecosystem? Are we reasonably sure that the use of GMOs does not carry serious health risks? Are we sure that consumers whose government has banned their cultivation will not find themselves eating them anyway? We are a long way from any definitive answers. The only thing I know for sure is that both the Commission and the Member States should guarantee that the necessary resources will be made available for independent research, and that GMOs will not be merely a short-cut to profit.

Mr President, there is huge anticipation for the legislative proposals on the forthcoming post-2013 cohesion policy, which will be tabled in September. The Commission has already announced that this reform will see the introduction of an intermediate category, which should replace the current system of phasing in and phasing out. I am left perplexed by the implications that this new category will have, since it will also include – or at least seems to include – the regions that currently are neither converging nor competing. I should like to point out that the priority of the cohesion policy is to assist late-developing regions, and I therefore would not want the reform to damage precisely the poorest regions of Europe, which struggle to put development policies into action. I hope, however, that the new programming can give European growth a kick-start. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the idea of setting up horizontal multi-fund programmes with clearly defined aims and streamlined access mechanisms is something I fully support. I agree with Professor Barca’s report, according to which an approach based on local development is the way to improve efficiency and effectiveness and to operate in a more integrated manner. We need to focus attention on the urban dimension and to ensure coordination between the funds and the other financial instruments of the European Investment Bank (EIB) and European Investment Fund (EIF). In a situation in which the budget is tight, these instruments, together with revolving funds, would allow results to be monitored. This would multiply the available resources and increase the number of beneficiaries, which in turn would deliver more results. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, everyone is aware of the importance of the common agricultural policy and of the contribution it has made to the development of the EU and to food security. Environmental challenges and the fight against climate change mean that the post-2013 CAP now has a new role to play, for which I believe we need a stronger and more sustainable CAP equipped with a budget that can meet the objectives to be pursued, with particular attention to the development of quality food products and to the needs of small farmers. Speculation in agricultural commodities and extreme price volatility put food security at risk and require flexible measures. Possible market fluctuations must be tackled with counter-cyclical measures, which should be included in the first pillar and be capable of responding swiftly and automatically.

Mr President, today’s vote represents a marked step forward in bringing in the ‘polluter pays’ principle, including in the road haulage sector, which makes a significant contribution to atmospheric and noise pollution. Despite the criticisms of industry organisations, I think that the Council’s position is the best compromise available right now, even though I hope that improvements can be made in the future. I voted in favour. I must point out, however, that we need to identify better ways to use the revenues, making it mandatory for the Member States to invest these resources to improve the trans-European transport network (TEN-T) and infrastructure for reducing pollution. This is the only way that, in future, we will be able to say that today’s decision has had positive results. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

Mr President, research and innovation play a central role in the European Union’s development and competitiveness and they are crucial in terms of reaching the objectives set out in the Europe 2020 strategy. The Seventh Framework Programme is the main instrument for funding research in Europe, as shown by the report voted on today. However, there are still many problems being caused by excessive amounts of red tape for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). In its resolution of 11 November 2010, Parliament asked the Commission to introduce procedural, administrative and financial simplification measures into the current management of the Seventh Framework Programme, yet these measures have still not been addressed. I call upon the Commission to acknowledge Parliament’s observations and to identify solutions to make it easier for SMEs to access the seventh and eighth research programmes. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

I voted against the resolution rejecting the indication of the presence of DHA in milk substitutes for babies because I think it is right to advertise the reasons for which DHA is added. I want to mention here that DHA is an omega 3 fatty acid which is present in breast milk and has a positive effect on children’s eyesight. I would point out that the EFSA, the European Food Safety Authority, expressed a favourable opinion to extensively indicating the presence of this substance. I have not appreciated the many e-mails received indicating the belief that we want to favour artificial milk over breast milk. We must always provide adequate information on substances added to food products, especially when they are for children. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the news regarding Fukushima is increasingly worrying. Safety limits have been greatly exceeded and we do not know what will happen in the near future. There has been a lack of clear and transparent communications. Stress tests should be conducted on existing nuclear plants and if the outcome raises concern we must have the courage to call for their immediate closure. We need to introduce higher international safety standards and there should be no thought of constructing new nuclear plants. We must prepare the way for a gradual withdrawal of this type of energy which causes irreparable damage to the environment and human health. Careful thought on the development of future energy policies is essential. We must urgently develop policies that aim at energy conservation and efficiency, and increased investment in research into new technologies and renewable energy sources. Finally, we should open a debate involving citizens and local authorities. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, women have always had an important role in the agricultural and rural sector. Indeed, women account for 42% of the labour force out of a total of around 27 million workers. Despite this high percentage, women are not well represented in sector organisations and face discrimination in the decision-making process. There are many areas in which women’s circumstances could be improved, including ensuring adequate social cover. The European institutions should therefore act to balance this inequality, perhaps by monitoring the sector through an observatory for female entrepreneurialism in agriculture, as already operated in Calabria and other regions in Italy. The report voted upon today – which I supported – also takes a long hard look at the issue of the exodus from the countryside. In order to help keep employment levels steady we need support policies and strategies which are designed to build infrastructure and create services suited to the requirements of modern life, which can be implemented in rural areas.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as an elected representative from Southern Italy, I join the chorus of fellow MEPs who have preceded me in calling for appropriate action to address the critical situation faced by citizens and migrants in Lampedusa. The health and sanitation situation on the island has exceeded all limits of decency. I appeal to the sense of responsibility of the Italian Government to ensure it adopts all measures available to it, and call on the European Commission to implement the measures provided for in the EU Directive on temporary protection for immigrants. The next European Council of Ministers of the Interior, scheduled for 11 April, must take appropriate measures to ensure that neither the migrants nor the citizens of Lampedusa are left in a desperate condition. We therefore need to initiate a serious debate on the European Neighbourhood Policy which will focus on initiatives to support the path to democracy, especially in the countries of the southern shores of the Mediterranean. I congratulate Mr Provera. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over the past 15 years, the number of natural and man-made disasters has increased significantly and we see phenomena that are more severe and more frequent in almost all European Union countries with serious consequences for the economy, infrastructure and ecosystems. We need an urgent EU approach to develop preventive policies and to identify and adapt the relevant financial instruments. The European Union Solidarity Fund and national funds are no longer able to cope with frequent disasters. I would ask the Commissioner who is present when will it be possible to provide data and a map of areas at risk, as announced in his communication of 23 February 2009? I regret, finally, that the Soil Directive for the improvement of land management has been blocked for some time in the Council. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the current economic crisis has revealed serious shortcomings in the framework for monitoring the financial sector and the need to respond with new instruments and new fiscal policies. The financial system has started to generate profits from speculative transactions and it is absurd that this sector is not subject to any taxation. We need a cure, a financial transaction tax, which is why I voted in favour. For other policies such as energy or the environment, Europe has managed to be the world leader, becoming an example and a stimulus for other countries outside the European Union. I believe we should do the same for the financial system. I hope that the Commission will respond soon, presenting a legislative proposal that can meet the expectations of citizens, on whom the burden of the crisis has fallen. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, the deep international economic crisis has hit industry especially hard. The idea that the markets should regulate themselves has been proved wrong. Europe has lacked the ability to give a unified response or to perform an economic analysis. Europe therefore needs to equip itself with a solid, competitive and diversified industrial base. Europe’s new industrial policy must be able to look to the future by taking a global approach to its own policies aimed at reaffirming the core importance of industry, especially manufacturing, which must continue to be the driving force of our economy and to prompt new intelligent, sustainable and inclusive modes of growth. I endorse and congratulate Mr Lange on his report, which examines all these factors and provides some interesting food for thought. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in which bluefin tuna fishing finds itself in the Mediterranean continues to cause incalculable economic damage to fishing communities. The Italian Government adhered to the decisions of the ICCAT and reduced fishing quotas for bluefin tuna for commercial fishing vessels only, with a de facto 
increase in the quantities intended for recreational fishing, an absurd measure that penalises only fishers, who are already facing a very difficult time. In this sense, I remind you of the negative effects on the industry of failing to take the decision to grant a derogation for whitebait fishing. I hope that one outcome of the forthcoming meeting to be attended by Commissioner Damanaki, who is here today, will be that fishing for whitebait can resume in 2011, at least in certain districts, such as Schiavonea and Corigliano Calabro in Calabria, with a possibility of a review for 2012.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even today in the European Union, health inequalities still persist over access to services, treatment and social factors, and this necessitates an integrated response. The reasons for these differences are, in many cases, avoidable and unjust, because they are due to discriminatory factors such as the reduced economic capacity of individuals. I believe that reducing health inequalities should become a fundamental priority for Europe, with an approach based on ‘health in all policies’, enhancing the quality of care for all. In the coming months, the European Parliament will discuss the revision of the directive on recognition of professional qualifications. It is an appropriate opportunity to achieve an improved mechanism capable of dealing effectively with emergencies without any discrimination. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is essential for Europe to ensure a fair balance between the need to support a vital sector, in other words, the agriculture of Member States, and the need to strengthen Europe’s international trade policy. A business strategy highly focused on pursuing the dynamics of global markets would end up sacrificing the ability of the European agricultural sector to compete. This not only damages the sector economy, with serious implications for employment, but also undermines any possibility of developing our rural areas. It is necessary to defend the quality of agricultural production and impose the maintenance of equal quality standards in terms of food security, human and animal health, and welfare and social rights when drawing up trade agreements with third countries.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, everybody has said that the free trade agreement with the Republic of Korea is an institutional and strategic innovation on the part of the Union. On the contrary, it is an unbalanced agreement that will have a negative impact on the European manufacturing industry. The elimination of duties on Korean products in return for a rise in environmental and social standards in Korea cannot be considered fair. The Korean shipbuilding industry benefits from substantial state aid, which has enabled it to attain a 30% share of the world market. This means that European industry, be it automotive, textile, chemical or any other, must defend itself against competition that if not unfair in form, is unfair in fact. The introduction of the safeguard clause is an appropriate measure, but it is not sufficient to patch up the many weaknesses in the agreement. I therefore call on the European Commission to be more prudent if it really wishes to defend European economic interests. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the transition towards a low carbon economy and the achievement of the objectives set out in the climate change package mean that we need to establish rules to regulate CO2
 emissions in various sectors, including the automotive sector. I am very pleased with the negotiations, which led to an agreement with the Council to limit emissions to 147g CO2
/km by 2020. This is a realistic limit that also represents an excellent balance between environmental, social and industrial rules. I hope I also played my part in this as shadow rapporteur for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. The agreement reached takes account of the economic crisis that the sector is experiencing and also makes reasonable allowances for the difference between the passenger car sector and the light commercial vehicles sector. Just as we saw with the regulation on passenger cars, the European automotive sector will also manage to develop green, competitive and environmentally beneficial technology for light commercial vehicles. I hope it will also manage to take advantage of the environmental challenge to invest even more in innovation and research. Paolo De Castro,

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which I have the honour of chairing and for which I drafted the opinion on the interim report, clearly expressed the wish that the common agricultural policy budget should be frozen in real, not nominal terms, as proposed by the European Commission. Although this is evidently the majority position, at this sensitive point in the negotiations I am in favour of giving full support to the own-initiative report drawn up by Mr Böge and Mr Kalfin, who have done an excellent job, providing Parliament with a strong, cohesive and united negotiating position. However, I should stress that were further cuts to be made to the common agricultural policy budget, it would be very difficult to reach an agreement on reform. All of the political groups in the committee have always stressed their wish not to have a final vote on the reform reports until there is clarity on the budget question. Indeed, the budget must be equal to the challenges posed by the agriculture of the future. Paolo De Castro,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the regulation on agricultural product quality schemes, on which we will be voting tomorrow, is the second most important legislative provision in which Parliament has been fully involved under the ordinary legislative procedure for agricultural legislation. As happened with the Milk Regulation, Parliament has again managed to introduce significant amendments to improve the Commission’s proposal. I would highlight, for example, the stricter rules to protect certified products against misuse and imitation (the so-called ex officio
 rule); the new system of optional quality terms, starting with the ‘product of mountain farming’ quality term; area marks; and greater simplification in the authorisation procedures for Protected Designation of Origin (PDO), Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) and Traditional Speciality Guaranteed (TSG) products. I would also like to mention the amendment to the list in the annex, which at last makes it possible for chocolate to enjoy a protected geographical indication. Allow me to take this opportunity to greet the friends of Modica chocolate who are here in this Chamber. These are just a few of the many amendments that Parliament has successfully introduced to strengthen the prospect of leveraging quality in order to compete in the sector. This was made possible by the excellent work done by the rapporteur, Ms García Pérez, whom I thank, as well as the shadow rapporteurs and the entire Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. The only regrettable fact, as the rapporteur herself mentioned, is that Parliament has not managed to persuade the Council of the need to extend production planning, which we usefully introduced in the milk package, to all the other protected designations of origin, particularly in the ham sector. However, as has been pointed out by Mr Dorfmann, one of the shadow rapporteurs, we shall not fail to do so in the debate on the reform of the common agricultural policy, and on the single common market organisation document in particular. Paolo De Castro,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to direct your attention to the six legislative reports on alignment with the Treaty of Lisbon that we are about to vote on. They do not just address agricultural issues, but affect all of Parliament. Indeed, we risk losing the new powers that the Treaty of Lisbon has given us. The Council systematically opposes delegated acts, replacing them with implementing acts that exclude Parliament from the decision-making process. We must press on to defend Parliament’s powers. Hence, I would ask you to lend your vigorous support to the decision already reached by a huge majority in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. Paolo De Castro,  
rapporteur. 
– (IT) 
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon abolishes the old comitology system, replacing it with a two-tier structure, consisting of delegated acts which include Parliament’s and the Council’s right of veto, and implementing acts which completely exclude Parliament from each step in the approval process. The existing body of legislation therefore had to be aligned to the new legal reality. We started this exercise with the three most important regulations all of which, Mr President, I shall deal with together, and which make up the heart of the agricultural policy: the regulations on direct payments, on rural development and on the common organisation of the markets. The Commission’s proposals immediately appeared to be quite balanced and there were very few changes made by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI). In particular, as regards direct payments, delegated acts must be used in cases where the basic act is amended, and in cases where rights are conferred to farmers or reversely where negative consequences may be incurred. In addition, given the spirit of the treaty on the common agricultural policy (CAP) budget, we felt that the financial discipline process could no longer be applied without the participation of Parliament. Indeed, maintaining Article 11 unchanged, with the Council acting on a proposal from the Commission, would constitute an unacceptable continuation of the Council’s exclusive right to implement measures directly. As regards rural development, we believe that the Commission has done an accurate repartition between more general provisions establishing additional elements, and which therefore require delegated acts, and more technical elements that are very much connected with the discretion that Member States enjoy in implementing this measure, and which therefore require implementing acts. By contrast, the proposed alignment with the regulation on the common organisation of the markets has proved to be more problematic, especially on issues connected with Article 43(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The article in question provides that the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, shall adopt measures on fixing prices, levies, aid and quantitative limitations. This is an exception to paragraph 2 of the same article, which requires the ordinary legislative procedure (OLP) to be used for the common agricultural policy. As an exception, Article 43(3) needs to be interpreted restrictively, that is, only when there are provisions that do not form part of the fundamental policy decisions, which must be taken pursuant to Article 43(2) of the Treaty. We therefore believe that the Commission proposal does not interpret Article 43(3) in a sufficiently restrictive way. The task of drawing up conditions and criteria for fixing aid amounts, export refunds and minimum export prices should remain with the legislator, which means Parliament and the Council, leaving to the Commission the fixing of amounts through implementing acts. Once these three recommendations had been approved by an overwhelming majority in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, we began to negotiate with the Council and the Commission so that we could reach an agreement at first reading. The urgency was dictated by the imminent reform of the common agricultural policy, which we would not have wished to be encumbered by complex negotiations on institutional issues. Despite our willingness to negotiate, to concede something with respect to our initial position, and despite the outstanding activism first on the part of the Polish Presidency and then from the Danish Presidency, we were unable to find a compromise solution, hence the need for the committee to act efficiently and in a timely manner, on the one hand, and the new and stronger powers conferred on Parliament by the Treaty of Lisbon, on the other. The main obstacles we encountered were from the Council, which wishes to systematically and horizontally eliminate delegated acts, even where these are legally required, in order to replace them with implementing acts which completely exclude Parliament. Such a position is unacceptable to us, because it means surrendering the new prerogatives that the Treaty has assigned to us, thereby severely limiting the powers of Parliament. Another factor that made negotiations more difficult was the attitude of the Commission which, during the negotiations, moved from a position close to that of Parliament to siding with the Council’s, leaving us alone in the battle to defend the most authentic interpretation of the Treaty. We are now faced with the difficult negotiations on the reform of the common agricultural policy; we therefore decided to ask plenary to confirm the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development’s vote on alignment, so as to strengthen our position when we negotiate future agricultural policy. Indeed, only by defending the prerogatives of Parliament can we be sure to respect the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon and, at the same time, ensure that in future, the CAP is more democratic and closer to citizens. Paolo De Castro,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take advantage of this minute just to thank my colleagues for their comments and also to thank the Commissioner. We take note of the support that the Commissioner has shown today, in the hope that the difficulties of reaching an agreement with the Council on implementing acts do not turn into difficulties of reaching an agreement on common agricultural policy reform. For this reason, I appeal to the Commissioner: we are in the Lisbon era, the Council needs to understand that Parliament has new prerogatives, which it is not prepared to surrender. In tomorrow’s vote, we will be following the Commission’s approach, so we hope that the Council will, in the end, join with us on these positions. Paolo De Castro,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in its capacity as co-legislator it is essential for Parliament to know the Member States’ simulation data for the new biophysical criteria put forward by the Commission on identifying Less Favoured Areas. The lack of transparency and unwillingness to send this data to the representatives of EU citizens reveal the ongoing ignorance of Member States and the Council of the democratic revolution enshrined by the Treaty of Lisbon. Parliament is co-decider on agricultural matters and, together with the Council, we are preparing to reform the common agricultural policy. We cannot therefore accept any discrepancy in the information held by the two institutions. We must be on the same standing as the Council in order to be able to evaluate the criteria put forward by the Commission in full awareness of the facts. The Commission – I would remind the Council – will not let us have this data, as some Member States have opposed it being given to Parliament. We therefore urge the Council to appeal to the Member States for the utmost transparency and full cooperation, in the light of what is a new institutional reality. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to express my delight in the fact that we have achieved the highly important goal of extending the programme for food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Union to 2013. It has been a long and difficult process, involving the efforts of all of Parliament. Now, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have together urged the Commission to make a clear commitment to the European Parliament to pursue the programme after 2013. The statement of 6 December 2011 in which the Commission acknowledged the opposition of some Member States to a new programme must not prejudice the Commission’s right to legislative initiative as provided for by the Treaty. The Commission must take into account the strong desire on the part of the European Parliament and the vast majority of EU Member States to continue this programme. Therefore, we are pleased with the statements the Commission has made to us today. We are talking – let us reiterate this – about an instrument which allows the EU to distribute 440 000 tonnes of free food every year to over 18 million poor people and struggling families, a number which, unfortunately, also includes many children. This is why we cannot consider our political initiative to be over. Mr President, Commissioner, taking into consideration also the new global challenges, such as food security, which are making life even tougher for the disadvantaged, Parliament will do its best to ensure that differences are overcome and that the programme can continue in 2014.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the vote on opening up the tariff quota for imports of high-quality beef marks an important moment in good transatlantic relations. What is more, thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament is, for the first time, playing a fundamental role in approving this sort of decision. This fact increases the United States’ interest in and understanding of Parliament, as we saw first-hand during the meetings held with the US Congress by a delegation from our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI) last June. This agreement puts an end to a long-held, age-old dispute, thereby enabling the sanctions imposed by the US to be lifted, while also maintaining the ban on imports of meat treated with hormones so as to guarantee our own high standards on food quality and safety. For these reasons, the AGRI Committee – which I am honoured to chair – gave staunch support for the conclusion of this agreement and did not present any amendments, in the spirit of deepening transatlantic trade relations and improving dispute resolution within the framework of the World Trade Organisation. My heartfelt thanks to Ms Quisthoudt-Rowohl and to the rapporteur for our committee, Mr Lyon. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that tomorrow we will be voting on the recommendation for a second reading on the programme for the distribution of food products to the most deprived persons in the Union, which involves the continuation of this important programme until 2013. After all these months and the commitment of so many people, whom I would like to thank, starting with our rapporteur, Vice-President Siekierski and Commissioner Cioloş, we have managed to achieve this important result, which means not abandoning 18 million poor people in Europe to their fate. The European Parliament has often expressed its approval of this programme and also of its continuation after 2013. Our political initiative will therefore continue, we will not rest just with tomorrow’s vote, Mr President. In full compliance with the ruling of the Court of Justice, Europe must also be able to continue offering solidarity to the weaker members of our society in the future, particularly during these tough economic times.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the measure we are about to approve represents the culmination of a process undertaken by Europe after the 2009 crisis in order to find solutions for stabilising the market and revenues of dairy and cheese producers. The work and commitment of the European Parliament and our rapporteur Mr Nicholson, whom I must truly thank for his enormous commitment along with the shadow rapporteurs of this important report, have meant we have reached a rapid agreement on a text that improves the Commission’s proposal. An important new provision is the possibility of managing and planning the volumes of certified quality dairy products. Such a tool is even more strategically significant at a historic time of prolonged and considerable market volatility, and we will consolidate it within the new regulations on quality agricultural and food products. The new possibility of involving representatives of the trade in interprofessional organisations is very important, as it will promote and consolidate positive links between all the components of the supply chain. Today, Mr President, Commissioner, we are showing that Parliament knows how to face up to its responsibilities and work swiftly as a whole towards completion of the legislative process. This is our first testing-ground before the major challenge of the debate on reform of the common agricultural policy. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with the report by Mr Bové, whom I thank for his work, Europe is focusing decisively on establishing a legislative framework to ensure fairness and greater transparency in relations within the agri-food industry. In this field, the ideas and requests approved in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are very much to be welcomed. Higher levels of transparency in prices, the reduction of the costs of production inputs and more effective management of energy and natural resources within the industry are just a few of the most important points. Madam President, on these grounds, and taking advantage of the presence of Vice-President Tajani, I think it appropriate to recall the central point of the joint resolution on the imbalances in the food supply chain, to which my fellow Members have also referred: a European system to harmonise the length of time taken for payments in commercial transactions between agri-food producers and the distribution system. Mr Tajani, we can no longer allow distortions of competition between European producers; it is no longer acceptable to have different national legal systems that regulate deadlines for payment, contractual agreements and discounting practices differently. There is a lack of territorial homogeneity exacerbating this phase of extreme market volatility where sharp price rises are not translating into higher margins for farmers; they, on the contrary, see their incomes dropping lower and lower. Mr Tajani, we in Parliament are ready to support a legislative proposal that goes in this direction and I know of the work that you are doing with the high-level group. I therefore sincerely hope that we may soon see a legislative proposal on harmonisation of the distribution systems in Europe. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the importance of cultivating trees for the landscape and the environment is already well known and acknowledged. Different scientific studies demonstrate that trees are more capable of reducing CO2
 levels than meadows and pastures. Considering the dispositions of direct payments, which anticipate that 7% of farmed land should be set aside for ecological purposes, what, Commissioner, will happen in the case of an olive farm that already comprises within it dry-stone walls and rows of trees, and that includes centuries-old trees of important value to both the landscape and the economy? Do you not think that such farms are already sufficiently sustainable from an environmental point of view, and that the application of the required 7% indicated above would instead risk causing harm to economic sustainability and the environment, with farmers forced to cut down part of their olive grove? Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for the response. We hope that no olive trees will be cut down. I will take this opportunity to ask a quick question.

 Mr President, Mr Sawicki, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, the food aid distribution programme for citizens at risk of poverty represents an extraordinarily important tool to sustain the most underprivileged in our society, an instrument that has been a success for the common agricultural policy in recent years and which enables the Union to distribute 440 000 tonnes of free food each year to over 18 million poor people and families in difficulty. This number unfortunately includes many children and looks set to rise at a time when access to food is defined as a fundamental right. We therefore cannot but express incomprehension and opposition when faced with the blocking minority in favour of cutting aid which has emerged within the Council of Ministers for Agriculture. We are aware of the Court of Justice’s ruling and we will work to ensure that from 2013 there will be a text which will, of course, take account of the Court’s comments, but we certainly cannot allow this programme to be interrupted. I believe that, while Europe is today discussing a EUR 500 million programme of aid to its internal population, in the United States for over 40 years the US ‘Fair Deal’ law has been providing aid to the US population with a programme worth more than USD 20 billion. I would therefore argue that we must all redouble our efforts and in this respect I would like to thank the Polish Presidency and Mr Sawicki, and to commend Mr Cioloş, who has taken this matter to heart with courage and determination. We must find a solution. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report on information to consumers allows Europe to take a new and important step towards achieving its specific objective of protecting consumer rights. I would like to thank Mrs Sommer for this, and all the shadow rapporteurs, in particular the shadow rapporteur from my group, Glenis Willmott. While it may be true that Europe can look to the future with more confidence now that the instruments for food protection and transparency have been made more effective, it is also true that the agreement in second reading redefines, albeit in part, what this House approved at first reading. For example, we would have expected more, Madam President, on origin labelling for foodstuffs. The obligation to indicate the origin of all meat, given to us in the new paragraph 25, is a significant change that meets the expectations of large numbers of European consumers. At the same time, we have to underline its less ambitious approach with regard to the introduction of mandatory labelling for all fresh agricultural products and single-ingredient processed foods, which this House had approved. Meat labelling in Annex XI excludes some important products that require an equal level of protection, such as rabbit meat, which for some reason has been excluded. However, the way forward in food transparency has been shown, and we now need to pursue it with the same commitment and responsibility that have brought us this far. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, fifteen years after the emergence of BSE, we should take stock of the implementation and prospects of the European legislative framework and the relative checks carried out on feed and food. As the rapporteur has said, figures show that the number of cases testing positive in the European Union has fallen from over 2 100 cases in 2001 to just over 65 cases in 2009, and in the light of this declining epidemiological trend we can conclude that the legislation implemented helped to eradicate BSE. This is why the report we are about to vote on is an important opportunity to show commitment and responsibility in moving towards aligning legal provisions with the actual situation in terms of risk. One good signal in this regard is the review of the ban on using animal meal in feed. The period of panic having passed, scientific progress shows that the time is now ripe for reviewing the ban on feeding non-ruminants with processed animal protein. This is an important new factor, and one which, in full compliance with food safety rules, is of strategic importance, particularly in light of the EU’s current protein deficit. At the same time, it is naturally important not to lower our guard in terms of checks and monitoring. We need to make sure we do not threaten the extraordinary progress Europe has made in consumer and animal health protection. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Dess report marks the beginning of a new phase in the common agricultural policy (CAP) reform process. It is the result of several months’ hard work by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, for which I would like to thank Mr Dess and all the shadow rapporteurs and parliamentary groups. Today this House can give a clear opinion on the future of the common agricultural policy: it must be a robust, simple, flexible and greener CAP that takes young people and employment into account. That, Commissioner, is why we are worried by the news in the press today about budget cuts, especially in the second pillar. That would be incompatible with both the Dess report and the report on the European Union’s financial perspective by Mr Garriga Polledo, which we adopted in plenary in recent weeks. The latter report introduced the important principle for the CAP of maintaining the current level of funding in the next financial programming period. Therefore, Commissioner, we would like some clarification about the news that has been circulated, and we would like to know whether as far as you are concerned there are different guidelines from what we have been told up to now.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we have an important chance to tackle the growing problem of antibiotic resistance in animals responsibly and with commitment. This is a strategic issue for the agriculture sector and, in particular, for the future of the European animal husbandry system. The data show that around 50% of the antibiotics in Europe are prescribed for animal use. If used properly, antibiotics are a useful tool that helps farmers keep their livestock healthy and productive and safeguard its welfare. Therefore, we are not here to demonise antibiotic use in animal husbandry, but we want to ask the Commission to provide a concrete response for the more efficient and effective use of antibiotics, in order to reduce resistance in animals. In our resolution of 5 May 2010 on the EU Action Plan for Animal Welfare, this House underlined the link between animal welfare, animal health and public health, and urged the Commission and the Member States to address the difficult problem of antibiotic resistance in animals in a responsible manner. In particular, we called on the Commission to collect and analyse data on the use of all animal health products, including antibiotics, with a view to ensuring the effective use of such products. A year later, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which I have the honour to chair, is here to ask the Commission to implement all relevant initiatives to resolve this long-standing problem, which can also have consequences for human health. What is needed, Madam President and Commissioner, is a tangible commitment from the Commission that it will use the data collected to put the results obtained into practice, not only encouraging research and monitoring activities, but also ensuring more effective use of antibiotics as an important tool for fighting animal diseases. On that front, I would point out that some studies show that low-energy animal feed could lead to a higher incidence of diseases and, hence, more antibiotic use. It would therefore be desirable to review the ban on the use of animal meal for non-ruminants, in line with the opinion of the European Scientific Veterinary Committee. These are the requests made in the resolution adopted in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on 12 April this year and which will be put to the vote in this Chamber tomorrow. It has been hard work for the last few months, and for that reason I would like to personally thank Mrs Paulsen, the shadow rapporteurs and all the parliamentary groups for their invaluable contributions to establishing a common text on this issue. The future competitiveness of European animal husbandry may depend on how this problem is managed, and its cross-cutting nature calls for commitment and responsibility, through a coordinated approach and a shared political will.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank Mr Wojciechowski and all the shadow rapporteurs for the work carried out on this report, which aims to make the rules on vaccination against bluetongue more flexible. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has made every effort to approve the text as a matter of urgency in order to allow the vaccination campaign to go ahead before the summer. The European Commission had presented a proposal which did not take into account the approval of the Treaty of Lisbon. In other words, it left decision-making power solely with the Council, totally excluding Parliament. After intense discussions, for which I would like to thank Parliament’s Legal Service and the secretariat of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, we managed to reach an agreement to change the legal basis, in accordance with Article 43(2) of the Treaty; in other words, within the framework of the ordinary legislative procedure. Now we expect the Council to be equally efficient in accepting our position and including the correlation tables, in order to give a prompt response to European livestock farmers. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the petition under discussion today has arrived at a time when Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and its Committee on International Trade are debating the new chapter on agriculture in the agreement with Morocco. The European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) confirms that there have been irregularities in the calculation of duties on tomato imports and that this has been damaging to European producers, the very same producers who are expressing their concern at the expected increase in tomato and fruit and vegetable imports in general that will take place if the agreement is signed. We are obviously sensitive to the concerns brought about by bilateral agreements where the agricultural element is often sacrificed for the sake of broader industrial interests. It is not a good way to proceed, and we will continue to repeat this to the European Commission. However, I would like to point out that the current economic and political crisis throughout the Maghreb area should lead us to consider this agreement carefully and with greater solidarity. Paolo De Castro,  
Chair of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to speak briefly just to underline the importance of the Wojciechowski report on bluetongue for an institutional issue which concerns us all. As far as the content is concerned, there is no conflict between the Commission, Parliament and the Council. However, the inclusion of the correlation tables in the text remains a very sensitive issue. Despite the fact that the Council was totally opposed to it, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development decided to vote for a text that includes the correlation tables, which oblige Member States to report on transposition of the directive. It is now up to the Council to decide whether to accept the correlation tables and conclude the agreement at first reading, or to answer to European farmers for causing the bluetongue vaccination campaign to be missed this year in order not to give way on this point. I believe that this report can act as a precedent in future negotiations with the Council. We must be united and determined in calling for maximum transparency from Member States and in defending total compliance with EU law. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, social tensions, such as the recent ones in North Africa, are almost always triggered by rising food prices. The record increase in the prices of cereals, sugar and vegetable oils is a clear sign of the increasing imbalance between global supply and demand. A further – sadly possible – rise in prices would have dramatic consequences particularly for those parts of the world where food expenditure accounts for more than 40% of per capita income. It also poses a real risk of creating tensions throughout the entire planet in an increasingly interdependent world economy. The European Union must therefore have a clear awareness that agricultural policies – the common agricultural policy for the European Union and the Farm Bill for the United States – have a role of extraordinary and strategic importance to play in the world order, a role that goes far beyond the legitimate protection of farmers’ incomes. We need, Madam President, a new global food policy capable of coordinating agricultural policies at international level. Personally I hope that the forthcoming G20 summit will be an opportunity to actually embark on this new path. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should also like to thank Commissioner Dalli for coming to the Chamber today to report on this case, which is a source of great concern for European consumers. Next week, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which I have the honour of chairing, will also meet to look further into the debate on the consequences of this serious episode. Despite the fact that Europe is very much committed to food safety, further efforts in terms of transparency and checks are needed in order to avoid further cases of food contamination. I would note that last year, Parliament adopted an own-initiative report on agricultural product quality and, above all, that this Chamber adopted the regulation on the provision of food information to consumers at first reading, introducing obligatory marking of the place of origin of agricultural products on labels. Unfortunately, this important development stalled on 8 December in the Health Council. We shall try to reintroduce it at second reading, because it is an important objective for protection and transparency in favour of European consumers. Parliament is therefore moving in the right direction, showing that it is on the side of consumers. We hope that the Council and the Commission adopt a similar attitude. Paolo De Castro,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today represents an important opportunity to discuss the strategic issue of protecting animal welfare in agriculture. On 1 January 2012, the terms of Council Directive 1999/74/EC will enter into force, laying down minimum standards for the protection of hens, tantamount to the abolition of conventional battery cages as a system of rearing for the production of eggs. This method of animal housing will be banned in favour of systems of rearing that guarantee better animal welfare. Mr President, the memory of the Council of the European Union on Agriculture, held on 19 July 1999, is fresh in my mind. It was an important day, on which, as the representative of my country (at the time I was the Italian Minister for Agriculture), I contributed to the approval of this important directive by voting for it. Now, one year after the irrevocable entry into force of the new legislation, data show that European producers are proceeding to adapt their production system, but not without running into difficulties. What we need is a concrete commitment from the Commission to safeguard animal welfare, to protect producers who have adapted their system of rearing to Council Directive 1999/74/EC, and, at the same time, to effectively guarantee the passage of the new legislation, avoiding distortions in terms of market competition. This is why my fellow Members and I felt it appropriate to add this important topic to the agenda of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which I have the honour of chairing. Hard work over recent months, involving all parliamentary groups, resulted in the oral question of 28 October 2010, which puts three important issues to the Commission: Firstly, to report on the implementation of the new legislation within the Member States; Secondly, the actions to be taken in the Member States to guarantee compliance with the terms of the directive, and compromising where necessary with those undertakings that show a genuine desire to adapt. Lastly, measures and guarantees to be adopted to avoid crises in the egg market in the coming years and to prevent unfair competition from third countries that are not obliged to respect the European Union directive within the European internal market. These are the queries to which we are awaiting concrete and definitive responses from the Commission. Lastly, we ask the Commissioner to guarantee a more transparent market, along the lines of the concept of so-called reciprocity of rules, in order to facilitate the prospect of greater international convergence on the animal welfare standards applied by the European Union. Attending to this matter, which we have discussed a number of times in committee since the start of the legislature, is essential to prevent Europe’s efforts on animal welfare – our efforts, Commissioner – from being rendered useless by a market that is incapable of recognising the social values that are bound up in foodstuffs. We need to reduce the distorting effects of the possibility that producers outside the European rules system could translate the lesser restrictions they are subject to into greater competitive advantages. Mr President, adopting the motion for a resolution on the welfare of laying hens, which we will vote on this morning, could represent a first and important step in this direction. Paolo De Castro,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as Chair of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I am deeply disappointed for several reasons with the contents of Mr Szájer’s report, which is being voted on tomorrow. Firstly, none the amendments voted for by my committee unanimously – and I stress, unanimously – were taken into account, even though the common agricultural policy is one of the policies with the most acts adopted under the comitology procedure and is therefore one of the ones most affected by the adaptation of legislative acts under the Treaty of Lisbon. Secondly, under the text of Article 10, the European Parliament will have no power to exert pressure nor a margin to negotiate with Council over the adaptation of CAP legislation to the new treaty. We are aware, in fact, that the Council has already demonstrated its unwillingness to agree acts delegated to the European Parliament and, with the adoption of this Regulation, the Council will not have any interest in proceeding with negotiations because the automatic adaptation – which excludes delegated acts and only covers implementing acts – has no deadline because it is transitional. For this reason, together with other fellow Members, I tabled an amendment that makes the automatic alignment genuinely temporary and I call on you all to support it in order to reinforce the role of the European Parliament. There is no reason, in fact, to come to an agreement at first reading over such a sensitive file that sets the rules for implementing the treaty for the coming years. This is the reason why, for this all-important file, we have the right – I would even go so far as to say the duty – to improve the text as much as possible and therefore proceed to a second reading without giving in to blackmail by the Council, which is threatening not to move on this file in order to force us to accept this negative agreement. After the budget, I think this is the most important file we have to vote on, because it redraws the balance of power between the European institutions. Here in this Chamber, we must vigorously defend the prerogatives of Parliament, which has been democratically elected and represents all European citizens. Paolo De Castro,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution we are about to vote on represents the view of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the European beekeeping support policy. As is normal practice for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, this important paper has benefited from the participation of all the parliamentary groups, who have added their valuable contribution to the end result. Despite the recent increase in the annual budget for measures to improve the general conditions for production and marketing of bee products, a widespread concern persists with regard to the numerous challenges and problems that beekeeping will have to face in the near future. Difficult production and marketing conditions, strong and prolonged price volatility and difficulties emerging from the increasingly widespread mortality of bee stocks are some of the critical factors that afflict one of the most important sectors of European agriculture. Like all other primary sector operators, European beekeepers must be put in a position where they can plan their own affairs. Since the current support depends on European agricultural policy implementation procedures in force at present, the future of this policy after 2013 is uncertain. This is the background to today’s resolution, whereby we intend to call on the Commission to make an active commitment to defend beekeeping. The main demands to the Commission contained in the motion for a resolution include the following: a specific undertaking after the expiry of national programmes, also in view of new challenges and problems in the sector, namely bee mortality, price volatility etc.; a commitment to the necessary improvement in statistical measurements, for more effective control of non-EU honey imports and research development; a strengthening of the role of European veterinary policy; an action plan to tackle the phenomenon of widespread bee mortality, partly through specific undertakings in the field of research; greater financial support in the field of operator training and education and, lastly, a revitalised role as a leading player for the beekeeping sector within the common agricultural policy after 2013. In thanking Mrs Lulling and all my fellow MEPs for the common work carried out, I would like to remind you, Madam President, Commissioner, that the International Year of Biodiversity is about to end. This is why we hope that approval of the resolution will definitely mark the start of the road to relaunch a sector that is particularly strategic from the viewpoint of environmental sustainability and maintenance of biodiversity, as well as in terms of economic and social impact.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are here today to call on the Commission to implement suitable efficient and flexible market instruments to combat the crisis into which the European livestock sector has plunged. We hope that the proposal that the Commission will shortly present on market instruments for the milk and dairy sector will also include proposals to limit the impact of price volatility on the agricultural sector as a whole. Many actions can still be deployed to send out a strong signal to European livestock breeders. We believe, for example, that it would be very useful to the livestock sector to review the current ban on the use of animal meal for non-ruminants, for example, for the avian and fisheries sectors. As you know, this ban was introduced following cases of BSE but now, a few years on, the scientific community agrees in stating that the ban can only be justified for ruminants. In the case of non-ruminants, conversely, there is no danger to human health and the environment and we therefore hope that this ban may be overturned with the aim of offering these animals a greater possibility of higher-energy diets.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after a year and a half of difficult negotiations between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, we have at last arrived at a compromise text in the sensitive dossier on animal experimentation. It has been difficult work and I should like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Jeggle, and our shadow rapporteurs, for having carried out such intense negotiations. The text was adopted unopposed, with only 4 abstentions, by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which it is my honour to chair. It achieves a good balance between the need to improve the welfare of animals used in experiments and the need to allow for progress in medical research. The proposal aims to examine and improve the 1986 directive, which is now obsolete, and harmonise European regulations on the subject. Animal experimentation is a particularly sensitive topic for all of us as well as for the general public, but I can say with conviction, ladies and gentlemen, that the text on which we are about to vote is reasonable and the outcome of serious, meticulous work. It is a definite improvement on the existing legislation in terms of animal protection while, at the same time, it does not lose sight of our moral responsibility to advance medical research. Paolo De Castro,  
Chair of the AGRI Committee.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as chair of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which is the relevant committee for this topic, I am against referring back the Jeggle report. After more than a year and a half of intense debate, our committee has already come out quite clearly in favour of the compromise reached on the common position, without any votes against and only a few abstentions. I therefore see no reason for re-examining the text: we already have everything we need to vote on it today. Paolo De Castro,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Jordan River is a major asset of not only environmental, but also agricultural and economic significance for Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian Territories, and the degradation it is suffering cannot fail to worry us. It is important to point out that roughly 98% of the 1.3 billion cubic metres of natural fresh water in the lower course of the river is diverted away every year, and long stretches of the river are at risk of running dry. This is devastating not only in terms of biodiversity, but above all in terms of local communities’ access to sources of water. Several international actors, including the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly and the United States Senate, have addressed the situation of profound degradation of the Jordan River. We, too, must demand intervention, not only from the local governments and authorities, but also from the Council, the Commission and the Member States, to provide technical and financial assistance for the rehabilitation of the river. In particular – as stated in the joint resolution signed by all the political groups, whom I thank for their wholehearted support – we must ask the Commission to insert a clear, specific reference to this project in the action plans of the neighbourhood policy with Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority. An initial step could be to set up a joint study on the situation of the Jordan River. We are well aware that water is a precious, inalienable asset, so I would like to point out that distributing the water fairly means paying equal attention to the demands of all the communities in the region. This is a matter of supreme importance if we want to achieve lasting peace and stability in the Middle East. We have been watching the resumption of peace negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians in recent days with some hope, as these negotiations have identified water resource management as one of their essential points. We hope that the governments, local communities and civil society organisations in the countries and territories involved will begin to cooperate effectively as soon as possible in order to save the lower Jordan. This is a duty not only because of the high symbolic value of this river but, above all, in order to improve the living conditions of the local communities. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over the next few years the challenges accompanying the development of the European agricultural system will be huge: the growing demand for food will have to be met through the sustainable use of natural resources, with a parallel increase in the level of environmental performance. This outlook, which strengthens the relationship between the agricultural sector and the production of public goods, gives agriculture a new strategic importance: the creation of the future common agricultural policy (CAP) today represents the solution to these major challenges facing our society, and the policy will play a crucial role in responding to what is already a food crisis. Therefore, it is a case of producing more while polluting less: this is the difficult objective that European agriculture will have to fulfil over the next few years. Based on these assumptions, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which I have the honour of chairing, has produced an intense and concise piece of work – which Mr Lyon, with the involvement of all the groups, has overseen in an excellent fashion – in the shape of the report presented to Parliament today. It is a report that we are convinced will help lay the foundations of the future CAP and will provide the European Commission with some clear pointers so that it can prepare the year-end communication on the future of the CAP after 2013.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a new phase of reflection has opened in Europe today on the issue of quality, which is intended not only as a guarantee for consumers but, above all, as a stimulus for our producers to be more competitive in a market that is far larger and far more competitive. Our businesses need to gain market recognition of the distinctive and quality-related aspects associated with their products. In this sense, as Mr Scottà’s report intends – and I, too, thank him for my part – we are making progress in guaranteeing, first of all, more information on the origin, composition and characteristics of production processes. At the same time, Commissioner, it is fundamental that European regulations allow organisations designated for the protection and promotion of quality products to plan their product supply and to adapt their production potential to market needs on the basis of fair and non-discriminatory principles. We hope that the approval of this report will signal the definitive establishment of quality as the lynchpin of the European strategy for the agri-food sector, and that the Commission will seriously consider our committee’s proposals, so that one of the principal strong points of European agriculture can be transformed into a precious competitive advantage. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT) 
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I must express my sincere regret, and that of the entire Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which I have the honour of chairing, that no reference whatsoever has been made to the agri-food sector in the 2020 strategy. It is absurd that the Commission’s proposed strategy for the next 10 years does not include the central issue of the challenge relating to food security, growth and job retention in rural areas. Madam President, how can one conceive of a green and sustainable Europe without taking into account that 45% of all European territory is managed by farmers? How can one fail to take into account the nearly 30 million people who work on that territory? These are workers who must be safeguarded and protected. Before we focus on new jobs, we must protect the existing ones. I would remind you that agriculture provides a whole host of essential services relating to, among other things, food, biodiversity, the landscape and the environment, and these are tasks that are performed for the sake of the social and economic life of rural areas. The Spanish Presidency has also insisted strongly on the need for a powerful common agricultural policy. I am therefore concerned about this very serious omission, which I hope Parliament will be able to put right. Paolo De Castro,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, here we are once again discussing the crisis in the agricultural sector. In recent months, Parliament has spoken several times on the difficulties that have seriously beset the milk sector, and asked the Commission and the Council to take urgent action. We have achieved results, albeit only partial results, but on the basis of these initiatives, a special fund of EUR 300 million has been made available to deal with the emergency. However, we must now take note that the crisis that has affected the dairy farming sector is rapidly extending to other sectors of European agriculture, with the wheat, olive oil and fruit and vegetable markets showing alarming signs, as Mrs Fischer Boel has just said. As for milk, we are facing a cyclical phenomenon that goes hand in hand with the difficult economic situation that has inevitably resulted in a fall in demand and in the ensuing stagnation of the markets. This crisis is starting to take on a decidedly worrying dimension, as demonstrated by the numerous protests led by farmers in many regions of Europe. These are symptomatic of a pressing and alarming situation and of widespread concern for the future of the sector as a whole. That is why, at the last meeting of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on 1 December, we decided unanimously to invite the Commission to the House to report to us on the status of the crisis faced by our agriculture and the trends that the various productive sectors are going through. On this front we expect, first of all, the Commission to make use of all the measures at its disposal to stabilise the market and to stimulate the recovery of consumption but, at the same time, we believe that this opportunity should also be seized upon to look to the future, and help guarantee that the common agricultural policy will continue to be an important European policy, which will look after the interests of all citizens and all European regions, from northern Sweden to southern Cyprus. Farmers expect immediate answers, and today we are here to accept responsibility to speed things up, to tackle the crisis in a decisive manner, and to put the lessons of recent experiences to good use, thus avoiding wasting time and quickly remedying a situation that is in danger of becoming even worse. We would like to receive an answer and also news from the Commission in this regard. Paolo De Castro,  
Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, here we are once again discussing the crisis in the milk sector. The dramatic nature of this crisis continues to concern us, just as European farmers continue to express their hardship and voice their fears for the future. Parliament has already expressed its views on this matter, both by adopting a resolution with our proposals and by adopting the Commission proposal to extend the intervention period for milk powder and butter, to which we added the request for the measure on the private storage of cheese. At that time, we pointed out that the measures proposed by the Commission did not go nearly far enough. We now have to decide whether or not to allow the urgent procedure for the extension of Article 186 of the single CMO Regulation to the dairy sector, namely the possibility for the Commission to decide, in the event of a market crisis, to implement emergency measures without going through the normal procedure in Parliament. Yesterday evening, an extraordinary meeting of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development was held to discuss this, with Mrs Fischer Boel attending. Firstly I, and the committee which it is my honour to chair, would like to thank the Commissioner for coming to us in Parliament right at the end of the Agricultural Council which was held in Luxembourg. This gesture was one of great attentiveness which we appreciated. Yesterday evening, the debate was very spirited, Mr President, and our fellow Members voiced a lot of criticism. First of all, it was pointed out that the Commission was very slow to act, and did not adequately grasp the seriousness of the crisis under way. Then the objection was raised that Article 186 deprives Parliament of its decision-making prerogatives, thereby giving carte blanche to the Commission. It was also said that the Commission should have made more funds available to tackle the crisis. These are legitimate concerns which we agree with in part. Nevertheless, Mr President, I feel compelled to admit that the Commission has made considerable efforts and progress, showing that it takes Parliament’s opinion and wishes seriously. It has explained how it intends to use a fund of EUR 280 million – which, I would remind you, we will be voting on this Thursday in the context of approval of the 2010 budget – and set out some of the measures it will implement, such as the private storage of cheese and raising the ceiling of de minimis
 aid from EUR 7 500 to EUR 15 000, as requested in our resolution which was adopted in September. Although I am aware that all this still does not go far enough, I nevertheless believe, Mr President, that today we should vote in favour of the urgent procedure. European farmers expect immediate answers and too much time has already been wasted. Today we must take responsibility for speeding things up in order to face the crisis head on. Let us show, ladies and gentlemen, the same responsibility which pervades our preparations for the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon with codecision in agricultural matters. Paolo De Castro,

 Mr President, Mrs Fischer Boel, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to take the opportunity to say how pleased I am at the responsibility shown this morning by the House when it adopted the urgent procedure to include the dairy sector under Article 186 of the single CMO Regulation, along with many other agricultural products. The rapid extension to this sector of the rules governing intervention in the event of market crisis enables us to provide a significant response at an extremely difficult time for farming as a whole and the dairy sector in particular. At this point, we expect the European Commission to take onboard, as Mrs Fischer Boel just said, Parliament’s requests, which have pointed out several times that the measures taken until now have proved to be inadequate given the seriousness of the current crisis. Parliament’s openness towards the Commission today should not be interpreted as full delegation with unrestricted powers, but as a gesture of responsibility in a dramatic and wholly exceptional situation. I am keen to stress that in this regard, Parliament considers it essential to be involved at every stage of the decision-making process in order to guarantee democratic scrutiny, and this is why we believe that the Commission should notify Parliament in advance of how it will actually use these new powers conferred under Article 186 for the milk sector as well.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 2 October was a great day for Europe thanks to the Irish who voted in favour of the Treaty of Lisbon. The entry into force of codecision will be a veritable democratic revolution for the common agricultural policy in particular. Parliament will finally have decision-making powers equal to those of the Council of Agricultural Ministers, thanks to the agreement of the Irish and the favourable votes received in the national parliaments, including the Czech Parliament. Any delay would create problems for farmers throughout the Member States. In fact, the agricultural sector is going through one of its most delicate and difficult times of recent years, with a fall in the prices of most products, and not just of dairy products, as we have seen these last few days. As we await the formal entry into force of the Treaty, we expect the Council and the Commission, Mr President, to give careful consideration as from today to the decisions taken by Parliament – which was democratically elected by all European citizens – regarding agricultural matters too, starting with measures to address the crisis in the dairy sector.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the dairy farming sector is going through one of the deepest and most serious crises of the last few decades: the fall in the price of milk and the more general crisis in the dairy farming market have now become a source of concern throughout Europe. This is a cyclical crisis, caused by the difficult economic situation, which has led to a decline in milk consumption and created stagnant markets, with the prices paid to producers in free fall. The prices paid to milk producers have plummeted everywhere, averaging 24 cents per litre within the European Union. Many economic operators are in an even more serious situation, as they get prices of less than 20-21 cents, when their production costs come to at least 40 cents per litre. Other markets, such as the cereal, olive oil and fruit and vegetable markets, are showing some alarming signs too. On this front, first of all, we should continue to make use of all the measures at our disposal so as to stabilise the market and to stimulate an upturn in consumption, but at the same time we need to be able to look to the future with medium- and long-term policies and to do everything possible to identify acceptable and lasting solutions aimed at minimising the risk of price fluctuations. In this context the Commission proposals extending the intervention period for butter and skimmed milk powder have been welcomed and accepted within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, as the unanimous vote of 2 September demonstrates. We believe, however, that these proposals are not enough to mitigate the serious consequences of the crisis in the sector. That is why, still in relation to the adoption of the European Commission’s proposal, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has adopted an amendment to my proposal that also reintroduces aid for private storage of cheese, which was abolished under the health check on the common agricultural policy in November 2008. This was a unanimous decision, Madam President, Commissioner, representing what are, in essence, identical views shared by the members of the Committee on Agriculture, which I have the honour of chairing, and expressing our desire to send out a strong signal to the Council and the Commission at a sensitive time for an extremely important sector for European agriculture. As well as being a first important demonstration of the positive leadership that we as the European Parliament want to provide when looking ahead to codecision in agricultural matters too, this is a measure that can also offer immediate help to dairy farmers, who are grappling with an increasingly difficult market and with an obvious and dramatic fall in sales. However, these initial measures, on which we will vote today, are not enough to support the producers in crisis, and that is why the Committee on Agriculture, through an oral question and a resolution on which we are preparing to vote, is calling on the European Commission to introduce new and effective measures to combat the crisis and to support the sector. We want to encourage and at the same time support the European Commission in the process of deciding what must be done to end the crisis in the European dairy farming sector once and for all. In this sense we hope that the Commission will provide an exhaustive answer to our questions and will take our proposals seriously, so that interinstitutional cooperation produces the results that European agriculture deserves and shows its solidarity by offering practical support to European farmers in crisis, who need our help today.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank the Commission for deciding to come here to Parliament today to present new proposals on the crisis in the dairy farming sector. It is important for the parliamentary term that has just begun to be characterised by an interinstitutional dialogue between the Commission and Parliament, a positive dialogue, which has in fact already launched the codecision process. We will assess your new proposals very carefully, Commissioner, and it will be my job to ask the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to issue an opinion on the new ideas immediately, without delay. May I conclude, however, by pointing out that, if the amendment adopted unanimously within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is also adopted by this House in plenary, it will become a political problem if the Council, after the ratification of Lisbon, should then vote it down. I therefore invite you, and the Council, to give it serious consideration. Rita Borsellino,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is an emotional moment for me as I come to present my own-initiative report on the European Union’s internal security strategy. It is, in fact, 20 years ago this week – on 23 May to be precise – that Judge Giovanni Falcone, his wife and his police escort were murdered. I would like to dedicate the adoption of this report to all the victims of mafias, organised crime and terrorism, and, in particular, to Melissa Bassi, the young victim of last Saturday’s attack on a school in Brindisi, in which six other girls were also wounded. The motive for the attack is still unknown, but it clearly comes within the context of growing tension and lack of security caused by the crisis, which organisations or individuals may be tempted to exploit for violently subversive ends. My thoughts also go out to the victims of the earthquake in Emilia Romagna, because natural disasters also come within the Union’s internal security remit. The text that we will vote on tomorrow highlights the importance of having a consistent security strategy for the Union, and in that respect I would like to thank the Commission for the major effort it has made in drafting this strategy. As is repeatedly shown in the report, security must always be pursued in accordance with the rule of law and people’s fundamental rights, which form an integral and inseparable part of this strategy. That is also why the role of the EU institutions in defining and implementing the strategy is of particular importance, especially in the post-Lisbon context. The European Parliament also needs to play an appropriate role in this context, both in setting priorities for the strategy and during the evaluation stage. This role derives from the fully-fledged legislative powers that Parliament has acquired in matters of security. It is also essential for ensuring proper democratic control, which the European Parliament should exercise alongside the national parliaments. That is why we will undertake to establish regular links between the European Parliament and the national parliaments, so as to create a parliamentary political round associated with the Commission’s annual report on this subject and ending with an annual parliamentary report on the implementation status of the internal security strategy. We believe the Union needs to have a clear idea of the extent of the threats to internal security, which it currently does not have. We therefore call on Europol, with the support of the other EU institutions and agencies, to conduct a global analysis of the threats facing the Union, on the basis of a more transparent and robust methodology and relying on information contributed by the Member States. In relation to the five key objectives identified by the Commission, we are of the opinion that they are not exhaustive and that the order of priorities could probably have been better structured. The fight against terrorism, organised crime and mafias is, and must remain, a key priority within the internal security strategy. The Union must know not only how to react to whatever happens in Europe, but also how to prevent and interpret it. That has been shown by the events in Utøya and now again in Brindisi. We need to be able to recognise the early signs of violent radicalisation, barbarisation of the social milieu and violent extremism. Judicial cooperation is the main element lacking in the security strategy outlined by the Commission, and this gap needs to be filled. Joint action by judicial systems across Europe is crucial if we are to clamp down on crime and terrorism; strengthening such action must be prioritised, as must fighting corruption and combating environmental, economic and corporate crime. While we agree with the emphasis placed on fighting cybercrime, the Commission’s decision to include the protection of intellectual property rights among our security priorities hardly seems justified. As the issue of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement shows, this topic is not just a security matter but is highly complex and involves people’s rights, and therefore it requires a more thorough debate. I would like to finish by thanking all the shadow rapporteurs who played a part in drafting this report, as well as the staff of the political groups and my personal assistant. Rita Borsellino,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I was part of the European Parliament delegation that visited Sicily in November last year. The head of our delegation, Ms Wikström, wrote to the Italian Minister for the Interior, Ms Cancellieri, and has received a reply that is clear enough. I should like to put on record first of all that since our visit, there has been a change of government in Italy, and there has also been a change of approach to the situation. However, the situation itself in the countries from which the flow of migrants largely originates has also changed. This is why we must not shirk from the need for a close examination of what has happened or of the situation as it is now. The most important fact, still an issue, is Lampedusa’s status as an unsafe port with the closure of the Contrada Imbraciola emergency assistance and reception centre following the fire in September 2011 in which it was damaged. However, the damage was only partial: a dormitory was wrecked and one of the facility’s seven buildings was damaged, followed by the effective termination of the Presidium project. Now, apart from the consideration that the only unsafe port in the Mediterranean was Tripoli in the Gaddafi era – and this analogy does not seem flattering to me – and given that the migration flows have certainly not come to an end, even though they have notably lessened both in numbers and for seasonal reasons, it is important that there should be a functioning emergency assistance and reception facility, and that it should be located at Lampedusa, which is the first landing point for those arriving from the opposite shore after journeys that are certainly not easy or free from risk. This is something the shipwreck victims from Somalia who arrived in April this year know well, after seeing 10 people die on the barge on which they were travelling, or the 20 who were transferred from Linosa because there was no place for them in the other reception centres, or the 18 who are still in Linosa, living in the stadium’s changing-rooms. There is also the tourist residence of Cala Creta, where they are currently housed, which is certainly neither an identification and expulsion centre nor a reception centre for asylum seekers, and especially the fact that in the meantime, both the sanitary arrangements and the possibility of receiving asylum at Lampedusa have been removed. Everything has been entrusted to the goodwill and the kind-heartedness of the police or the citizens and volunteers of Lampedusa. Another thing that must be borne in mind is the role that the centre itself has assumed in the recent past. After having allowed thousands upon thousands of people to gather, against all legal and ethical standards, in a place which, in terms of capacity and function, was only intended to accommodate a few hundred passing through, after having allowed an area of a few square kilometres, already made problematic on account of its location and logistics, to be forced to accommodate a number of people far in excess of the local population itself, we must give thought to who is responsible for an extremely tense situation, which then resulted in the fire itself. I believe that a perusal and examination of the facts is enough to understand that it was precisely the removal from Lampedusa of the great number of people who had gathered there which led to all this. Today, the best relations will surely lead to a better state of affairs. Rita Borsellino  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Member of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to join my colleagues who have welcomed the anti-corruption package approved by the European Commission on 6 June. Corruption is a transnational phenomenon and European-wide measures are needed to fight it. According to estimates from Eurobarometer, the vast majority of our European citizens believe that Europe should do more. How can we fault them? Many Member States have lacked the political will to fight corruption. One only has to consider that some European countries have still not signed the United Nations Convention Against Corruption. If we think of the devastating effect of corruption on democratic processes, citizens’ rights and confidence in the rule of law, it is clear that the national anti-corruption measures adopted by Member States to date are not sufficient to curb what is a growing problem. The European Union has to give a unified, strong response, especially now, in the midst of an unprecedented economic crisis, which is having an impact on people’s lives, on the survival of welfare and pension systems, and on the ability of institutions to guarantee essential services. Each year corruption causes the loss of EUR 120 billion, the equivalent of 1% of the European Union GDP. Every day it siphons off resources belonging to the EU and to Member States that could be used to provide key services – education, children’s services, employment and transport. In other words it siphons off clean resources from services to support people. We therefore need to be more courageous and more firm, both in overseeing the implementation of anti-corruption measures, and in intensifying and strengthening measures to combat corruption at EU level. More specifically, we cannot talk about combating corruption unless we are capable of adopting at least basic standards for defining the crime of corruption, which there is no trace of in the package just launched. The same goes for the definition of standard parameters for measuring the extent of the problem in Member States, which is essential for preparing an adequate response. For example, we are in favour of relaunching the network of EU anti-corruption contact points, as I proposed in the resolution we will be voting on tomorrow. Rita Borsellino  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today’s debate on readmission agreements cannot escape the now thorny issue of the agreement between the European Union and Libya. We know that one part of the agreement centres on the fight against illegal immigration. We are worried because so far, the Commission has said little to us on the issue, despite the fact that the Treaty of Lisbon obliges the Commission to provide Parliament with information promptly. As we know, Libya is not a signatory to the Geneva Convention on Human Rights, nor has it so far shown that it has adopted standards of behaviour in line with international law. I am thinking of the case of the Eritrean immigrants held in inhumane conditions in the Libyan centre of Brak, as well as the closure of the offices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Above all, however, I am thinking about the events of last week, when a Libyan patrol boat opened fire on an Italian fishing boat from the Mazara del Vallo fleet in international waters, claiming that there were illegal immigrants on board. This is an extremely worrying explanation that brings to mind the agreement signed between Libya and Italy. Among other things, this provides for the refoulement of immigrants to Libya without any provisions on the right to request asylum or individual, case-by-case assessments of each situation, whilst it also permits the use of firearms to stop immigrants. Given that part of the agreement is secret in this case too, I wonder if the Commission is aware of its content and whether, in the case in question, it thinks it necessary to request explanations regarding the Libyan authorities’ ability to open fire on boats if they suspect that they are carrying illegal immigrants. Because if this was the case … (The President cut off the speaker) Rita Borsellino  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Chastel, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the French Government’s decision to expel more than one thousand Roma is an extremely serious matter, above all, when we consider that this measure was taken for propagandist and populist reasons at a time when the French Government is far from enjoying favourable public opinion, and this is true political manipulation. This measure undermines the principle of European citizenship first and foremost. Under Directive 2004/38/EC on freedom of movement, this principle must be restricted only in specific cases and the restriction assessed on a case-by-case basis. I do not believe that this is what happened. As guardian of the treaties, the Commission’s job is to intervene quickly and to carefully assess conduct by Member States that is xenophobic and does not comply with EU law. I would also like to remind you that when the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force, the Charter of Fundamental Rights became binding and prohibits any kind of discrimination based on ethnic origin or nationality. Today, this debate gives us the opportunity to find out what the Commission and the Council think about these measures and what action they will take in this regard, not least because, quite sincerely, I believe that the Commission’s response was a little late in coming. I shall conclude by asking the Commission and the Council what became of the action plan for the development of a European strategy for the Roma and their integration, and how France and the other Member States are using the European money earmarked for the integration of ethnic minorities.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is not my intention, nor that of my group – which supported and wanted this debate – to transfer Italian internal political diatribes to the European domain. The issue of freedom of information concerns us all: it concerns the European Union, which can and must regulate the matter at Community level, so as to resist political and economic conditioning and to guarantee true pluralism of information. The Italian anomaly, where the Prime Minister is also the owner of some of the most important private networks, lies precisely in the existence of a dangerous link between the media and political and economic powers. It is precisely for this reason that we are calling for a European legislative measure, a measure that – far from being an anti-Italian act – will help to safeguard pluralism of information, preventing concentrations and conflicts of interest. We therefore call on the Commission today to intervene as quickly as possible – as this Parliament has already requested in the past – in order to equip the European Union with common rules for safeguarding freedom of information for all European citizens.

 Mr President, Mr Barrot, Mr Billström, ladies and gentlemen, in recent days, when setting out the European asylum plan, you yourself, Mr Barrot, talked of steadfastness in the fight against illegal immigration and of humanity when receiving the victims of persecution. Translated into legal terms, this means ensuring protection and the right to asylum for those fleeing starvation, war and persecution, and preventing their expulsion to countries where their lives are in danger or they risk inhumane treatment. This is basically the opposite of what the Italian Government is doing, as demonstrated by the latest worrying refoulement of 75 immigrants from Eritrea and Somalia to Libya, which happened without at least checking whether there were any potential asylum seekers, as required by international law and as denounced yesterday by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. An agreement between Italy and Libya cannot transform that stretch of the sea into a free zone where human rights are violated. I therefore call on the Commission to take action as soon as possible to ensure that the rules of international law are restored and complied with. Furthermore, I would like to know what progress has been made in the negotiations on the bilateral agreement between the EU and Libya, already underway for a number of years. When do you expect to conclude it? Can the Council and the Commission confirm that this agreement would prevail over the Italy-Libya one? Can you explain to Parliament the key points relating to tackling illegal immigration and guaranteeing the right to asylum and the principle of non-refoulement? Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, I would like to move this oral amendment, which is purely technical, to add to paragraph 22 the words: ‘which are eligible for registration and expected to register’.

Madam President, we are having a strange debate. We are discussing two balanced reports, and then the third one, the report by Ms Ferreira, on which the EPP has chosen to follow an ideological and extremist line, sticking to the defence of an integralist version of austerity policy. The members of Berlusconi’s party in this Parliament are performing the miracle of being extremist twice over: extremist in Italy against austerity, and extremist in this Parliament in supporting austerity, but behind the ideologies there is reality, and the reality is that the rate of fiscal consolidation is not only worsening the recession and unemployment, it is not reaching its main goal: the reduction of deficit and debt.  Open your eyes, EPP colleagues in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. With your medicine, public debt is growing in Europe, and if we want to reduce it, fiscal discipline must not be blind. It must be growth-friendly; it must leave room for public investment and have a sustainable space. After the IMF, the Commission and the European Council are recognising this reality, but not the EPP in the ECON Committee, which even went so far as to delete a paragraph which simply welcomed the efforts of the Commission to pursue growth-friendly fiscal consolidation. We hope that in plenary the EPP will isolate its extremists and will return to moderation and a spirit of compromise, but if this does not happen, our ‘no’ will be loud and clear.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the current crisis is not just an economic crisis, it is also a political crisis that has to do with the contradiction between the prevalence of the national political sphere and the need for the euro to have a European government founded on European institutions that have democratic legitimacy at European level. For this reason, the resolution is of great importance. Roberto Gualtieri,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. 
– (IT) 
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I said that the crisis currently affecting the euro is not exclusively economic but is rather a political crisis based on the growing contradiction between the fact that the national dimension prevails in politics yet the policies needed to face the crisis are European. This resolution aims to bring about a reform that does not require changes to the Treaties or secondary legislation. It is an important political and institutional reform because it uses the mechanism of nominating a candidate for Commission Presidency based on the model of parliamentary regimes, although we are obviously not dealing with a direct election. Nomination is by the European parliamentary parties, recognised by and present in the Treaties. We are therefore applying the spirit and the letter of the Treaties, which state that the President of the Commission is elected by Parliament and that the appointment of the President should take into account the result of the EP elections. At the same time, we are introducing a reform allowing the citizens to participate directly in choosing the political government of Europe. This brings genuine democratic legitimacy, based on a real European political sphere for the European institutions, which is a precondition for the effectiveness of their actions of government, as well as for their democratic legitimacy. On the other hand, this reform does not, in my opinion, contradict the independence of the Commission. This is because Article 17 of the Treaty of Lisbon on the independence of the Commission refers both to the fact that the Council should propose a candidate, acting by qualified majority, and that the proposal should take account of the results of the elections to the European Parliament, clearly demonstrating, as is the case in ordinary democratic regimes, that the democratic legitimacy of a governing body does not necessarily conflict with its independence. The question here is one of democratisation and politicisation, in order to strengthen the action of the Commission and, overall, to build a more legitimate, stronger European Union that is closer to its citizens and therefore more capable of providing a response to the extraordinary crisis that we are experiencing. Indeed, with reforms such as this, the crisis might well be the opportunity to take another step on the road to a political Europe. Roberto Gualtieri,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fundamental message of this report is that a single currency cannot simply be a system of rules but requires proper economic governance, with its own resources and full democratic legitimacy. A genuine Economic and Monetary Union should therefore be based on the EU institutions, around which a true European political space should take shape. Consequently, an increased role for Parliament is not a case of empire-building but is an essential condition for giving legitimacy and strength to the governance of the euro. However, we believe that a loose federation, based on a clear definition of roles, resources and powers between the EU and the Member States, would be more effective and democratic and, at the same time, more respectful of the national parliaments’ prerogatives than the model that has taken shape in recent years. Because of this, we support the idea of stronger fiscal powers based on own resources, the embryo of a proper European Treasury, provided that this operates within the EU budget and is based on additional resources. For this reason we believe that the ex ante
 coordination of economic policies can be increased and must involve Parliament on a different basis from the contract-based model indicated in the interim report. Because of this we believe that implementing common debt management mechanisms at EU level is unavoidable. So this means reinforced governance, but also different policies. Budgetary discipline should be accompanied by countercyclical measures that can guarantee a suitable role for public investment, and the protection and revitalisation of the European social model should become an integral part of the governance of the euro, a genuine ‘fifth pillar’ based on a social pact that prioritises youth and employment. With this report, Parliament is therefore promoting an ambitious vision and a clear and realistic roadmap. Firstly, full use should be made of the broad margins for manoeuvre offered by the Treaties; in the next parliamentary term, boosted by enhanced legitimacy from Parliament and the Commission, through the mechanism by which the European parties choose the candidate to be chair, a Convention should be set up that completes the process of building proper economic and democratic governance of the euro, which is essential if the crisis is to be overcome and Europe saved. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the current difficulties facing the European steel industry demand an examination of the role of the industry in EU policies. This not only concerns the limited powers of completion, shall we say, of the industry, but the overall effect of competition, trade, cohesion and fiscal policies. Although the economic crisis has highlighted the central role of manufacturing, we must move away from a system that has in recent decades put consumption before production, services before industry. I believe that the various cases, such as the special steel manufactured at Terni and the Piombino steel plant, are food for thought in this respect. In terms of competition policy, for example, we should maintain a global, and not just a European, outlook when evaluating dominant positions. With regard to this particular question, I believe it is important that we guarantee the integrity of the Terni site during the current sale and hive-off by Outokumpu of its steel pipe business. In terms of fiscal policy, the measures contained in June’s Growth Pact must be implemented swiftly, encouraging fiscal consolidation to bolster growth and thus safeguard the role of public investment in European fiscal policy. Finally, there is the question of rules on State aid, which should be recast to encourage bridging finance aimed at securing the future of manufacturing at sites deemed to be strategic. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a single currency requires genuine economic union; not merely a system of rules and regulations but economic government based on democratic institutions and equipped with adequate resources. Parliament insists that there can be no effective and legitimate ways of achieving this aim unless developed within the Union framework based on the institutions of the Union, and that the European Parliament is the Parliament of the euro because the euro is the currency of the Union. It is right that these principles should be recalled in the European Council’s conclusions, but they need to be stated tangibly and coherently. Greater fiscal capacity is required to absorb the shocks caused by the crisis and to sustain growth and social inclusion, but clearly such fiscal capacity can and must be made a part of the EU budget and must be based on additional own resources; above all it should not distract from the need to have a joint capacity for issuing and managing debt. However, we are opposed to individual contracts: they are ineffective and risk bringing about an asymmetric transfer of sovereignty, which would accentuate the democratic deficit. Parliament proposes a different model: binding and general social and economic objectives defined in ordinary legislative procedure at EU level, with national governments and parliaments competent to decide how these might be achieved. This approach reflects a vision that is at once more ambitious and more realistic of a Europe in which stability, growth, social cohesion and democracy go hand in hand – and for this reason a fifth social pillar is essential – and of a federal transition aimed at building consensus among citizens on the basis of a clear road map. This would involve: 1) correcting a policy based on austerity and the inter-governmental method with swift Decisions that take maximum advantage of the possibilities offered by the Treaties and prioritise growth and employment; 2) rendering the upcoming European elections genuine elections for the government of the EU. Finally, a convention should be called to complete the building of real democratic government for Europe and its currency. Parliament calls on you to act, and Parliament will exercise all of its powers. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with Mr Brok’s statements and with his report, which see progress in the development of the European External Action Service. This, together with your personal action, is starting to give shape and identity to the EU’s common foreign and security policy and external action, along the lines of a global multilateral approach based on plural instruments, which is the only possible way to face the challenges of the world today. In this framework, I believe that the balanced approach you have taken on delicate issues such as those of Syria and Iran, based on a correct awareness of the delicate network of interdependence and on the contradiction between state and national religion that characterises the Middle East, is commendable. That said, there is clearly a long way to go towards a better identification of the priorities, which are to strengthen the unity of intent of the Member States, strengthen European defence and develop the parliamentary dimension of the common foreign and security policy, both in terms of parliamentary control of the spirit and the letter of Article 36, and of strengthening the potential of parliamentary diplomacy. I believe that in these areas, too, we can work together, not least in preparation for the review of the decision establishing the External Action Service, towards which we will work constructively.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the ‘two-pack’ shows that there is a legal basis for EU governance of the euro area, as this Chamber had called for during the revision of Article 136. What we now have to assess is whether these two regulations seem to be capable of dealing with the deterioration of the crisis and the potential of their legal basis. Here, the answer is clear: the Commission’s proposal seems to belong to another epoch. As Commissioner Rehn has said, the Commission proposes an addition to the ‘six-pack’ without taking into account the obvious limits of austerity policies and economic governance that are solely focused on introducing rigid constraints and without attributing any real financial decision-making powers to the EU. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has introduced significant improvements to the Commission’s proposal, especially visible in the report by Ms Ferreira, first and foremost, in the article on the debt redemption fund. However, there remain several limitations. I am struck by the deafness of rapporteur Mr Gauzès who, faced with the proposal to involve Parliament in activating the enhanced surveillance procedure, introduces a procedure similar to that used for delegated acts. Our group, however, has responsibly decided to focus on one point, on which, however, there still appears to be some confusion. Amendment 82 is not a weakening of the Stability and Growth Pact, it is not a classic ‘golden rule’ clause. Quite the opposite: it is a tool to defend the Stability and Growth Pact, to make it effective and to ensure compliance, as well as giving a greater role to the Commission. The amendment is based on the concept of sustainable discipline and gives the Commission the task of prioritising investments for growth and employment when defining medium-term objectives and assessing Member State budgets. For this reason, I call upon fellow Members in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) to read the amendment, to reflect and to prevent this Parliament from appearing to be cut off from a situation that is evolving throughout Europe as well as in the Council.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Martin’s report paves the way to the full implementation of the Treaties’ provision governing the right of inquiry, essential for carrying out one of Parliament’s fundamental duties: political control. The Treaty of Lisbon introduced a special legislative procedure, and we therefore hope that during negotiations, both the institutions – Council and Commission – will uphold the spirit of this rule which explicitly entrusts the power of initiative and regulatory power to Parliament, and limits the role of the Council and Commission to a mere expression of consent. Mr Martin’s report draws on the previous experiences of temporary committees of inquiry which have shown the limitations of this instrument, and proposes significant innovations. Informal talks with the Danish Presidency and with the Commission have resulted in satisfactory compromise proposals which meet some of the requests of the Member States and the Commission, but which do not limit Parliament’s right to hold to account EU and national institutions for the correct implementation of EU legislation, and to identify possible instances of maladministration. Certain wording could be better clarified, but it is vital not to compromise on one point: the committees of inquiry must have access to documents and persons. This has nothing to do with judicial duties but, precisely, it concerns the full implementation of the political right clearly enshrined in the Treaties: the right of political control. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, now the figures more than the theories clearly demonstrate that not only has the austerity strategy failed to produce growth and employment, but that it does not even provide stability within the European Union, which was Ms Merkel’s main goal, given that public accounts are getting worse, not better. We therefore need a change, and although the actions on which a consensus seems to be emerging are certainly positive, they are still insufficient. The project bonds pilot project is an important precedent, but its macro-economic impact is just a drop in the ocean. Even strengthening the European Investment Bank, which has greater potential, is not decisive, whilst better spending of Structural Funds is unlikely to have much of an effect since we currently lack even the resources to pay for projects already begun. Two essential elements for emerging from the crisis are missing. The first is a reformulation of the Stability Pact, which would also affect the fiscal compact without it needing to be amended, to separate a portion of investments from calculation of the structural deficit, giving the Commission a specific role in establishing them and activating this separation in recessive phases of the cycle. The second is joint management of a portion of the public debt based on the model of the proposed debt redemption fund. These two elements must go hand in hand and form a ‘growth and stability pack’ which must be EU-wide in order to be effective: so a ‘pack’ and not a ‘compact’. For this we need to make the most of the ‘two-pack’ discussion in order to act quickly and effectively on EU legislation. I believe that the Commission should play a clearly defined role in this process and stop defending an austerity policy now acknowledged by everyone as disastrous. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I join in thanking the Commission and the Presidency of the Council, but this debate is especially timely and important because we are facing two unacceptable violations of the letter and the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon. The violation of the letter – as many speakers have pointed out – is the European Union’s boycott on acceding to the European Convention on Human Rights, which is clearly set out in the Treaty of Lisbon and is a essential complement to the adoption of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The violation of the Treaty’s spirit, meanwhile, relates to the project currently under discussion in Brighton to amend the Convention, reducing citizens’ opportunities to appeal to an unacceptable extent. These are truly paradoxical proposals, not only because Protocol 14 has already significantly reformed the Court’s procedures, but also because, in more general terms, solving the problem of too many pending cases by reducing opportunities to appeal is like combating an epidemic by closing hospitals. The problem is not too many appeals, it is too many violations of rights in Europe and that is what governments should be worrying about. Parliament is therefore very concerned and highly vigilant. We think a reaction that prevents the kind of reforms under discussion in Brighton is of the utmost importance. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have to say that I was disappointed with Mr Barroso’s speech. As many have said – the last of whom was Mr Domenici – a fact evident to all, with the clear exception of the European institutions, has not been acknowledged. That is that we are falling from a recession into the risk of a depression, and in these circumstances, compliance with the objectives of the ‘six-pack’ and the fiscal compact is quite simply impossible. There is only one solution for tackling this recessionary and depressive downward spiral and that is to revitalise demand through investment. The solutions and answers that Mr Barroso proposed cannot work by themselves. Investment is needed, and as it is not realistic to make a substantial increase in the European budget at the moment – although we have been asking for it – public investment is needed, and therefore a reform of the ‘six-pack’ that introduces the golden rule on a group of public investments, which need to be separated from the calculation of the structural deficit. This is what Europe needs today. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the satisfaction of having escaped danger is understandable, but it should not make us forget the mistakes and the delays of recent years, not to mention the decisive role played by the European Central Bank (ECB) and by the new Italian Government. Most importantly, our satisfaction should not stop us facing up to the enormous structural problem that the policies of recent months have not resolved. The strategy of salary deflation brought in by austerity policies as an alternative to devaluation is not economically or socially sustainable, nor is it universally accepted in political terms. We should leave the caricatures behind. Nobody here is proposing deficit spending. We do think, however, that it is possible to combine national fiscal responsibility with a revitalisation of investment and demand; it is possible with a more even distribution of wealth; it is possible if we confront macro-economic imbalances; it is possible through large-scale EU investment; it is possible if we set up shared management of debts through a debt redemption fund. The Community method offers the instruments for realising these objectives, but we need a change in political direction which, between the elections in France and the European elections of 2014, will start a new cycle and see the consolidation of a different strategy and of truly European economic governance. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, by taking part in a critical but constructive capacity in the negotiations for the fiscal compact, this Parliament has reached an important point of unity. Greater budgetary responsibility at national level is necessary but insufficient, and without concrete steps towards growth and solidarity, it could lead to an unsustainable downward spiral towards recession. There is no evidence of Parliament’s approach, which is well thought-out and balanced, in the preparatory documents of the European Council. For the Council and the Commission, the word ‘growth’ seems to mean fiscal consolidation and salary reductions. It is true that there are positive developments taking place on the internal market, but they are not enough. Growth requires a robust internal driver, which involves a two-pronged objective: to reinforce internal demand in countries with a surplus and to promote an extraordinary investment plan financed by project bonds. However, the Commission only interprets the macro-economic imbalances in one direction – ignoring the logic of the Ferreira rule – and there is no trace of project bonds and shared investments in the European Council documents, except for a vacuous game in which the card picked is to use the existing resources of the Structural Funds, a bit like the way Mussolini used to move his tanks around in the Second World War to make it seem as if he had a bigger army than he actually had. It is therefore clear that this ruling class has had its day, and only a major political sea change can save Europe from disaster. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, commenting on the rather forgettable conclusions of the summit on 9 December, we said that this Parliament would watch and work to limit the damage of that unfortunate choice. This has been the case. Parliament’s united commitment in the difficult negotiations that have taken place has definitely helped to prevent even worse developments. There was a real risk that the new treaty would seriously undermine the law and the common European institutions, by establishing standards, mechanisms and procedures external to the Union and in contradiction with its laws. That is no longer the case. Parliament, the Commission and the President of the European Council have averted this danger. Now the treaty will have to be implemented through EU legislation. The parameters for defining deficit and debt levels have been substantially, although not completely, brought back into the context of the current regulatory framework, and the dreadful possibility of having a new parliamentary institution has been averted. But even though we have significantly limited the damage, the fiscal compact is not an adequate response to the crisis. There are still unacceptable and unwise aspects, such as the limitations on the presence of Parliament at Euro summits. From a legal perspective, the Court’s power to impose sanctions seems highly dubious. Only if the proposals that Parliament put forward with one voice in its resolution – financial transactions tax, project bonds, stability bonds – are finally adopted, can Europe overcome a crisis that unidirectional fiscal discipline threatens to aggravate.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Brok reminded us, this Parliament has adopted a critical approach to the new international agreement, which is reflected in the resolution we are about to approve. We have given the reasons for our criticism on several occasions. At an institutional level we believe that the tools provided by the treaties would have made it possible to avoid the damage of an intergovernmental agreement and to strengthen governance and budgetary discipline in the euro area whilst remaining within the legal framework of the EU. It is a paradox that even before the ink on the ‘six-pack’ has dried, some Member States already want to amend it by intergovernmental means, introducing some elements that they had not asked for before, indeed in some cases that they had actually opposed. This is a step backwards and not forwards along the road to fiscal union. On a political level we believe the economic slant of this agreement is dangerously unilateral, because without concrete measures to strengthen growth and solidarity the EU will not emerge from the crisis and the very objective of stability will not be achieved. We nevertheless felt that we had a duty to become active and constructively involved in limiting the damage to the edifice of the EU, defending the primacy of the Community method and Parliament’s prerogatives, and emphasising the necessity and urgency of shared management of sovereign debt. It is extremely significant from a political point of view that the four pro-European groups have defined a shared platform of amendments along these lines. Now we are waiting for the fourth draft of the agreement. It is clear that if not even the smallest points, on which there was agreement, are faithfully carried over into the text, Parliament will have recourse to all the tools at its disposal in order to oppose the agreement. However it is also clear that only a significant correction in approach, on an institutional and economic level, will be able to eliminate the reasons for our criticism and our determination to build a real European economic government based on the Community method and focusing on stability, growth and solidarity. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, the European Union is a Community based on law, and therefore form cannot be separated from substance: form is substance! That means that using an intergovernmental treaty as the basis for a fiscal compact is legally and technically quite a complex operation, or indeed an impossible one in practice. The comparison with Schengen and Prüm is not valid, because those areas were not governed by the Treaties. The fact is that we have reached this point because the premise was wrong; in other words, the Treaties could and should have been overhauled. We now have to find a way out, avoid the risk of renationalising Union competences, preserve the EU’s legal system, avoid duplications and, of course, correct an economic policy that is both wrong and inadequate. This House will watch carefully, ready to play its part in sorting out this incredible mess, by putting the process started at the European Council back on the rails of EU law, which are the only possible foundations on which a true fiscal union can be built.

Mr President, since Ms Koppa has already stated why the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament supports the Lisek report, I would like to focus on the Council’s conclusions, which, to my mind, represent a small but nonetheless significant step forwards. Of course, Parliament expected more, above all, in terms of planning and conduct capability, but the serious risk of a widespread abandonment of the common security and defence policy (CSDP) has been avoided, and for this I would like to thank the High Representative for her work on this front. To return to the subject of new operations, after the uninspiring outcomes of the European Union Force (EUFOR) in Libya, the Horn of Africa, Sudan and the Sahel, we expect to see real results and we are ready to offer our political and financial support. Whilst we already have pooling and sharing projects to be implemented, in terms of planning and conduct capability, the search for unanimity has presented limits, but the will to consider activating an operations centre as only a first step also emerges from the Council’s conclusions. It is important now that we do not lose momentum and instead take further steps forward, because otherwise no Member State will be able to avoid a future of global irrelevance.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation is coming to a head, and it is time to act with the speed and effectiveness that has so far been lacking. Relying on the miraculous effect of a Treaty reform announcement would be pointless and counterproductive. Embarking on the risky road towards an intergovernmental treaty would have a quite devastating effect on the markets. Reforming the Treaties takes too long; an intergovernmental agreement will not result in any kind of fiscal union. The truth is that the problem facing the EU today is a political problem, not an institutional one. It is possible, under the current Treaty, to strengthen economic convergence, enhance fiscal discipline, maintain stability in the euro area and boost growth. The two new proposals for regulations tabled by the Commission demonstrate this, and with that legal basis, Article 136, it is possible to go even further, including with regard to the role of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The flexibility clause would make it possible to increase the powers of the euro area, and Article 122(2) is an appropriate basis for that extraordinary Eurobond-based debt redemption fund proposed by the German Council of Economic Experts. In short, one has the feeling that Treaty reform is being sought so as to avoid codecision, so as to have less rather than more Europe. Hence there are no excuses: immediate action must be taken and the foundations laid for the full creation, with the citizens’ consent, of a fiscal union based on stability, growth, solidarity and democracy, one that ultimately serves as the basis for that reform of the Treaties, which is too important a goal to be compromised by a clumsy, ill-timed reform that would be legally unnecessary, economically insignificant and politically harmful today. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this excellent report can make a very important contribution to the debate under way on economic governance and on the possible reform of the Treaties, because it highlights very successfully the extremely close and obvious connection between the effectiveness of economic governance and the degree of its democratic legitimacy, thereby also emphasising, I wish to say, the absurdity of the idea of a limited Treaty reform. Because, although the objectives that such a limited reform seemingly sets could easily be achieved, as we have already argued, not with a reform but by applying the Treaty, if instead we turn the guidelines and recommendations made on the basis of Articles 121(2) and 148(4) into decisions with legal standing, we are stepping beyond the confines of a limited reform and moving towards a full-blown federal-style fiscal union that cannot be created without full democratic legitimacy and hence without a full codecision role for the European Parliament. In short, this reform, if limited, is useless; if it grants new and unconditional powers in relation to economic policy then it certainly cannot be limited. Therefore, a completely different approach must be adopted; Parliament must be involved straight away in defining the guidelines and recommendations, as the report proposes. This is a prerequisite for subsequently making those guidelines binding in nature. Adopting a completely different approach, following the Community method and striving for greater democratic legitimacy: that is the line that the Berès report convincingly proposes to us.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all allow me to offer my sincerest congratulations to Mario Monti for his good work; his nomination to guide the Italian Government is fantastic news not only for Italy but also for Europe. I believe that from this debate strong messages from all political groups will emerge with clarity, and I hope these will be listened to attentively. The first message is that without instruments for growth and development, and with only an austere approach to fiscal matters, the idea of a stable Union is a chimera. The second is that the government of peers, this peer pressure of which President Van Rompuy has also spoken, cannot function. We need provisions that have a legal basis, and we need institutions legitimated democratically. This is the only way to produce a true European economic government. In all this, to think that reforming three paragraphs of Articles 121 and 126 as decided in Berlin should be a panacea is an illusion not only because of the difficulties and risks of the revision itself but also because, of these three amendments, the first is useless, the second is irrelevant and the third is impossible. Thus, our position is clear. Firstly, before changing the Treaty of Lisbon, apply it and read it, and you will discover that Articles 136 and 352 are founded on strong legal grounds for strong governance of the euro area based on communitarian methods. Secondly, it is obvious that this Parliament is not opposed in principle to strengthening the EU’s jurisdiction by reforming the Treaty, but this mandate can be limited and should be well-balanced, and this Parliament will not accept a reform which, alongside stability, does not create a Union of solidarity, growth and democracy.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, cooperation between the European Union and the United States is certainly going to play an increasingly important role in transatlantic relations. Dialogue with the European Parliament has a crucial and growing part to play in this cooperation, which is something our friends across the Atlantic have grasped perfectly well and often better than many national governments and parliaments. This dialogue is first and foremost legislative in nature, but there is also political and strategic dialogue on major economic and foreign policy issues, areas in which this House intends to strengthen its actions and make the most of its prerogatives. One of the issues that I would like to highlight is a matter of great importance which has been positively taken up in the joint resolution. I am referring to the Middle East question. We are committed to supporting the efforts by the High Representative and the Quartet to resume the negotiations between the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli Government, because we all know that if the parties do not negotiate there will be no peace and no two-state solution. At the same time, however, we believe that recognising the Palestinians’ aspirations to be represented in the United Nations as a state does not negate the need for the talks but instead may strengthen them. We therefore call on the Member States and the United States to come up with pragmatic measures to achieve this recognition. In the context of the budget procedure, we are committed to increasing EU economic support for the Palestinian Authority and believe that the Unesco boycott is a misguided and counterproductive reaction.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Gahler has just explained, cluster munitions are terrible, fiendish instruments of death for the civilian population. Banning them is therefore a battle for civilisation to which this House has been committed for some time. The entry into force of the Oslo Convention was a major success, but now, little more than a year later, we are faced with a dangerous attempt to undermine its outcomes through an additional protocol to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons – the review of which is currently being negotiated in Geneva – which would again allow the use of cluster munitions. This is a protocol that must not and cannot be signed by countries that have already signed up to the Oslo Convention, because, as you said yourself, Commissioner, it is clearly incompatible with the Convention and would open up a dangerous loophole, not least for those other countries that want to continue to produce, stockpile and use these types of munitions. Moreover, it would create a very serious precedent and would be a blow to international law. The argument by those who say that the protocol would in any case improve the situation, because it would be signed by countries that have not signed the Oslo Convention, sounds decidedly specious to us, and on this point we would perhaps have liked to hear a rather clearer and less equivocal statement from Ms Ashton’s representative. Protocol VI would undermine the Convention because it would allow for the use of munitions produced after 1980, which form the great majority of them; it foresees a long transition period; it would allow for the use of types of cluster bomb that are extremely dangerous to civilians; and it would not set out any clear obligation to destroy individual countries’ stockpiles. It is therefore crucial that all the Member States do not support the entry into force of this protocol and that the High Representative commits herself to ensuring that all the countries in the Union adopt a clear, united position in favour of a definitive ban on cluster munitions. The joint resolution that we are about to adopt on this issue is an important political signal, and we are certain that it will be adopted in its entirety by a large majority.

 One of the causes of the current economic and financial crisis is the lack of adequate regulation of financial markets. Through the adoption of the report by Mr Canfin and the first-reading agreement between Parliament and the Council, the EU has taken an important step forwards by bringing in new rules on credit default swaps and short selling. Thanks to the work of Parliament, the slightly timid approach taken by the Council has been corrected in a number of fundamental ways. Indeed, we have brought in a ban on naked short selling – that is, selling securities that you do not actually own – which includes a ban on buying credit default swaps unless you also own the relevant government bonds. Moreover, the information and transparency obligations imposed on operators will allow national supervisory authorities to keep up to date with any pressure on a security, thereby effectively preventing risk. Parliament can therefore only express its satisfaction about the adoption of this regulation: it may be just an initial step and a simple part of a more general project to regulate the financial markets, but this regulation represents significant progress and a robust contribution to better-functioning financial markets, particularly in terms of sovereign debts.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the most recurrent words in these conclusions are ‘urge’ and ‘commitment’, including Mr Berlusconi’s commitment to tackle the North-South divide in four months. It is clear, then, that exhortations and commitments do not add up to any sort of common economic policy; nor do institutions that do not exist, such as Eurosummit, for example. The proposed regulations based on Article 136, announced by Mr Barroso, show that the institutions that do actually exist can, instead of exhortations, make laws. We say: ‘make them; make these laws now’. We would add, furthermore, that we shall not allow any treaty reforms unless all the possibilities of the existing treaty have been exhausted. We shall not accept a limited mandate that has not been devised in part by Parliament and does not include codecision on economic policy and shared responsibility for Eurobonds, because without democracy, growth and solidarity, a stable European Union remains merely a chimera.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Heading 4 is structurally underfunded with respect to the EU’s commitments and strategic interests. This has forced us to make painful choices to protect our priorities and particularly resources for Palestine, which are clearly necessary, especially in the light of the decisions taken by the United States Congress. That is what is behind the cuts to the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) budget, which are not generic, linear cuts but policy-based cuts on specific issues, which do not therefore affect other operations. First of all, Afghanistan: this is a painful cut, but at the same time we must be aware that, despite the good results of our mission, the EU is a bit-part player on this issue, subordinate to the strategies of others which, moreover, are not seeing great success. In terms of emergency measures, the issue of special representatives is coming to the fore, so this is a logical cut to make. In terms of preparatory measures, the Council rejects Article 51(5)(c) of the Financial Regulation, which gives Parliament a limited role in these measures, in line with the Madrid agreement. Hence, this cut is inevitable. It is not Parliament that has chosen this path of austerity: the Council can hardly be taken aback by its consequences. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, even though it is too early for a conclusive assessment, it is difficult to escape the impression that this Semester is producing weak coordination and inadequate democratic legitimacy. The two things are linked because without full democratic legitimacy, the Semester runs the risk of being more a bureaucratic exercise than a coordination of substance. This limitation certainly relates to the crucial issue of the Union’s competences and Parliament’s prerogatives, which should lie at the very heart of any Treaty reform, which would otherwise be pointless or harmful. This limitation also highlights a problem of effective political will to make immediate use of all the instruments offered by the Treaty in order to strengthen coordination and give Parliament a greater role. Then there is a problem of content. A reading of the Council’s recommendations shows an obvious limitation in the line of economic politics that inspired them: deficit reduction and development of the internal market are necessary but not sufficient conditions for tackling the crisis, and unless there is a major investment plan, they are liable to trigger a vicious circle that may bring us to collapse. The political line of the Semester therefore needs to be the subject of a genuine political debate, which can only take place in the context of the discussions between Parliament and the Council. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, President Barroso said some important things today, but several points need to be clarified. I would like to highlight three of them. First, euro area fiscal union. At last, someone has noticed the existence of Article 136; however, the President of the Commission spoke of a Commission-Council procedure. In fact, Article 136 also contemplates the possibility of regulations. It is therefore possible that, under Article 136, 17 Member States will vote in the Council and 27 in Parliament. We would like to know whether – as Parliament has requested – the Commission intends to propose regulations with the ordinary legislative procedure pursuant to Article 136 for the conditionality of the stability mechanism. Secondly, the stability mechanisms themselves. The 21 July agreement is fine, the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) is fine, but the truth is that the quota method does not work. You must tell us if you think that the EFSM, which still exists, can continue to operate, especially after the ruling from the German Court, and if therefore it is possible to think in terms of the communitisation of the stability mechanism. Thirdly, the Secretary General of the German Christian Democratic Union (CDU) today said that he would like to move on from monetary union to stability union. Without growth, development and employment, there can be no stability. You should tell us if the Commission agrees with this. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 In voting against the Wortmann-Kool report, and in fact against the entire ‘governance package’, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is not saying ‘no’ to more robust and stringent European rules on the fiscal policies of the Member States, but is expressing its opposition to a specific line of economic policy: a line focused solely on budgetary discipline, and therefore an inadequate response to the current serious economic and financial crisis. As a condition of its support for the package, the S&amp;D Group had requested the introduction of a golden rule to ‘save’ productive investment from swingeing cuts. The alliance between the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Euro-sceptic conservatives of the European Conservatives and Reformists Group, backed by the Council, has made it inevitable that we would vote against by rejecting this potential compromise, which opposes a line that is destined to exacerbate the sovereign debt crisis and to hit both social cohesion and growth prospects in Europe hard.

Despite the measures taken by the individual Member States, the number of victims of road-traffic accidents in Europe is still too high. By approving the report by Mr Koch – which contains more than 100 suggestions on how to ensure effective road safety – Parliament is adopting a resolution in response to the Commission communication of 2010, which appeals to this House to put forward an even more ambitious action programme. We shall need to improve the deployment of road signs, as well as infrastructure and vehicle safety and information exchange. Above all, however, we shall need to move towards harmonising legislation on the subject, for example, by reducing the speed limit in residential areas to 30 km/h and banning new drivers and those driving with passengers from drinking alcohol. This is the only way that it will be possible to halve the number of victims and reduce the number of injuries by 2020. We therefore expect the Commission to produce a new plan that follows Parliament’s suggestions by the end of the year. Road safety must be a priority for Europe. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

Mr President, would you not agree that the treaties already allow for closer integration in the euro area and that therefore it is not necessary, and indeed would be counter-productive, to achieve it outside the EU institutions, as the current governments of France and Germany seem to be aiming for? In particular, would you not agree that Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union makes it possible to adopt legislative measures for the euro area within the scope of the economic policy competences given to the EU by the treaties? Secondly, would you not agree that Article 352 makes it possible to strengthen the powers of the existing institutions in order to reach the objectives set out by the treaties? Lastly, is it not the case that Protocol No 14 does not forbid the Eurogroup Heads of State or Government from meeting without having to create another institution, and therefore that it would be unreasonable for the President of another institution – the European Council – to preside over this expanded Eurogroup? Therefore, would you not agree that achieving euro area integration within or outside the treaties is a problem of political will and not of legal barriers? Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have reached a crucial moment in the decade-long aspiration of the Palestinian people to have a state of their own and also in the rightful aspiration of the people of Israel to live in safety. This is because the latter is so intimately connected with the former, because there can be no safety without peace and there can be no peace without a democratic Palestinian state that is respectful of international law, as outlined by Mr Abbas to the United Nations. The acceptance of the timeline drawn up by the Quartet is a victory for the European Union and one which we must salute you for, Baroness Ashton, even though some countries did try to steal the European Union’s limelight. However, the news of new settlements warns us that the path ahead will be strewn with difficulties. That is why it is important to increase the pressure on the Israeli Government and clearly express the EU’s support – despite the absence of absolute unanimity – for a possible vote in the UN General Assembly on awarding the status of non-Member State. This House must be united in upholding and increasing this pressure, including putting aside differences of opinion on full membership, giving its unanimous backing through its resolution on the legitimate aspiration of the Palestinian people to be represented as a state at the United Nations.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, after 42 years of dictatorship and six months of conflict Libya is at a turning-point in its history that could open the way to a future of democracy, peace and development. This future is in the hands of the Libyans and no one can expect to impose choices and ready-made solutions on them, but at the same time it is clear that the European Union has a great responsibility, a decisive role to play in supporting the process of stabilisation and transition to democracy in the country. After being marginalised by the divisions among its members in the early stages of the conflict, a conflict the wise management of which can be attributed to NATO, the EU has gradually begun to demonstrate the capacity for action that we all value and which has produced concrete results, with the opening of the office in Benghazi, missions in Tripoli, which we would like to be more coordinated, external service action and ECHO (Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection). This activism must now find its place in the context of a strong and credible political strategy capable of defining a multilateral framework that is both robust and effective, and of ensuring a true unity of purpose within the international community, preventing overlapping and competition and guaranteeing real support for the Libyan transition. The transition will inevitably be long and complex, and will have to focus on national reconciliation while preventing the creation of new divisions within the country. At the same time it will have to ensure progress and democracy, and guarantee the involvement of civil society and the creation of new ruling classes. During this transition the return to normality and restoration of public order means difficult problems such as border control, rebuilding the judicial system and the security forces, and controlling the widespread distribution of weapons, must be addressed as a matter of urgency, while at the same time the transition has to be based on a robust and credible road map that is both democratic and representative. All this requires dialogue, commitment, leadership skills, as well as intensive planning and work to identify resources. It is therefore an important test for the EU, for the European External Action Service, and for its comprehensive approach, and the European Parliament is ready to play its part and to support this commitment.

 Parliament’s vote on the report by Mr Glante opens the way to the development of a European satellite navigation system. The establishment within the Galileo programme of a public regulated service (PRS) – an encrypted, maximum security network to be used by operators authorised by governments, such as the police or the armed forces – will provide an extremely useful service for European citizens by helping to ensure that security forces can respond to crises or emergencies without delay. Other than providing benefits for citizens, the Galileo programme also represents an opportunity for European industry in the new technologies markets by helping to create high-level jobs in the satellite navigation sector. Parliament now awaits the position of the Council, in order to make the PRS service available and operative from 2014 onwards. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

If it is true that women traditionally encounter greater obstacles than men in entering the labour market, then this is particularly the case in the business sector. It is therefore important to incentivise female entrepreneurship through targeted actions. This can be achieved, in particular, through easier access to credit – in which case the European Microfinance Instrument Progress can be of major help – or by subsidising exchange initiatives, similar to an Erasmus scheme for young female entrepreneurs, which could encourage women to embark on such a professional vocation. The European Union must therefore strive to promote the presence of women in small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe, removing the economic and obstacles that they encounter. Roberto Gualtieri,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament believes that the construction of a true European political space is a prerequisite for progressing towards a political Europe that can rise to this century’s huge challenges in a strong, determined and appropriate way. The Treaty of Lisbon represents a significant step forward in this respect, especially when it comes to the principle already mentioned by the rapporteur, Mr Duff, which clarifies that the European Parliament directly represents European citizens at EU level. Nevertheless, despite this and other important innovations in the Treaty of Lisbon, and despite the fact that everyday life clearly shows us that a political Europe is necessary, the construction of a true European political space is still a long way off. Debate in our Member States is too focused on national issues, too many of the discussions among political parties are carried out from an exclusively national perspective, and the European elections themselves often appear to the citizens as an extension of national political debate, which is also one of the reasons for the overly low turnout. We believe that a reform of European electoral law that strengthens our common principles can contribute towards this Europeanisation of European political debate. Clearly, it is not the only requirement, but it can help. Therefore, despite being aware of the numerous problems associated with this proposal, the S&amp;D Group supported the proposal for a transnational list in committee. At the same time we supported the request for a referral back to committee, because we realise that broad consensus is needed on this proposal. However, we also believe that we must proceed with determination towards a reform of the European electoral system that strengthens the transnational nature of these elections.

 By adopting the Sommer report, Parliament is showing that it is mindful of the transparency of information about the nutritional value and the provenance of foodstuffs, in line with the requirements of European consumers for greater safety in the products they buy. By confirming the agreement at second reading with the Council, Parliament is introducing the obligation to provide detailed information about the composition and energy value of foodstuffs, as well as extending origin labelling to fresh swine, sheep, goat and poultry meat. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has played a dynamic role in the negotiations, convincing the Council and Commission to consider the subsequent adoption of rules on origin for meat used in packaged foods, as well as on the effects of using hydrogenated fats, which, from today, are subject to legislation. The adopted text signals recognition of the Italian approach, which has already previously shown how to protect and promote Italian and European excellence, and it is therefore a source of satisfaction both for Italy and for operators in the sector. However, although the step taken is important, our commitment to European citizens being able to make ever more independent and informed choices about the products they put on their tables will go on. Roberto Gualtieri,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution that we are preparing to vote on is important and timely because it sets out and unequivocally clarifies the principles that must guide the action of Parliament and its representatives in conducting these difficult negotiations with national parliaments. First and foremost, these principles derive from Treaties that, by getting rid of the pillar structure, on the one hand, and assigning Parliament the role of representing citizens directly at EU level, on the other, make the European Parliament a vital source of democratic legitimacy for the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) and the common security and defence policy (CSDP) as EU policies This double innovation results, as we know, in increased functions and responsibilities, from the vote to approve the High Representative, to the referral powers established by Article 36, to the budget powers that, we must remember, make the European Parliament the budgetary authority for the exceptionally large increase in CSDP missions which, as we are aware, are civil missions. However, the reasons that lead us to take, with determination and readiness for dialogue, the road towards genuine agreement with national parliaments are also political and pragmatic. Interparliamentary cooperation is appropriate and necessary to strengthen support for the CFSP and the CSDP and to increase consistency between them and the choices made by Member States at national level. It is precisely for this reason that this cooperation should represent, in a balanced way, the institutions that express Europe’s democratic legitimacy at a different level, and an imbalance that excessively compromises Parliament’s power would be incongruous with the mission to Europeanise the debate on foreign security and defence policy in Europe, which is at the root of the idea of holding a conference. That is why it is good for tomorrow’s vote to clarify that the readiness for debate is accompanied by the utmost commitment to certain principles, starting with the principle that, as Article 9 of the first protocol clearly states, no regular form of interparliamentary cooperation can be established without Parliament’s consent.

 The single European emergency number 112 is a service that aims to ensure rapid access, free of charge, to emergency services for everyone throughout Europe, thus markedly simplifying access to the service, especially for people who are abroad. Adoption of the Rapti report is Parliament’s response to Europeans’ scant knowledge and awareness of the potential of this service. This lack of information is certainly worrying. Among the aims of the European Parliament resolution is in fact to carry out an effective information and awareness-raising campaign in key locations such as doctors’ surgeries, pharmacies, schools, airports and stations, as well as to call for improvements in the quality, efficiency and accessibility of the single service, thus ensuring easy access even for people with disabilities and vulnerable individuals. By providing the Commission with clear guidelines on how to improve use of the universal service, we have taken a step forwards in protecting people who live and travel in the Union, with particular attention to social and geographical inclusion.

 The vote on the Langen report on over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives further reinforces Parliament’s priority of regulating the financial markets and fighting speculation, the main factor in market instability at a time of crisis. Parliament has defined its position at first reading on the proposal for a regulation in line with what has already been suggested both by the European Commission and by the G20 mandate, which calls for a strengthening of the system within which OTC derivatives work, in order to provide more transparency and greater risk management. It is necessary, in fact, to provide the relevant European and national authorities with all the tools they need to supervise and control the derivatives market, including more information on the nature of derivative transactions and on the contracts entered into by counterparties. We now expect the Council to get over the splits between Member States and offer the opening needed in this area, so that the wholesale reform of European financial markets can come to fruition.

 Urban areas, which are home to 73% of Europe’s population and generate around 80% of the GDP, are the Union’s major centres of innovation, culture and growth. However, the urban dimension has up until now received insufficient recognition. For this reason it is important that Parliament should propose to enhance the European Urban Agenda within the framework of EU policies, reinforcing the contribution of cohesion policy to urban development and encouraging greater involvement on the part of local political stakeholders. It is necessary to direct the urban dimension of political cohesion towards supporting the development of basic physical infrastructure, the modernisation of economic, social and environmental characteristics of cities, urban regeneration and the promotion of social innovation in disadvantaged neighbourhoods. All this requires direct participation on the part of local authorities and civil society, and the involvement of cities’ political representatives in strategic planning and in defining and negotiating partnership contracts. Within this framework the call for the Commission to promote the creation of urban administrators and to establish an Erasmus for local and regional elected representatives is of significance. Let us monitor closely the Commission’s commitment to welcoming the important proposals of this report, in the belief that a full appreciation of the central role of the urban dimension in EU politics constitutes an indispensable condition for its success.

 Europe needs stronger and more Community-based economic governance. However, the package of measures being voted on today wrongly reflects the tendency of the current centre-right majority to view governance as a mere austerity exercise, by strengthening the preventive and corrective dimension of the Stability and Growth Pact without outlining mechanisms and instruments for supporting investment and development. One cannot accept the reverse majority rule and tougher parameters and sanctions without a golden rule to protect Member States’ investments and without Eurobonds to fund European investments and, at the same time, to guarantee sovereign debt. This is not a good enough formula for tackling the crisis and it is destined to make it worse. That is why we will vote against this and the other reports on fiscal surveillance. Moreover, we will fight to take European economic policy in a different direction and, at the same time, to strengthen the Community method and the EU’s instruments and resources.

 The European Parliament has brought an end to the long legislative procedure on the Consumer Rights Directive by adopting the Schwab report, which is a satisfactory compromise with the Council and the Commission. Two important steps have thus been taken. On the one hand, we have adopted a single legislative instrument on consumer rights, which provides harmonisation and takes over from the four previous directives in this area. On the other hand, we have laid down detailed rules for buying and selling online, in order to promote cross-border trade and to guarantee transparency for both businesses and consumers. The new directive lays down aspects that are intended to give greater protection to the European consumer, such as the information to be contained in sale contracts, delivery times, the right of withdrawal, and the right to repair or replacement of a defective product, as well as the cases in which the risk is transferred from the vendor to the consumer. Although yet more detailed rules may be laid down in future, the text that has been adopted represents a positive compromise in the harmonisation of existing regulations, guaranteeing secure purchases and putting a definitive end to typical sharp practices that hide behind electronic purchasing.

 The tragic earthquake in Japan is an incentive for Europe to look more deeply at the consequences of nuclear technology use and its impact on the safety of European citizens. In adopting the report on the proposal for a directive on the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste, Parliament is showing that it is particularly sensitive to this issue and demonstrating a clear desire to find common, definitive solutions to the storage of nuclear waste in Europe. By calling for common minimum standards for all the Member States, we are encouraging their governments to invest in new technologies, with a view to obtaining rapid, concrete results in relation to the disposal of this extremely hazardous waste. I therefore welcome two amendments tabled by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament calling for Parliament and the Council to co-decide on matters relating to nuclear energy use and endorsing the fundamental ban on waste exports to third countries, a ban which demonstrates Parliament’s determination to shoulder its responsibilities. Parliament’s vote is therefore a further step towards the gradual abandonment of nuclear energy, in favour of sustainable energy solutions that are safe for the public. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 The Dess report adopted by this House is entirely consistent with the guidelines already set by the European Commission. It calls for the common agricultural policy for 2014-2020 to be reviewed in order to meet the challenges of environmental sustainability, job creation and guaranteed high-quality, safe food. In adopting this text, the European Parliament is demonstrating its opposition to regressive tendencies and proposing that the future CAP budget remain at least at the same level as the 2013 budget, thereby ensuring that farmers receive the support they need to invest in new technologies, a crucial step if this sector is to remain competitive. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has made a decisive contribution – partly as a result of the numerous amendments tabled both in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and in plenary – to achieving a convincing result, thereby sending a clear message to the European Commission ahead of the legislative proposals scheduled for October.

By approving Mr Klinz’s report appealing for effective regulation of rating agencies, Parliament is taking another step towards greater transparency in the financial markets. It is important to overcome the current problems that characterise the sector: the lack of competition, the regulatory over-dependence on ratings, and the low reliability of notes. In this vein, Parliament’s request for the Commission to consider creating an independent European agency that could also be responsible for sovereign debt ratings is significant. Since the irresponsible behaviour of credit rating agencies (CRAs) has often been the initial cause of speculation that primarily harms European taxpayers, it is hugely important to review their role in sovereign debt ratings as part of the ongoing reform process, which will be completed in the autumn.

 By voting for the Garriga Polledo report, the European Parliament has made its voice heard on the future of the European budget and put forward an ambitious proposal for the next Multiannual Financial Framework. The request to increase the post-2013 EU budget by 5%, and therefore to increase the total European Union GNI from 1.06% to 1.11%, corresponds to a desire to honour commitments made to support growth and development, first and foremost, the Europe 2020 strategy, for which adequate resources are needed. It is important, in fact, to remember the added value of the European budget, which can act as a driver for economic growth, research and development and employment, particularly for young people, alongside national budgets. The report also reinforces Parliament’s position in favour of new financial instruments, such as the tax on financial transactions and Eurobonds, which are an opportunity for the European economy. It is now down to the Commission to take up Parliament’s ambition, presenting its proposals for the next European financial framework and not falling victim to the restrictive budget policies of Member States.

 Parliament’s approval of the directive on the charging of heavy goods vehicles is a step forward in the protection of European citizens’ health, and a commitment to lessen the harmful effects of pollution caused by such vehicles. The ‘polluter pays’ principle has been introduced for the first time in this sector in order to encourage safer and more sustainable transport, and hence to promote alternatives such as rail transport. Under the compromise reached, however, due consideration must also be given to the protection of the haulage industry, which must not be penalised excessively. Member States must therefore strive to make more effective use of the revenues collected under the Eurovignette, for example, by investing in infrastructure improvements and encouraging the use of less polluting haulage vehicles, so as to ensure that the benefits of the directive are enjoyed by all the sectors involved.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the common security and defence policy (CSDP) is going through an extremely difficult time. Just when developments in the international system require the European Union to become a credible actor in security and defence; just when the European approach to crisis management through supporting democracy rather than exporting it appears to be more suited to the challenges of our times; just when the economic crisis makes the option of developing a common defence inevitable; just when the Treaty of Lisbon provides new instruments to develop the CSDP within the framework of an integrated approach; in short, just when a quality leap in the CSDP has become necessary and possible, the European edifice seems to be creaking dangerously and there is a real risk that the ambitions and possibilities of the CSDP will have to be drastically downsized. The report I am presenting seeks to tackle this contradiction and suggests possible answers for the other institutions. With regard to the Libyan crisis, we do not confine ourselves to expressing our disappointment either at the European Union’s inability to define its position and take joint action or at the restrictions placed on the EUFOR Libya mandate. We believe the time has come for a European political initiative, in conjunction with our other partners, to bring about a ceasefire and to hold negotiations that will put an end to the Gaddafi regime and begin a transition to an inclusive democracy. NATO’s military intervention is clearly unlikely to solve anything and it will do well to adhere scrupulously to the mandate of the UN resolution, avoiding any disproportionate use of force. At the same time, we hope that CSDP assets will be used effectively to provide humanitarian assistance to the civilian population under attack and that future operations will be planned in such a way as to support the development of democracy in Libya. The Libyan situation also calls for reflection on a wider scale, and I believe it reinforces the report’s suggestions. Responsibility for the future of Europe and for security and defence, of course, lies primarily with the European Council, its members and also its President, who represents the Union in matters of foreign and security policy at that level. We say to them clearly that bilateral cooperation and coalitions of the willing cannot replace the CSDP as the Union’s policy. We do not find the idea of renationalising this policy convincing, not because we are Treaty purists, but because, if it were renationalised, this policy would not be equal to the challenges that lie ahead. We propose that Parliament should enter into a strategic dialogue with the European Council, which we call on to discuss Parliament’s recommendations, to draw up a proper foreign policy strategy and to devote an extraordinary meeting to European security and defence. We call on you, Baroness Ashton, to intensify your efforts to build a consensus among the Member States and to make use of your multiple functions to improve consistency between the CSDP, the common foreign and security policy and the other facets of the Union’s external action. The European External Action Service is an instrument with enormous potential for this work. The report puts forward several proposals for the role it should play, starting with that of being a crisis management board able to provide a genuinely integrated response to crises, and we are delighted to see that it is taking shape. The Libyan situation also confirms the inadequacy of Europe’s military capability, which is well below the overall high level of national defence budgets. It is quite obvious that strength only lies in unity. This involves pooling, sharing, strengthening of the European Defence Agency, permanent structured cooperation, development of an efficient and competitive European defence market, strengthening of the industrial and technological base, and enhancement of joint command and control capabilities. The inadequacy of these capabilities has been a factor preventing Europe from responding promptly to the Libyan crisis, starting with setting up a permanent operations general headquarters. The report formulates a large number of concrete proposals on this and other issues, such as the integration of external and internal security policies in a way that respects the primacy of the Community method. It is noteworthy that in this respect, the main pro-European political groups are united, and I thank the shadow rapporteurs and coordinators for this fruitful collaboration. Parliament is ready to support the development of a CSDP that is fully integrated with the Union’s external action and is rooted in the values and principles of Europe. Baroness Ashton, we hope you can respond convincingly to us both in words and, above all, in deeds. Roberto Gualtieri,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe Mr Albertini was right because as rapporteur, he had four minutes for his speech and two for his reply. I therefore take the liberty of pointing out that he should have his four minutes. For my part, I think this has been a useful and important debate, which shows how united Parliament is and how ready it is to offer its support for consistent and effective external action by Europe. We have not only heard recriminations for the obvious limitations shown by Europe in recent events, but we have also heard proposals offering a kind of strategic partnership between Parliament and the other institutions in order to make Europe a credible actor in security and defence matters. I believe this partnership would be not only an opportunity but a necessity as well because, if what we have been saying is true, which is that Europe’s integrated approach is its main potential, achieving that integrated approach will require the support of a body endowed with clear legislative and budgetary powers. For that reason as well, I think we should find a balanced solution to the matter of interparliamentary cooperation. It has become clear from the discussion how we must act. We must first of all assess the possibilities offered by the Treaty: by permanent structured cooperation and by Article 44, which makes it possible to delegate the task of carrying out a mission to particular Member States, but within an EU procedural framework, which is not the same thing as renationalisation. We need to make use of existing structures – starting with the European External Action Service – and set ourselves ambitious tasks in the field of capabilities. Of course, we also need to know how to offer leadership ability. We would like to thank Baroness Ashton for her commitment and for the important statements she has made. It is an attractive thought, as she said, that a small group can do great things, but Europe is a great civilised power which cannot shirk its responsibilities. Roberto Gualtieri,  
rapporteur.

 By approving the Hökmark report, Parliament is opting for innovation: the broadband and mobile telephony sector is not only of great interest to Europeans, but it makes it possible to develop new prospects in terms of research and development, areas in which the European Union can and must aspire to play a leading role. In this respect, it is important to ensure that the first European radio spectrum policy programme is in line with the objectives already outlined in the EU 2020 strategy and the Digital Agenda and comes within the priority actions of the Single Market Act. The EU must endeavour to overcome the digital divide that results in huge disparities within Europe – between urban and rural areas in particular – so as to ensure all citizens have equal access to services, especially those involving new technologies. I therefore welcome the ambitious targets proposed, to provide broadband access throughout Europe by 2020, with particular emphasis on wireless networks. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 The approval of a common transparency register, following a broad majority vote in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, is another step towards greater transparency in parliamentary activity. A common register between the European Parliament and the Commission that is public and accessible online will make it easier for citizens to check the various stakeholders with whom MEPs interact. However, the agreement still needs to be improved as registration by actors is still on a voluntary basis, although a pre-requisite for obtaining access to the institutions. The next objective will therefore be to make registration mandatory for all lobbyists. We also expect that, like the other European institutions, the Council will adhere to the indications of Parliament and the Commission and participate in the register. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

The specification of a European forest protection strategy is part of the EU’s overall commitment to the fight against climate change. Particularly positive points in the report that has been approved are the proposal for a specific regulation on the prohibiting of building on land cleared by fires proven to have resulted from arson, and the request for suitable funding for forestry strategies, which is currently at a very low level. Finally, the request for appropriate sustainability criteria for biomass produced for the use of energy is also important. We therefore urge the European Commission to continue along this route, by presenting a White Paper on forest protection to deal with these issues. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

I voted against the joint resolution because of the rejection by the House of two key amendments presented by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament on the development of medium- to long-term strategies for the progressive phasing-out of nuclear power and the definition of binding renewable energy targets. The vote against the entire resolution by the House highlights the fact that the nuclear issue is no longer just one of greater safety. It is now vital that we begin to think seriously about the energy issue and about investment in renewable energies. Japan’s tragic experience has shown us just how necessary it is to discuss nuclear power in depth. In this sense, the European Parliament’s vote is the first step towards a change of direction in energy policy choices on both a European and an international scale. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that the establishment of a permanent stability mechanism is an important achievement that provides the foundations for the political commitment to defend the euro at all costs. Therefore, despite not inconsiderable reservations about the methods and intergovernmental nature of the fund, Parliament supported this watershed moment and has focused on ensuring a solid link between the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and the EU Institutions. In this vein, the reference in the European Council’s conclusions to a regulation establishing the procedures to define the conditional requirements is important and we now expect the Commission to come up with a suitable proposal. Even though this is a positive result, it is difficult to consider it adequate. The problem is the basic direction of European economic governance. We persist in treating the symptoms of the illness instead of its causes. Deficits are the effect and not the cause of the crisis. Thinking that we can cure the illness by limiting ourselves to cutting deficits with one hand and refinancing banks with the other is sheer make-believe: it risks deepening the crisis and making the very task of the permanent stability mechanism unsustainable. If we want to treat the illness and not merely the symptoms, then we need to tackle a number of basic problems. We talk about strengthening European competitiveness. Rightly so, but which model of competitiveness are we pursuing? We cannot bring in a model for recovery driven solely by exports to third countries, because this will accentuate imbalances. In order to be more competitive in external trade, we also need to stimulate high-quality internal demand. We must therefore deal with the issue of the banks and the system for providing credit to the economy in order to direct European savings toward long-term investments. We need to equip ourselves with instruments such as Eurobonds, the tax on financial transactions and a budget worthy of the name, in order to make large-scale public investment at a European level that can provide a kick-start for private investment. Finally, we need to think of the European social model as a resource instead of a burden. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

A European regulatory framework in the fight against violence against women represents one crucial step forward within a comprehensive strategy. Only a combination of legal, social, economic and preventive actions will manage to resolve this problem which is rather close to home, given that over a quarter of women in the European Union have experienced violence during their lifetime. Violence against women makes no distinction by age or ethnic or cultural background, and it remains an invisible problem that has nonetheless very high human, social and economic costs. The European Union must affirm its active role in fighting discrimination against women and that is why the Svensson report supports the European Commission in its attempts to create a clear and homogenous regulatory framework in the context of the Stockholm Programme. I am therefore in favour of the request for an instrument of criminal law which would define violence against women as a crime in itself, through the development of a directive against gender-based violence, to be brought in line with the multiple training, prevention and awareness-raising initiatives in order to fight all forms of abuse against women.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the report that we are about to vote for, we still have reservations over the decision to adopt a revision of the Treaty on the intergovernmental character of the mechanism, but at the same time we are in favour, because – as Mr Brok explained – the negotiations that we conducted allowed us to achieve important objectives that relate mainly to the fact that the conditionalities associated with the assistance will be determined by a regulation, hence by a codecision procedure. It is therefore fair to vote in favour and I would like to thank the many fellow MEPs who have contributed to this result and mention the privilege of working with Mr Brok, Mr Pirillo’s extremely useful advice and also the work of the two rapporteurs from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON): Mr Scicluna and Mr Gauzès, Mr Schade, Mrs Häfner and the group coordinators and of course the chairmen of the groups that have given us such significant political support, thank you.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it would not be an exaggeration to say that this is an historic time in the process of Europe-building. The economic crisis has made it clear that the single currency needs real European economic governance and, for the first time, significant and innovative steps are being taken in this direction. At the same time, we are seeing a dangerous trend of giving this new governance an intergovernmental flavour, which not only risks threatening the institutional structure of the European Union, but also making the new mechanisms ineffective. Hence, the permanent stability mechanism is an issue of symbolic and central importance. Indeed, on the one hand, the establishment of a permanent stability mechanism represents a decisive and important step forwards. Parliament supports this decision, although it is important to stress that it must not rule out the possibility of using extraordinary solidarity mechanisms, such as those based on Article 122, which are currently in use. On the other hand, if the establishment of a permanent mechanism is therefore positive, the European Council has chosen to create a purely intergovernmental mechanism, thereby denying in a unique manner the European institutions any role, including in the procedure leading up to its establishment. Amongst other things, this could stir up disputes during the ratification process about the appropriateness of a simplified procedure, given that it is hardly in doubt that cutting back the competences of the European Union would require an ordinary revision procedure. Furthermore, since the treaty states two clear things; that the monetary policy of the Member States whose currency is the euro is an exclusive competence of the European Union, and that the Member States must coordinate their economic policy within the framework of the Union, as the treaty states, a mechanism that operates completely outside the European Union’s institutional structure would scarcely be compatible with these principles and would therefore result in a reduction of the European Union’s powers, which would not be compatible with a simplified revision procedure. This problem could also be raised by a number of national parliaments during the ratification procedure which, as we know, will be a complicated and risky process. Likewise for this reason, Parliament would have preferred a different, more institutionally appropriate and less politically risky procedure, such as Article 352, either alone or in combination with Article 136. The report sets all this out in black and white, but we preferred to concentrate on the substance rather than on procedures so as to reach a realistic yet determined approach. The central point is that the permanent stability fund will be created by the Member States because that is what they decided, but it may also lay the foundations for a new structure lying outside the EU institutions or it might be an intergovernmental wagon within a European Union train, travelling down the tracks of European law. Parliament wants to make a contribution because we are following the latter of these two paths. Hence, we asked in our report for two conditions to be respected: the proposal for an amendment must be redrafted so that the establishment of the mechanism’s distribution is somehow placed within an EU procedure, or that the EU institutions are heavily involved in the practical implementation of the mechanism and, above all, in defining the conditionality measures. What principles and rules should be established for providing assistance? Who shall establish them and how? For this, we need a regulation with an ordinary legislative procedure and we are waiting to consult with the European Council and the Member States on these issues. Roberto Gualtieri,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this has been an important debate which I think has clearly shown the existence of broad consensus among the political groups over the assessments and general direction of the report. With a few exceptions, Parliament is truly speaking with one voice and that is important. We are saying yes to the permanent stability mechanism though we cannot hide some confusion and concern which, as we have learnt, is also shared by the Commission, even though we would have liked to read of these concerns in the opinion of the Commission on the procedure selected. We are open to showing practicality and a sense of responsibility in noting that the political conditions do not exist to set up a European mechanism today and, nevertheless, we have shown and continue to show determination in our desire to help insert the mechanism into the Union’s legal and procedural framework, whilst also respecting the Treaties. Our proposals are clear, but now I think the crucial issue is another. Is the European Council willing to start up a real discussion with Parliament on its proposals and is the Commission willing to take an active role in this discussion? I should like to underline that Parliament has taken what I would call a customary decision to postpone the vote to 24 March. I think this is an important sign: this is a responsible Parliament, but I think the Council also needs to show this sense of responsibility by taking Parliament’s proposals into consideration.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday evening, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, by a large majority, adopted Parliament’s opinion on the amendment to the Treaty to introduce a stability mechanism. The text proposes a change to the amendment to the Treaty of Lisbon, setting out a procedure which, while safeguarding the intergovernmental nature of the fund, justifies the inclusion of the rule in the Treaty. It also contains some clear proposals regarding the operation of the mechanism, designed to make it compatible with the duties that the Treaty assigns to the European institutions and with the need to have real economic governance, which simply would not work if it were intergovernmental. To use a metaphor which you, Mr Barroso, used in the last debate, Parliament proposes putting this intergovernmental wagon on the rails in a Union train and giving the Commission its due role in running this train. How does the Commission view Parliament’s proposals? Is it willing to help push them in the negotiations over the coming days? (The President cut off the speaker) Roberto Gualtieri,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we stand at a crossroads for the future of the Europe Union. After the many delays that we are guilty of, it has become obvious to everyone that Europe needs real economic governance, which must be particularly stringent for those countries that have adopted the euro. We therefore welcome the creation of a permanent stability mechanism, which we feel is a key point in the construction of genuine economic governance in Europe, even if we continue to nurture legal and political reservations on the procedure adopted, which we think is risky and does not make full use of the instruments provided for by the Treaty. I am delighted to hear that you also share these reservations. In any case, we are now focusing on a different point: how will the new mechanism actually work? Will it contribute to strengthening the economic governance of the European Union or will it be a step towards a new (and inevitably discretional) ‘intergovernmentalism’, which is the direction that was also taken by the unfortunate wording of the Franco-German competitiveness pact? Basically, in what direction is this train setting off? Who will be driving it? Indeed, on the one hand, the proposed amendment to Article 136 sets out an intergovernmental mechanism that is entirely disconnected from the Union and its institutions, while, on the other, we can read in the opinion of the Commission that the mechanism shall have to rely on economic governance exercised by the Union and that the Commission will take all measures to ensure consistency between the stability mechanism and the aforementioned economic governance. We do appreciate these intentions but, since there is no sign of any of this in the proposal to amend Article 136, we think that this is the time to clearly define how this mechanism will work. What procedure will be adopted to put the mechanism in place? What role will the Commission have in its management and in defining the conditions for its application? What will be the composition of the secretariat? What does the Council think about what Mr Barroso has just said on the validity of the current extraordinary solidarity mechanisms? Will there be a role for the European Parliament? I believe that only a rewording of the amendment to Article 136 or, alternatively, a clear declaration from the European Council on these issues, will enable Parliament to adopt an opinion in line with the desired schedule of the European Council.

Mr Present, ladies and gentlemen, I am a keen supporter of regard for the European Union and the competences assigned to it by the Treaties, which I believe also represent the best way to carry out our role as the direct representatives of the citizens of the European Union. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, ladies and gentlemen, I see two major problems with the proposed amendment to Article 136, one of them institutional and the other political. The institutional one is that Article 3 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that monetary policy for the countries whose currency is the euro is the exclusive competence of the Union, but Article 2 provides that exclusive competence may be exercised by the Member States if authorised by the Union. It is difficult to understand why the application of a rule clearly set out in the Treaty should require reform of the Treaty. Then there is also a political problem: choosing the Treaty reform option, rather than using Article 2 or Articles 352 plus 136, places the European Stability Mechanism, and hence the future of the euro, at the mercy of 27 ratification processes. Do people realise that if just one of these 27 ratification processes proved unsuccessful, it would then be difficult to find a plan B for the euro? Does the European Council realise that choosing this path puts the future of the euro at great risk? Roberto Gualtieri,

 Mr President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, there seems to be positive agreement between Mr Danjean’s remarks and what you said in your speech, Baroness Ashton, regarding the analysis of the situation, which is that the situation in the Sahel is critical. We are talking about one of the poorest regions in the world, bordering on some of the countries that have been shaken over the last week by more dangerous instability than ever. It is also a region where terrorist infiltration and drug trafficking are intertwined to a truly worrying extent. All that makes the situation unsustainable and a real threat to Europe. We therefore need to see a qualitative leap in Europe’s initiative. The 2009 initiative for security and development in the Sahel has so far proved ineffective. What is needed is the new strategy for security in the Sahel that the Council of Foreign Ministers have called to adopt, which we are awaiting. I believe there are two important points that have been highlighted: firstly, a regional approach; and secondly, an integrated approach that enables us to make the best possible use of the various instruments available to the EU in a concrete, operational and coordinated way. We must realise, however, that the path for a possible mission must be assessed very carefully, because Common Security and Defence Policy missions are one of the instruments we have available, but they are no replacement for a political strategy. Our group therefore fully endorses Europe’s new, renewed commitment in the Sahel and we are anxious to see the new strategy, discuss it in detail and support its implementation. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D
).

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, procedure is the stuff of democracy and therefore the implementation of the citizens’ initiative was not merely a technical exercise but imposed crucial choices that made it possible to turn the citizens’ initiative into an instrument effectively capable of helping to build a genuine European political space. Parliament undoubtedly exercised its prerogatives in an exemplary manner, significantly improving the original proposal. The main results have already mentioned and I do not need to remind you of them. I would, however, like to emphasise another one, to which our group made a significant contribution: European political parties will also be able to promote a citizens’ initiative. This is an outcome of great significance because the fate of European democracy lies at its heart, since there can be no genuine international democracy until European political parties take on an effective role in the democratic process. Today we are taking a step forward in this direction and this is another reason why it is a great day for European democracy. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the new strategic concept developed by NATO contains important, positive changes to meet the challenges of the 21st century in a manner consistent with the values of the Atlantic Pact. In particular, we welcome the revival of the strategic partnership with Russia, the explicit formulation of the goal of a world without nuclear weapons, the recognition of the importance of a stronger European defence, the reaffirmation of the principle of collective defence and, at the same time, the statements that NATO does not consider any country to be its adversary. There are still, however, problems and contradictions that this far from new concept does nothing to dispel. Firstly, there is no clear and unambiguous commitment to the elimination of tactical nuclear weapons, which are still deployed in Europe even though they are strategically anachronistic and economically increasingly unsustainable. Secondly, the European Union's role in the strategic concept is still insufficient and the planned civilian crisis management capabilities are at risk of pointlessly duplicating those of the European Union. We are aware of the political problems that hinder more effective EU-NATO cooperation, but this cannot get in the way of developing an operational perspective, complementarity and synergies that are a match for our ambitions. Helicopters, medical support and explosives represent significant progress but are not enough: we need vision and an active commitment and we call on you, Baroness Ashton, to deploy them both with strength and clarity. Roberto Gualtieri,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament approves the establishment of a new section of the budget for the European External Action Service (EEAS) and the provision of additional funds for staff. This position is due to Parliament’s desire to see the EEAS set up, because Europe urgently needs it, but, of course, it does not mean that it will give up its role as budgetary authority in the debate on the nature of the body that will deal with crisis management or on the priorities of staff policy, as shown by the reserve that we established in the 2011 budget. The regulations that we are going to adopt reinforce the outcomes of the Madrid agreement and, in some cases, go further, for which I would like to thank Mr Rapkay, Mrs Gräßle and Mr Rivellini. I must also thank Baroness Ashton and Mr Christophersen for their willingness and openness in our discussions. The Staff Regulations ensure that all EEAS staff will have the same rights and duties irrespective of their origin, and requires the High Representative to ensure a geographical and gender balance. These arrangements will be binding and Parliament will make sure that they are complied with. At the same time, they avoid the use of quotas, which would be not just difficult to implement but also wrong. The Financial Regulation ensures a solid control system and keeps the EEAS closely tied to the Commission. I welcome the success we have achieved with the setting up of specific budget lines for the main common security and defence policy missions, which represents a major leap forward for Parliament’s ability to exercise control over the common foreign and security policy. With tomorrow’s vote, therefore, we will have an EEAS that is stronger, more communautaire
 and subject to greater Parliamentary scrutiny. We will be strict and demanding in performing this scrutiny but, at the same time, we will do it responsibly and in a constructive spirit, since we are determined to help the High Representative in the colossal task of providing Europe with a real foreign policy to serve its values and interests. Roberto Gualtieri,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think the genuine satisfaction that has emerged in this debate shows that Members were aware of just how difficult yet important the task facing us was. How to unify functions associated with different policies and subject to different decision-making procedures in order to make the European Union’s external actions more consistent, without endangering the communautaire
 nature of certain policies, but embracing the contributions of bodies operating in the field of the common security and defence policy, was not merely a problem of European law or administration science or a test of the power relations between institutions. Instead, it was a necessary condition if we were to endow the High Representative with an instrument that could enhance Europe’s potential on the world stage, strengthen its role as a civilised power, and allow us to act more effectively in the Middle East, the Horn of Africa, the Caucasus or the Balkans. Well, I think we have risen to the challenge marvellously, and so our satisfaction is fully justified. The High Representative will, I believe, enjoy Parliament’s exacting support as she performs her duties. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is very important to make a success of this budget procedure, not just because it is the first budget under the Treaty of Lisbon, with a new procedure and new functions for the European Union, but especially because it comes at a crucial time for the future of Europe, affected as it has been by a severe crisis. Faced with the crisis, many governments think of an economic governance model based entirely on stability mechanisms, which means cutting their national budgets and perhaps also the European budget. We, on the other hand, think that a stronger European budget, supported by own resources and also a financial transaction tax, is a precondition for effective European economic governance and for greater discipline in national budgets. We must therefore decide which way to go, and to that end, the amendments that the President-in-Office of the Council has considered inappropriate are, in fact, extremely important. However, the greatest disagreements concern the figures, of course. In this respect, I would urge the Council to make up its mind, because it cannot want to keep strictly to the margins and, at the same time, expect Parliament not to bring its own priorities into play. The Treaty of Lisbon is quite clear on this: the Council is paramount as regards the quantity of spending, whereas Parliament has the last word on the quality of spending. Thinking about heading 4, we are not against increasing funding for the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) or for the Industrialised Countries Instrument (ICI+), but we do not want it to be at the expense of our priorities: first Palestine and then development cooperation. The Council therefore has three options to choose from: it can accept Parliament’s priorities, or it can agree to a revision of the margins, or it can accept greater flexibility of the budget and in the budget, in the knowledge that Parliament will stand united in defence of its prerogatives and priorities. Roberto Gualtieri,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the strengthening of the industrial and technological basis of European defence is an essential part of developing a common defence system. What it needs, however, are common rules and a coordinated approach in order to enhance the development and competitiveness of the European defence industry and, at the same time, to ensure that this development is in line with Europe’s principles and international commitments. To that end, together with the directive on the internal market in defence, the December 2008 common position defining procedures and criteria for military exports to third countries was an important step forward. As we know, these procedures do not include a general consultation mechanism. However, the common position does include a timely reference to the need to enhance cooperation and convergence in this field within the framework of the common foreign and security policy. Until the hoped-for progress on this front, and until such time as the creation of a common defence system makes it possible to adopt even more binding mechanisms, the cooperation and convergence referred to in Article 7 should not remain just on paper and the annual report on military exports should be made available to Parliament. Naturally, the question tabled by the Members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) seems implicitly – although it has now been made explicit – not to confine itself to matters of a general nature. Given that it would have been better to refer to things by their names right from the start, it does not seem that the sale of French ships to Russia contravenes the 2008 common position. On the contrary, such exports could strengthen European-Russian ties and cooperation in the security field and make them more binding. These ties, however, should be removed from the bilateral sphere and be entirely addressed, discussed and managed at a European level. Roberto Gualtieri,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets.

 Mr President, Mrs Ashton, Mr Šefčovič, ladies and gentlemen, clearly, the report on which we are preparing to vote is not a simple opinion, but the result of intense negotiating efforts, for which I would like to thank the High Representative and the Spanish Presidency. These are negotiations in which Parliament played a prominent role in significantly improving the text of the decision that the Council will have to adopt. The compromise reached in Madrid is fully in line with the objectives that guided this highly coordinated work carried out by Mr Brok and Mr Verhofstadt: to provide Europe with a service that has resources and powers sufficient to increase the consistency and effectiveness of the EU’s external action, but which is, at the same time, closely linked to the Community method and the Commission, and subject to the full democratic control of the European Parliament. I, too, would like to say to those who have mentioned so-called red lines that the European Parliament must not cross, that it is precisely because Parliament has been able to exercise its prerogatives fully and dynamically, and even cross some of the red lines outlined by governments, that Europe will have a more effective, more democratic and more European service. I am talking about a service, for instance, that is able to reconcile development cooperation policies with the rest of the EU’s external action, without undermining either the necessary independence of those policies or the Commission’s responsibility. Parliament shall continue to make strong and determined use of its legislative and budget prerogatives, especially over the coming months, in order to define the Staff Regulations and the Financial Regulation in accordance with the basic outline of this report. It will also carefully supervise the actual development of the service and ensure that the letter and spirit of the Madrid Agreement are fully respected, beginning with the proper participation of European officials at the helm of the service and in the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) budget reform. It will also make use of these prerogatives to provide the High Representative of the service’s officials with its full support as the European Parliament, an institution which cares more than any other about the development of a true European foreign policy and about its gradual communitisation, in which the Madrid Agreement is an important stage.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Madam High Representative/Vice-President, I would like to emphasise the fact that we are discussing three excellent documents drawn up by Parliament: ambitious documents that express clear stances, make clear-cut choices and are subject to broad consensus between the groups within this Parliament who care about Europe and its future. It is an important fact, demonstrating Parliament’s will and ability to offer itself as a candidate to play a central role in CFSP/CSDP on the basis of what I would call a dynamic reading of the Treaty of Lisbon. We intend to exercise this role in the process of constructing the External Action Service, not only to guarantee Parliament’s prerogatives, but also to contribute to making the service an organisation capable of ensuring that EU external action is consistent and efficient while, at the same time, strengthening and gradually extending the community method. As regards the Danjean report, I would like to highlight that the concept of strategic autonomy is presented in the context of a multilateral approach, and that it is a condition for strengthening the strategic partnership with the United States. I would also like to highlight the fact that Parliament is united in requesting an Operations Centre, and I am glad that you, High Representative, have declared yourself open to a more exhaustive discussion of this idea. Concerning the non-proliferation resolution, I would like to underline the importance of envisaging a world free from nuclear weapons, the clear judgment on the anachronism of tactical nuclear weapons and the value of the positions recently adopted by some European governments on this front. Thus, Parliament’s message is clear, realistic and ambitious, and we hope that the High Representative is able to grasp and endorse it. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the unprecedented humanitarian disaster in Haiti affects us deeply and the European Union has a duty to contribute as best it can to the efforts by the international community, using all the tools at its disposal. As far as financial resources are concerned, significant progress has been made in recent days and hours. What deserves more thought is the other aspects of Europe’s response to the crisis, but we should avoid worrying about our image and concentrate instead on the substance, as the High Representative rightly said. The central role of the MINUSTAH mission has now emerged clearly, in terms of both civil protection and security, ruling out an autonomous CSDP mission, but the EU’s coordination role in support of the UN mission remains key. On this point, I would like to remind Mr Juvin that this coordination exists, and that the Monitoring and Information Centre is performing it in the area of civil protection, and the Situation Centre is performing it in the area of security, and it is to be hoped that this work will result in deployment of the European Gendarmerie Force, as has been expressly requested by the United Nations. What it is useful to understand from the High Representative and from the Commission is how the MIC and the Situation Centre are responding, in practice, in the face of such onerous tasks and tests, how their coordination is working, and whether their instruments and resources are adequate. This will also help us at a later date when we will have to consider the adequacy of these instruments and the capacity of consular protection, but now is not the time for these debates. Now is the time for action and commitment, and we fully support the action being taken by the High Representative. Roberto Gualtieri,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the developments in the situation in Iran, one cannot help but express serious concern. These concerns relate to the increasing infringements of political and civil rights, which we strongly condemn, and concern over the failure to perform the duties resulting from Iran’s membership of the Non-Proliferation Agreement, upon which even the country itself states it does not want to cast any doubt. We do not question Iran’s right to the peaceful development of nuclear energy, nor do we intend to underestimate the important role that Iran can play on a regional level, its legitimate security requirements, or the need to create a credible system of regional security that involves all the nuclear powers in the area. It is precisely because of this, though, that we do not understand the reasons for the failure to comply with the request by the International Atomic Energy Agency for the uranium to be enriched abroad, and we regret this decision. Faced with this situation, it falls to the Security Council to determine the international community’s response and the possibility of new sanctions, which should be focused on non-proliferation and designed to be an instrument to support the path of difficult but unavoidable dialogue, and not designed and used to beat down the regime. With regard to this course of action, the European Union should play its part by giving thought, at the appropriate time and in the appropriate form, to possible technical measures to complement the UN sanctions and, at the same time, by confirming its readiness for debate and dialogue, which should never be lost, even at difficult times. We will fully support action by the European Union and the High Representative in line with the approach that was set out clearly in the High Representative’s speech. Rosario Crocetta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that today is a great result for Parliament, because when I wrote to President Buzek on 15 July saying that ‘we need to set up an anti-mafia committee’, I remember many Members from different countries saying, ‘But the mafia is only a problem in Sicily and in Italy’. Today, recognition by our fellow Members from the north and from the whole of Europe that there is a problem of ‘organised crime in Europe’, and the desire to fight it together is, I believe, a momentous fact, and I would like to thank you, Mr President, and Parliament as a whole.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if Arab dictators shoot at the crowd the West immediately responds, with no-fly zones, UN intervention, and so on. If, on the other hand, the Israeli air force bombs Gaza there is silence, because it is natural for Israel to bomb the Palestinian people. Yet the lack of a solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict is the main cause of conflict between the Arab world and the West, and it provides strength to extremists. Today the Arab revolutions have brought a fresh wave of democracy to North Africa and the Middle East. This cannot fail to have an effect on the relationship between Palestinians and Israelis, too. The very existence of Israel is in some way linked to an understanding of this cause. Either Israel accepts the existence of a Palestinian state, or Israel will no longer be able to live in the same conditions in that region. Within this framework, I believe that it would be very hypocritical for Europe not to give the Palestinians the same support that it is giving to those who are today fighting for freedom and rights in the Arab world and elsewhere. This is because I believe that the right of people to have their own land, to govern themselves, and to have their own state is an inalienable right, and I believe that Europe should support the Palestinian resolution at the UN.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Commissioner Malmström for having forcefully raised the issue of an anti-corruption package, however I must be honest. Those who, like me, live in a Mafia-controlled area and have also paid and continue to pay a terrible price for it, are not amongst those who are convinced that a magical law is all it takes to finally put a stop to corruption. This seems to be the main problem and cause of the state of emergency we currently find ourselves in. Corruption is an ancient art, much older than the world itself, and has probably now become part and parcel of the way in which politics is done, not only in Italy, but in many other countries too. I strongly support what the Commissioner said: we must ensure that we fully emphasise the importance of this policy. When considering how to combat corruption, we must start by asking ourselves how public procurement procedures are conducted; what the threshold is for cases in which a degree of discretion is allowed; whether or not a monitoring network exists to monitor, for example, whoever wins a contract; how people have accumulated their wealth; whether or not there are any rules for tracing money; and how we check whether politicians who have been found guilty have actually been sentenced and imprisoned, or ascertain whether they are still members of parliament, protected by their parties and the laws of their country. We should start a revolution, so to speak; I personally would make the fight against corruption, the Mafia and organised crime the focus of this second half of the parliamentary term, in order to tell the Spanish ‘Indignados
’ that we want a better Europe, a freer Europe, a more transparent Europe, and to tell the young people participating in the Arab Spring that we too want to change the world, and that we want to enact serious change. So, congratulations, Commissioner, but let us do more. Rosario Crocetta,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Beijing’s justification for the arrest of the artist Ai Weiwei for economic crimes is not convincing, and neither is the need to treat a free, dissident artist so harshly. It is not convincing since this arrest is one of hundreds of arrests of opponents and part of the systematic repression of all signs of dissent. At a time when uprisings are breaking out in the Arab world, we think back to the images of cruel violence in Tiananmen Square against young Chinese who, just like today’s Jasmine revolutionaries, were demanding freedom and democracy. China has opened up to the West in economic terms without, however, linking production to respect for the environment and safety at work, and it is unable to embrace democracy and pluralism in any form whatsoever. This is not interference on our part in Chinese internal affairs, as Beijing maintains, but the appeal of men and women, of movements and parties that intend to build a world free of intolerance on every continent. The Beijing government should watch what is happening in the world to grasp that, if it does not change, it will be historic events and Chinese citizens that will change China.

Then, it was considered one of the most democratic countries of the Gulf and has been considered so even in recent years. So one must say, imagine what happens in other countries given that Saudi Arabia performs a few hundred executions a year, given that terrible massacres take place in Iran, given that throughout the Gulf, killings are commonplace and there is complete denial of the rights of the press. Today, we approved the resolution on Syria, Yemen and Bahrain, but when we will prepare a resolution for Saudi Arabia, for Algeria, for China and for the other countries which violate human rights in the world?

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is sad to note that sometimes, the West can find great solidarity when it comes to bombing, sending companies into third world countries and taking oil, but finds it more of a struggle to make solidarity and migration policies. This evening’s debate touches on these themes. I went to Lampedusa on Monday and saw 4 000 - 5 000 people on the ground, huddling together to sleep under the sun and the rain, doing their business where they ate and not being able to change the wet clothes – which some have said were designer labels, but are, in fact, fake designer labels – they had on during the crossing, in lamentable conditions. Among these were 4 500 children, 12-13 year-old kids, living under the same conditions, conditions of discomfort shared also by the inhabitants of Lampedusa. Tunisia is now home to 150 000 migrants who come from Libya and shows its solidarity. It is a poor country showing solidarity, while wealthy Europe is unable to accommodate 5 000 migrants. Europe should instead show its solidarity to these wonderful kids who have sparked the Jasmine Revolution originating in Sidi Bouzid that is changing North Africa and the world.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Egypt: from the virtual community on Facebook to the real one, with millions of people seeking fairer distribution of wealth and greater justice, and protesting against corruption. We must move on from the transition period of soldiers and tanks to a true democracy: a new constitution, new elections, abolition of the death penalty, more humane prisons, social rights and freedom. It will be difficult. Those who are willing to deploy any means in the name of an idea are lying in wait. We want to believe in the great Egyptian people, who have not, however, ever experienced democracy. We want a secular democracy, with a distinct separation between religious authority and political power, a democracy that integrates minorities and establishes true rights: to public healthcare, social security and work. Europe is supporting this approach by investing resources with the ability to promote real development in Egypt: no more dictatorships, no more misery, no more poverty. Rosario Crocetta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commissioner for having devoted her attention to the issue of Tunisia. To be sincere, I would have liked this debate to be given a different title, namely ‘Debate in support of Tunisia and other countries fighting against dictatorships and for human rights’. Instead, we are making a humanitarian crisis out of the fact that one of the greatest world powers, Italy, is having to tackle the problem of taking in 5 000 people. Of course, for Lampedusa, these refugees are a problem, even though a daily ferry links the island to Sicily and there is also an airport through which these people can be taken away. We have to realise that what is being discussed at the moment is not the problem of Frontex or how to stop the boats, but the fact that we are dealing with peoples whom we have urged to fight for democracy and, now that they are doing so, we must be in a position to receive them. Granting more visas is one policy that Italy can pursue to try to help those countries. Rosario Crocetta  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is time that Europe made efforts to give the Tunisian people and their transitional government concrete support and to re-launch a Euro-Mediterranean dialogue that has been badly neglected in recent years. The explosion of anger among the young people and the poor in the Maghreb and Egypt has been caused by the inequitable distribution of wealth and restrictions on people exercising their fundamental freedoms. North Africa is fired up and is demanding more democracy, better economies, more participation and more employment, while looking in disbelief at the old continent of Europe, which is immobile and unable to grasp the social transformation that has taken place in the region or to develop genuine policies for progress and peace. Europe needs to be pay closer attention to human rights and democracy and must promote more dialogue, more collaboration and more genuine economic assistance. Europe must open its doors and its heart to North Africa, so that the Mediterranean can become a sea of peace. There must be no more rejection of migrants through violent collaboration with countries like Libya. What we need is more investment, more openness, more aid and more of a Euro-Mediterranean policy. History demands it of us. Rosario Crocetta,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by asking for the immediate release of Nasrin Sotoudeh, we are urging the Union and its Member States to do more to liberate Iranian citizens and the world from one of the cruellest and most authoritarian regimes in history. The Islamic Republic of Iran is characterised not only by the threat it poses to world peace with a nuclear project capable of evoking the terror of nuclear war, but also by the illegitimacy of its elections; mass arrests of people requesting free elections; the killing of objectors; the rape and physical abuse of those who do not support the regime; the iniquity of judicial processes, where decisions can be predicted as soon as the accusations have been made; serious discrimination against women and homosexuals; and the absence of freedom of expression and of association. The conditions of Iranian prisoners in Camp Ashraf, where they are subjected to violence and even stoning, are absolutely incredible. Every day, at least two people, including children, are sentenced to death in Iran, and they are guilty of nothing more than of not pleasing the regime. Legal evidence is often created through the cruel and skilful use of brutal methods of torture. These criticisms are certainly not aimed at Islam, which is based on peace, but at the Iranian regime. The arrest and conviction of Nasrin Sotoudeh bring to light a new level of judicial deceit, since in this case, the attack and conviction are against a defender of the people, which means that citizens of Iran cannot even defend themselves.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the purpose of my speech is to point out the severity of the deindustrialisation process affecting a range of Sicilian industrial centres, in particular, the Termini Imerese automotive centre owned by the FIAT group, and the Gela petrochemical centre belonging to the ENI group. Termini Imerese is being damaged by the competition arising from the low salary system within some EU countries, whilst Gela is being damaged by competition from Asia. With regard to the severe deindustrialisation processes that are taking place in widespread areas of the Union, I would argue that the time has come to reconsider the policy of non-intervention that the European Commission has adopted up until now, and to begin to launch a set of important, strategic measures to support European industry. This call is addressed chiefly to the European Commission and to Mr Tajani, the Commissioner for Industry and Entrepreneurship. Rosario Crocetta  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as someone who has visited Tunisia two to three times per year since 1982 and who, as a Catholic, on 6 January attended mass, as I regularly do, I find it truly difficult to think of Tunisia as a country which suppresses religious freedom. There are problems, but for Heaven’s sake let us not to look at these countries, countries which are trying to make progress, through the prism of Western countries, because if we were to use that parameter, a parameter which someone is using this morning with regard to Tunisia, then certain European countries would probably be denied entry into the European Union, because the violence and denial of freedom which exists there is on a greater scale than in Tunisia. Thus, the issue arises as a result of one concrete fact: namely, that we have before us a country which has abolished Islamic fundamentalism, which is making efforts to develop a cooperation and peace policy with Europe, which is trying to evolve. There are problems. I believe that the way to solve these problems is to strengthen dialogue and friendship and to help these countries to achieve more. Rosario Crocetta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we were in Ramallah when we heard the news that Europe had adopted a new decision on the Middle East peace process. We saw the hopeful smiles on the faces of the Palestinian representatives. They were days filled with emotion and suffering, etched on the faces of the children gripping the window bars of their homes on the Hebron road, the deserted road that no Palestinian is allowed to cross. We saw the suffering of an 85-year-old woman, driven out of her occupied home, forced to sleep in the cold in a tent set up in the garden of what used to be her own house, and the suffering on the faces of the Palestinians who had built a farm using European funds, subsequently destroyed by Israeli soldiers. Israel has the right to be an independent state, but the Palestinians also have the right to a homeland, a state and a passport. The decision of the Council of Europe represents a considerable step forward, but we need to act immediately. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is just the tip of the iceberg in a larger conflict. On the final day of our visit, the Israeli authorities prevented us, the European Parliament delegation, from visiting the Gaza Strip. I believe that in this regard, the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, should step in to protest on behalf of democratic Europe. I should like to thank Mr De Rossa who led the delegation and all the other members of the delegation, because during the days we spent in Palestine, the vulnerable were able to see and hear the face and the words of a Europe which upholds rights and wishes to, and must, do more.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, concerning the request from the Council that we approve the proposal for exchanges of information between Europol and partners, including third countries, one can see what this would lead to: the proposal, if approved, would create the absurd situation of regulating, among other things, the exchange of information between Europol and third countries without Parliament having yet approved any such list of countries. This proposal, in its depiction of the handling of personal data, seems to pave the way for the creation of a truly limitless database which could even be made available to third parties that have not yet been specified by Parliament. Article 15(2) of the Council’s proposal states that in cases of absolute necessity, even where there is no suggestion that a crime has been carried out, data may be transmitted that reveal a person’s race, ethnic origin, political stance, religious and philosophical convictions, trade union membership and so on, without it being specified what is meant by ‘absolute necessity’ and, worse still, by endorsing the idea that there is such a thing as racial groups. It would be interesting to hear the Council clarify what a racial group is and which racial groups exist. As far as I am concerned, I believe that there is only one race – the human race. For these reasons, but also to maintain the independence of Parliament, which must work within the necessary time limits, I believe that the Council’s proposal in its present form must be rejected by the requested deadline of 30 November.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank you for asking the Belgian and French authorities to provide me with police protection. To feel the solidarity of the institutions when you are on the frontline fighting a phenomenon such as the mafia in Italy, which has resulted in many victims over many years, is really important in my view, and I offer my heartfelt thanks. However, for some time, Mr President, mafia organisations have been a global phenomenon: not just through money laundering, but also through their permanent presence in various European countries, and also via immigration. When, on 16 July this year, I called for the establishment of a committee of inquiry into mafia organisations in Europe, I did so with the aim not only of serving my country, but also the European Community, in the belief that a lack of vigilance when it comes to organised crime associations such as the mafia could have a negative impact on citizens’ quality of life and safety and on development mechanisms. And it is strange, I have finished, Mr President ... (The President cut off the speaker) Salvatore Caronna  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted for this report and I would like to congratulate Mr Alfonsi once again, because I believe macro-regional strategies can be a tool for creating added value for the whole of Europe. That is why it is important to continue along this path, though subject to certain specific conditions. Macro-regional strategies have to be developed around a well-defined geographical area with specific, uniform characteristics. In addition, strategies must be functional and stakeholders must be willing to push forward the integration process. Essentially, the regional approach should guide local communities towards integration at a higher level in order to address and overcome challenges that they would be unable to tackle otherwise, if they did not cooperate. With regard to the Mediterranean area, I think it is important that the report envisages one strategy for the western Mediterranean and another for the eastern basins, in other words, the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. In particular, it is significant that there is already a very high degree of coordination in the Adriatic and Ionian region. I therefore believe the Commission and the Council should follow up this important report. Salvatore Caronna  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the role of the cooperative movement has always been important for creating a more balanced and just economy. Currently, while we are going through one of the most serious economic and social crises since the war, the function of cooperative societies has become crucial. It is quite clear that where there has been substantial development of the cooperative dimension in the economy, the result has been an increase in employment, more skilled labour and more equitable redistribution of the wealth generated. Therefore, it is good that the European Union has adopted a statute for cooperative societies, but now more than ever, there needs to be a real simplification of the rules. We need to give new incentives for the creation of a common European framework on cooperatives and this must occur by giving assistance and not creating bureaucratic obstacles. This is why I voted in favour of this resolution and I hope that the Commission and the Council will take action to resolve the problems mentioned. Salvatore Caronna  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the creation of a European Higher Education Area is a major goal that the European Union has set for itself. However, despite the progress made with the Bologna Declaration – which, as noted, dates back to 1999 – we have got to recognise the fact that in terms of student mobility and the harmonisation of degrees across the various countries, the results have been far from satisfactory. That is why I voted in favour of this report. We need to move forward with greater speed on this issue and reverse the trend – especially in some countries – of cutting investment in education. Accordingly, the harmonisation put forward under the Bologna Declaration is still essential in order to improve the entire European education system and make the labour market more dynamic. I, too, would like to applaud Mr Berlinguer for his excellent work. Salvatore Caronna  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Parliament’s vote relating to the scheme for distribution of food products to deprived persons for the next two years was, above all, a mandatory step, bearing in mind also the fact that a few weeks ago, we approved a report against food waste that had amongst its targets the fundamental objective of helping the most needy sections of the population. It is unthinkable that at a time of economic crisis and social suffering like the present, we should not be responding, albeit partially, in such a way. In such a perspective, it is to be hoped that we will find a definitive solution for the entire 2014-2020 period. As we are seeing at the moment in the squares of Athens, the image of a European Union capable only of imposing cuts and sacrifices is a devastating one. We need to offer an alternative Europe capable of solidarity and of taking care of those in difficulty, and we need to do it soon. Salvatore Caronna

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first, I would like to thank the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their cooperation during the drafting of this report. This fruitful collaboration meant that we were able, swiftly and almost unanimously, to approve a text on an issue, that of the waste of food, which has, for too long, been underestimated by the institutions and by policy. We can no longer permit ourselves to underestimate it. All the most authoritative specialist sources now say that one of the main problems in the immediate future will be to tackle the new and extremely high demand for food and that therefore, the issue of food security has become one of the most difficult problems to tackle because, in the future, the demand for food will tend to exceed supply. If this is true, we can no longer allow ourselves to remain passive in the face of food waste. When we talk of food, we are talking of food that is still perfectly edible, and so this issue has become a large-scale problem which is no longer sustainable. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) estimates that a third of food produced every year in the world that is intended for human consumption is wasted, and in Europe, the figure is already 50%, with every citizen on average wasting 105 kilograms per year. We have reached such a level, in fact, that we have to say that we are faced not only with an ethical problem, but with a real economic and social issue, with enormous implications for the environment. That is why, through this report, we want combating food waste to become a priority on the European Union’s policy agenda. We are therefore asking for the Commission to lead the 27 Member States in adopting a common strategy that can foster a real step change to reduce food waste significantly by 2025. We therefore ask that all the associations, volunteer groups and initiative-taking centres that have produced specific projects in this area in various countries should be turned to good account. These experiences have generated a virtuous system which has guaranteed significant recovery of products to be sent to those sections of the population that are experiencing financial difficulties. I would like to remind you that in Europe, wealthy Europe, nearly 70 million citizens live under the poverty threshold and suffer from malnutrition. We are therefore asking for precise directives from the Commission. Specifically, it would be important to amend the regulations on public procurement for catering services in canteens and hospitals so that, when they are being considered, priority is given, other terms being equal, to those enterprises that have a management model established on combating food waste. On this aspect, I would like to point out that the important fact is that the first to set an example should be the European institutions, starting with this Parliament. Finally, we are calling for all stakeholders in the agri-food industry to take responsibility. A real awareness-raising campaign needs to be conducted, targeted firstly at the large farmers’ organisations, the world of industry, schools and universities, which can produce a civil and scientific culture oriented towards a more restrained and environmentally sustainable model of consumption. With this report, the European Parliament has done its part. Now we hope that the Commission will address this work by putting an effective strategy in train. Above all, we hope that swift action will be taken to declare 2014 the European Year against Food Waste; this would be a tangible sign of the institution’s true, strong and immediate commitment in this area. This would give an immediate signal to all citizens that the European Union is able to be at the forefront in establishing a fairer and balanced development model. Salvatore Caronna  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are currently living through a period that is decisive for the future of the euro and with it of the whole European project. Being aware of this would mean abandoning a short-sighted logic that subordinates everything to an ideological balance of payments straitjacket. We all want various countries’ books to be in order. We all want to reduce debt. Nevertheless, it is clear that without a sensible policy of investment capable of breathing life into the economy, there will be no possibility of growth. The one clear outcome of this approach is that the greatest price will, as usual, be paid by the least well-off. That is why we in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have voted against this report. In fact, it continues down a one-way street that is one of austerity without growth, a direction that has so far proved to be the wrong one. Salvatore Caronna  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very appreciative of the work done by Ms Ferreira in this report. In fact, this was the only one of the package’s six legislative proposals devoted to economic governance for which my group and I voted. We did so because it includes, among other things, a clause on the protection of social rights, starting with collective bargaining, and because it also strengthens Parliament’s role in the adoption of delegated acts. Therefore, although we cannot change the overall balance of the six-pack, with this report we are definitely making progress towards, among other things, a surveillance system that takes account of fundamental rights. In this context, then, although a vision based solely on a policy of austerity does not, in our view, produce positive results, this positive report certainly bucks that trend.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I had no hesitation in voting in favour of the report by Ms Zimmer, above all, for one purely political reason: I think we need to bring this major issue of food security right back to the core of all European Union initiatives. It is not only a matter of helping developing countries to tackle this issue more effectively. Rather, since the demand for agricultural products is set to increase by more than 70% between now and 2050, the food crisis is a key issue that must be dealt with quickly and decisively. Otherwise, it may become one of the main threats – if not the main threat - to stability, peace and, as we have seen, even democracy. I think it is therefore incumbent upon the European Union and the Member States to take the required steps to properly tackle this important issue, beginning with adequate investment, as the report proposes. Salvatore Caronna,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that the challenge of the coming years is to ensure that Europe, as has been said, maintains its position as the world’s number one tourist destination and, at the same time, is able to enhance its entire territorial heritage, both in terms of environmental protection and competitiveness. The challenge is a difficult one and not to be taken lightly, having regard not only to the opportunities but also to the aggressiveness of other countries in this sector, of other continents from China to India and Brazil. Against this backdrop, as Commissioner Tajani mentioned, and as noted also in the opinion that we approved on the Committee on Regional Development, having a strong, general, EU-wide strategy on tourism with an enhanced role for the regions and territories becomes fundamental. Accordingly, in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity, it is essential that regions and local authorities are fully involved from the outset. Moreover, I believe that the development of integrated tourist networks and projects should be encouraged through the creation of partnerships for the exchange of best practice. I think that the proposal to identify a ‘Europe brand’ that is capable of defining a high quality of tourist product is also good. Obviously, it will be up to the Commission to define better the priorities, above all from a financial point of view, to guarantee that Europe retains its number one position in future.

Mr President, I voted in favour of the report by Mr Garriga Polledo on the forthcoming financial perspectives of the Union because, at one of the greatest times of crisis for the so-called European spirit, I am convinced that it is vital for us to insist upon and prevail in our belief that it is essential to provide the Union with credible instruments, beginning with adequate funding. The request for a 5% increase in the next budget is therefore just and necessary. Perhaps it will not be enough, but it is essential in order to provide answers to the big questions that lie ahead: these resources are needed to tackle real problems, such as greater cohesion between the regions, a greater capacity for research and innovation, and a greater capacity to generate growth and provide jobs. Without adequate resources, none of these problems will be properly dealt with, beginning with the introduction of the intermediate category in cohesion policy, which only makes sense if it does not harm the other categories already in place. That is why I voted in favour and I hope that the Commission and the Council will follow the recommendations of the report. Salvatore Caronna  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the adoption of the report by Mrs Podimata represents a significant step forward for a more balanced, more progressive and stronger economic and fiscal policy in Europe. It is now clear to everyone that Europe, as the coordinating authority of the 27 countries, urgently needs to equip itself with economic and financial instruments that are capable of controlling the economy and not just submitting to it. For this reason, the proposed taxation of financial transactions has caused quite a stir and generated a large amount of attention and discussion. The fact that the majority of this Parliament has voted for this regulation is important and significant because, for the first time, things were not just left to ride and instead, we have achieved a step forward. I do hope that the Commission and the Council will continue on this path. Salvatore Caronna  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Open Days have been taking place here in Brussels over the last few days. Many municipal and regional representatives have been talking about how to address the serious problems our cities are facing and about the old and new needs affecting workers, families, and small and large production companies alike. The economic crisis that has hit our societies has made it harder and more difficult for all of us to find suitable solutions to a new and serious social issue. In this context, I believe everyone has come to understand that, time and again, cohesion policy has been the only real instrument the regions have had available to them for trying to provide solutions. We can therefore say that over the last few years, cohesion policy has provided a vital fillip to the European integration process for all of the regions. Now we are having to redefine this policy for the period after 2013, and we are therefore at a turning point. That is why it is vitally important to avoid certain risks. The first fundamental risk would be to renationalise it: that would be a serious step backwards. Next, when preparing the financing budget, we must lay down appropriate requirements with regard to the weaker areas without penalising the more competitive and more advanced regions. Lastly, it is essential to simplify the procedures for those who have demonstrated efficiency and to make more legally binding the power to penalise those who have not. We expect the Commission to take action along these lines. Silvia Costa,

 Madam President, I want to remind you that today is the 23rd anniversary of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and I believe the digital world is a new frontier for promoting and protecting the rights of babies and children. I wholeheartedly thank the shadow rapporteurs from the Committee on Culture and Education and the rapporteur from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for the excellent job they have done too and I hope that today we will really send an important signal to everyone awaiting Parliament’s vote. Silvia Costa,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, 23 years after the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the internet is becoming the new frontier at which the rights of minors have to be protected and promoted, given the growing penetration of the internet among children and adolescents in Europe – a kind of symbiotic relationship which helps to form their personalities and the way in which they relate to the outside world. A few years ago, the average age at which children had their first access to the internet was around 9 years old, but today, the first steps on the web, for those born in the digital age, are being taken even before they learn to read or write. Young people under 16 use computers for study, play, watching video clips, downloading videos and music, file sharing, and for visiting chat rooms, blogs and virtual worlds. However, the majority of children between the ages of 9 and 16 have their profile registered on a social network, many using a fictitious identity, and a quarter of adolescents declare an older age than their real one. Twelve per cent of those in the 9 to 16 age group report that they have been harassed, in particular by being bullied (40 %) and by content and approaches of a sexual nature (25 %). Therefore, opportunities and threats coexist on the internet; nowadays the internet is indispensable for the integration of children from a social, educational and work point of view, but the European institutions and the Member States must do their utmost to ensure that minors are guaranteed the conditions they need for their education and to keep themselves informed, the rules required for safe navigation, and that providers, business and educators are made aware of their responsibilities. The report proposes a holistic approach in respect of the promotion and protection of the rights of children online. Exchanges with the various political groups in the Committee on Culture and Education and the shadow rapporteurs – whom I would like to thank – allowed us to arrive at a compromise text which was highly satisfactory even though it deals with a topic about which there are different sensibilities and trends. The work carried out with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and its rapporteur, Ms Hedh, made a significant contribution. The report welcomes and incorporates – with precise recommendations – the recent communication from the Commission for a better internet for children. It was our aim to strike a balance between the fundamental rights of the child in the digital world, the right to access to education, the right to protection and the right to digital citizenship, in a new system of governance which puts at its heart, as paramount, the interests of the child, as a person undergoing education and as a European citizen, on the basis of Article 24 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Treaty. Where governance is concerned, we call on the Commission to mainstream children’s rights across all the policies of the European Union that refer to the internet, to continue to finance specific programmes such as the Safer Internet Programme on the basis of a report and monitoring, and to take appropriate measures, through the internet among other things, which make it possible to coordinate the implementation of codes of conduct and the CEO coalition initiative. In addition, we support the Commission’s proposal to take legislative action if the adoption of the current codes of self-regulation should fail. As regards safe and untroubled access to internet use, we propose taking measures for an educational alliance among families, schools, associations and those involved in media and audiovisual services, to integrate these skills in school curricula and to train trainers and adults; vigilance in respect of the online marketing and publicising of harmful substances; an exchange of good practice in the role of informal education by the dissemination among adolescents of positive and good practices on the internet; the access of minors to safe and high-quality pluralistic digital content in educational programmes and services and, in particular, in the public service media. As regards the right to protection, the report makes a clear distinction between illegal content and unsuitable and dangerous content. For the dangerous and unsuitable material, we call for action to protect identity and privacy; to prevent excessively early contact with sexuality, grooming and improper behaviour – including that towards other minors, such as online bullying and sexting. Furthermore, we call on the Commission to maintain the initiative for classifying unsuitable content and, in general, for all the technical innovations that guide parents and children; we support the proposal from Ms Reding on the protection of personal data, privacy, the right to be forgotten, with specific measures for minors, and with mandatory parental consent for the processing of their data. As regards illegal content, however, there must be tools which are effective in dealing with online crimes such as grooming, and we would repeat that such crimes are of a cross-border nature and so stronger international cooperation is required in dealing with computer crime and in supporting hotlines. Finally, we would encourage – and we call on the Commission to encourage – the Member States to give whatever support they can to digital citizenship, which is crucial for the development of an intelligent and inclusive Union and civic participation, including that on the internet, by minors.

 Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, sending disconcerting, destabilising messages to Europe’s young people is not a great way to celebrate 25 years of Erasmus. The 33 countries involved in the Erasmus programme and the two and a half million students who have so far had the opportunity of studying abroad deserve certainty. It is unthinkable that the reason that this programme is in crisis is its success, including in terms of the funding already used. We need to be aware that the entire lifelong learning programme accounted for just 0.7 % of the EU budget in the last seven-year period, and we are talking about seeking an increase of 65 % or 75 % for the next seven-year period. We would be giving a completely mixed message if we were to say we could not honour our commitments. I hope that the Cypriot Presidency and the Council will make a very real commitment to reconsidering the extra funding requested by the Commission. Parliament should give a strong, united signal to ensure young people do not become eurosceptics too. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I, too, would like to congratulate Ms Jiménez-Becerril Barrio and Ms Parvanova, the Commissioner and the Council for this step forward by the European judicial system represented by this directive, which is also a way of honouring the victims of 9/11. I believe that, after the directives concerning human trafficking, child pornography and the European protection order, it is very important to focus on vulnerable people using a holistic approach with this directive. It is very important for all the countries to decide on a shared basis of inalienable rights, starting with the right to understand and be understood in one’s own language, access to services, information, compensation, and basically to justice for oneself and one’s family. It is also important that, thanks to the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, reference is made in this directive to the specific nature of violence against minors and women. I hope that in this regard, major efforts will be made to inform and update magistrates and lawyers, and I will conclude, Mr President, by saying that it is important to ensure that we prevent the secondary form of victimisation that often takes place via media that is not self-regulated, which broadcasts pictures of minors, exposing them to further violence and violating their privacy.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we must acknowledge that the European Council of 28 June represented an important political step forward, finally bucking the trend of years of repatriation of EU policies and delays in the process of strengthening and completing the Union’s institutional and economic framework to accompany the single currency. It is now irresponsible of certain governments or political groups to question or threaten to veto the decisions that have been taken, which I hope will be confirmed and fleshed out at the next Ecofin Council meeting. Such behaviour also risks negating Parliament’s efforts to push ahead with common objectives, namely boosting own resources, investment, jobs and growth. Thanks above all to the efforts of our political group and the work of the Italian and French Governments – together with the Spanish Government – the ‘golden rule’ and the Tobin Tax are now on the agenda, but a renewed push for greater political and economic integration in the European Union should be there as well.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I very much wish to emphasise the importance of this report on volunteering, and also to congratulate the rapporteur, with whom I had an excellent relationship in the Committee on Culture and Education (CULT), especially to ensure that Parliament’s attention on this issue will not wane now that the European Year of Volunteering is over. We were hoping – as I had asked previously in my role as shadow rapporteur – for a White Paper on volunteering work, which unfortunately has not been forthcoming. That would have provided an overall comparative framework at European level between the various situations, defining a status for European volunteering work and ensuring consistent fiscal treatment. I find that, despite not having had this, this report does fill a void and looks ahead. It is important to want to strengthen cross-border volunteering and remove the barriers that hamper many volunteers from gaining access to this opportunity and also, in particular, for disadvantaged people who need to be able to get help from volunteers. I think it is vital for us to find out how widespread volunteering is in areas such as cultural heritage, the environment and sport, and to make sure that in European tenders, the work of voluntary associations can be considered as a form of cofinancing for the purposes of being eligible for such tenders.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work. Fifty-five years on from Article 119 of the Treaty and after Article 157 of the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, the average pay gap in Europe is still 16.5%, demonstrating that a more comprehensive approach should be attempted, as the report itself advocates. In my view, the nine key issues identified in the report provide a sound basis for amending the 2006 directive, which Parliament is asking the Commission to review by February 2013, with the inclusion of both legislative and non-legislative measures. I would remind the previous speaker that the legal basis is Article 157, which provides that Parliament and the Council can act through the ordinary legislative procedure, in conjunction with the Commission, to introduce measures to ensure that the Member States implement equality measures. In particular, I must stress the need for transparency in defining work of equal value, which should be based on a job classification system that takes into account professionalism, skill and responsibility. Statistics should be made comparable – which is not the case at the moment – and there should be effective monitoring bodies to which appeals can be addressed, as well as more effective sanctions. Additionally, in terms of pay evaluation, greater transparency is needed in the wage or salary component, which is generally equal compared with the other components, such as benefits, allowances or deductions, in which the gap tends to be greater. That is shown by the fact that the higher women climb in their professions, the greater the pay gap becomes. We should therefore focus on that aspect, together, of course, with the need to reconcile work and family life and the need for training opportunities, not to mention raising the profile of part-time work in relation to the ability to pursue a career, a factor that penalises women to this day. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate the words of the Council and Ms Malmström. I think that today we must at long last talk about a proper European strategy on fighting trafficking, on prevention and on protecting victims. I attach huge significance to the role of the European coordinator, whose staff should, I think, be beefed up. We also need strong direction from the Commission so that all the Member States create equivalent organisations that will work with the national rapporteurs through ongoing consultations, with non-governmental organisations – which are often the most involved in this area – and closely with the police, the magistracy and with the cyber police on offences committed online. It is also important to compare the measures against customers and on discouraging demand in the various countries. This will allow us to move forward and connect the measures on children in a more holistic way as we implement this directive and the one on Internet child pornography. I think that training legal professionals is of central importance, as is legislative consistency. In this vein I would note the appalling situation of those in Italy who from 1998 had the humanitarian residence permit while now illegal immigration has been made a crime. I hope the current government will change this, because it is making it impossible to use the humanitarian residence permit for women who are victims of trafficking. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me just clarify this: I think, personally, that I have some concerns over one point in the report but I would not express it in the way Ms Bizzotto did, in the sense that it seems to me that the report goes a bit beyond the remit of the European Union, not so much when it describes various types of cohabitation, of family, and so on, in different forms, but when it says that the EU must somehow enter into what comes under family law which is still subject to subsidiarity. As far as same-sex families are concerned, I would like to make it clear that there are definitely same-sex unions in Italy, there are same-sex unions in situations where children are present, but same-sex union is not treated as being equivalent to the condition and legal status of the family and this is allowed under the various freedoms of Member States. I believe this is the point that should be clarified, it is not denying reality, it is denying legal gender equality in this case in my country. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that to sum up the situation and indicate more advanced goals for equality between men and women – today, in March 2012 – means facing up to the dramatic data from the economic crisis that show a rise in female unemployment, especially among young people, increasing poverty amongst women and I feel we should also acknowledge the rise of violence against women, especially where it is perpetrated in private. There is a situation, therefore, of suffering exacerbated by the cuts being introduced in many States in areas such as welfare, education and social security, which has mainly hit women. I believe there is a connection between this situation and the continued exclusion of women from the decision-making process and that this leads to an underestimation of the impact on women of the crisis and of our policies. Against this backdrop, the two reports focus on some goals that I agree with: a stronger focus when planning 2014-2020 Structural Funds on actions also targeted at women; economic independence, encouraging women entrepreneurs with Guarantee Funds and support tools; abolishing the gender pay gap, by reassessing women’s work and professionalism; prohibiting discriminatory behaviour – for example in my country, forcing women employees to sign blank resignation letters. We also call for standards and measures to recreate a balance in terms of representation, with transparent selection procedures for men and women in politics and in decision-making, and I would welcome it if Commissioner Reding can with the support of Parliament – as she has announced – really get a directive on quotas in enterprises. We also need to act at a symbolic level, not only countering the stereotypes in the media, but by promoting the enhancement and respect even for the dignity of women which is all too often commodified and abused. I am disappointed that the rapporteur Ms In ’t Veld proposes an amendment to delete this reference to the dignity of women, perhaps not fully grasping that the degradation of their image becomes a legitimisation of the violence towards them. Thank you. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, it would be truly strange if, at a time of such difficulties and problems in the lives of millions of people in Europe, the European Union were to impose further restrictions on food distribution. This would have a detrimental effect on basic social citizenship rights, the value of social cohesion and the very perception of the European social model. The signal that Parliament and the Council are both giving is a positive one, but we need to work on giving a definite structure and future to this necessary initiative. I would like to point out that in my country, Caritas, local bodies and other not-for-profit organisations providing free meals have seen an exponential increase in the number of people joining the ranks of the deprived, who can no longer count on being able to feed themselves, and these include not just immigrants, but many elderly and young people as well. I believe that, in the context of our ambitious fight against poverty and efforts to reduce poverty, this scheme is a prerequisite, and if we had not approved it, we would have gone against our own policy objectives.

I voted for this important report on sport, which is a response to the Commission’s communication on the subject and anticipates the proposal to create a sub-programme for sport in the 2014-2020 multiannual programming. As the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, we pushed for the following points: the adoption of sport as a compulsory subject in school curricula, the need to encourage women and girls from disadvantaged backgrounds to take up sport, focusing on sport as a driver of social integration and as a tool with which to combat intolerance, racism and violence, increasing the protection of minors in competitive sport, combating doping, the use of the European flag at all official sports events, the establishment of a European Day of Sports and the extension of the Erasmus programme to sports.

 Madam President, one of the fundamental rights that the European Union must guarantee for its citizens and residents is real freedom of movement under safe conditions throughout the 27 Member States. At the moment this is not guaranteed for those people – most, but not all of whom are women – who have obtained protection orders in their own countries, often with great difficulty, after being persecuted, stalked or repeatedly threatened even with being killed by someone they know, often a spouse, as Ms Reding mentioned, or an ex-husband or a boyfriend, or in any case someone they know. Such people are in fact no longer protected when they travel to another Member State. Parliament and the Council, in conjunction with the Commission, are seeking to fill this legislative gap by means of this directive. I would like to point out that we have applied the codecision procedure for the first time, at the initiative of the Spanish Presidency together with another 12 Member States, including Italy, and with strong support from the Polish Presidency, whom I would like to thank. This is the first legal instrument offering effective prevention and protection for actual or potential victims of crimes against the person or crimes of a moral nature across the European Union. It may be executed by either the civil or the criminal authorities of a country with measures that are the same as or equivalent to those taken in the issuing country. As the shadow rapporteur in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I would like to highlight the excellent cooperation that arose with the two rapporteurs and the invaluable contribution made by Ezio Perillo of Parliament’s Directorate for Legislative Affairs, who is today at the Court in Luxembourg. I also want to say how pleased I am with the key points of our proposal: the expansion of protection to cover physical and psychological integrity, dignity, personal liberty and sexual integrity; the right to information; the guarantees that the perpetrator of threats will also be informed of the consequences of breaching the European Protection Order; and the obligation for Member States to draw up comparable statistics. Of course, I also expect Parliament to adopt a position on the Victims package that Ms Reding has announced, so as to make this focus on victim protection truly horizontal. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that three issues are important in the transition from training to work: the relationship between theory and practice in teaching and learning; the integration of the humanities with technical and scientific subjects; and the structure of higher education and technical training, including non-academic training and continuous development. This is the direction that should be taken in teacher training, the promotion of training partnerships between companies, training centres and research centres and the promotion of high-level training. Today, we have a two-speed market for young people, and the situation is getting worse. We also have a flexibility that has not been matched by welfare provisions, but the new welfare is continuous development and opportunities to return to work and for mentoring. I think this should be presented more as a new social right. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that compromises are made not only by aiming downwards but also by seeking a middle way that aims upwards, and by improving the living and health conditions not only of women but also of children, whom I believe have not received much attention in this debate. I appreciated the intellectual honesty and politeness with which Mr Mleczko described the Council’s difficulty. I truly hope that a balanced compromise can be reached. However, I believe that we have done well to raise the bar compared with the requests contained in the Commission’s project, which were truly modest. I want to say one thing which I believe is really a basic objection. It seems as though Europe has not yet understood that, unless it helps reconcile work and motherhood, millions of European women will be excluded from the labour market or will be unable to remain in it. A different type of compromise would rejuvenate Europe, reduce childhood and family poverty and increase the productivity and community of Member States, unless the only proposal for welfare reform and cost optimisation is to increase women’s pension age, which would lead to a paradox. Under this system, these women will never reach pension age, because they will leave their jobs, as happens in many countries including mine, because it is not possible to reconcile work and family during their productive and childbearing years. I believe that unless European economic thought revises its conceptual base and moves beyond an ‘accountancy’ approach, growth will not be intelligent, inclusive or sustainable, because the women will not be there. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a point I very much welcome in Ms Wallis’s report on alternative dispute resolution is the fact that it calls for a general ‘justice for growth’ agenda across sectors which goes beyond consumer-producer disputes to include civil transactions, and family disputes in particular. I would argue that family mediation and a strong commitment from Europe in this respect are extremely important issues, in view of the growing number of disputes that generally follow separations and divorces in the European Union. In particular, disputes between spouses who are often of different nationalities tend to drag on longer and consequently have a terrible effect on the children. Experience in many countries shows that having a family mediator, as someone neutral that they can freely turn to, helps partners reach a mutually acceptable understanding, with an agreement in writing that can be submitted to a judge to be made official. This goal must therefore be determinedly pursued at a European level, although with due respect for subsidiarity, not least in light of the 2005 EU regulation on parental responsibility. It will also strengthen cross-border protection, particularly with regard to child abduction and the role of the European Parliament Mediator. I hope, therefore, that the Commission also includes this aspect directed to the Member States in its legislative proposal. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her complex, interesting and fertile report. As has been mentioned, single mothers now make up over 5% of the female population in Europe, and I would also point out that 85% of single parents are women. Single-parent families are therefore concentrated on the female side, and this fact should now be increasingly acknowledged by welfare, employment and social security policies. Naturally, as the report shows, this is a highly diverse population in terms of age, legal status and economic situation. In northern Europe, for instance, the vast majority are young unmarried mothers, especially in certain countries in Scandinavia and the United Kingdom, while in the south, most single mothers with children are separated, divorced or widowed. Their conditions are therefore also highly varied. Whereas certain welfare services and systems are probably more advanced in northern Europe, not least because family connections are less extensive, in the south, we are having to face a new, emerging problem of young unmarried mothers as well, but with a welfare system that has not yet been properly focused or thought through. There are therefore different speeds of response. I believe the first thing that should be done, as the report also points out, is to compare welfare systems and best practices in order to work out the right mix of services for employability, for training and for welfare, in order to guard against forms of poverty and exclusion from the job market and to enable these women to achieve a work-life balance, which is much more complicated for them. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Alfano, on this important report. It has become an essential reference for Parliament’s actions in an area in which it has new, enhanced competence based on the Treaty of Lisbon. It is a fundamental reference because of its subject matter – the fight against organised crime and mafias in the European Union – and because it calls for a special committee, the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor’s Office and the harmonisation of the Member States’ legislation. I also appreciate the fact that some of the proposals I made as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality have been accepted, for instance, the proposal to promote the role of associations of victims’ families and the establishment of a European forum, as well as the call for a holistic approach to people trafficking, especially child trafficking, and to illegal adoptions, not least in light of the recent European directive. I would like, however, to place a little more emphasis on the extent to which the text succeeds in showing that women and children make up the majority of direct or indirect victims, especially of crimes against the person, and that there must therefore be a specific, targeted commitment to support and protect women victims of crime and violence, including when they are witnesses or have dissociated themselves, especially from mafia and criminal families, and also to value their role when they commit themselves to a culture of legality. I would also like to mention the growing number of women involved in combating crime as judges, lawyers and police officers, and also as teachers trying to change the culture of our young people in this respect. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as I congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Gardini, and the Commissioner, I must say that I agree with the calls for European legislation, a bottom-up approach and a coordinating centre that draws on the best experience and the models of civil protection intervention used in the various Member States, bringing together expertise and voluntary resources, national coordinators and local bodies. I would like to refer to two points. Regarding the consolidation of 112 as the single emergency number in Europe, I would ask the Commission to carry out an active check, given that my country, for example, is moving towards further fragmentation of emergency numbers and the services that answer emergency calls. There are even two numbers for fires. Secondly, we should increase the part played by new technologies in the field of early warning and warning systems, for example, by supporting the roll-out of prototypes that the EU finances but which are not then taken up by the Member States. Lastly, in terms of the organisation of civil protection, I think it is also important to highlight the social changes that have occurred in the European population, which, to an increasing extent, is elderly, of foreign origin and concentrated in outlying areas where there is little infrastructure. Hence, there is a need to safeguard access and the possibility for this most vulnerable section of the population to be supported. Silvia Costa,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as everyone knows, being a woman is already an undertaking in itself, because it means having to manage and reconcile family, professional and social life, in a context that still does not adequately recognise the high level of education (as Commissioner Reding mentioned earlier), professionalism and expectations of women. I appreciate that in this report Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou has worked extremely hard to collect numerous proposals and objectives that, as a shadow rapporteur and member of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I advanced together with several of my colleagues. In the European Union women are under-represented, as they are in management positions in companies, currently making up only 12% of the membership of boards of directors of listed companies. Against this background we are happy to have heard the serious commitment of Commissioner Reding, and we call on the European Commission to propose legislation including mandatory quotas by 2012, to increase percentages to 30% by 2015 and to 40% by 2020, if the steps taken by companies and the Member States are found to be inadequate. In this regard it is an encouraging sign that six countries, including Italy in the last few days, have approved legislation along these lines with a bipartisan vote. I would like to clarify that these quotas are not just numerical, but also aim to achieve better performance in the corporate system, by sharing the management not just of large enterprises, but also of small and medium-sized enterprises. This is why we are proposing the use of several instruments under corporate social responsibility, including family-friendly services, flexi-time working arrangements, and management training for women. It is also important to recognise the link between the presence of competences and women’s roles in corporate governance with a different approach to process management, optimal use of human resources, anti-discrimination rules and sustainable productivity which they often guarantee. I would like to raise another point also in response to what Mr Bauer rightly said earlier, and that is that we have not merely just included female quotas, but we have also included an important mechanism, which was our own proposal, and that is that the joint presence of men and women is linked to greater transparency in appointments, in the selection of men and women, so that this is a benefit for everyone, not just for women. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Mr President, it is highly significant that Parliament is using this resolution to send a strong message to both the Member States and the younger generations to ask for greater commitment to European cooperation on learning, vocational training and higher education in order to bolster the Europe 2020 strategy. We know that youth unemployment has severe repercussions on poverty and social exclusion, as does the prolonged period of insecurity in which 40% of European young people live. Strong backing should be given to a combination of education policies and a new incentive-based welfare system for enterprises that provide full-time employment for young people and women. Ensuring that the skills being learned are in line with the competences – including for citizenship – required for the new goals of sustainable and intelligent growth is essential, as are policies for the transition from education to the workplace and speeding up the recognition of professional qualifications, titles and academic credits. Those Member States which, like my own, are cutting resources for education and research at a time of crisis must know that they are hurting young people, and hurting the future of Europe. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, in an ageing Europe that is struggling to find answers to the global challenges of the future, the European Union and its Member States must seize this strong stimulus from Parliament to demonstrate that they can be more courageous, investing in future generations, in education and in culture. With these four reports and the Sarajevo proposal, Parliament calls for these issues to be placed at the heart of the Europe 2020 strategy. In particular, the economic advantages, as well as those in employment and innovation, are highlighted by the report on cultural and creative industries, which already account for almost 3% of Europe’s gross product and employ 5 million people – a figure which rises to 7% if ancillary industries are taken into account. As shadow rapporteur for this measure for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists &amp; Democrats in the European Parliament, I am pleased to see that the rapporteur, Mrs Sanchez-Schmid, has welcomed our amendments. What did we propose? First of all, that cultural tourism and fashion should be added to the eight sectors already included. We also hope that the Commission – and I am sure that Mrs Vassiliou will take action to ensure this happens – will submit a White Paper on cultural and creative industries as soon as possible in order to strengthen this cross-sectoral strategy throughout Europe and the Member States. Cutting funds for culture and education at times of crisis – as my country is doing, on the grounds that culture is not essential to survival – means failing to invest in the future and in smart, inclusive growth; it means failing to understand that culture is essential for life. The report states that the European status of artists and of those engaged in creative professions should be officially recognised, and that in cultural industry, small and medium-sized enterprises should be fully recognised as such for the purposes of access to credit and support when starting up, especially for young people under the age of 35. It also promises to protect jobs, and to introduce specific training and innovative financial instruments, bearing in mind that capital in the creative sector often consists of values that are intangible but nonetheless crucial for innovation in all sectors. The Europe-wide cultural sector must be taken into consideration in the legal framework for international trade, certainly in the European dimension and in cultural diplomacy, in the internal market, in mobility … (The President cut off the speaker) Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, naturally, I wish to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur on this report which really signals a significant step forward in EU policies, in its invitation to the Commission to submit a proposal for a directive on the procedures to be adopted by Member States to recognise, and possibly revoke, international protection. I believe that the events of recent days between the African and European coasts indicate that we need the ‘asylum package’ – as it is to be called – to become a binding rule. In particular, I think of the positive amendments that were approved; for example, the whole question of greater safeguards with regard to minors, since I believe that children must not be detained under any circumstance (which is exactly what has been happening in Lampedusa, where children have been treated in exactly the same way as adults, together with adults, often in totally unacceptable conditions). It would have been better to have this directive in place before these dramatic events took place in Europe and Africa. Another very important issue is that of vulnerable people and their issues, especially women, and problems relating to family matters and reunions. Congratulations also to the rapporteur. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as some of my fellow Members have already said, I think that by voting in favour of this report by Mrs Svensson we are making a commitment to ensuring that the Commission fulfils its pledge to adopt a Communication, before the end of 2011, for the implementation of a strategy and a European action plan to combat violence against women, which will take a global view and therefore include all the different cases, from sexual violence to domestic violence and female genital mutilation, and – I hope – all the new forms of violence. I am referring to the actual inducement to violence, which is often carried out by advertising and the media, as well as the forms of blackmail and violations of women’s human rights that occur in the workplace when they decide they want to become mothers or are already working mothers. Following the implementation and adoption of the directive on trafficking in human beings – to which Parliament was very committed – and the directive on the European Protection Order, I think it would be important to have a proper directive on this issue within the new legal framework created by the Treaty of Lisbon and the Stockholm Programme. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Svensson. We know that violence against women and children is increasing across Europe. For this reason, we urge the Commission to submit a proposal, as it has already promised, for a strategy on violence against women by 2011. This should be all-inclusive, in the sense that it should cover domestic violence and genital mutilation, but also some more insidious forms. I am thinking of severe discrimination and bullying in the workplace against women who are pregnant or intend to marry and who are called on to resign beforehand, which is something that happens in my country but is no longer a crime as it was in the past. I am also thinking of what can only be described as the incitement to violence perpetrated by the media and advertising. After the directive on trafficking in human beings and the imminent directive on the victims of violence, announced by Commissioner Malmström, I think that the Treaty of Lisbon has laid the basis for achieving greater legal harmonisation in the way Member States acknowledge the importance of crimes of violence against women and children as specific forms of violence, as well as defining the essential standards of services for consulting, legal assistance and protection for women and children in cooperation with NGOs. It will also lead to consistent and comparable statistics with impact analyses of forms of prevention and enforcement by Member States to ensure a reduction in violence. I think, in this respect, that there is a common will by Parliament – I was one of the signatories to the written declaration – to define a year of reflection across Europe on the theme of violence, and I think that Parliament can add its very strong and very influential voice to this.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to ask my fellow MEP who spoke just now if it can really be considered appropriate to apply the terms ‘freeloaders’ and ‘fortune seekers’ to people who are fleeing from a situation of great political distress – and all the political groups agree on this – such as the one in North Africa. I find this to be an extremely serious allegation and call on the President to somehow highlight what has been said and establish whether this can be considered appropriate in such a sensitive debate that touches on the suffering of human beings, who are clearly not considered to have the right to eat, as it has been said of them ‘they even demand food and are lot of freeloaders’. I find it very serious that this has been said in this House and I hope that European citizens can read this extremely harsh utterance, which only serves to reveal the total political inadequacy of the person who said it. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteurs and I also dedicate this 8 March to the women of North Africa and the Middle East, such as the many women who, at this moment, are demonstrating in Cairo and Iran and fighting for democracy and liberty in their countries. In this respect, I hope that firm measures will be taken, including in the external actions of the European Commission, to establish links with these women. Even in Europe, there is a great reawakening of women’s participation, starting with demands to respect the dignity of women in the media and in the behaviour of men in institutions, as was said in town squares on 13 February by 1 million Italian women and many concerned men. As for the reports under discussion, I would note that there is a strong link between growing insecurity at work and in the lives of young women, even though they are better educated and more skilled, the inadequate protection of atypical female workers – which most young women are – during maternity and parenthood, the shortcomings of current policies for achieving balance and the lower rates of female employment, the more frequent instances of poverty among women and children, and the lower level of their pensions and, hence, their exclusion from decision-making powers. While I agree with Mrs Reding’s initiative concerning boards of directors, I am less supportive of the initiative on insurance which risks penalising women in particular. Without this, there will be no Europe 2020. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, I voted for this resolution because I believe that the compromise reached with such difficulty within our committee is essentially positive, insofar as it is a tool to remind Member States to ensure that pensions are adequate, sustainable and portable throughout Europe, in the context of a significantly ageing population. I would however like to make three criticisms, which I hope the European Commission will implement in the coming White Paper. The first is the lack of recognition of the importance of the third pillar in pension systems. Second, although the difference in retirement income between men and women resulting from the pay gap, breaks for periods of care and greater unemployment among women has been acknowledged, there are no flexibility criteria for women of retirement age who cease to be employed, and there is no adequate recognition of periods of care for the purpose of defining retirement age. This would, however, be desirable. Thirdly, European citizens’ right to a common programme of welfare education and information about their pension and insurance situation should be affirmed, in particular for young people and workers throughout the course of their working lives. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, during a stage in its life in which Europe is undergoing a crisis of identity and prospects, I think that the establishment of a European Heritage Label that identifies those sites – both material and immaterial – of high symbolic and educational value for the history, culture and creation of the European Union, is particularly significant. My sincere thanks go to the rapporteur, Mrs Paliadeli, who efficiently took on board the proposals and additions suggested by many of us in the Committee on Culture and Education, providing, in particular, for procedures that are more certain and more respectful of the Treaty of Lisbon with regard to the subdivision of tasks among Member States, the Commission, the Council and Parliament. As some of my fellow Members have picked up on, we also strove to make sure there was no overlap between the label and other initiatives of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) or the European Council’s historic and cultural itineraries. Indeed, on the basis of well-defined criteria, the Member States will present not more than two actively managed sites every two years. This is an important point: the Member States must show that they believe in the sites and therefore manage them in an educational way, involving the people. The Commission, meanwhile, will be responsible for pre-selection after hearing from a panel of experts, but it will also assume a monitoring role, will assess the effectiveness of the management of the sites every six years, and may also withdraw the label. Parliament comes out of this with a stronger role because not only does it appoint four of the 16 members of the European panel, but also because it has an active relationship with the list of pre-selected sites. I also support the solution provided to the complex problem of the marks already assigned on an intergovernmental basis to many Member States that, in any case, though not suitable for the new system and the new criteria, will retain their earlier mark and will not therefore be downgraded. I also appreciate the priority given to transnational sites, which will be a very interesting challenge for Europe, and the role assigned to the Committee of the Regions as part of an approach of subsidiarity, as well as the emphasis on the necessary involvement of Member States in the selection phase, including municipalities and regions, in order to avoid their being only partially involved. However, I think an extra effort by the Member States would also be useful. It would be very important for them to launch competitions aimed at young people in schools and universities to start a process to identify the sites, which would also become a way to reconstruct a common European history and destiny and mean that they, too, would contribute to the sense of belonging and European citizenship.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if this programme is brought to fruition today, it is thanks to the determination of Mrs Pack and the will of Commissioner Vassiliou. As an Italian-Swiss citizen, I am happy that Switzerland is the first country from outside the European Union to participate in EU education programmes for young people, both in higher education and continuing skills training. Indeed, let us remember that even if Switzerland is not part of the European Union, it has made a major contribution to building the values and freedoms that are a shared heritage of the European continent. It is a symptom of the success of programmes such as ‘Youth in Action’ that Switzerland requests that the mobility of our European programmes be extended to their young people and therefore, it is of significant importance that Switzerland is not only requesting a larger economic area but also a larger educational area. I believe that it will be very interesting for the young people of the European Union and Switzerland to get to know each other better, and I am sure that this will lay foundations that will also have an influence on the future of the European Union.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, through this proposal for a directive – for which I should like to express my great thanks to the rapporteurs, with whom I worked as a shadow – Parliament is supporting and expanding the Council’s proposal, which was designed to protect people across all 27 Member States who suffer forms of persecution or serious and repeated threats from known and previously identified persons – often ex-boyfriends, husbands or partners – who threaten their physical and sexual integrity, dignity and personal freedom. Indeed, the number of attacks and killings – particularly against women – is on the increase. Their complaints are often not taken seriously enough by the police and the judiciary, and protection orders and measures against the aggressor are currently only valid in the country in which they are issued. Commissioner Reding, the measure under approval may not be perfect, but it plugs a legislative vacuum. After all, in creating the European area of freedom, security and justice, we have always acted empirically, at times pushing matters through where necessary. Indeed, we believe that this initiative is important because it will allow all citizens of the European Union – men and women – and all European residents to travel freely across borders, taking their human rights and their rights to protection and security with them, as stated in Article 3 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which we in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament intended as the legal basis, in order to give a more coherent direction to the structure of the proposal. Through the establishment of the European Protection Order, the protected person is guaranteed to be looked after even in other Member States, through a fast and free-of-charge procedure. Each Member State must appoint a competent authority to inform victims of their rights, carry out campaigns, collect statistics and inform the person as soon as their national protection order has been issued. Furthermore, it gives a great boost to the creation of the European legal area and the implementation of freedom of movement, and it also applies the ordinary legislative procedure involving codecision between the Council and Parliament for the first time. I hope that the Council will confirm this commitment and I hope that the Commission – though showing particular attention to the coming ‘Security for Victims’ package of measures – does not miss this particular chance to respond right now to this extremely serious situation, which is also demonstrated by European and national statistics. Amongst other things, this could lead to important legal convergence among Member States. I would therefore suggest that we avoid any delays and make a specific commitment to this particular type of victim protection. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur, I should like to thank the rapporteurs and say that I think this directive is extraordinarily important because it is the first time that the European Union has taken legally binding action in the fight against the trafficking of human beings. Fifty years after the United Nations convention, there are still hundreds of thousands of people in our civilised Europe – mainly women and children – who are reduced to slavery. For the first time, the EU is equipped with a single instrument to fight against the trafficking of human beings, whether for reasons of sexual or labour exploitation, including forced begging. Our group had three priorities: to hit traffickers with uniform, more severe sanctions, including confiscating assets and using them to support the victims of trafficking; to ensure a high level of protection and social rehabilitation for victims, with free legal representation and immunity from prosecution for crimes committed in connection with being trafficked; and to promote the crucial role of the non-governmental organisations, both secular and religious, that work to support the victims. However, I am hoping for a revision of the 2004 directive on the resident permit for victims. I would also underline that in the proposal, we provide for the safeguarding of children through strengthened measures and I support Commissioner Malmström’s call for further measures against sex tourism and child pornography. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, I believe that Parliament has a great opportunity today to reiterate that motherhood is a social value, that the protection of a mother’s health and that of her child must be strengthened, that a female worker must not be discriminated against for being a mother in finding and keeping a job, and that childcare should be better shared with fathers. Notwithstanding the current crisis – as has already been highlighted – we must make the same observation which has already been made by the most advanced economists: the impact assessment which has been carried out shows the need for a more far-sighted and holistic approach. Today’s costs, which can potentially be staggered, are a social and economic investment in the greater well-being of children, fewer diseases and the greater participation of women in the labour market. Many claim that there will not be an increased and appropriately trained and qualified female workforce without a new welfare system and new opportunities to achieve a work-life balance: I fully agree with and thank the rapporteurs, Mrs Estrela and Mrs Plumb, for the complex work they have carried out, as I do all Members who have strived to find common ground. I also agree with the facility which, I believe, many of us wanted, and which will provide mothers of disabled children, and in the case of adoptions and multiple births, with greater opportunities to have flexible working hours, the reversal of the burden of proof against breaches of the law and greater protection from dismissal. Furthermore, I proposed, together with other Members, that with respect to the compulsory six weeks’ leave following childbirth, a safeguard clause be provided for those countries where legislation provides this compulsory period prior to childbirth too. In conclusion, I hope that now, over these two days, we will be willing to find common ground so that we do not miss the important opportunity to adopt this directive in this parliamentary term as well.

 Mr President, I should like to express my support for maintaining the European Social Fund’s own budget and rules, albeit with a view to its greater integration with all the other Structural Funds. However, the rules need to be revised in at least five areas: we need more simplification and more monitoring of results and not just of procedures; we need to really make the most of experience such as that gained in the Italian regions over the last two years, to offer integrated packages of guidance, training, retraining and support to help integrate workers who have been made redundant or who are unemployed into SMEs; we need to promote training partnerships between educational training institutions, universities and businesses in order to provide opportunities for continuous training that take into account the need for new skills; we need more transnational projects, which, until now, have only been experimental; and we need more national and transnational work-study initiatives for young people. I believe that it is on the basis of these points, among others, that we need to reconsider the prospect of introducing new rules for the European Social Fund. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, through this debate – which frankly I was hoping would be rather better attended, because it deserves far greater participation – Parliament is seeking to add its voice to that of so many others around the world who have come out in recent days against the tragic death sentence by stoning for Sakineh Mohammadi-Ashtiani, after the appeal by her son Sajad, and to save all the other women sentenced to death or unjustly imprisoned, like Zahra Bahrami, in summary trials in Iran. In this age of globalisation, it is even more obvious that human rights and women’s rights are inseparable. If a woman dies after being tortured by stoning, our consciences and our freedoms will be stoned with her. In our resolution, we urge both the European Union’s High Representative, Catherine Ashton, and the Commissioner for Human Rights, Viviane Reding – two powerful women – without further delay, to take all necessary steps with the Iranian Government and in international forums for the death sentence for Sakineh to be rescinded, for Zahra to be released, for the barbaric practice of stoning to be abandoned, and for renewed efforts to be made in the battle to achieve a moratorium on the death sentence and also to support the democratic opposition in Iran. We, the Italian female Members in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, together with all our fellow Members, are holding a candlelight vigil tomorrow evening here in the courtyard of the European Parliament in Strasbourg. We are calling it ‘A light for Sakineh’s life’, and we ask all Members to take part so that darkness does not fall over this tragic, highly symbolic affair and so that the Iranian people and the Iranian opposition are not abandoned. We are calling for more robust intervention from the Union because we believe that the defence of human rights, here and around the world, is an area where the European Union’s credibility and identity are at stake.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteurs – whom I thank – have raised a key issue, which Commissioner Reding has also addressed in part. We must ensure that policies for women and for equal opportunities are incorporated and integrated more effectively into general policies at European and national level alike. I am thinking of the crisis, poverty, development, cooperation, employment and welfare. I believe, however, that there are three issues that should be emphasised by the Commission, by us in our work and by the Member States. Firstly, I would like Commissioner Reding to emphasise the role of women in the European Union’s external action. A new policy of which women must be made more aware is contained in Mrs Figueiredo’s report. The second issue is that of the Commission’s support for the draft directive on the European Protection Order, which is a tool of fundamental importance for guaranteeing the … (The President cut off the speaker) Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 10 years since the introduction of the Lisbon Strategy and on the eve of the Europe 2020 strategy, in the middle of a full economic, social and employment crisis, we know that we cannot come out of this crisis, nor lay the foundations for new and sustainable growth and a new social cohesion, as you have said, unless we strengthen the mechanisms and instruments that the European Union has at its disposal to sustain investment in the knowledge triangle: education, training and research. Just now, Commissioner, you confirmed that as regards this objective, some European governments are performing well, others a little less so. In order not to fall within the limits revealed by the Lisbon Strategy, I believe that in this area, the Commission has to strengthen the open method of coordination with Member States, provide incentives and penalties in the European Social Fund and monitor the results. I do not consider it to be consistent for governments, as the Italian Government has done, to cut EUR 8 billion in three years from education and the universities, without reinvesting the savings in these areas, especially as we have a 19% early school leaving rate and 25% youth unemployment. In conclusion, do you not consider it opportune to strengthen the legal powers in Directive 2005/36/EC to facilitate the mutual recognition of professional qualifications among Member States? According to Professor Monti’s report, currently, less than 3% of European workers in fact work in another Member State, and one of the reasons seems to be precisely this difficult issue of mutual recognition of qualifications.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Beijing +15 is confronted this year with a financial, economic and employment crisis that is having a negative impact on the living and working conditions of millions of women throughout Europe and the world, but which may represent an opportunity to review development models, the organisation of the labour market and social policies. In strengthening the Beijing +15 objectives, the European Union must prioritise, on behalf of women, policies for providing access to environmental resources and credit, including by means of micro-finance; the balance between family life and work life, including by means of the adoption of the directive on parental leave; training policies and incentives for businesses that employ young people and women; and the fight against trafficking in human beings with a new directive, which we hope will be based on the resolution approved during the last part-session in Strasbourg. Above all, we must focus development cooperation support on the empowerment of women in the poorest countries, and in African countries in particular, building a possible Euro-African alliance with the women. It would be good – I am addressing the Commissioner and the President here – if the European delegation in New York promoted and gained support for the campaign to award the Nobel Peace Prize to the women of Africa, symbolically represented by the leaders of associations active in those countries worst affected by conflicts and poverty.

Madam President, Commissioner Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is very important for the European Parliament to take the opportunity offered by this debate with a view to the March elections in Iraq. The Iraqi political process has shown itself to be important – even if, as you were saying, interesting – but still very fragile. It is thus even more important to do everything possible to consolidate and strengthen the country’s new institutions and the political equilibrium which sustains them. We believe this to be a vital objective if we wish the first substantial withdrawal of US troops to occur in August without it having serious consequences on the country’s internal situation. The coexistence of Shi’ites, Sunnis and Kurds which is today embodied in the federal structures should be guaranteed by new laws, as well as by a political consensus involving all these parties. On this point, concerns are being aroused – and we would also like your view on this – by the electoral commission’s recent decision to bar many candidates and parties with close links to Sunnis or Christians, thus running the risk of weakening the already fragile democratic process in Iraq. Through the measures undertaken, the European Union must follow this electoral process, as you have said, but also be more ambitious in the development of relations with Iraq. The Union’s EUJUST LEX programme directly involves us in the process of improving Iraqi legislation and democratic institutions, and we, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, consider it a positive sign that the Council has decided to extend the mission until 30 August 2010. The EU should continue to maintain strong support for Iraq through its cooperation programmes, with the aim of participating in the process to stabilise and develop the country, and after the elections, it should strengthen relations between the parliaments. It should be remembered that many Member States are working with Iraq, including Italy, with the important cultural cooperation programme. Iraq’s political equilibrium is essential not only for the country but also in terms of the role that Iraq can play in the region strategically, with the aim of overcoming existing conflicts and securing peace. In this sense, the improvement of relations with Turkey by the regional government of Kurdistan constitutes a positive step in that direction. However, as we know, Iraq remains a country with very serious problems in relation to security, respect for democracy and human rights, as well as economic insecurity. It is the most vulnerable groups, such as refugees – forming 10% of the population – ethnic minorities, women, religious minorities and children who are suffering the negative impact of this situation. We must therefore play a still more incisive role in this area – I am just finishing – partly through support for local and European NGOs working in Iraq and, in this regard, women can also be involved as strategic figures to overcome some of the population’s difficulties.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my great satisfaction that today we are tackling a subject like this with an important question, for which I warmly thank the authors, and I would also like to express my gratitude for the high level of cooperation that we have seen between all the political parties and the two committees. I am also very happy to have heard very serious commitments voiced by the Commission and also by the Spanish Presidency, and I truly hope that the new directive will soon be drafted along the lines that essentially seem to enjoy a large consensus. I think we know that the numbers in this field are very complex to analyse, but in brief, we are talking about almost 300 000 people, 79% of them women, many of them minors, being trafficked every year in our civilised Europe. Unfortunately, numbers have been rising in recent years. For this reason, too, we need to make very strong progress in the light of the new areas of responsibility that the European Union has and also in the light of what we have already approved in the Stockholm Programme to bring in some innovations. It was a great step forward when we approved, at EU level, the provision – which, for example, had already been in force in Italy since 1998 – allowing humanitarian residence permits to be issued to victims. However, we must also make progress on safeguarding victims in relation to protection, social and employment reintegration, the possibility of preventing there being customers – which we must think very seriously about – and more serious and effective measures on sanctions which must, as you said, Commissioner, be harmonised at EU level. In particular, we ask that the consent of victims to their exploitation be considered irrelevant, in view of the high level of blackmail involved in these circumstances. I will conclude very shortly, just adding this: we need not only special protection for minors but, above all, also forms of support for persons arriving in Europe who have already previously suffered forms of trafficking along the journeys, ever longer and ever more tragic, that they complete before reaching our coasts and our territories.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it would be very important for 2010, the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, to mark the birth of a new Community financial instrument, dedicated to microfinance, aimed at those who are disadvantaged in accessing the banking system but who have micro-enterprise plans. As we are aware, micro-credit has proved to be an extraordinary tool for creating self-entrepreneurship opportunities and widespread social value in developing countries, particularly for women. It has become a new strategy of the United Nations and of the World Bank, but it has also been trialled with positive results in many countries, in many European Member States, including Italy, particularly for immigrants, women and young people. By adopting this report, Parliament is providing, in the midst of a serious economic and financial crisis, not only a strategic opportunity for social inclusion but also a positive challenge to the banking system, since it is developing a new approach and new powers, in collaboration with non-profit bodies and local and national institutions. I welcome the adoption of many amendments, which I will not go over again, but I would like to say that today we are asking not just for micro-credit resources, but we are also asking that micro-credit … (The President cut off the speaker) Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to dedicate this International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women to the memory of Anna Politkovskaya, a journalist and a woman who paid for her love of truth with her life, to the African women in conflicts, and to the many forms of suffering of women in Europe that often go unobserved. These examples are at odds with the degraded and consumerist image that the media often attaches to female identity, helping to create a culture where women are oppressed and humiliated. This is also a serious form of violence against which Europe must speak out and intervene in. We must urgently set up a consistent European system for statistical recording – it has been said more than once – with particular reference to minors, trafficking, physical and sexual violence, and women in vulnerable categories, such as immigrants. Yet we would also like to see tangible results from the European Union guidelines on women in armed conflict, which the Commissioner also mentioned previously, at least through the provision of financial and other support for projects, often organised by small associations, local NGOs, including in countries concerned with reintegrating and assisting women who are victims of violence. We are aware that today, we have a new possibility, as offered by the Treaty of Lisbon and the Stockholm Programme, to enshrine this preventive action within the Community. However, we must also denounce another aspect of violence: the context in which violence takes place. Alcohol- and drug-related violence is growing among young people and minors, and perhaps we do not mention this often enough when we discuss violence against women.Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me first thank Mr Leichtfried for this document. It is important because it provides better definition of the interinstitutional relations between Parliament and the Commission on an extremely sensitive question: Parliament’s powers have been extended in the area of trade, which was not part its competences under the ordinary legislative procedure. There is therefore a fundamental problem, not with the Regulations we are amending today, which are being adapted to a new regime, but in terms of the relations between the European Parliament and the Commission. In this regard, although I welcome Mr Leichtfried’s report, I am not at all pleased with the views expressed by the Commissioner in this House. The relationship between Parliament and the Commission is still overly technical. There is an evident and continuous effort by the Commission and the Council to reduce relations with the European Parliament to their pre-Lisbon level and we cannot allow this to happen. Limiting the powers of the Commission is an important step that should result in more parliamentary control and make the Commission act in a more focused manner. Only in this way can we respond to the problems raised by Mr Salvini: I completely agree that the EU’s exclusive competence in the area of trade policy should be maintained, and that the EU’s power should be increased over that of the individual Member States. However, we must also be stronger within the World Trade Organisation, in the knowledge that unless we pay more attention to the real economy, we will never emerge from the current crisis. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that on your travels around Europe in this difficult period – especially given your competencies in some key areas at this time of crisis – you will have had a chance to ‘see for yourself’ the situation in which Europe finds itself. I say this because the last thing I would like in the present case is to find myself agreeing with Mr Salvini. We must be aware of the situation we face: we know that China represents a great opportunity, and not simply great problem. It represents an opportunity for those enterprises that export EUR 170 billion worth of goods to China each year, although we also import EUR 250 billion and are only too aware that this represents a trade deficit. However, if we do not introduce strict and exact rules on fair trade, we will end up by fuelling and increasing the wave of anti-European sentiment against the EU institutions. What else do we need to say or do to make you understand in that ivory tower that is the European Commission what kind of situation we are facing? These continuous sermons on innovation and development mean very little to the sector we are dealing with here, which is at the cutting edge in terms of innovation and development! So all of you, and all of the gnomes that live inside the offices of the Commission, cannot but be aware that the timetables that you are proposing do not do justice to Europe and the problems we are facing! I think that you should make an effort to understand that for the largest economic power in the world to impose the rules of fair trade simply means enhancing its own dignity, showing that it understands how to live within the great global village of the present with a sense of dignity. Currently Europe is not managing to do this in a way that benefits its citizens. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, nobody in this Parliament is in any doubt that the importance of the measure that we will be voting this evening goes well beyond the specific issue we are discussing. I have always considered myself to be a friend of Israel and I personally have no doubt that the conflict that has pitted a large part of the Arab world against Israel for decades is due mainly – if not exclusively – to the fact that too many in the Arab world do not want to recognise the right of the State of Israel to exist. Having said that, however, we must also strongly condemn the repeated violations of international law and of the agreements signed by the Israeli Government, which have led to a downward spiral that Israel should – precisely because it claims to be the only democracy in the Middle East – make a definite effort to end. We therefore request that this report be referred back to the Committee on International Trade and be shelved until Israel takes decisive steps towards dismantling its settlements in illegally occupied Palestinian territory and until it shows more respect for the Palestinian people’s right to exist. Such signals can be encouraged by a more effective European Foreign policy in the area, which today is altogether lacking. Despite the fact that I am not voting in favour of the measure, I believe that Parliament should at least support the amendments by Mr Moreira, Ms De Keyser and Ms Schaake, aimed at preventing the extension of the advantages for Israel under this measure to products originating from the unlawfully Occupied Territories. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I voted in favour of this proposal on trade and economic relations between the EU and the United States, in part because of the important, balanced and complete report drawn up by Mr Moreira, for which I thank him. The proposal offers us a complete framework of the commercial and economic prospects and of the difficulties and challenges involved in the meeting of the two main world economies that together account for about half of global economic output and nearly a third of world trade flows. After many years of deadlock, we are now approaching a possible turnaround in bilateral relations, with the prospect of a far-reaching agreement between Europe and the United States that could open up positive scenarios for transatlantic relations. Naturally there are questions relating to tariff barriers, and an agreement of this scope would have to aim to remove the many trade and technical barriers that unfortunately persist. It would also deal with other important issues, such as the protection of indications of origin, the opening up of the public procurement markets and harmonisation of rules of origin and regulatory standards, including health and plant protection standards, where there is still too much divergence. However, this in no way detracts from the steps being taken. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution before Parliament is an important policy document taking account of the ambitions and concerns that European manufacturers have for some time held with regard to a country that is both a great opportunity for our economy and a great problem. The EU and Japan together represent more than a third of world GDP and more than 20 % of world trade. These figures alone give us an idea of the importance of the upcoming negotiations. I would have preferred Japan to send out stronger signals than it has done, in my opinion. The most important question remains the removal of the numerous non-tariff barriers (NTBs) by the Japanese as well as regulatory barriers that cannot merely be ascribed to cultural differences. Such removal should be seen as a precondition for reaching a mutually balanced and mutually advantageous agreement. The outcomes on public procurement and the automotive sector seem particularly decisive for a successful conclusion to negotiations. Japan should open up its market to the same extent as the EU in a spirit of real reciprocity, in particular with regard to NTBs in the automotive sector such as the ‘zoning regulations’ and special fiscal treatment for ‘key cars’.
 The question of indications of origin for agro-food products including wines and spirits is also important. Parliament should also ensure that it is continuously informed on the progress of negotiations and that the Commission carry out a second assessment of the impact of a possible free trade agreement with Japan, in particular with regard to more sensitive sectors such as the automotive and electronics industries. This is the only manner in which to provide proper protection to European manufacturing sectors at a time of crisis without compromising our commitment to free, sustainable and fair trade.

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Leichtfried, the negotiations on the trade agreement with Colombia, Peru and Central America and the corresponding stabilisation mechanisms and safeguard clauses have kept many of us and the Committee on International Trade very busy. We are in favour of the proposed regulations because they secure a balance between various demands, all of them referring back to the principles of free trade, attending to Union interests, and international trade as a tool for growth and development based on environmental sustainability and respect for human rights. In particular, these regulations are designed to protect European companies and consequently the workers they employ – our farmers – especially those in the outermost regions of the European Union. The safeguards and stabilisation mechanisms are effective for a limited time only, and we believe that the time period suggested is long enough for us to adapt our production system to the liberalisation measures included in the agreements and also for the countries in question to increase their exports considerably. That is why we voted in favour. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D
).  
– (IT) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on this issue, there should have been a more respectful approach towards the prerogatives of Parliament, towards the need to avoid a confused agreement which tends to regulate matters that are, in themselves, too diverse. I will be voting against the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) not because I am convinced that the fundamental rights of the Union are truly being violated to the core, but because counterfeiting and online piracy cannot be fought with the same weapons, almost as if counterfeiting a handbag or a drug is similar to downloading a song or a film from the Internet. I am against ACTA because the Commission and the Council hitherto have not yet regulated in a credible way an issue that is so very much in the limelight in the digital age, such as the protection of intellectual property on the web. I am opposed because current legislation would already enable action to be taken against those countries that make a living out of counterfeiting. I conclude by reiterating my opposition to an agreement that touches on highly sensitive issues, but does so in an inefficient, confused way, lacking a legal framework that is the only thing which would allow me to do anything other than vote against, as I shall be doing tomorrow. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, while we appreciate the care with which they were formulated, your answers only partly give us peace of mind. We are facing a highly political issue, not just a commercial one: formal consistency between this agreement and the more general association agreement with Israel cannot justify the sort of subterfuge that facilitates infringing the prohibition that international law has imposed on Israel regarding products made in the occupied territories. I understand our economic interests, I also understand the technical scope of this protocol, but I believe the European Union should undertake a careful review of the origin of the products, because no protocol or agreement can ignore the more general context which prevails today. The repeated violations on this point by Israel do not help the process of détente which we all feel is required and which needs the European Union to be an active part of the solution.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to explain my vote also in relation to Ms Ferreira’s report, because it seems to me that it is the right time to overcome the contradiction between growth and austerity, which is at risk of becoming outdated. Today, we have spoken in favour of growth and, at the same time, in favour of recovery. There is a contradiction when we say that we do not want to adopt a report like Mr Gauzès’s, on which I abstained for reasons I will explain, and then at the same time we call for a consolidated European budget and fiscal union. We need fiscal union, we need to monitor the budgets of Member States and, at the same time, encourage growth with the amendments we have presented and voted for in Ms Ferreira’s report. I therefore believe that we have done something important. We have done it even though Mr Gauzès’s report contains an article – Article 10 – which sends a negative message to the markets, as it concerns controlled default procedures, which we should not even talk about at the moment because we have to show the European public that we want to move forward with the euro and with greater integration.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the prudence with which the Commission is looking at the new system of relations between the first and the fourth largest economies in the world is a comfort to us. Deep underlying reasons, based on the history of our times, push for relations between the democracies of Europe and of the Rising Sun, based on the desire for friendship, development and the opening up of new opportunities. We cannot, however, overlook the fact that, amid all the distrust caused by long-term antagonism and by resentments that have not yet fully died down, the history of a system of relations in the name of multipolarity, overcoming the hegemony of the United States, is pushing us into new partnerships with the Far East. This has led to new forms of cooperation between China and Japan, shifting the balance that has become established since the Second World War and which must not be used against the European Union. The new set-ups which are being introduced at global level and in the major regions of the world thus require the European Union to be an enterprising key player, both by strengthening the multilateral approach and through bilateral relationships that will help Europe strengthen its competitiveness. For these political and economic reasons, we fully support your efforts to create conditions that will improve the system of relations between ourselves and Japan. However, we are not willing to begin negotiations unless the Council first involves Parliament in drafting the negotiating mandate. Although, formally, Parliament has the power to conclude the negotiation process by ratifying, or otherwise, any treaties that have been signed, it is equally true that parliaments throughout the world, due to their democratic legitimacy, have always been involved in drawing up the policies that underlie negotiating mandates. Europe needs to follow not only the letter but also the spirit of the treaties, so we call upon the Council, in this as in other cases, to duly take this into account. Finally, acknowledging the words of the Commissioner, we stress that it is imperative that Japan prove it wishes to break down tariff and especially non-tariff barriers that still dominate its domestic market. It is not therefore our intention to impede negotiations, but to assume responsibility for the growing demand within European public opinion, which fears that bringing together an open internal market such as ours with the increasingly closed markets of our main competitors will, in the end, damage our competitiveness and, with it, growth and employment. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are duty bound to acknowledge the positive elements in the Commission proposal on which, following the improvements proposed by the Committee on International Trade (INTA), we will be asked to vote. However, from a methodological point of view, I honestly do not agree with concluding at first reading a matter that will only become effective from 2014 onwards, and which divests Parliament of the power to exert its full potential on such an important issue. Looking at the substance, I believe that the positive elements in the new regulation are not fully compensated by the persistence of negative issues that adversely affect the interests of industrial sectors that have already been severely tested in Europe by a globalisation governed neither by multilateral rules nor by reciprocity. One positive aspect, however, is the new geographical coverage owing to the principle of differentiation, which provides a boost for the poorest nations. Equally useful is the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance, known as ‘GSP+’, linked to the implementation of the main international conventions on social, human and environmental rights. Also positive is the safeguard clause for the entire textile and clothing sector, as well as the general clause. However, the loosening of the financial criteria for the beneficiaries of the GSP+ regime and the exclusion from the graduation mechanism of nations that come under this scheme actually opens the door to unfair competition in relation to already heavily affected sectors, as I said, and gives priority to countries such as Pakistan, whose violations in the field of human rights must not be approved. In short, there is no doubt that this is a positive regulation, but the issues I mention cast a shadow over other aspects that we wished to consider. Gianluca Susta,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we speak of trade relations between China and the European Union, we evoke relationships which, on many occasions, have affected the course of history, as the pendulum has swung between East and West. The pendulum appears now to be firmly in the East. Europe seems to be labouring in China’s wake, as our second trading partner has seen its exports rise by 39.5% in just under two years. It is our loss if we view China only as a source of problems, as certain nationalist and protectionist elements on the political right have been trying to portray it for years, and not also as an opportunity. In the 21st century, however, the greatest world economies can work together only in an atmosphere of reciprocity, compliance with the rules, and intolerance of illegality, of unfair practices and of discrimination, to which we have grown accustomed after a great many absolutely unacceptable episodes. It is understandable that the pendulum of history is now swinging in favour of emerging countries. It is right that we open our markets. However, the Chinese Government has a number of unacceptable policies: protecting its country’s businesses while leaving our companies’ intellectual property inadequately safeguarded; the proliferation of technical barriers, sometimes much more burdensome than tariff barriers; keeping a closed procurement market; and an almost total disregard for the most basic social and human rights, as the oppression in Tibet shows. In the European Union, terms like ‘reciprocity’ and ‘traceability’ – which recall others, now long forgotten, like ‘transparency’ and ‘quality’ – must become a precondition for every trade agreement and every legislative initiative within the framework of a renewed multilateral policy. It is our duty, therefore, to keep our market open while protecting the Union’s interest from outside protectionism – from China and elsewhere – by demanding adequate quality standards for the goods and services available in the European Union market. This report addresses these matters with clarity, describes important solutions, and is heading in the right direction. It will therefore have our support. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I thank Mr Rinaldi for his broad-ranging report, which is worthy of support in political terms, and packed with ideal aims and practical proposals that will undoubtedly be looked upon with renewed hope by the people living on the shores of the Mediterranean after the revolutions that have taken place in their countries. We need a change of pace and a return to the spirit of the Barcelona Declaration in order to overcome the fragmentation characterising trade relations between the European Union and the Mediterranean countries. Only a short-sighted view of the EU’s strategic role could consider that a policy of greater integration with the countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean contradicts the EU’s western vocation. Trade governed by a balanced new free trade agreement could also represent an instrument of stability in a region criss-crossed by uprisings that have not yet perfected an approach to democracy, which also involves reducing inequality, strengthening production, better protection for civil and social rights, and commitment to avoiding Islamic fundamentalist tendencies. Of course, this does not just depend on us, on the European Union. It also depends on the tremendous difficulties of cooperation and integration experienced by the countries on the southern shores. However, to paraphrase a great writer, if the Mediterranean becomes a project once again rather than a state of affairs, together we can overcome the current political and economic obstacles that have prevented a good agreement being reached in the past. We need an EU initiative towards the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, to hold more in-depth talks about legislation with all countries in order to eliminate the excessive number of tariff and non-tariff barriers, and to open their markets up towards reciprocity, which means that a larger amount of aid must be tied to greater commitment on the part of our partners. In conclusion, I can only repeat my appreciation of this report and trust that the Commission will make it a priority objective of its political and administrative agenda. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the goals of the agreement are all highly commendable and it should therefore be adopted. However, we cannot forget the big social question that cuts across this sector: a trade that improves the quality of its product, offers fair prices and develops the industry cannot fail to bring about an improvement in the economic status and living conditions of 5.5 million smallholders and the 14 million workers who depend on cocoa production. Since the European cocoa industry is the biggest in the world, we must urge our processing companies to commit to fighting the exploitation of children and for a sustainable and fair cocoa supply chain. That is what this resolution sets out to achieve and that is why it deserves our support. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Mr President, the political importance of the convention under discussion today will be clear to everyone. The European Union is well consolidated, but a further process of integration within the confines of Europe and between Europe and the rest of the world on its borders is a prerequisite for strengthening this region in the new global balance of power. Once again, a modern framework for trade relations may be a useful point of compromise between those who believe that Europe should primarily have an Atlantic vocation and those who believe that a new balance of power in the Mediterranean is essential for building a democratic future for Europe. This convention brings together in an improved multilateral, if interregional, logic, all the different positions currently in force concerning the origin of goods traded with the participants in the Barcelona Process, the EFTA States, the Faroe Islands and all of the Balkan States participating in the Stabilisation and Association Process. By adopting a legal instrument of this kind, it will be easier in the future to have recourse to the pan-Euro-Mediterranean system of cumulation of origin, and therefore agree on preferential tariff treatment for Mediterranean goods, although the absence of a review clause and uniform provisions for the settlement of disputes must be lamented. Precisely for this reason, the convention may be an important element to help revive a process which began in Barcelona almost 20 years ago and to which various initiatives refer, some more convincing and effective than others, but all of them important, such as the Union for the Mediterranean, the trade road map agreed under the framework of that process. Ours is an ambitious goal, but a slow-moving one due to the imbalances that are still too strong between the two shores of the Mediterranean, the political instability that is still crossing the Middle East – which requires greater effort from the European Union to push Israel to respect the international agreements on the Occupied Territories – and on account of the uncertainties linked to the evolution of the Arab Spring in North Africa. These are all major outstanding issues, which require a strong political and diplomatic initiative from the European Union. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, the relevance to the EU of this agreement is more than just that of farmers in the south, although this is of course important. The southern shore of the Mediterranean will not develop peacefully or democratically if we retreat into autarchical nostalgia which could encourage the spread of anti-European sentiment on the African continent. Of course it would have been preferable to pursue a multilateral approach with the countries of North Africa, in order to avoid future inequalities. Nevertheless this agreement appears to be balanced. It does not threaten many of our traditional products. Quota restrictions on six out of the fifteen most sensitive products exported by Morocco will remain. New opportunities are opening up for some of our products and for those to which total liberalisation will apply. Finally, the safeguarding clause offers an additional protective mechanism in the event of serious damage. It is true, ladies and gentlemen, that this agreement does not resolve the ancestral issue of the Saharawi people. Every trade agreement needs to be accompanied by a courageous political initiative on the part of the EU to promote the values of liberty and justice in the world. However we cannot use the tragedy of the Saharawi people to safeguard a few individual sectoral economic interests. We can and must have the farsightedness of a trade policy vision that looks beyond its own immediate requirements – a vision that this agreement allows us to catch a glimpse of, and therefore I will vote for it.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of this report because, in these difficult times, a free and fair trading system based on principles of reciprocity and harmonisation within an enhanced multilateral framework is a fundamental prerequisite for development. We need to bring down customs duties, non-tariff barriers and protectionism, which is still too widespread, and not only in emerging countries. These are the most serious obstacles to creating an effective international trading system. Europe should be more aware of its role and should use its democratic, social, open model of political union to achieve stronger multilateral cooperation and bilateral agreements that are balanced, sustainable and respectful of civil and social rights. Europe, ladies and gentlemen, should play its role with authority, so as to eliminate distortions of competition by the main global players, and it should maintain the Generalised System of Preferences only to help lift the least-developed countries out of poverty. Such an approach will benefit our producers, workers and entrepreneurs, as well as those who look to Europe as a model for greater freedom and social justice in the world. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Mr President, as well as seeking to remedy its mistakes, Europe must also start investing in its future again. We have set ourselves an ambitious target: 75% employment for the 20-64 age group by 2020. However, just as it is inconceivable that only public expenditure will drive new investment for growth, there will be no new jobs if we do not stimulate private investment in innovative sectors and youth hiring; if more training - better training - is not carried out; if budget, fiscal, pensions and welfare policies are not harmonised across the EU; and if the labour market is not made to be more flexible, making contract negotiations more in tune with and proximate to the needs of businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, while also respecting fundamental rights. My vote in favour of the report by Ms Bastos is an act of faith in the EU institutions and in their ability – albeit late in the day – to pull the leading world economy out of the crisis without distorting the European social model. At the same time, however, the institutions must succeed in releasing the hidden energy reserves in Europe’s economy, which are hindered from reaching their potential and contributing to the much-needed growth of the European economy and the resolution of the sovereign debt crisis by bureaucratic inflexibility, the labour market and dumping within Europe.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we could sum up our debate by saying that, while Athens is weeping, Sparta is not rejoicing, in the sense that both Europe and the United States are going through a serious crisis, and both are struggling to come up with the solutions needed to overcome the crisis. The world is certainly sending some undesirable signals with regard to the approach we must take in order to relaunch the economy, with our focus being mainly on regulating the financial markets and, to a lesser extent, on the possibilities of developing the global economy. We have to move away from the debate between those in favour of economic rigour and those who support growth, because Europe and the rest of the world need rigour in the management of their public debt and public resources, but they also need to grow, and we need to be seriously concerned about the protectionist signals coming from the United States, from Argentina, from Brazil, with the introduction of new taxes, and from parts of the world such as the Mercosur countries, which are facing difficulties today. We must therefore pay a great deal of attention and understand that the world markets have to be extended, safeguarded and broadened, and that we have to eliminate barriers in order to encourage growth. Mr Caspary’s proposal was very interesting, and I think that as part of the logic of opening up world markets, we should have a far-reaching Marshall Plan, a new Marshall Plan for developing countries, so that they can compete with the major players that compete with us. On the same day that the House rejected President Obama’s plan containing the ‘Buy American’ provisions – which we oppose – the United States Senate passed a law on the issue of the yuan and the strengthening of the yuan against the dollar. These are also measures which must be seen in the context of a new way of managing world monetary policy. Alongside an open global trading policy, we need to safeguard EU interests, and we also need a new Bretton Woods agreement to define the world’s monetary framework. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of this package, despite the instructions of my group. I believe that in a seriously critical moment like this, the most important thing that Europe can do is to react with urgency to a demand that comes from its citizens. I therefore believe that this package does not go far enough, but it is absolutely necessary to continue down this road, strengthening the instruments of growth but bringing budgets under control and increasing regulation in order to enable development to be managed. Consequently, I think tomorrow is an important day for focusing on what has made the European Union the most important democratic institution at this time. Certainly, much remains to be done, but this is an important initial response, and we could not miss the opportunity, after years of discussion in which we failed to tackle the greatest crisis in our lifetime with the necessary urgency and firmness.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the future of our trade policy coincides with the future of European competitiveness itself. For years, we have justifiably pursued a policy of opening up our market – and perhaps we have been more generous to others than to ourselves – but the slowdown in the Doha Round, the resurgence of protectionist measures by several partners, including strategic ones, and the enterprise shown by emerging countries must lead us to reconsider the way in which we Europeans want to relate to the world. In this context, words like ‘reciprocity’ and ‘protecting European interests’ must become the litmus test to show whether what we are doing is right. We have to play a leading role and not a supporting one in seeking to conclude the Doha Round with a well-balanced global agreement, which is an essential condition for arriving at a free-trade agreement that really opens up the markets and, above all, creates equal opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises. Trade policy and economic governance go hand in hand in this world, and we are therefore calling for a new financial system and a new monetary and exchange rate policy, as well as a redefinition of trade protection measures.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, no one can deny the importance of closer trade relations between the European Union and Taiwan. Yet, surely they must be aware of the well-known and delicate question, which the Commissioner also mentioned, of institutional relations between the countries officially known as the Republic of China and the People’s Republic of China, with whom the European Union and all the Member States maintain steady diplomatic relations. Furthermore there is no doubt that the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement signed in 2010 between Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China will help to overcome the consequences of the territorial and political separation of ‘One China’ and will facilitate better trade discipline between the European Union and Taiwan. Trade relations between us and the fourteenth largest global trade partner, the European Union’s seventh largest trade partner, can only improve, even though they require new regulations to eliminate the current barriers, in particular non-tariff and linguistic barriers, of a market that is still locked in the multilateral framework of the World Trade Organisation, which Taiwan has been a member of since 2002. As I have already mentioned, however, the principle difficulties concern relations with the People’s Republic of China. While we must address the issue of maintaining a dialogue with all parties, yet politically recognise a ‘One China’, we must ensure that the two Chinas do not turn the current triangular trade into veritable triangulation which could put the European Union at a trade disadvantage, as has already happened with other East Asian trade partners such as Korea.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, almost 10 years have passed since the Doha Round began. In two months’ time we will be marking its 10-year anniversary, but it has still not achieved any results. The global setting has changed profoundly. Countries which were considered to be developing countries have now become emerging countries, and today those countries are emerging even to the point where they are able to put themselves forward as saviours of the European Union or of certain Member States. The rules of global trade need to be rewritten. Trade still has extraordinary potential to promote growth, better distribute wealth around the world and rebalance the North and South of the world. Within the multilateral framework, all of this has remained unchanged, but we need the chance to renew reciprocity between countries too, and we also need to launch and contribute a new process to strengthen democracy within the World Trade Organisation which is unable to function properly in its current form.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, any initiative that aims to promote our real economy at a time of serious crisis like the present must be thoroughly welcomed, especially when its goal is to make our businesses more competitive on the global market. I am grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Jadot, and to the other shadow rapporteurs for having delivered a report that singles out support for investment and makes it more transparent without increasing the already substantial number of administrative requirements imposed on SMEs. I hope that this agreement that we are adopting today, and which was concluded within the OECD, will be signed by other countries that are trade partners of ours in order to guarantee a genuinely level playing field for operators and to ensure that Europe does not suffer competitive disadvantages in a sector that accounts for 10% of world trade and which is therefore crucial to the overall growth of the European Union.

 Madam President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is at a turning point and this crisis could lead to situations that would imply the dissolution of the biggest political and institutional project of the tragic century that was the 20th century or, alternatively. a decisive step forward in the process of integration. It is worrying, therefore, to see governments asking to reduce Europe’s financial perspective or acting against the idea of amending the Treaty to strengthen the euro; it is worrying to see all these initiatives that do not aim to help the real economy but the financial economy – the dream of so many irresponsible people who continue to travel back and forth across Europe. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) also have to play their part in tackling new markets, offering new products, adapting to the whims of the global market, bolstering their capitalisation, investing in research and innovation and showing – as they already are – that in this changing world, nobody can reserve the role of bank of the world for themselves while making others function as their workshop. We are heading towards a world in which today’s emerging big players are capable of being both bank and workshop and will have to face the challenges – including social and environmental challenges – that this world will deliver to them and will also affect us. Our competitiveness, our ability to grow and simultaneously ring-fence employment and security largely depends on our SMEs’ ability to adapt. SMEs have much to gain from a new commercial policy, but to do so they must be strengthened, they must present themselves as consortia on world markets, and they must know how to work together to crack open new markets and meet growing demand, including in sectors that require the huge volumes which we have not been able to provide in the past. They must be supported when they have to defend themselves before the courts of third countries because their patents and trademarks are being violated. Europe and its Member States have certainly done a great deal, but the fragmentation of skills and the random distribution of resources in many countries has so far prevented SMEs from working effectively on an international scale, in particular – I would reiterate – when faced with the enterprise shown by our big global competitors. This is what we need to focus our attention and commitment on. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted for the reports, with the exception of Mrs Wortmann-Kool’s report, on which I abstained despite supporting my group’s amendments. Therefore I did not vote following the overall indications of my group, because I believe that we are facing such serious problems that we must at this point demonstrate the cohesion of European institutions and our ability to deal with the problems we are confronting. Despite a certain timidity and arrogance on the part of the Council with regard to this crisis, I believe we need to show this cohesion. I did not agree with the postponement either, because we are in a position in which we need to give our citizens urgent responses to the economic crisis, which is not just the result of financial speculation, but also of our inability to deal with the problems of recovery and growth. We have a duty to heal Europe’s public finances and we have a duty to set out responses, which have to begin with the involvement of businesses and the world of work, and have different and more open rules in order to complete the single market and be in a better position to compete on the global market. That is why I voted for the reports with the exception of Mrs Wortmann-Kool’s report. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I feel bound to note that a sense of fear and a need to defend European interests still prevail among some Members in this Chamber: in other words, they are on the defensive. As far as I am concerned, I believe that this agreement with a country with which we have a long-standing bond of friendship is important as long as it is entered into on the right basis, that of true reciprocity, and is a balanced and ambitious agreement. It should not be limited to the elimination of tariff or non-tariff barriers but should represent an opportunity to take a qualitative leap in the elimination of environmental and health policy differences, and I refer, in particular, to the farming sector, the protection of animal species at risk of extinction and particular economic extractive activities that have a significant environmental impact, such as asbestos mining and oil sands drilling, or that restrict access to medicines for the poorest countries. However, we must be positive in our attitude, not defensive like we were with Japan. I would therefore emphasise the need to improve reciprocity in terms of the protection of intellectual property, including trademarks, geographical indications and policies for the reciprocal promotion of bilateral investment, aimed principally at innovation and technology and inspired by the positions already taken in this field by the European Parliament. Madam President, I believe that the numerous bilateral agreements between Canada and the Member States are the best foundation on which to build a robust free trade agreement in the commercial arena, thanks to a friendship that we have already experienced in the UN, the G8, NATO and the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, a friendship based on the ideals of democracy and freedom that characterise Canada and the European Union.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this proposal for a regulation is worthy of support because it helps to simplify and harmonise the different laws in the Member States. The proposal sends out a signal that is in line with the Commission’s proposals on small and medium-sized enterprises and the strategies to stimulate European competitiveness in the manufacturing sector. The regulation also implicitly rewards product innovation and contributes to greater transparency in the process. However, I would point out that the compromise reached with the insertion of the review clause and the joint statement by Parliament and the Council on origin marking – the political significance of which is not lost on me – could set a precedent and compromise the outcome of the difficult negotiations between the Commission, Parliament and the Council on the complex issue of origin marking for non-EU products, which Parliament approved at first reading last October and which concerns non-textile products also. It is high time that the Council acknowledged once and for all the democratic will expressed here by the majority of MEPs. However, despite these concerns, we will vote in favour of the proposal for a regulation. Gianluca Susta,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, quite honestly, we do not understand why the majority of the Committee on International Trade were so adamant in wanting to put this matter forward for debate, only to then ask for it to be referred back to committee, a request that we reject. Both decisions are wrong; however, because of the time constraints, among other reasons, I intend to focus solely on the issue of merit, but only after voicing my full support for Mr Moreira’s speech. In this complicated world in which natural and man-made disasters are occurring all the time and in large numbers, we would be setting a dangerous precedent if we were to turn every humanitarian emergency into a review of trade policy. That is a slippery slope that could result in serious imbalances and, hence, unfair treatment of the poorest countries. Yet it is only through balanced, permanent and objective rules that those countries can reap the benefits of trade policy, which must not replace development cooperation. We know that any aid earmarked for Pakistan would not be used to help the people hit by the floods almost a year ago. We know with just as much certainty that it will be the European textile sector that mainly, if not exclusively, pays the price for this humanitarian aid. We cannot accept this unfair departure from trade policy rules because we are aware of the need to consider other factors, too, in our discussions. We all know that, as well as showing solidarity with Pakistan’s flood-hit populations, another fundamental reason for granting aid lies in the decision to support Pakistan’s counterterrorism efforts. The grey areas that have emerged in recent days between the Pakistani authorities and al-Qaeda, and the Bin Laden affair itself, show how unreliable that country is. I believe that we must focus attention on this, just as we must focus attention on the major human rights issues that have emerged lately. Gianluca Susta,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council’s request to open negotiations with Japan on the conclusion of a free trade agreement must be assessed very carefully. We therefore welcome the Commissioner’s cautious approach to this issue and we call on Parliament as a whole to follow that approach, which inspired our group’s motion for a resolution. The new Japanese Government has demonstrated – at least verbally – its willingness to open up its market, one of the most closed markets in the developed world. This positive attitude must be verified in practice, especially with regard to the 27 non-tariff barriers identified by the European Union, which must be lowered so that we can open negotiations with Japan and make them one of the priorities of our trade policy. We believe that improving these relations can help make Europe more competitive, since Japan accounts for 9% of world GDP, or over 35% when its GDP is added to our own. Today, however, we cannot adopt resolutions unless they make the opening of free trade agreement negotiations subject to specific, binding and verifiable conditions; namely, that there will be genuine reciprocity and a proper impact assessment. Firstly, Japan’s protectionist policy in the automotive sector concerns us, because there is an imbalance between exports and imports. Secondly, we wish to raise the issue of non-tariff barriers. I am talking about a whole range of standards, from health and plant health measures to technical standards – especially in the agricultural and automotive sectors – export subsidy rules, customs checks and factors allowing for counterfeiting and also triangular trade with China and Korea. To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, we ask that before Europe declares itself willing to open negotiations on the conclusion of a free trade agreement, it resolutely defines the Community interest that it intends to protect and specifies the areas in which it will request reciprocity from Japan. We hope that the Commission will take these comments of ours on board. Gianluca Susta,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on International Trade.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the economic and financial crisis has led many people to rediscover the central importance of industry. Despite your efforts, Mr Vice-President, the Commission has still not always realised that. A great many acts, of which the documents on the Europe 2020 strategy or certain free-trade agreements that have recently been approved or are under discussion will not be the last, are still biased towards the service economy and the strengthening and development of services, particularly in the financial, banking and insurance sectors. In contrast, the real economy is giving us opposite signals, as you have said. Production and exports are rising and we are witnessing a reversal of the trend for relocations. We must encourage these signals, since no great economy in the world can escape the central importance of industry. Hence, we need to complete the internal market and to speed up the implementation of strong initiatives in support of innovation and research, technology transfer, product traceability, protection of intellectual property and promotion of European production, not to mention effective rules against dumping and for true reciprocity in bilateral negotiations. This report is a step in that direction, and I am very grateful to Mr Lange and all those who have worked on it. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is wrong to have turned the debate on the Free Trade Agreement with Korea into a stand-off between supposed neo-protectionists and die-hard free-traders. I also think it is wrong for the Commission to have acted more like a service economy development agency than the political government of 500 million Europeans, which should strike a balance between considerations relating to growth on the one hand, and to employment and distribution of wealth on the other. What differentiates us from the United States, which has not yet ratified this agreement – and we know why – and this also applies to relations with Korea, is the very fact that no world economic power exposes its quality – and I stress the word ‘quality’ – manufacturing industry to inevitable dismantling processes, sacrificing it on the altar of financial interests, setting white-collar workers from the City of London against the white-coated workers of modern European factories, which is exactly what Europe does not need in the wake of the crisis. All this, Mr Sturdy, Commissioner, has nothing whatsoever to do with neo-protectionism. Otherwise we would have to include in this category the Spanish, German, Polish, Portuguese, French and Italian Industry Ministers who, in the 10 February edition of Le Monde
, reiterated the need to make Community interest central to the work of the European institutions, stating that in this case it definitely could not be protected by the safeguard clause, however worthy it may be. An excellent academic exercise in the field of international trade relations has taken place, but we have failed to act in Europe’s interests. For that reason ...

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it happens all too often that intellectuals or high-powered institutions in some countries refuse to understand the phenomenon of Italian terrorism, raising doubts about the trustworthiness of our judicial system. Since this is the legal basis for the refusal to extradite Cesare Battisti, we cannot but reject it. Cesare Battisti, an individual with something of an ambiguous past, is the product of a time in which thousands of young people – many of whom were desperately lonely – chose armed struggle as a means of political struggle and ended up turning the alienating utopian dream they believed in into a crime. Other countries have experienced similar tragedies but none have so far offered the protagonists of these any chances to reform, unlike Italy, which, in fighting terrorism, really cemented its sense of national unity. Taking up the appeal of the victims’ relatives, we therefore ask for Cesare Battisti to be brought before the Italian judicial system, which will know how to show – as it has done in hundreds of other cases of former terrorists who are now reintegrated into social and civil life – that to be punished is also to make amends, as the Italian, Cesare Beccaria, taught Western legal civilisation, and not just intimidation or brutalisation, as the Brazilian authorities fear.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I totally disagree with the last speakers. Personally, I find that this measure is harmful to the priorities of Parliament and is against the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon. We are about to conclude 70% of the agreements at first reading with the Council, but I fail to understand the rush to conclude such a sensitive measure as this at first reading since it concerns the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon, which has extended our powers, particularly on commercial policy. At the very opening of the anti-dumping procedures, we are changing from the objectivity of legal certainty to an intervention by Member States, which threatens to become the outcome of bargaining between the Commission and Member States. I therefore think it is a step backwards, as is automatic alignment without any time limits from the old comitology system to the present system in the agricultural field, which strengthens the role of Parliament. Therefore, I do not believe it is wise to rush into an agreement with the Council at first reading, because we also run the risk of disputes before the Court of Justice. Gianluca Susta,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Scholz for drafting this report, which establishes a financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised countries. It is right that this instrument is managed by the Committee on International Trade because, above all, it relates to cooperation with industrialised countries and emerging countries, so there is a certain difference compared to other instruments. First and foremost, I think it is necessary to emphasise the role of Parliament. We have lost too much time in a tug of war with the Council and the Commission on an obvious issue after the Treaty of Lisbon. We must defend the centrality of Parliament, in regard to both delegated acts and executive acts. Secondly, I think it important to underline the strategic importance of this whole game and, thirdly, the need to intensify collaboration with developing countries and emerging countries, without taking money away from the poorest countries. We must make an effort, within the budget of the European Union, to divert more resources to the poorest countries, bearing in mind that the problems with emerging countries are mostly to do with rules, rather than financing. In any case, innovation must also be supported, but with additional resources that have not been taken away from the poorest countries. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we have to be mindful of the crisis that the European Union and its Member States are experiencing on a global level. With a crisis that is hitting work, employment and growth, I wonder about the logic inspiring some European countries but, above all, the European Commission, in terms of international relations. The Commission proposal under discussion today will heavily penalise some industrial sectors, particularly textiles and, in a situation like the present one, we must ask ourselves whether it is reasonable. Some people fear that these decisions are borne from the desire for Europe to take a leading role on the world stage. In reality, we know that this is not so and that the attempt to reduce the pressure, including terrorist pressure, within or related to some political and institutional systems, has even less to do with it. The truth is that not even the recent flood has anything to do with this proposal, since the main concentration of the Pakistani textiles industry is not based in the regions hit by the disaster. The actual reason is that once more, the aim is to penalise a sector in favour of financing the European economy and to favour large-scale retail, rather than the interests of the manufacturing industry located in some European countries. This is profoundly mistaken in terms of growth, work and employment in a time of serious economic crisis and the need for real EU growth on global markets, in terms of its exports and its capacity for innovation and quality.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Muscardini, and all the shadow rapporteurs with whom I have worked on this issue, which is extremely important for us. I hope that tomorrow, the European Parliament gives the same strong backing to the legislative resolution that it gave in July 2006, with the written declaration of 2008, and the favourable vote on the resolution of 2009. We are preparing to adopt a measure that should protect the consumer, informing him or her of the origin of products for a more general purpose, which renews equality of opportunity in international trade and reciprocity between the European Union and its main competitors. It does not add costs for businesses in third countries, which are already obligated to mark their products in all our competitor countries in the world and in many others. Nor does it create any burdens for the European distribution system which, indirectly, without costing the public finances anything, favours the return to Europe of significant production, slows business relocation and also contributes to the fight against counterfeiting. It is a combination of very obvious advantages, which cannot be halted by calling perhaps for further measures because here, it really is the case that the best is the enemy of the good. We must come to the end of a process that began seven years ago, showing our concern for the interests of our businesses – above all, in this time of crisis and unemployment – but also for the potential for a trade system regulated so as to provide reciprocity, consumer protection and correct information which could be further developed in terms of traceability. If this measure is not voted through by Parliament, there will be trouble. I should like to thank the European Commission once again and all those who wish to support this measure, because it is helpful for European citizens and for world trade. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I think we must ask ourselves what we want as Europe, what we are calling for as Europe, and what commitments we intend to adopt in relation to this serious economic and financial crisis, the depression we have experienced around the world, and the difficult recovery that we are facing. In my view, a Free Trade Agreement at a time of such great difficulty for multilateral relations, when the Doha negotiations are at a standstill, should fulfil at least two major requirements. On the one hand, it should establish a truly level international playing field between us and the other competitors in world trade and, on the other, it should show the world the direction in which Europe wants its economy and development to go. This agreement is divorced from all that. It takes no account at all of the global context. It is on one side or on the other. It is simply a very cleverly produced Free Trade Agreement. It is an important conceptual document, and it would certainly be able to open up useful scenarios in a totally regulated world, a world in which reciprocity, common rules and common qualitative standards are the order of the day. The world is not like that, however. What we see, in fact, is that Europe’s manufacturing industry, on which it should build in order to create more development, more employment and more jobs, is being penalised, while once again, the financial services sector is being rewarded. In its positive aspects, this agreement has hardly any effect on increasing GDP; in the best case scenario, it will raise it by 0.03%. I do not see the need for it. After President Obama’s cautious overtures, even the United States is putting the brakes on now under pressure from at least 100 congressmen from the majority party, who have described this kind of agreement – similar to the one we are about to sign – as ‘job killing’. The ratification process in Korea is extremely slow and neither the ecological standards nor the social standards are guaranteed. Even so, we want to move towards ratification very fast. We must ask for one thing, however. We asked for it before in the preliminary stages through the vote that we cast then. There can be no provisional implementation of this Free Trade Agreement unless the safeguard regulation is adopted, and in this Parliament, we have introduced some important amendments that will enable us to address the subsequent stages more effectively.

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, ladies and gentlemen, as I am one of the last people to speak, I would like to offer you some words of comfort. In my opinion, you were right to point out here that you do not represent the governments, but Europe and the European Union itself: an affirmation that is obvious, though not for some, evidently. We therefore urge you to persevere in your role to ensure that the stable Presidency of the Union provides that encouragement, that backing, and forces the governments to turn their words into action. We welcome what has been achieved over recent months, the idea of the task force and also the fact that the Heads of State or Government were forced to draw up a significant document because, Mr President, the content of that document, if put into effect – although we are not really sure whether all of the Member States do wish to put it into effect – is certainly significant. For example, we do not know whether the statements in the final document on the taxation of financial transactions or on the tax on banks will actually become reality. We are waiting for the task force’s conclusions in order to see whether these effective instruments, in conjunction with the statements on economic governance, together with the statements on growth, are really an essential premise of our political action. We wanted the constituent process, which ended with the Treaty of Lisbon, in order to signal a change: we hope that the stable Presidency of the Union will insist – as Mr Van Rompuy underlined in his reply – that these words become reality.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you to the rapporteur, and also to the shadow rapporteurs, and to Commissioner Tajani, or should I say Vice-President Tajani, for the precise and accurate answers you have given us on key points. Eighteen years ago, the University of Barcelona carried out a study that concluded that the textile industry would have disappeared from Europe by the year 2000. It is now 2010 and this gloomy prophecy has not come true, and it has not come true for one simple reason: namely that the research and innovation developed in Europe and in countries that have maintained their manufacturing base – because they have not just acted as research centres, but as centres of applied research and industry – have ensured the production of new innovative fibres. Hence, the need for these regulations instead of a directive, to guarantee flexibility, protect consumers where labelling is concerned, and also to vouch for the country of origin. I believe, Vice-President Tajani, that it is worth imagining a future where we also have a European Monitoring Unit to protect health and safety, in other words, an authority to safeguard this originality. I believe that we must all agree on this positive aspect that has emerged from this report. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I listened with interest to the introduction by the President of the Council and the Vice-President of the Commission, and I have to say that I am not convinced by the conclusions. I am not convinced by the conclusions of the March European Council, because we are witnessing a decline, among some leading figures of European contemporary history, of the Community ideal and method. It is this that concerns us given what is happening in the world; rather, certain aspects concern us. The Greek affair is merely an illustration of what Europe ought to be, but is in reality not yet. Therefore, we call on the European Commission, on the Vice-President, who is standing in here for the President, and on the President of the Council, to adopt a strong political initiative, a legislative initiative: the Commission must set the agenda, and the Council must ensure that we do not trail in the wake of governments whose power and incisiveness is too often curbed by imminent electoral issues – yesterday in France and Italy, tomorrow in the United Kingdom and Germany – which paralyse the action of governments. Your role must be not only that of a facilitator, Mr Van Rompuy, but of a driving force behind this Europe, and we appeal to your democratic and pro-European sensibility to ensure that this new impetus will bring benefits for this Europe. It is no longer enough to set objectives; we need to define instruments. We agree on the objectives, just as we agreed on the Lisbon Strategy. What are the instruments, though? Do we want to end up with a federal budget – and to call it that – which equates to at least 2% of GDP? Do we want to bring into play Eurobonds, European investments and treasury bonds so that we can politically enhance this Europe, without which we will go nowhere? In essence, we need to know whether we are succeeding in defining the new Europe and whether we are succeeding in defining – through a new relationship between the European political forces within and outside this Parliament – the real distinction, the real boundary that exists within today’s Europe between conservatives and progressives, between those who want a more politically integrated Europe and those who, instead, want only an enlarged single market.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe’s ambition to remain the world’s largest economy must increasingly be linked to the revival of its competitiveness, to the quality of its manufacturing system and to its ability to conquer new markets. The fight against counterfeiting and commercial infringement plays an essential role in this context. However, the protection of trademarks, patents and intellectual property are not only non­financial instruments that make the system more competitive, they are also a tangible example of the application to the industrial economy of principles of a democratic legal culture founded on respect for the rules, for those rules which have been violated in past years under the force of international financial speculation. The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) is a fundamental instrument with which to combat counterfeiting, a phenomenon which yields incredible revenues of USD 500 billion per year, which has links with organised crime and which affects – indeed threatens – fundamental human rights such as health, if we only think of the counterfeiting of medicines. If we are to assess the need for ACTA, we must bear this international context in mind. On the other hand, we must call for this treaty to also respect certain basic, fundamental principles of coexistence inspired by respect for the rules. We cannot hide the fact that we are concerned about the legal basis of the treaty, about the negotiating mandate and its transparency. Those who represent, as this Parliament does, 500 million citizens, must be informed officially, not confidentially. The negotiators from the Commission must report back to this House on the state of progress of the work, and access to the documents and information must be provided so that a detailed opinion can be expressed. The difficult yet fruitful cooperation between Parliament and the Commission can help the European Union to realise its potential in the best possible way. The resolution is along these lines and, as such, it is worthy of our vote. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important opportunity to reaffirm, above all, the importance of the Generalised System of Preferences. Both the basic GSP system and the GSP+ system, which are both linked to the ‘Everything But Arms’ initiative, contribute to reducing poverty, in strict accordance with the primary obligation of ensuring respect for human rights. It is the violation of these basic principles of coexistence that recently led the European Union to withdraw Sri Lanka’s preferential tariff benefits following a detailed investigation by the Commission. The new institutional framework must, however, fully include Parliament in the legislative process aimed at modifying the legislation in force. We therefore hope that it will include a complete review of the regulation, in accordance with the ordinary procedures, since it has several shortcomings, including on the very subject of investigations. The next step will be the joint resolution. The effectiveness of the regulation depends on its credibility, the objectiveness of the criteria upon which it is based and the strictness with which it is applied. In a Europe in which the vast majority of citizens do not agree with exporting democracy at gunpoint, trade and trade­related aid are essential vehicles for disseminating principles of coexistence based on respect for fundamental human rights. It is our duty not to lapse into indifference – which would be wrong – but also to avoid making hasty judgments about certain parties, judgments which sound like irrevocable sentences, as is the case with Colombia. This is why I do not feel able to support what are almost one-sided inflexible attitudes to one country or another, but I do strongly support the need for enhanced monitoring of all of the problematic situations, in the spirit of the legislation in force and according to the principles of the rules on which we want to base the legislative review that we are demanding.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, new players have emerged out of the wings onto the world stage, some of which were actually considered developing countries not long ago. This must change our approach, cultural and otherwise, towards free trade and the tangible manifestations of the relationship between the European Union and its major competitors. This relationship is currently mediated by certain magic terms that have not yet entered into the vocabulary of the European Commission. These terms are reciprocity, European interest, the fight against dumping and the fight against tariff barriers. This is the background to the free trade agreement with Korea, which incidentally confused two Commissioners – the Commissioner for Internal Market and Services and the Commissioner for Employment – and some governments. What are the real advantages of this bilateral agreement, when 50% of the trade between the European Union and Korea concerns the automotive sector, when the disparity between the 700 000 Korean cars exported to us as opposed to the 27 000 European cars imported by Korea is glaringly evident? What is the sense in providing indirect aid of approximately EUR 1 600 for each Korean car sold in Europe when some European governments find it difficult to provide incentives for buying and selling cars to stimulate consumption? How can we also fail to take into account the serious doubts over the textile and electronics industries? We will not settle with hearing for the umpteenth time, Commissioner, as Mrs Ashton said before you, that there are advantages for our chemical, pharmaceutical or agrifood industries because these pale scandalously into insignificance compared to the consequences for textiles, electronics and, above all, for cars, or financial services. Could it be that Europe, even with the crisis we are in today, is yet again choosing the financial option for its development? We all welcomed the birth of the new Europe in Lisbon with hope. Europe cannot however, fail to take responsibility for European interests in the world, particularly today. The United States is jumping through hoops to defend Boeing against Airbus and the Argentinean Government is threatening to expropriate Telecom. The agreement with Korea actually legitimises pass-through financing with China which, until now, was illegal. This is the scenario in which our major businesses are forced to operate. Behind them are hundreds of thousands of workers, of families who can see their future going up in smoke, not because they are producing poor quality services or goods but because poorly defined interests are allowed to prevail over more evident and objective interests. We trust in your sensitivity, Commissioner, in the hope that you will avoid over-hasty ratifications, which could go hand in hand with unacceptable decisions over the provisional application of the commercial side of the agreement pending ratification, or at least decisions that will be unacceptable until the regulation on the bilateral safeguard clause has been clearly defined. The adoption of this clause is subject to the ordinary legislative procedure that should be considered a first step to any appraisal of the advisability … (The President cut off the speaker) Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

President of the Commission, the progressives among us are giving you a vote of confidence today so as not to leave you open to the blackmail of those who have little faith in this community of Europe and so as not to subordinate you to the governments of the Twenty-Seven. Believing in a community of Europe means breaking your deafening silence and taking up a central role in the major international issues; defending European interests in the industrial and economic arena; reinforcing social policy and investing more towards conquering world poverty; consolidating our alliance with the United States but on equal terms; reinforcing the position of the European Union in international bodies, beginning with the UN Security Council; relaunching multilateralism in world trade; and setting the agenda in the fight against global pollution. Our vote today will be a conditional vote of confidence, with no exceptions, in the Commission and in the individual Commissioners, in order fully to achieve the new Europe born in Lisbon, a political player among the major world powers, and so that it can be, above all, a community of destiny dedicated to its own economic and civil progress, and which sets itself a mission of peace, justice and freedom in the world; one that is not solely a community of memory, living in the present off its own wealth and off a past glory that is now faded.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Zapatero, thank you for the great commitment you are making during this parliamentary term regarding the items you have announced, even though this is no longer the time to list all the useful items, but to make practical efforts to revive Europe. We need to end this period of defining institutional structures and to face the major issues which still prevent Europe from being able to compete on an equal footing with its international partners. We need to know whether the European Union will be able, one day very soon, to have a seat in the United Nations, whether it will be able to have a seat, as the European Union, at the G20, whether it wants greater fiscal and social harmonisation, and what resources it wants to put into the European economic circuit so that it can truly do what its other international competitors have done. We need to come here – and I say this also to President Barroso – with concrete measures to revive Europe, because, in six months’ time, we will not see the same results as we have seen previously with other previous experiences. We would also like to know whether the time has finally come when, as Kissinger would say 30 years ago, the major world leaders know which telephone number to call when they need to speak to someone in Europe, and do not just contact the Member States. At stake is Europe’s dignity as it emerges from the Treaty of Lisbon, but also the European social model, that fundamental democracy which we Members of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament strongly demand and on which we want the future well-being of our citizens to be based.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I certainly do not intend at this time – even with the time available to me – to go back over all of the reasons behind the repeated request that we, as Parliament, are making. I would point out – and you yourself have already made this point, Commissioner – that Mrs Muscardini and I are the only two veterans of 2006, of the signing of the resolution with which this Parliament endorsed the initiative of the then Commissioner Mandelson in December 2006. We hoped that the initiative that you undertook a few weeks ago to make small changes in order to achieve a compromise could have been supported more strongly, including within the Article 133 Committee. Among other things we regret that, within that committee, many countries reiterated their opposition or misgivings, including the United Kingdom, via its representative. All that we want to do today is to remind you that this request is not about protectionism; it is not industries that are no longer able to compete on the international market that we want to defend, but consumers: we want to draw attention to the theme of health, the environment and genuine reciprocity on the world market, which is lacking today. Moreover, it is not only lacking with regard to the weakest subjects in the world: no, it is also lacking with regard to Japan, to the United States, to Australia, to Canada, to Brazil, to India, to the main competitors of the European Union, which has a duty, in these economically difficult times, to defend the Community interest, which is also behind this request. We therefore hope that Parliament will throw its full weight behind the initiatives that the Commission provides and we also hope that the commitments made a few weeks ago will be fully honoured, even if this procedure cannot be wound up by Christmas but under the new procedure introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the time has come for this House to stop the endless debate on the Treaty of Lisbon, which we have still heard going on today. I believe that we must respect the wishes of this Parliament, of the great European countries, of the 27 and of the 26 that have ratified this treaty in various forms, but democratically, and thus the offences to the treaty and its democratic content must also be rejected. I also believe that the Council meeting at the end of the month will be an important opportunity to reaffirm the need to revive the idea of Europe beyond Lisbon and to revive the economy, as well as to ensure that Europe does not back down over the major issue of climate change. From that perspective, I believe that what we have heard lately from the President-in-Office, but also what we have heard today, is insufficient. Europe beyond Lisbon is failing to interpret the strong content of the new treaty and is failing to comply with the terms of the Lisbon Agenda. Therefore, if we 500 million Europeans want to remain the world’s biggest economic power, a power that is preparing to become a major political player on the international stage, I urge the Commission to fully carry out its mandate of proposing European legislation on the major issues relating to the economy, the economic recovery and the labour market recovery, and I urge the Council to turn a long list of headings into an actual policy to help resolve the economic difficulties. This is what I believe we are lacking. We are lacking a major economic recovery plan, we are lacking in major areas such as the revival of the infrastructure policy with Eurobonds, and we are lacking a high-profile European approach. This is what we expect from the European Council at the end of the month. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, people who seek to label as anti-Italian, subversive and communist anyone who calls for a set of rules on communication and freedom of information that respects pluralism, and which is characterised by a clear separation between the fortunes of those who assume important institutional responsibilities and the wealth they derive from entrepreneurial activities in the publishing and information fields, are making a serious mistake, which must not be forgiven, justified or allowed here in Europe. Not once in our speeches have we mentioned the Italian Prime Minister. We could have referred to the number of newspapers he owns: 150 in Italy; and around 40 television channels. That is not the problem, however. The problem is that pluralism of information – and in information – is a cornerstone of every free democracy and must be used as a defence against every monopolistic and oligopolistic philosophy and against conflicts of interest. The sovereignty of each State, the reaffirmation that the European Union is not a superstate, Commissioner Reding, must not make us forget that the European Union also has a Charter of Fundamental Rights from which stems a legislative system that the Member States cannot ignore. You know that, on these very issues, many times the Court of Justice – in the case of Italy, not on issues to do with the system, Mr Speroni – has passed sentences that are still to be carried out. Globalisation of the markets and the ever-increasing use of the airwaves now require more targeted European legislation to regulate this sensitive matter, which has such a strong influence on public opinion and therefore also on the principle of popular sovereignty – which underpins the European Union and not just the Italian Republic – and on the ways in which this principle is exercised. It should no longer be possible for anyone to invoke the sacrosanct rights of the popular majority to justify threats to freedom of the press in what was, until recently, a situation of disparity between the plaintiff and the defendant – whether in Italy or in Portugal, as we were reminded earlier – because this undermines the foundations of the rules of coexistence on which the Union is based. This is why there is an urgent need for a directive against concentrations in the field of information that will regulate the dealings of those who are involved in politics and, at the same time, control very important media.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have welcomed the work done during this period in which Mrs Ashton has been carrying out her role as Commissioner. I must say that we have had a better relationship with her than we had with her predecessor, despite their common political affiliation, which we too share, and their common nationality. However, this time I do not share the Commissioner’s enthusiasm on this issue, because too often in recent years, the Commission has taken the floor here and talked up certain initiatives, only to then pursue a different path. We are going through a particular moment in time, a major economic and financial crisis, which is also the result of a lack of reciprocity in the world, not only with developing countries – which has its own logic, its own explanation – but with the new global players and the traditional global players. Too often I seem to sense a lack of awareness within the Commission, by its President and its Commissioners, of which initiatives should be implemented to aid the recovery of European industry, the recovery of the European manufacturing industry. It seems to me that this agreement – which, admittedly, is a positive agreement and has extremely positive content – has more of an academic value; it is almost a textbook treaty, but one that is not in touch with reality. We export USD 30 billion to Korea, only USD 20 billion come back in the form of cars exported from Korea to Europe, and USD 1.5 billion will be the indirect aid that accrues to Korean cars in Europe, without mentioning the textile and other sectors. That is a definite imbalance, which I believe must be highlighted and must be corrected, before the green light is given to a free trade agreement that penalises European industry. Ours is a quality industry that has committed itself to the new requirements that innovation calls for, certainly not a bankrupt industry that cannot get to grips with the need for innovation that exists within the economy.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, like many of my colleagues, I would like to ask the Council what its real intentions are in the light of this proposal. Do you want to reduce everything to a minimum and freeze the future? And is this the same Europe that will supposedly be relaunched with Mr Van Rompuy’s document on integration? Where is the consistency between Mr Van Rompuy’s two policy documents? Where is the consistency, from the point of view of ordinary citizens, between the measures announced in July on employment and growth, those great calls for hope and for the future of the EU that we heard from the Council, and this sudden violence done in the name of realism, aiming for mere survival? With these figures and these cuts how can we implement cohesion and the agricultural reforms in terms of concrete actions? These are sincere questions that require a clear and honest answer, because there is evidence here of a type of institutional schizophrenia that Parliament and the citizens can no longer tolerate. Parliament wants consistency and credibility. The very first criticism that can be levelled is that the budget just does not add up. So much for growth and investment: this is the 2008 budget over again! Of course it must be conceded that Mr Van Rompuy, in heading 1a, overturns the quite scandalous suggestion by Cyprus. He also recognises the essential role of the budget in offering support to growth in some sectors, additional to the support offered by the national budgets. But growth and innovation – clearly – should not be achieved at the expense of other sectors that also contribute to ‘growth’ and ‘employment’, such as cohesion policy, but also agricultural policy, which has created jobs and is ever more focused on innovation and protection of rural areas. ‘Growth’ and ‘employment’ also mean culture, training, the transnational networks, the Connecting Europe Facility, as well as solidarity and international development, human rights in the world and our contribution to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. What we are seeing however is the usual Council spectacle: no vision, no leadership, a Babel of conflicting and competing national interests, an inextricable tangle of vetoes, aspirations and general discontent. Unfortunately what is mainly missing is Europe! Patrizia Toia,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today Europe is being asked to perform a new task of industrial policy coordination, and even the most ardent supporters of the freedom of private initiative are calling for this role to be carried out. Without more Europeanisation of national strategies, particularly in terms of job protection, the current crisis will not be resolved and there will be no economic recovery. The automotive crisis is not just about overcapacity: it is about widespread job losses. The crisis now seems to be structural and concerns the very future of the automotive sector as we know it today. We want to have an automotive industry in Europe and do not want to squander the skills, know-how and professional expertise that exist. We are therefore calling for a major restructuring and regeneration project to be launched swiftly so that the costs do not escalate disproportionately. Restructuring cannot only derive from fragmented decisions by national governments and individual companies. We at least need to try to join forces and guide this painful process at EU level, making the interested parties sit down at the table for a dialogue between the social partners, manufacturers, trade unions and governments in each country, offering support for research, innovation, training, upskilling and the necessary funding. I know that this will be an arduous task, because the national interests of individual companies are not the same. However, since competition within the European Union is highly ambiguous and at times risks being unfair, I believe that ultimately it is in the interests of all countries to have effective EU guidance and stimulus, so that together we can face the increasingly aggressive global market.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the energy crisis has taken and is continuing to take its toll on employment, on the thousands of short-term, temporary and permanent workers in this sector. The major steel conglomerates are increasingly pivoting towards the Far East or the American continent, which raises a question over the direction of our development model. I believe that Europe should resurrect the idea that a manufacturing sector such as ours needs a solid production base, able to supply the European internal market. We must therefore defend this sector and the role of a stable steel industry, and we must support it, Commissioner, if we want to halt the industrial decline. I think we need to move away from the dualism – which has not emerged here this evening, but which is often heard in discussions about this sector – between those who campaign to protect the environment and workers, which is misguided because it does not show us the way forward. An industry in which steel is considered to be an integral part needs the latest production systems, concrete and balanced solutions, which safeguard the various interests, the various requirements. Therefore, we need a strong European plan focusing on sustainability – on which we should never turn our backs, in my opinion – as a source of real added value, with which we can compete in the world, supporting investments, as several parties have already said, new technologies, new processes and upgrading our plants; a European economy that makes efficient use of its resources, including energy, indeed starting with energy and the search for new materials.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a budget is the programme and charter of an institution since it shows what it is, what it does and above all what it intends to do in the future. We are faced with a crucial choice between a budget for mere survival or subsistence – with a little less for everyone – or a courageous budget with selective decisions, with investment in job creation, innovation, youth, in other words in the future of the European Union and its development role. It must be emphasised that, as has been stated very clearly by Mr Kalfin among others, today Europe can do what the individual Member States cannot do for the economy, for regional development and for the regions – where social cohesion will either be strengthened or die – in other words, for the lives of the very citizens we mentioned. The great European choices are today in danger of being suffocated by accounting-based disputes – within the Council and elsewhere – between net beneficiary countries and net contributors. It should be underlined that this as a false problem, because it is easy, taking account of what happened in the past, to demonstrate with figures and numbers, rather than with words, that the contributor countries actually gained, often more than the others, from the convergence of economies and growth. The Council is currently working to add figures to the various headings. The war of positions has started: statements, stances taken by certain countries that view the budget as a mere expense item to be cut mercilessly, and even used to appease anti-European sentiment, easy to fuel at a time of crisis. This is a mistaken position that does not help the integration that we are struggling to achieve in other areas. As many of us have pointed out, our Europe is still incomplete and imperfect. We adopted a stability plan that was supposed to include development, but we have stabilised so much that we are in recession. Let us at least take the opportunity offered by this budget and this multiannual financial framework to make choices that go in the right direction. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I just wanted to add my voice to the plaudits this report has garnered from the House in relation to the need to strengthen the European Union’s standing as a place where it is possible to invest, produce, and produce in line with our conception of an economy that is inclusive as well as socially and environmentally sustainable. I think a number of parts of this measure are really helpful, while others could be added. I do think it is important to grasp this opportunity and work even harder to enhance our attractiveness through regional marketing policies and openness, which represent the region’s proposition for a productive, industrial, manufacturing and services economy that, as it originates in the region, is respectful of the environment. This regional approach together with EU policies along the same lines are what we need to attract investment and growth. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the initial comments on the European Council, now the time for simplistic interpretation has begun, which is a mistake because important progress was made. For example, the destructive link between banks and public debts has been broken and we have a plan – albeit a weak one – on employment and jobs. The European institutions seem once again to be infused with a spirit of resurgence and renewed progress towards political unity, after so much slowness and dragging of feet, and a desire for real progress towards greater integration. In this vein, yesterday saw a display of real unity between Parliament and the Commission. There were no winners or losers, but an undeniable, new institutional and political vitality compared to the diarchy of the past, which was the negation – the very antithesis – of the European spirit. Many countries showed initiative and a desire to act, not to create new, exclusive alliances, but to build a shared consensus that is respectful of all Member States. This is the path towards political unity, without which any form of banking, fiscal or monetary unity will be totally inadequate. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, water is increasingly being seen as a public asset, a precious resource for the whole of humankind. It is vital, therefore, to develop an integrated, efficient strategy for the wise use of this finite resource. Measures at EU level must address our continent’s current and future water challenges, and therefore the ‘Blueprint to safeguard Europe’s water resources’ to be published in November is more important than ever to ensure – as has been said – sufficient availability of good-quality water for sustainable and equitable use. I regard this as an important aspect of the EU 2020 strategy. Water is linked to food or, rather, water is part of food, and a small amount of food contains a huge amount of water, so a water strategy is also a strategy to ensure food security for Europe and the world. Water can lead to wars, but it can also be a factor for development and peace; I therefore strongly support the proposal contained in the report to devote 1%, for example, of water tariffs to decentralised cooperation measures and growth projects around the world. I hope this legislation, which already exists in some Member States, will spread like good practice to other countries to become law in all the Member States of the European Union.

 I support this report because it is essential to attract new investors to the EU market. This is only possible through measures such as project bonds and far-reaching reforms such as the cohesion policy reform that we will adopt in 2013. Ambitious territorial development policies will allow the EU to maintain its high-quality human capital and foster an open and fair business environment as well as investment in research and innovation for successful products and business models, for the benefit of Europe’s economy and society. The promotion of a strong industrial base needs to be put at the centre of reforms, particularly in those areas where the EU has traditionally been strong, as well as in high-tech sectors where a strong industrial base is essential to develop innovation in products, processes and services and to create new jobs. In a context of economic recovery, it is necessary to adopt ambitious legislation for SMEs by simplifying regulations and strengthening access to finance, promoting effective capital systems (venture and angel), and enhancing the role of private and public equity investments in financing long-term corporate growth. Parliament’s commitment will be maximal. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even though our budget is limited, a year’s budget adds up to a figure that can be wasted by the markets in a single day. The multiannual financial framework (MFF) is very important but only if the Member States do not see the budget as a source of expenditure to be cut like all public expenditure, but rather as a resource which can help the economy to grow – an investment – and not as a cost for citizens but as the way to produce tangible results. The figures represent programmes, projects, things to be achieved. Therefore, I say ‘no’ to short-sighted cuts and ‘no’ to infighting between countries, because growth is an opportunity for all European citizens. In addition, the European budget should not be seen as separate, but as complementary to national budgets. A new approach is needed to strengthen links between the European budget and national budgets. In some ways, our budget is the 28th budget of the Member States. This is the only way we can create the global assets that can develop effective policies. We are asking for a more coordinated approach. The European Semester can also help with this. Finally, as regards Parliament’s role, I say this to the Council: we will accept neither a fait accompli 
nor a ‘take it or leave it’ approach. We want a preliminary consultation before the formal proposal is presented for approval. Citizens, worried about the future of Europe, express themselves through us and we, as their representatives, want to play a part in taking decisions. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say a big thank you to Ms Podimata and to all those Members who have worked hard so that we could hold today’s vote. This proposal has an inescapable logic and its basis is clear, robust and fair, if it is possible to use this latter adjective in relation to the economy. Not even the objections raised today undermine this logic, and the understandable concerns voiced over the possible counterproductive or undesirable effects – if made in good faith – can potentially be answered and resolved, as shown by the debate over the last few months. Of course, solutions to avoid undesirable effects exist, as long as there really is the will to establish this tax, because sometimes one has the feeling that caution is called for just to slow or block the approval process, with predictions of economic catastrophes. On this point, I would address Ms Ford: have we not already experienced these catastrophes thanks to harmful and reckless speculation? Mention has also been made of difficulties, but today, Europeans are calling on the institutions to recover the ability to carry out their general role and to equip the world of finance with precise rules, since this is our duty and this is our sovereignty as a body with a general nature. Therefore, let us make the right choice today, one which the citizens will welcome. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, development is not a luxury but a duty. Today, growth is a universally acknowledged priority. Yet this was not the case until recently, and my group can be rightly proud of having consistently pressed on this matter, in calling for some significant changes to the focus of European policy. As has already been mentioned, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) – which are the productive backbone of the economy – need not only the urgent interventions that will be discussed later but also long-term measures to cultivate the human capital of the young men and women of Europe. These measures must send them the message that a business-oriented outlook and a spirit of enterprise mean more than a career or a question of personal success or adventure. Indeed, these attitudes are also useful to society, because they help to create – through a model of development based on widespread enterprise – the conditions for fairer and more sustainable growth, as Ms Krehl has already said. For we want to see development that is innovative, and that is both able to seize all the new opportunities and sustainable in environmental and social terms. As regards the long-term efforts, in terms of training, I would also advocate revisiting technical colleges, which are a real asset in Europe, one that we have neglected for too long. These are a great resource and a great way of learning about science and technology, and therefore of getting a taste for creating something new through your own ingenuity. As for resources, while still on the subject of urgent action – and I address these remarks especially to the Commission but also to the Council, which together with Parliament, must make a decision on the Structural Funds Regulation – it will be essential to coordinate resources. Shall we be able to use the Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs (COSME) funds (the financial instruments for SMEs), the research funds and the Structural Funds in a complementary approach? If we use these resources wisely, in a complementary fashion, then we shall be able to get the most from them; otherwise, we shall risk spreading them too thinly. The Structural Funds are indispensable, and they are intrinsically focused on this priority. Nevertheless, Commissioner, while recognising the importance of thematic concentration, I believe that it is also important that the regional authorities should be able to contribute to the planning and decision-making process, because while it is true that many regions need guidance, many others are quite capable of planning and setting priorities. The regions are key, for they are the engine room of progress, of business growth, of the spirit of new employment, and of the desire to participate, including on the part of all the economic, social and community bodies. Hence, the regions are the main resource where EU policies and the policies of the local authorities must come together. I must emphasise, then, the importance of coordinating resources. And finally, as regards the definition of SMEs – a subject on which the Member States will have their say, and therefore the Council will need to as well – in my view, what counts is not only the structural elements – employment and turnover – but also the quality of the small and medium-sized enterprises, which operate locally but think globally. I therefore ask that special consideration be given to the fundamental nature of small businesses and their support network. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, when we speak about good examples for our citizens, when we speak about the internal market and the possibility of creating genuine, concrete opportunities for changes in everyday life through the working of the internal market, we can truly use this example – and we obviously have need of many others – as a fruit of our labours. It is a good example because, as was said, it has an impact on citizens’ real lives, on their daily lives. It also helps businesses to expand their market, not because charges are high and services reduced, but because they can increase their service offering and, in substance, it also helps the economy as a whole. That is why I believe that it is, without doubt, a positive example, a good example. Yet you will have realised, Commissioner, that there is a widespread desire in this House; in particular, let us recall the speeches of two of my colleagues, Ms Riera Madurell and Mr Goebbels, not to mention many others, who would like this good example to become the best possible example, and would like us to move towards a zero-cost roaming outcome. Such an outcome is possible, and this measure partly anticipates that. Are we wishing for utopia? No. We are not, because an internal European market implies that domestic and non-domestic tariffs should be similar. There is no longer differentiation if we speak of the single market and, above all, because there is no technical justification for an increase in charges. I remember when, in 2007, we began to discuss voice roaming charges, the first of the trio that we have now tackled. There was a certain incredulity and also certain difficulties; not, however, on the part of the Commission, and here I must give the credit to your predecessor, Ms Reding. The difficulties were quite wide-ranging. They came from those who said that a true market did not allow for tariffs to be regulated, that there were political prices to pay, that they belonged to an old idea of the left, et cetera, et cetera. There were those who said it would not work and so on, that it would put a brake on the market. In the end, however, we have done it. The interests of citizens and establishing that these were not justifications for increased charges have made it possible. That is how the world moves on, and things are becoming, let us say, ever more possible. That is why I think an even more courageous outcome is achievable. A concluding remark on why it is not possible to do otherwise. Today, we had a visit from a delegation of Tunisian citizens; I do not know if they are still here. Perhaps one of its many benefits is that this extension to outside the EU will make us understand that the opportunity of using phones without the bugbear of charges will also aid democracy.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I want, first and foremost, to express my very sincere appreciation for Mr Giegold’s work on this own-initiative report. I also recall that we share with him and with others an active presence in Parliament’s Social Economy Intergroup. My political group, as you know, believes that the social model is one of the fundamental characteristics of the European integration project. Therefore, this is not just a simple policy, or one of many; it is a policy that characterises our entire project. In this day and age, with the attacks relating to the need for public spending cuts as well, we still firmly support this priority. We know that it may be as a revised or modified social model, but we believe that it should be retained, defended and reaffirmed as a priority. Therefore, I believe that, in this same vision, we must also promote business entities, such as cooperatives, which produce goods and services and have a very special role in the so-called European social economy. These businesses reassert the fact that it is possible to be productive, to do good things, to be efficient even if the goal is not profit but rather, for example, employment, welfare, labour development and contributing to the life of the local community. This is why it is important – I am finishing here, Madam President – for Europe to make the appropriate instruments available for an active policy and make a good statute – not the one that exists now, which is unusable, but a good statute for cooperatives which can be a way to help this very important sector.

 Mr President, I too applaud the positive outcome of the transitional period, and hope that a definitive solution will be found in the financial programming that will deliver a stable, definitive and rapid response to a real need, which is unfortunately growing, because the number of poor people, the new poor, in Europe is continuing to rise. New areas of the population that were formerly self-sufficient now do not have enough food to live on, and food is a primary basic right. These are poor workers, single mothers with children, and people suffering from invalidating illnesses. The spectre of hunger has once again raised its head in civilised Europe. I believe that we cannot remain indifferent, just as we cannot support the reasons of those – including many of our colleagues, unfortunately – who think the responsibility should lie first and foremost with the Member States, that we should focus on nutritional education, and so on. In my view we should first of all take this action and then abolish food subsidies, not the other way round. Luckily, however, outside Parliament, Europe is made up of young people, volunteers, associations and political groups that want this House to deliver more fairness and solidarity in Europe. This is what we are working towards. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Internet applications and services still have great potential both for the economy and for a more informed and inclusive society. Now that the telecoms package is being transposed into national legislation, there is a risk that the European framework may become fragmented. The Commission’s monitoring role will therefore be important. I would also say that the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) will have an important part to play, and some of us would have liked it to have been stronger during the drafting of the telecoms package as well. The priorities that we want to emphasise in this debate are: a guarantee of net neutrality, development of broadband infrastructure and of more open software, security of access and interoperability of systems, promotion of the use of digital technologies throughout industry and the services sector, production of digital content and new services, inclusion of people who are currently excluded – I am thinking of people with disabilities, amongst others – and support for pluralism in information provision and culture. It should also be laid down and guaranteed that operators cannot adopt blocking or throttling practices or discriminate against users and that they should ensure the utmost transparency in their commercial offers and in all their business activities. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this year and the next are crucial to the future and unity of Europe. The work programme should therefore be included more fully in this framework of exceptionality, which certainly means focusing on key objectives, giving more concrete efficacy to our actions, concentrating investments towards those bodies which can, in turn, put into action other private resources, but also, as my colleague has said, seeing the Commission – President Barroso, if I could just have your attention for a moment – playing a more active role, which is better directed towards the reality of certain countries and of the entire euro area and of the whole of Europe. We hope that the Commission will take on this role, and I say this even as a representative of a country which, at this moment, is changing its government; which is not a technocratic government but rather a technical government that demonstrates not the rejection of political forces and politics but, if anything, the generosity – and I say this as a force that was in opposition in my country – of parties that are ready to do what is useful for the country even without direct representation. I believe that the theme of stable and equal growth should regard the theme of supporting businesses in two ways: access to credit and innovation. The Commission and Europe are capable of achieving this in a concrete way. When we recapitalise and help to recapitalise banks, even, perhaps, with public support, we should demand that this credit go to the real economy – first and foremost to the real economy. When Horizon 2020 becomes one of the main dossiers, we should initiate wide-scale research on innovation for enterprises, whether these be large or small. The chapter on the digital agenda is also very important because the creation of this unique market will be of great help to society. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D
),

The favourable outcome of the vote concerning the resolution on the situation in Egypt and Syria, with particular regard for Christian communities, is confirmation of the fact that Europe continues to look after ethnic and religious minorities. Unfortunately, the situation has now become even more worrying due to a trail of blood and death, in Egypt above all, but also elsewhere in the world, which the European institutions cannot ignore. Parliament is alive to this and intends to take action to ensure that such episodes are not repeated. There is no use in denying that tension exists between Muslims and Christians, but stopping there would only afford a partial view of the situation. History teaches us that religions can coexist, as long as the climate is right. The current difficulties are worsened by hidden troublemakers, who fan the flames to deepen the conflict and impede the transition to democracy. We need to clarify the role of the armed forces in this phase, as they have all too frequently turned into the agents of repression, rather than guarantors of transition. We appeal to the representatives of all religions, philosophies and schools of thought to contribute to civil and peaceful coexistence. Europe – the home of fundamental rights and freedoms – will do its part to ensure that these principles are respected. Patrizia Toia,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis in Europe is interlinking the problems of public budgets and private capital with those of the productivity of our businesses in a vicious circle, and the spectre of recession is looming. Therefore, if small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are our top priority, I would call on the Commission, alongside Parliament, to make absolutely sure that our good principles are put into practice and that the Member States turn the legislative initiatives of the Small Business Act (SBA) into highly effective, high-quality, concrete measures. Just think, Commissioner, what would happen if the Late Payment Directive were implemented early in all the Member States, and what a great benefit to SMEs it would be! The SME tests are important, but we are still at the method stage. Of course, it is only right to check that the laws we make really are suited to SMEs and further their interests, but we would urge you to persevere and examine the issues very thoroughly when setting up this framework of opportunity that you have sketched out. We also appreciate what the Commission has been doing and we are ready with the budget and the other options that we have to support it. I would just like to say a word about credit. We have to make our position clear to the banks – I am saying this to you, Commissioner – because SMEs need help … (The President cut off the speaker) Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the preparation of the common strategic framework for research and innovation funding represents a huge opportunity for the development and economy of Europe. It is a matter of pulling the lever that can truly usher in a period of growth and also of new skilled employment, such as that done by researchers and young people who devote themselves precisely to the new opportunities in innovation and technology and associated professions. One observation in particular emerges from this work, which is that we in Europe must put increasing emphasis on the kinds of research and innovation that find practical application, originate new companies, result in new patents and do not remain pure basic research or pure knowledge, which is certainly important, but not to the extent that it actually triggers development. The second observation is the relationship with local bodies, regions and territories, which are an important tool for territorial planning and for bringing together research, universities, centres of excellence and businesses.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report looks at global food security. This means that what is at stake here is not only hunger in the world or in the very poorest countries, but that the subject of food supply affects all communities, including those in the most developed countries. I would like to pick out a few key points of consistency between European policies and this target of global food security, because we in Parliament are quite accomplished at preaching, but often we are not consistent in our decisions. I only wish to highlight three innovative areas, which I think we ought to develop further. Firstly: food supply is currently jeopardised by price volatility, caused by speculation in food markets – through derivatives and so forth – that must be contained, if not banned outright. Secondly: the subject of land grabbing, which I think needs to be addressed in some form of treaty or negotiation, because democracy and the survival of many populations are at risk. Thirdly: consistency between food supply and energy policies. In our efforts to produce new energy, we must not make it impossible to produce food for the people of the world. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, hidden behind the widespread prosperity of our continent is an often invisible Europe that we refer to in numerical, statistical and sociological terms and not as real people. These people are often women and children or the elderly – the most vulnerable population groups in other words. However, Europe will have no credibility in the eyes of the public unless it learns to be consistent, and we want to be consistent, in this Parliament and at this stage in Europe’s existence. Therefore, if we say that the Union is based upon values and human rights, I do not think we can suspend or cut so drastically a programme for people who suffer from food poverty – in other words, for those who lack the right to food or the right to access food and hence lack fundamental rights – on account of an unresolved legal issue. We are talking about an agricultural fund, a social fund – and if it is a social fund, Commissioner, it should not impinge on other social programmes, but be a new ad hoc fund with appropriate resources. We say that we want to guarantee food security for Europeans, but the most important right with regard to food security is the right to food itself, followed by the right to healthy food. We need, therefore, to be consistent. With that in mind, we must find a legal solution that provides continuity and that, with the help of non-governmental organisations in the voluntary sector, guarantees the most fundamental human right: the right to food.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is time to take some bold decisions in this Europe if we want to do more than just survive. The crisis has severely disrupted normal life for European citizens and businesses and, if we do not react, it could mean that the quality of the social and cultural life, the welfare and the future of young people and Europeans, are irreversibly affected. As well as creating valuable cohesion and prosperity, overcoming the crisis means finding solutions to the causes identified: solutions for tackling speculation, which should also be restricted where necessary through the introduction of strict rules for the financial markets; solutions for combating the recession; solutions for combating the imbalanced development model that has put individuals below profit; and solutions for combating the resurgence of nationalism, which is today preventing Europe from making the choices that it has to make. Above all, it is time to provide tools and resources – new and old – so that we can forge ahead and start the engine of growth, with research, innovation, training and support for productive investment, infrastructure and jobs, because without jobs, people have no dignity or rights. Thanks to Mrs Berès and other Members, this report outlines a possible strategy for a Europe that is proud and aware of its role. It is now up to Europe’s leaders, if they exist, to implement it.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that one point that we all agree on and have established is that this programme for frequency harmonisation and coordinated spectrum use can serve a dual purpose. I believe that this is a key point to be remembered at all times; in other words, through the programme, we can develop the great potential for economic exploitation of this field by the telecommunications sector, the audiovisual sector and new services, while, at the same time, giving a boost to economic development and to other sectors linked to the telecommunications sector. We can also develop the potential for cultural and social development that this dual purpose permits and requires. Commissioner, in my opinion this programme should also be seen as an opportunity, so that we respect and uphold certain fundamental principles through the choices we make. Firstly, the principle of media pluralism. The review of the system for managing radio frequencies at European level is very important, and I believe that we must clearly prevent the accumulation of frequency rights and the creation of monopolies and oligopolies, which unfortunately exist in some European countries and which are becoming stronger and gaining a foothold in the broadcasting sector. Secondly, the principle of balance between the liberalisation and opening up of the market to new operators, and fairness, so that the commitments entered into with those operators who have provided substantial investment can also be promoted, supported and maintained on the market. Lastly, transparency and the guarantee of well-managed and well-administered frequency allocations. We are talking about auctions not only to focus on an aspect of the market that should be reconciled with all the possible social uses for spectrum, but also to say that discretion should not be used and unfair advantages should not be given with regard to radio frequencies. This point also deserves close attention. To conclude, unfortunately I do not have the time to expand on the social aspects, but they have been discussed at great length by all the members of my group. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteurs and Mr Barnier for their generous contribution to Parliament. We support the idea of an internal market which is able to understand and meet the social expectations and the implications that the social dimension requires. It is not a pipe dream; it is realistic and also modern. It is this vision that makes the market stronger, because focusing only on the economic element, essentially reducing the market to a question of economics, has shown that it will solve neither problems of growth nor of cohesion. This means, in short, that we must now fully realise the ideal of a European social market economy. In today’s texts, we have this. There is recognition of the social enterprises, cooperatives and their role, of mutual insurance companies and of foundations, which represent 10% of European companies and many of our jobs. These are a reality with real businesses demonstrating economic pluralism and the pluralism of business. They work with capital but not for capital and want to create work, welfare, quality of life and innovation, and to demonstrate that these values should and can be part of the internal market in Europe.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I join all my fellow Members who have spoken in noting that we are at last talking about a common industrial policy again, and I hope action and also specific decisions will be forthcoming again soon. I am grateful for the Lange report, the excellent work done by our fellow Member, and Vice-President Tajani’s communication. This decision means some important things, the first of which is that the revitalisation and recovery of Europe’s economy and the resilience of employment, as has been said, depend partly, and perhaps especially, on the recovery of the whole manufacturing sector, both the more advanced and the more traditional parts of it, and on the support it is given. That is because it is still possible to push the boundaries in manufacturing, something that was not so obvious until a short time ago. Secondly, the recovery of industry in Europe also means that our competitiveness is not only in play in the financial or tertiary sector, but here as well, and it is not too late for us to take up the challenge to make Europe competitive in industry vis-à-vis
 the rest of the world. The third point, as has been said, is that the new industrial policy focuses on factors rather than sectors; it focuses on factors and instruments that can genuinely promote new companies and a new capacity for resilience and modernisation. I feel it is important to highlight once again these new factors on which we need to act: credit – we are calling for new initiatives in addition to those already announced by the Commissioner on the subject of credit – raw materials, energy prices, innovation, research, the need to enhance the capacity for the technological transfer of the results of research and innovation within companies in Europe, in new products and new ways of organising production. We must make good use of a highly unique industrial fabric in Europe, particularly in certain countries, which is that of small and medium-sized enterprises, the quality of enterprises and of their products, and the unique nature of European industry. I think we should rediscover these manufacturing traditions and manufacturing roots in many countries in order to innovate and change them. Lastly, there is the question of location, which is very important. European policies are successful if they find a region able to tackle them. We therefore thank Mr Lange and look forward to an excellent collaboration with the Commission in order to arrive at concrete results very soon. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is not easy to find so much unanimity in Parliament This means that the work was really outstanding and Mrs Van Brempt and all the other shadow rapporteurs should be made aware of this. It has been said that the resulting instrument is very positive for several reasons. It is positive because its procedures and timeframes are fast; positive because it is aimed at highly qualified project categories; positive because it is aimed at urban contexts, in other words, at local authorities which, by making specific decisions, are able to bring about real change in the state of affairs and improve air quality, housing quality and urban transport quality; positive because it is aimed at profitable projects and can therefore yield a return of resources; and positive, lastly, because the strategy will bring many more resources into play. In the face of all this, however, picking up on an objection raised by many Members, including Mr Geier, Mr Turmes and Mr Cancian, I wish to say to the Commissioner that the sticking point will be the implementation, the choice of financial intermediaries, the relationship with local authorities and how their financial difficulties are dealt with. Commissioner, this instrument raises the possibility of opening the way to other projects, to a stabilisation of this instrument and its extension to other sectors. The topic is crucial. The same thing must not happen that happened with the Recovery Plan and with the small and medium-sized enterprises that are still waiting for the EUR 30 billion approved by Parliament and the Commission at the end of 2008.

 I just wanted to inform you that my voting machine was not working for the Hoang Ngoc report. I was voting against it. Patrizia Toia,  
rapporteur. 
− (IT) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report which we are debating this evening and on which we shall vote tomorrow is part of a major effort to implement the 20/20/20 package, which I believe is still one of the most far-sighted and significant things to have come out of the last European parliamentary term. If asked what I would save from the last five years, I would definitely place the 20/20/20 package at the top of the list. I believe that it is important to add that some very intense work went into this report, on the part of both the European Commission – a communication and a recommendation preceded this report – and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and others. They enriched the initial report and our work with many suggestions, additions and amendments. I believe that there is still a slight difference of opinion within Parliament over one point, and I hope that it can be overcome with tomorrow’s vote. It concerns the more or less binding nature that we wish to attribute to the contents of this report, which I would like to make a point of saying was drafted in a context of great understanding and great unanimity. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) represent an important sector, not least, in fact, because of the weight they carry in the European economy: they account for 7% of the labour force – of the European labour force – and 6% of GDP, thus a significant share of the European economy and of the European productive and labour force too. They are also very important not only, precisely, for what they represent, but also for the contribution they can make and for the essential, significant role that they can play in terms of trying to achieve this transition from our economy to a situation in which the economy, though still developed, produces fewer emissions and has a lower carbon content and will thus pollute less for our future and for that of the generations to come. In short, they can represent – not in words, but in concrete actions – changes that can lead to a way of producing, living, travelling and consuming in our society, and to that industrial revolution that, for many, will actually characterise the future of social and economic life, not only on our continent but throughout the entire world. How can ICTs make this major contribution to transforming our economy? Firstly, by changing the sector itself: the report is intended to demonstrate how this sector can, first and foremost, look within itself to see how it can produce communication, microelectronic and other instruments that consume less energy, and are thus inherently more efficient. Next, they can make an enormous contribution in the major sectors, in the housing and transport sectors. The latter two – I am quoting data from the Commission – are sectors in which greater efficiency, according to the European rules and the targets also laid down by the 20/20/20 package, can lead to a very substantial reduction in these emissions – since, today, the transport sector consumes 26% of the energy in Europe, and 40% is consumed in homes for heating and cooling, depending on the season – and can achieve very high levels of efficiency. This is without mentioning that the scope, in the case of the major sectors, affects our lives in very significant areas. I am thinking of the entire banking sector, of the relationships within public administration, of the entire e
-government sector and of all the services, in short, which, with the application of these technologies, will be able not only to reduce their carbon emissions but also to save time, with a consequent improvement in the quality of life of Europeans and in the quality of social life. This is, therefore, highly significant. However, I believe that this report will be all the more significant if Parliament approves its binding character tomorrow. I would like to offer just two examples, Mr President, if I may: smart meters and the smart grid, and smart cities. 
Only yesterday, 700 European mayors concluded a new agreement in this House, before our President and the European Commissioner, aimed precisely at improving the efficiency of cities, which are home to more than 70% of European citizens and which can thus make a major contribution to increasing efficiency and economic and social development.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is not just a routine debate but it is supposed to be very specific and to ask clear and precise questions – what resources are there and where to get them – and I hope that Parliament is expecting equally clear and precise answers, today and at the forthcoming Councils on 12 and 25 March. We want to tell the Commission and the Council firmly that the European Union, which has flown the flag for the fight against atmospheric emissions and climate change in front of the world, now has to be consistent if it does not want to lose credibility. It must do everything it can to achieve these goals. We must be well aware that talking about a low-emission economy means a kind of Copernican revolution for the production system; it means changing many things, having clear priorities and political will but, above all, sufficient resources and instruments. We also know that this Copernican revolution is vital for our production system, European industry, to remain competitive. In many countries, in many research centres and in many universities, the intellectual resources are ready, the capabilities are there and the will is there: it is now time to set things in motion. Everyone has to do it, as the Commissioner and the Council have said: the Member States, entrepreneurs and the private sector have to do it. I believe, however, that the vital task of putting this complex partnership together belongs to the European Union. Patrizia Toia,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the initiative that we are about to launch is very important for two reasons: the first is the subject of the research, which concerns the fight against neurodegenerative diseases, and the second is the joint programming methods for the research. Clearly, we would have preferred Parliament to have been more directly involved in the pilot project – this has been said and it is the subject of our question. While we must press on now and not bring matters to a halt, we are nonetheless asking for guarantees that our opinion will be taken into account in the Competitiveness Council’s deliberations, and that a more certain legal basis will be defined in future so that Parliament can be fully involved and there can be a greater sense of ownership in this field of research. We must now intervene with adequate means and resources to prevent and eradicate the widespread scourge of Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and the other diseases, which are destined to become more common as our population ages. We call for efforts to be focused on extensive, large-scale studies, aimed both at diagnosis and at identifying cures. Research into biomarkers, into early diagnosis methods based on a multidisciplinary approach, the compilation of vast databases, and the search for curative medicines and appropriate treatment and service models would appear crucial. I wish to make just one request in this House: that we ignore neither the individual circumstances of patients, which are too often excluded in the context of these types of disease, nor the involvement of patients’ and relatives’ associations. From a methodological point of view, we believe that joint research projects are very important because they fulfil an essential requirement: that of pooling efforts and resources and overcoming these divisions, these duplications, and therefore being able to create a critical mass that is sufficient to produce satisfactory results from this type of research. If we consider that, in other parts of the world, joint public and private efforts manage to invest tens of millions of euros, we realise how much there remains for us to do and how much we still have to do, by directing our efforts towards joint projects, towards strategic lines of action and joint programmes between the Member States and Europe and towards common programmes between public and private operators, without disregarding that international framework that puts us in contact with major scientific developments at international level.

 I voted in favour of the draft European Parliament legislative resolution on EU accession to the Protocol for the Protection of the Mediterranean Sea against pollution resulting from exploration and exploitation of the continental shelf and the seabed and its subsoil. The Protocol entered into force on 24 March 2011, following its ratification by six contracting parties (Albania, Tunisia, Morocco, Libya, Cyprus and Syria), and so far has neither been signed nor ratified by the Union. Given that, following the discovery of new reserves of fossil fuels in the Mediterranean, offshore activities are likely to increase, a potential accident could have immediate large-scale effects. For this reason I think that the EU’s ratification of the Offshore Protocol would constitute important leverage to ensure a good level of cooperation and the continued concrete commitment of all Mediterranean countries to the achievement of the maximum possible safety of offshore activities.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the legislative procedure began in November 2010 and has been a demanding task from a technical and political point of view, lasting a good two years and involving three Presidencies. It is therefore appropriate to thank all those who have been involved: the shadow rapporteurs, Parliament’s Secretariat and the political group secretariats and MEPs’ assistants – and, of course, the Commission and the Council. Agreement was reached at first reading, a fact that I consider highly significant. The objective of this regulation is to lay down harmonised rules on the manufacture of agricultural and forestry vehicles with a view to ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market and, in particular, the application of a large number of important criteria to improve operational, road and occupational safety for users, that is to say workers, and standards of environmental protection. In this context, the introduction in Articles 7 and 8 of new operational and occupational requirements may be considered a real success for the whole of the European Parliament, which has succeeded in covering risks which, at present, affect numerous operators, often with fatal consequences: one need only think of protection from electrical discharge or indeed from overturning. In addition, we must not underestimate the importance of worker health and safety, and so we have made provisions for the market surveillance of vehicles, systems and components, in order to ensure that all the provisions are implemented properly and carried out effectively. To sum up, the regulation helps to make industry more competitive, since it simplifies current legislation on the approval of vehicles, making it more transparent and reducing red tape. In fact, 24 base directives and around 25 related amending directives on technical requirements are being repealed and replaced by a single regulation. These aspects are important, because this regulation seeks to achieve other objectives, beyond helping to create a regulated internal market and to provide a framework enabling a competitive, balanced and transparent system. In addition, I believe we are also contributing to strengthening the sector, and in short we are putting in place the conditions for both widening the productive base and increasing employment. The work that has been done is therefore highly important and extremely useful: the compromises found between the political groups are the result of a major collaborative effort undertaken in the right spirit, with the desire to present Parliament with a consensus regulation.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the Vice-President for his contribution. I would not know where to put a tractor, so it is just as well that it is staying where it belongs. I do not think there is anything more to add: the debate has shown the degree of consensus surrounding the proposed regulation on agricultural and forestry vehicles. Now I hope that this consensus will be completely confirmed in the vote in the Chamber. This is what we have worked for, and so I really hope this result can be achieved.

 I voted in favour of the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2008/106/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the minimum level of training of seafarers. Training of a seafarers is an essential element of maritime safety and it is therefore of the utmost importance that crews trained in different countries in accordance with different systems have the necessary skills to carry out their onboard duties safely. The present proposal is aimed at bringing relevant EU legislation on training and certification of seafarers into line with current international standards, improving the wording of the legislative text for the sake of clarity. I therefore consider the proposal to be essential for avoiding conflict between international obligations and the EU obligations of the Member States. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 I voted for the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime. The new directive proposes to establish minimum standards on the rights, support, recognition and the widest protection within the territory of the EU of victims of crime, regardless of their legal status, whether in terms of content or implementation. Since confidence in justice is a priority for all citizens, especially for victims who feel their rights are unheard and out of reach, I think this proposal for a directive is an appropriate means of closing the many gaps and overcoming the many obstacles that currently exist in the single market and in the European area of freedom, security and justice.

 I am voting in favour of the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on administrative cooperation through the Internal Market Information System (‘the IMI Regulation’). The proposal aims to establish a set of common rules which will allow them to further exploit the IMI system’s full potential and encourage a smooth cross-border exchange of information between different authorities in the Member States, guaranteeing, at the same time, a higher level of protection than traditional communication channels. On these grounds, I believe the proposal for a regulation is an essential element to complete the single market and is clearly in the interest of citizens. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is increasingly being called upon to play an important role in the geopolitical changes that are affecting vast areas of the world. I believe that it is ever more urgent to raise the profile and quality of foreign policy, especially because many of these changes are taking place not far from Europe. To achieve this, we need to convince the Member States to invest in European common foreign policy, thereby reinforcing the choices made in the Treaty of Lisbon. Baroness Ashton, we need to move from the current activism – which cannot be denied and is manifest in the many trips you have made to every corner of the world – towards a more central role that will not only leave its mark, but will also adjust the existing equilibrium in favour of European foreign policy. It is to be hoped that it will be possible to dedicate a special session within Parliament to debate the foreign policy and the strategies to be put in place. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in reality, this debate is merely recording our powerlessness in the face of the tragedy that is unfolding in Syria, and I would like to know whether we are simply acknowledging this state of affairs or whether we intend to implement an appropriate, strong political initiative to try and restart diplomatic activity and adopt the necessary choices in the field, starting with the humanitarian corridor. Europe cannot be a passive bystander to the events taking place. Those who think that this situation should be prolonged must be aware that they are taking on a major political and moral responsibility. Is it true, Baroness Ashton, that you feel conditioned by the divisions and inconclusiveness of the Member State chancelleries? If so, this must be said. We need to call loudly upon all the European governments to support your work and your European action consistently, and I would like to hear this call clearly from yourself, Baroness Ashton, here today in the European Parliament.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the choice made by the Council on 7 June does not just concern European internal policy; as you can imagine, it also has an impact outside Europe. Everyone here has said that the free movement of people is one of the greatest European achievements in a Europe that is defined by it. However, restricting that free movement actually implies and portrays a feeling of mistrust that the Council is trying to distil among European countries and into European public opinion, which risks destroying the European project. For some time we have been calling for innovative and modern European governance on the migration issue. What you are doing, though, renationalises immigration policy. You are making rights and freedoms take a backward step, but these choices are likely to have a negative impact on another front, in that they reveal a certain schizophrenia in the action taken by Europe in its various policies. Together we have decided that one of the pillars of the new neighbourhood policy is mobility, a core element of the new European approach, for example towards a changing area such as the Mediterranean. What message are we sending out to these countries, apart from a message of distrust and lack of credibility? Pier Antonio Panzeri,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at long last we can say that the official announcement of the appointment of Mr Morsi, leader of the Justice and Freedom Party, has brought this first phase of the Egyptian political saga to a close; it was never a given, with two highly controversial judgments of the Constitutional Court sending out shockwaves in the days before the results were announced. The first judgment saw the supreme court declare the political isolation law under which Mr Shafiq was made ineligible to stand in the presidential elections as unconstitutional. The second judgment ruled that the electoral law used for the general elections was unconstitutional, thereby dissolving parliament, which could also have consequences for the constituent assembly. Just to complicate matters, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces also issued amendments to the constitution, severely weakening the president’s powers and abolishing autonomous legislative power until a new constitution has been approved. In his first speech as president, Mr Morsi sent what was, for us, a cheering message of unity and conciliation, as he sought to mollify the various sections of Egyptian society. In terms of foreign policy, he affirmed that he would make good on existing international obligations. Now we will have to see whether he is as good as his word. In any case, after a period of extreme uncertainty and instability, the election of a new president could finally open the way to a new phase that might, on the one hand, spur Egypt on to quickly consolidate democracy and rights and, on the other hand, enable efforts to be made to revive the economy and put an end to the ongoing financial crisis. We need, in this area, to make the role of the European Union clearer and more visible, including via the EU-Egypt task force. The EU must be ready to work with the new president to strengthen bilateral relations, to support and see through the transition to democracy, and to overcome the economic and financial problems that could jeopardise the country’s stability.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, it cannot be enough for political and institutional leaders to show their rightful indignation at the horrors unfolding in Syria, and I think you, Baroness Ashton, are aware of that. What is happening beyond our borders requires an appropriate response capacity, and frankly I do not think even the European Union as a whole has sufficient response capacity to meet the challenges facing us. How long must we stand and watch the massacre in Syria? We can understand all the current difficulties resulting from the fragile balance of power in the region; we can understand, yet not agree with, the positions of Russia and China, who will not allow the United Nations to take more incisive action; and we can also understand the mistrust in certain spheres in Europe towards the forces opposing Bashar al-Assad, not least because of their sources of funding. However, we cannot tolerate what is happening any longer. The European Union should go beyond its current activism and take a stronger lead. We have to disprove the idea that the Assad regime can do what it likes because the international community has shown itself to be impotent and that the European Union is too tied up in the economic and financial crisis to allow itself the luxury of intervening in the events in Syria. The decision to create a humanitarian corridor has not been put into practice. I think, though, we should make a fresh start on that and back up that decision with all the means at our disposal, bar none – and I stress, bar none – because that is a vital prerequisite for initiating the transition process and the transfer of power. We now need to turn our words into actions, and that is a task that is clearly yours to shoulder. Pier Antonio Panzeri,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Ms Lunacek has done a great job. I think that the process of consolidation of democracy in Kosovo is a very important factor. Our goal now is to encourage the government authorities in Priština and all the political forces represented in Parliament to persevere in the area of democratic reforms, reforms that are capable of modernising the country and opening a new phase in the political, civil, and economic life of Kosovo. There are still many shortcomings to address – earlier, the Council mentioned them – and they must be addressed with vigour and determination, and first and foremost they must be addressed by the Kosovo authorities with the consistency required. Admittedly, the situation is evolving. We can only welcome the historic agreement reached between Belgrade and Priština on inclusive regional cooperation and on the representation of Kosovo in regional forums. This may seriously promote stability throughout the Western Balkan region and is therefore of great importance for the European Union as well. It is in this context – as Commissioner Füle reminded us – that we welcome the fact that the Commission has initiated a feasibility study for a Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and Kosovo. We must now persevere on this path, because this path may not only bring peace and make the relationship between Serbia and Kosovo more profitable, and may bring these countries even closer to the EU, but also because it may help overcome the prejudices towards Kosovo on the part of those countries that have still not recognised the existence of Kosovo itself. There is thus a task that must be performed by Europe, but first and foremost a task that the Kosovar authorities must fully carry out in order to achieve these goals. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, there is one point on which Parliament has found a broad consensus over the last few weeks. This concerns the need to change the neighbourhood policy towards southern Mediterranean countries, particularly in view of the changes taking place which are producing significant improvements in the spread of democracy, and opening a whole new chapter in the EU’s approach to these countries. Now we need to be consistent and not oscillate between extremes when implementing this neighbourhood policy. It would be absurd and inexcusably incomplete if this policy merely called for more rights and democracy in these countries, and resolutely ignored everything else, starting with economic and trade issues. We have often stated that rights and democracy are established above all also through new economic and financial policies capable of stimulating growth in these countries. Democracy and social and economic growth are inextricably linked. The agreement with Morocco is part of this context. It aims at and must encourage mutual convenience in terms of free trade and the process of integrating the Mediterranean area. I am concerned about Mr Bové’s style of protectionism because, instead of helping the democratic process and rights in these countries, it in fact becomes an objective obstacle to them. For all these reasons it is important that Parliament should approve this agreement, and I hope that tomorrow this will happen. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, a huge effort has been made by the two rapporteurs to redefine European Neighbourhood Policy, which is necessary considering the great changes which are under way, particularly in the Mediterranean region, which is being affected by a new wind transforming a large number of its countries. The huge leap forwards which this new phase has brought about must be achieved with strength and determination, to build the conditions for our support for the transition processes taking place. However, we must be careful because the movements that have begun in these North African countries are not linear: there are and there may be increasing numbers of counter-trends and we cannot be sure or confident of how things will end. Nevertheless, we have to remain involved and not turn our backs on the situation. We should instead monitor these changes, paying closer attention and increasing our involvement. Of course, we should focus our attention on economic and financial issues, on the opening up of markets, on a process of regulated mobility, but now we also need to be more rigorous in demanding that the new laws uphold human rights, equality between men and women, and political and religious plurality. These should be the cornerstones of a new neighbourhood policy if it is to be effective and not run into the mistakes of the past. I hope that the good work carried out by Commissioner Füle continues in this direction. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, despite there still being some pockets of resistance by supporters of the old Libyan regime and even if, while Colonel Gaddafi is still around, the National Transitional Council still fears possible backlashes, it is right and proper to focus our attention on the post-war challenges. The European Union’s role in the process of reconstruction and stabilisation of Libya is extremely important. Aside from the immediate priorities of food, medicine, a plan for security, public order, border control and the highly sensitive issue of withdrawing arms, it is important to prepare for medium- to long-term action. This begins with the contribution necessary for the election process that will open up to institutional capacity building in the transitional phase, and to economic and social development. After the aggressive stage of the crisis which saw the European Union isolated, it is right to think that this is the time to strengthen Europe’s role with the right amount of determination. We do not just have a humanitarian duty, however important that may be, when thinking of the many migrants in Libya. We cannot fail to be present at the table that will redesign the geopolitical structure of the region, which now has another important protagonist in the shape of Turkey, as we are seeing at the moment with Prime Minister Erdogan’s triumphant visits to various Arab countries, just as we cannot delegate management of the post-war phase solely to the group of countries that took part in the NATO mission. There are already signs of competition on the Libyan stage between some Member States which is not subtle and will not have a beneficial outcome. In fact, in the race towards the new Libya it is not difficult to see economic and energy-related interests. The plans for building a democratic Libya are not so clear, and this is what requires hard work and dedication. This is where the importance of the role of the European Union comes in, not least because the road before us is not an easy or a short one, and above all we must bear in mind that a democratic outcome is by no means guaranteed.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow we will vote on an important and compelling resolution that shows Parliament’s will, despite many difficulties, to adopt a clear position on the events that are affecting countries such as Syria, Bahrain and Yemen, together with all the associated problems. It is true that what is happening in other countries, like Tunisia and Morocco, shows that the route to democracy is viable; it may follow a different path, but it is possible. This observation, however, does not dispel the public perception of the policies pursued by the international community and by Europe itself on these events involving the Mediterranean region. This perception questions the idea that foreign policy can apply double standards as it unfolds. In essence, we wonder why things are done one way in Libya and another way in Syria. Certainly, it is clear that different standards apply in foreign policy: from political realism, to the strategic nature of certain areas, to the reluctance of large countries to adopt more definite positions. In any case, this is a contradiction that continues to dog us and which we must be able to tackle. How? In two ways: there is a need for European policy to take more of a leading role, for greater consistency to give credibility to our presence throughout this area; there is a need to give political weight to the idea of a Euro-Mediterranean operating structure that can provide a genuine and lasting reference point for both the north and south sides and that can deal with existing problems. This work needs to be done immediately with the necessary effort and determination. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the turbulent events laden with uncertainties and hopes that are changing the political geography of the southern shores of the Mediterranean are increasingly posing a challenge to Europe and its external policy. In view of what is happening, it should be increasingly important for the European Union to be able to rely on a sound, consistent external policy capable of dealing with a difficult present and planning for a problematic future, in which international relations will be altered and the world will be profoundly changed. In view of the strategic repositioning of countries such as the United States, China and Russia, and growing shortages of raw materials and energy resources, Europe should develop a crucial, decisive role, but it is quite clearly showing itself to be unprepared for such challenges. For some time now, it has been moving too slowly towards coordination of the external and domestic policies of its Member States. There has been no substantial progress. Evidence of this is, on the one hand, the lacklustre action deriving from its external policy and, on the other, the obstinacy of certain countries that are nostalgic for a colonial period that can no longer return and insist on believing that they protect their interests better by doing things alone and not delegating anything to European authority. We need to turn over a new leaf. Baroness Ashton, you have an important role; please fulfil it to the utmost, in the knowledge that the time available is quickly running out. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the criticisms that we have heard here this morning in connection with the petition presented are understandable. I think there is still a long way to go before we can ensure that a possible general agreement on agricultural products with Morocco receives consensus approval. On the one hand, the agreement must respect the need for balance, and not cause serious difficulties for European agricultural producers. On the other, it must respect the need for clear and transparent rules of competition on agricultural markets. This is the path to follow in order to ensure that the relationship between the European Union and Morocco is a positive one. I therefore invite the Commission to look for suitable solutions that do not lose sight of the producers’ interests, but which also do not lose sight of a renewed policy of generosity towards Morocco, particularly in view of the events taking place in the Maghreb. It would be very useful to understand, and I do not want us to end up effectively importing tomato pickers, instead of agricultural products and tomatoes. It is therefore important to carry out a thorough investigation in order to create a new European policy. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, with this review of the EU’s neighbourhood policies, we are setting forth on a journey that will not end any time soon. The events in the Mediterranean signal a process of profound change and they will have lasting consequences, not only for the countries of the region, but also for Europe. We must be aware that the transition to full democracy will not be easy and that these transitions are accompanied by many risks and uncertainties. For this reason, there are numerous things we must do and these will take time. Europe’s response must be characterised by a strategy based on immediate and long-term actions. We must facilitate access to European markets and allow greater mobility. We should organise a conference to explore the possibility of cancelling or renegotiating the debt of these countries which have chosen the road to democracy; we must make adequate financial resources available and provide assistance to the democratic process by strengthening parliamentary institutions and political parties, ensuring the full participation of all citizens. This should all happen within the framework of a revitalised Euro-Mediterranean dialogue. At stake is the strategic, political future of Europe. I believe that Europe must understand that we have to work to the east and the south, but right now, there is a special priority to the south. These policies need fundamental change; we must finally open a new chapter. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, beyond the measures that have been announced, I wonder if European policy is doing enough. It naturally takes time for the European Union to establish leadership, especially in foreign policy, but as we know, certain situations arise and unfortunately do not allow us all the time we would like and actually call for fast action and far-sightedness. Now it is clear that we are still falling short of requirements as far as affairs in the Mediterranean region and particularly Libya are concerned: we need to reflect a little more to recognise that perhaps we will need stronger action to understand what has been happing and also to deploy concerted action towards the Mediterranean. It is in fact clear to everyone that if we look at Libya, there is a substantial difference between the whole of Europe taking joint action and action only being taken by willing countries, as is the case at present. No, my message to the representatives of the Council and Commission is that we are not there yet. The Council has not answered certain questions, and now must do so quickly. I wonder if beyond the humanitarian effort, we really know what to do if the application of Resolution 1973 is not enough and if some countries go beyond their mandate. Secondly, I would like to know the Council's view on the issue of operational command: NATO told us that it is performing a technical role, but not providing political guidance. Do we think we can get along like that, without seeking a stronger and more united European Union voice instead of fobbing the job off onto the few who are willing? Finally, within the framework of ongoing operations and the relationship with the Arab League and the African Union, it is essential to prevent our intervention from ultimately being seen negatively, with the risk of creating uncertainty and dangerous shifts. Are we aware? Perhaps not altogether: these are questions that do not deserve bureaucratic answers but need appropriate policy responses, starting with tomorrow's Council meeting.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the spirit of this debate enables me, Baroness Ashton, to remind you that the Union for the Mediterranean’s Parliamentary Assembly concluded its meeting last week in Rome. It set out several paths that the Commission would do well to return to, in particular, in terms of its suggestions on how to support the democratic transition processes in progress. Hence, I urge you and I urge the Commission to follow the developments in Tunisia intently. This country is objectively a driving force for democracy and is setting a benchmark for the entire region. Regarding Libya, we need to be fully aware that having decreed it part of the international community, the severance of relations with Mr Gaddafi’s regime will have consequences, particularly given that his regime is showing greater resistance than those of Mr Ben Alì and Mr Mubarak. This means that we must act on four fronts right now – and political timescales are decisive – with credibility, sincerity and consistency. We must come up with a suitable European financial plan. I understand the evocative note struck by many, but we need an Ashton Plan rather than a Marshall Plan. We also need a European immigration and asylum policy, a deterrent policy including the closure of airspace, and full support for the opponents of Mr Gaddafi’s regime. Baroness Ashton, it is up to you and your foreign policy ties with the Council to make these points count in the coming days, but also to avoid Europe’s foreign policy being caught unawares again by the events that are changing the Mediterranean.

Mr President, I voted for the motion for a resolution on the progress of Croatia’s accession to the European Union within the framework of the enlargement process, because I attach great importance to starting this process and to the progress made by Croatia. In essence, we hope that the enlargement will extend beyond Croatia and end up encompassing the whole of the Western Balkans. This is one of the key points of Europe’s neighbourhood and enlargement policies. My vote is therefore, without doubt, in favour of the Swoboda report. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the current flood of migrants is a serious problem, and it is a European one. What is needed is not complaints, however, but effective cooperation to tackle the current crisis in a constructive and far-sighted manner. We must take action at two levels, and we will need broad shoulders to bear our responsibilities. The first level concerns the immediate situation. Additional funds must be made available to deal with the crisis; we need at last to prepare a European round table, putting on the agenda the possibility of sharing out the immigrants fairly among the various countries; and, lastly, we have to meet with the provisional Tunisian Government to demand that resources and instruments be put in place to stem the current exodus. The second level is more strictly political in nature. It is absolutely vital to radically review our neighbourhood policies. Action is needed based on a renewed policy of economic, financial and social cooperation, an intelligent immigration policy, and effective support for the economic reforms and the democratic transition process under way in Tunisia. It is only by taking such action that we will be able to tackle and solve the problems now facing Italy and Europe. Commissioner, I am sure you will agree with us all that it really is time now to stop talking and start acting. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Baroness Ashton, I get the impression that you are not yet sufficiently aware of what is going on in the Mediterranean region. I have to say that the slowness of the EU institutions in addressing the Mediterranean question can only be explained by a lack of awareness of the situation and an inability to sense the changes that are afoot. We are coming to the end of a political and historical era in which Europe’s policy towards the South has been muddled and counterproductive. The economic crisis, difficulties faced in migrating and the lack of changeover among the ruling classes have created an explosive combination that is affecting Tunisia and Egypt now, but is likely to spread to other countries. To address some of my fellow Members also, I would say that we will not get away with thinking that all we need to do is to simply give our support to the demonstrations that are currently taking place. Europe needs to show greater political maturity. To do this, we need to retune Europe’s political antennae. Europe’s foreign policy needs to come out of its semi-secretive mode and take a leading role on the international stage in supporting the democratic transition processes currently underway. In particular, we need clear policies in a number of areas: a new partnership and neighbourhood policy, and a new security policy for the Mediterranean region; greater willingness from the whole of Europe to address the Mediterranean issue; and a policy of joint action so that Europe will be acting in the region alongside other players, such as the United States and Turkey. We need a major change of course and this calls for an act of considerable humility on the Commission’s part in reopening the debate on foreign policy towards the Mediterranean and taking a fresh look at the Union for the Mediterranean, whilst at the same time ensuring that Europe has a role within it. This is crucial for Europe, and we need to be fully aware of this. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, requests to debate this topic have been made several times, and commitments have been adopted each time to put the required initiatives into practice in the Sahel region, whether to stabilise the region or to ensure greater security. As we know, given the lack of borders and the huge size of the region, the Sahel is an ideal area of transit for drug traffickers and terrorist groups, specifically al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. The weakness and instability of the states in this region are the main problem and, as has been pointed out, the threats directly affect the peoples and countries in the region, particularly Mauritania, Mali and Niger. The main task the European Union has to address is to draw up a credible security strategy based on the various facets of possible European action: cooperation and development policy, regional programmes, coordination strategies for highway security, and security training policies. Hence, the European Union not just should, but must intervene as quickly as possible, and therefore we are looking forward to the Commission drawing up a complete strategy, as you announced, Baroness Ashton, as well as strong intervention on the ground. To conclude, my request is clear: we need to pay far greater attention to what is happening south of Europe, because many things are about to change and we had better not be caught unprepared. It could only do the EU good to be more far-sighted. Pier Antonio Panzeri,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the work done by Mrs Gomes in my view makes a serious contribution to what the Commission should do in defining the framework agreement. Libya undoubtedly plays a decisive role in the fight against terrorism, in peace and security in Africa, in the fight against illegal immigration in the Mediterranean, and in the energy sector. Our aim in the context of the European Union’s strategy must therefore be to consolidate Libya’s integration into an international political and economic system based on shared rules. To achieve that, a number of conditions need to be imposed on Libya, and that is what the recommendation is calling for. First of all, in the matter of immigration, Libya is clearly a transit country. This is an extremely important subject, but it cannot be seen simply in terms of security, stopping immigration and refoulement. The subject involves the need for a government ruled by the streams of economic and social policies equal to the challenge of migration, the issues of the recognition of political refugees and the ratification by Libya of the Geneva Convention and, lastly, the problem of the readmission of immigrants based on concrete guarantees to safeguard the immigrants’ living conditions. Then there is the question of launching economic and democratic reforms to make decidedly more room for democracy in this important country. We shall have to take this issue into ever greater account, as the events in neighbouring Tunisia are showing. Lastly, this recommendation calls for reflection on the issue of bilateral agreements. Such agreements can certainly make a valid contribution to defining and solving problems, but they are not the final answer. For example, the problem we have with Italian fishing boats shows that the bilateral agreement option does not address these problems. Now, however, the review of the partnership and neighbourhood policies also involves the call to rethink the Libya question in a new framework, which means including Parliament. Many of us have called for the Council’s mandate for the framework agreement to be made known. In this respect, Commissioner, there is a real need to break step and involve the European Parliament more and more in defining new policies for the countries to the south of Europe.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we share the concerns about what is happening in Tunisia and express our sadness about the many people who have lost their lives during the protests. The new and confused situation that began after the flight of former president, Mr Ben Ali, must now lead to the objective that many have asked for: the start of economic and social reforms to match the expectations of the vast majority of the population and the opening up of democratic forums, to ensure that civil society and the various opposition forces are increasingly involved in public life and in government. Obviously, all countries have the right to determine their own path, but we are keen for these reforms to be carried out and for the changes to be real and not merely window dressing. What is happening in Tunisia at the moment poses questions for all of us and poses questions for Europe, with all its delays and mistakes. In 1995, the European Union launched the partnership programme with the Mediterranean in Barcelona. This was supposed to include economic, political, military and even social and human cooperation, but not even in the two key objectives has this been achieved. In terms of the economy, there has been a drastic reduction in regional and infrastructural projects because the funds never arrived from Member States and those from the Commission remain in standby. The promised free trade zone does not exist, but the most obvious failure is on the political level, and we need to be fully aware of this, Commissioner. The Union for the Mediterranean was launched in 2008, but remains a façade. The summit that was supposed to be held in November 2010 has been postponed indefinitely. The problem is that the various European governments are not interested and do not see any interest in real cooperation. They prefer to maintain relationships with questionable regimes that are wedded to the defence of their undemocratically managed national resources, whilst millions of young people live without any future prospects but emigration, which is increasingly difficult. It is no great surprise then that, spurred on by the economic and social crisis, the protests in Tunisia have turned into a tidal wave capable of having a heavy impact on the existing power structure. European political realism is no longer useful as a result of the fear of Islamic fundamentalism, and perhaps the time has come to finally shelve that post-colonial attitude that tends to re-emerge every now and then in relations with north African countries. Indeed, taking Barcelona as a starting point, Europe needs a new vision of its southern reaches and the Mediterranean, which must be more credible than in the past. This implies a complete overhaul of the partnership and neighbourhood policies that have been followed thus far, and I would insist that you attend to this, Commissioner. We cannot hide the fact that both the Commission and the Council were even ready to start discussions with Tunisia for an advanced status agreement. On the basis of what criteria it was thought that all this was possible is still to be explained. We need to change tack – change gear – and we are telling the Commission and the Council that this can be achieved by showing more conviction in giving Parliament a role in the elaboration and application of a new idea of partnership with the countries of the Mediterranean. All of this is not solely in the interest of these countries but is, above all, in the interest of Europe. Many of the problems that Europe appears to have can only be tackled and resolved by a productive and virtuous relationship with all the Maghreb countries. Supporting economic and democratic reforms, as well as simultaneously deploying all the necessary antidotes to fundamentalism and terrorism, is a difficult road but is the only one to take. There is reason to hope that the tragic and bitter lesson being imparted by Tunisia can serve to give all of us a better understanding of what is worth doing and what is worth changing in terms of Europe’s actions.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to say to Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra that, ahead of resolving the conflict between Plato and the truth, perhaps we needed a little more time before coming up with this resolution, for at least two reasons. Firstly, we could have collected all the information to help guarantee that Parliament would take a more solid stance and, secondly, a series of meetings and hearings had got under way in the relevant committees Parliament took the legitimate decision to move ahead immediately, In any case, this does not diminish the requirement for these hearings and the need to keep the negotiations with Morocco open. I therefore believe that, after the vote, it is a good idea to apply our efforts in three specific directions: establishing a new leading role for Europe, with its diplomacy and neighbourhood policies; contributing to a positive outcome to the negotiations opened by the United Nations; and, finally, using all parliamentary instruments – beginning with the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the mixed committee – to ensure that the meeting goes ahead and helps find solutions. I think it would be helpful to work determinedly towards these specific objectives. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, someone might surely object to the reasons that have led the European Parliament to debate and pass judgment on a legislative act that a democratically elected parliament like the Israeli Knesset is adopting. Such objections are understandable, but there are at least two basic reasons why this debate is necessary. The first is the unique nature of the situation in the Middle East, resulting from a conflict that has lasted too long and does not only involve Israel. The second is the important role played by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in that area, both on the humanitarian aid side and in connection with development cooperation policies. Besides, the Israeli authorities themselves should assess that role carefully, because without the work done by all the NGOs, the tensions in the region would be greater and much more serious. For that reason, it will be perfectly natural to suggest to the Knesset, when it intends to legislate on this subject, that it should set out two clear objectives in addition to the changes already made: to ensure transparency for funding, applying without bias to everyone, including organisations like the settlers’ NGOs, for example; and to make it possible in practical terms for all the NGOs to work, since their work is important, not least for the future of the peace negotiations themselves.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I call for the words ‘all the people’ to be deleted when reference is essentially being made to the dialogue. Therefore, the final sentence should be: ‘considers that both parties should take a pragmatic approach to the dialogue for the benefit of Kosovo and Serbia’. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it has already been said that tomorrow, we will vote on the motion for a resolution on Kosovo drafted by Mrs Lunacek. Today’s discussion and tomorrow’s vote are very important and are a useful contribution to the process of stabilising Kosovo and the Western Balkans as a whole. If it is to honour the commitments it has made, Europe must work to ensure that three primary objectives are fully met in Kosovo: a stronger and more complete integration of the Albanian and Serbian communities, full implementation of the rule of law and the strengthening of Kosovo’s democratic institutions. Moreover, these are essential conditions if Kosovo is to move more decisively towards the European integration process. In this context, the European Union must be very demanding with itself and with the authorities in Kosovo, through its presence there, so that the democratisation process can move forward in the country and can embark on the road to European integration. We need to be aware that there are still many things to be done. The European Union must play an active role, which means also following the guidelines provided by the European Parliament. I therefore believe that this much hoped for process – and I do hope that this motion is adopted by the European Parliament and that all of the groups come together in some way – has a very important role, which I believe is negotiation, dialogue and opening an honest relationship between Serbia and Kosovo for two reasons: to stabilise the relationship between the two countries and to prepare the entire region in the best possible way for a European future; and we hope that this will happen in the not too distant future. We as Parliament and the European Union must assume this responsibility with the necessary determination. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, nothing can justify what happened and I am sorry to say that we are faced with an act of rank amateurism by the Israelis. Perhaps the Israeli leadership is not yet properly aware that Israeli security will be achieved only if the peace process goes ahead and not by raising the tension. Against this background, the resolution tabled to Parliament is an important response by this institution to the difficult question of Gaza. This affair, with all its dramatic overtones, nevertheless forces Europe to step up the quality of its dealings with the Middle Eastern question. Mrs Ashton, I think you are aware that today, we need new leadership within Europe; stronger action with the aim of setting the indirect negotiations on the right path. Stop this senseless settlement policy and lift the blockade on Gaza. By adopting this resolution, the European Parliament offers an important benchmark. Make use of it so that European action can make a serious contribution to overcoming the conflict and winning over all extremist positions, while also achieving the goals of the two states.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we are taking an extremely significant step forwards by adopting this report, and it will be very useful with a view to the Barcelona Summit of 7 June, a summit which, as we know, is set to be difficult given the deadlock in negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians, and also owing to various uncertainties and difficulties regarding the definition of the administrative set-up of the new secretariat structure. Faced with these problems, the Peillon report has been drafted in the only way possible, highlighting, on the one hand, that the conflicts must not hinder tangible progress towards multilateral cooperation in specific sectors, while acknowledging, on the other, that the Union for the Mediterranean will not be fully successful unless these conflicts are settled. Therefore, the real challenge now involves a clear, robust political commitment which must come out of the Barcelona Summit, finally enabling the structures of the new institution to function and commit to providing the funds necessary for the major projects that are its main objective. Europe must realise that it needs to turn its political and economic efforts and its own interests southwards, because it is here that it can find the solutions to many of the problems currently plaguing it.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are aware of the differences that exist between the various regulatory frameworks of the individual countries, and we also know that various interpretations of European and national case law are currently leading to a large number of infringements and disputes within the Member States. The lack of a European Union policy is no longer sustainable in the light of the challenges posed by the cross-border nature of online gambling services. Moreover, the rapid spread of the Internet and of electronic trade in recent years has given rise to an increase in the supply of online games and to the consequent emergence of cross-border issues, which remain unresolved. For this reason, I am convinced that the European institutions should rise to the common challenges, such as the protection of consumers – and more specifically of children – and the prevention of crime and fraud, but also to the challenges concerning the fight against the illegal and unauthorised supply of services, which the national governments alone cannot cope with. The Commission must therefore respond to Parliament’s requests and strive to obtain a European regulatory framework. It must do so by showing the necessary determination. Commissioner, your good will is not in question, and that is why I say to you that the consultation is a good idea and that the green paper is also a good idea, provided that it is used to identify the correct legislative framework and is not just an end in itself. The old Commission very often drafted too many green papers and white papers without any decisions being taken. However, I believe that you realise, Commissioner, that we need decisions and not just words. Pier Antonio Panzeri,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we had to give an opinion on the existing relations between the European Union and Tunisia, it could only be a positive one, including as regards the stabilisation of the region. It is true that important progress has been made in economic terms, and there are also encouraging signs from a social point of view. However, in political terms, following the presidential elections on 25 October, we are faced with the problem of supporting the journey towards democratic reforms with greater concrete action. As we know, the European Union’s objective, in pursuing its foreign policy, is to develop and consolidate democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Tunisia has made some important commitments in the context of the Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan on democracy, governance and human rights. The action plan lays down a series of priorities and, amongst these, particular attention must be paid to implementing and consolidating reforms, and to strengthening political dialogue and cooperation, particularly in relation to democracy and human rights, foreign policy and security. It is within this framework that the institutions must be strengthened. The latter allow the increased participation in political life of the various members of Tunisian society, greater development of the role of civil society, continued support for political parties to broaden their participation in the democratic process, and greater respect for freedom of association, freedom of expression and media pluralism. We are convinced that these objectives can be achieved, and it is reasonable to expect tangible progress to be made. Our commitment is to safeguard the friendship which binds the European Union and Tunisia while consolidating the existing relationship, including in view of the conflict which could arise concerning the idea of an advanced status for that country. However, concrete steps really must be taken by Tunisia itself. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I consider the resolution that we are discussing today in Parliament to be genuinely positive. To dwell on part of this, I consider that the topic of European enlargement to the western Balkans is, and must remain, one of the linchpins of European action in the coming months. I would like to compliment the Swedish Presidency and, above all, Commissioner Rehn on their work. We must nevertheless feel more involved in the process of enlargement. Some countries must undoubtedly step up their action on the legal front in terms of the fight against crime and reforms. Yet we must not lose sight of the political aim, which is to consolidate democracy in those countries and have them follow the European path in economic, social and infrastructural terms. I am thinking, for example, of countries such as Kosovo – and in this regard I agree with the amendment tabled by Mrs Lunacek with regard to the Roma issue – because this is a country we cannot sideline merely because five European countries have not yet recognised its independence. To sum up, we need the right amount of courage and a far-sighted policy that is up to the challenge that the process of enlargement sets all of us. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, believe that this cooperation agreement with Tajikistan really is very positive and can help to achieve what I believe are some important and precise objectives. The first objective concerns the strategic position of that country, which can genuinely be of use in promoting an area of peace, security and stability. The second objective, I believe, is and must be to encourage the growth of that country from an economic and social point of view, because we know that it is one of the poorest countries in the region. Lastly, we must ensure that freedom, democracy and rights are the fundamental elements that govern the application of this agreement. Leaving aside any limitations that may be found, I believe we should welcome the report on which we are voting in this House. Pier Antonio Panzeri (S&amp;D).

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when debating foreign policy issues, such as today’s issue involving Iran, there is always the risk, as we know, of lagging slightly behind the events taking place. However, there is no doubt that the European Parliament, if it wants to, can play an important role in urging Europe and the international community to take the current events seriously and to implement all of the initiatives needed to ensure that the process of introducing a democratic system in Iran can actually take place. Following the close attention paid by the international public to the post-election period in Iran and the street demonstrations that the Iranian regime sought to repress with the use of violence, it is important to ensure that silence does not descend on the situation in the country. Being realistic about things does not mean taking the Iran issue off the agenda. It is also up to us to keep this level of attention high, and it is also up to the Swedish Presidency – which I thank for the points it has made today – to promote a strong initiative, together with the United States, Russia and other countries, in order to change the way in which issues in Iran, from democratic rights to the nuclear issue itself, develop.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry that I do not agree with your optimism; based on what I know, I would call it Rio -20, because we have gone back about 20 years. No binding document, no definition of the future we want, but of course, without Mr Obama, Mr Cameron and Ms Merkel – who alone represent more than 30% of the entire gross domestic product and who were, in fact, in Mexico at the G20 summit – what could have been decided? Only safe ideas for those who want business as usual, such as the green economy, masterfully represented as one of the instruments available in order to achieve sustainable growth, and for the adoption of policies, which should not, however, be subject to rigid rules. The divisions, inconsistencies and injustices will therefore remain and the separation of economic, social and environmental spheres will continue to cause disasters. Yes to recognising climate change, reducing natural disasters, energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions, and yet nothing concrete – as if to say, the house is burning and we are not doing anything to put out the fire. Other evident sticking points: that the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) did not become a real environment body and that no High Commissioner was appointed for future generations. What can we do now? Only be aware that interdependence can help us cope with the crisis we are experiencing and therefore that a new governance is absolutely necessary in order to move forward. The Commission could set an example: get the financial institutions responsible for a large part of this crisis around a table and ask them to commit to a plan of growth, inclusion, fairness and development, which respects and protects the environment and people. For its part, Parliament can come up with a universal statement of interdependence and democracy, which also guarantees right of access to natural resources and then ask the biggest States in the world to join in. For once, it would not be up to the young people or banks or large corporations, but the democratically elected representatives to decide the future we want. Vittorio Prodi  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, I have been defending the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) programme since I arrived in Parliament and I now feel the need – after letters, oral and written questions, resolutions, meetings, debates, hearings and newspaper articles – to remind those who seem to have forgotten what the benefits of this programme are, as listed in a publication written, among others, by the NEREUS Network of European Regions Using Space Technologies. Here are just some of the areas that the EU will put at risk without GMES: air quality, monitoring of climate change adaptation, EU water policy, the INSPIRE programme for geospatial information, civil protection and emergency services, agriculture and forests, services to the marine environment, monitoring of illegal activities, energy management and urban mapping. To these I would like to add the support, in particular to African countries, for all the technology currently needed to manage the environment. Given this non-exhaustive list of the merits of GMES, could Commissioner Barnier – who I am sure is an advocate of the benefits of GMES – explain who it is that does not wish for the GMES programme to operate as it has done so far, and why? Why is the Commission hiding behind Council decisions, when we have evidence that at least eight major countries have asked to put GMES back into the multiannual financial framework? Who is insisting (and why?) on adopting an intergovernmental approach with an agreement that would make Parliament’s control of one of the most important space programmes much more difficult, rather than facilitating it as required by the Treaty of Lisbon? Let it be known that we are friends of GMES: the Commission seems to agree, and claims simply to be following the orders of the Council, the Council itself substantially agrees, and the regions are clamouring for GMES to be fully implemented. It must also be noted that, at this time of crisis, GMES is one of the few sectors where jobs are not being slashed and in which European companies can still boast a competitive edge. Parliament has repeatedly expressed its full support for GMES. Commissioner Barnier, please tell those in the Commission and its services who are against GMES that it is time to stop. We have to work for Europe and for its young people, so as to make their future less hopeless. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Vittorio Prodi  (S&amp;D

Mr President, it is clear that this is possible and is also one of the types of data that Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) can consistently deliver.

 Mr President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, these are truly European items of infrastructure that are vital for implementing European policies. Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) is specifically for security, the environment and the management of mitigation policies, of global warming and the review of extreme meteorological events. It must be included in the European Union’s multiannual budget. If that is not possible, this may be the time to make use of project bonds, which also have an anti-recession function. I am convinced that this is an investment in our future and that it will pay dividends in a very few years’ time. Commissioner, let us go forward along this path. Vittorio Prodi,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution on the Rio+20 summit highlights the crucial principle of fairness. Fairness on an international scale that guarantees developing countries their right to development; intergenerational fairness that does not make those who come after us pay the price for our decisions; fairness that thus develops into genuine solidarity and a vehicle for a new kind of sustainable development. We must reject the old concept of the three independent pillars – economic, social and environmental – and instead recognise the interdependent nature of these elements, because they are indivisible. Determining the conditions for genuinely sustainable development requires us not only to develop new standards, such as the Beyond GDP project, but also to guarantee the active involvement of all parties at all levels of governance. It is precisely by focusing on the indivisible nature of fairness, solidarity and global governance that we can break out from behind the barrier of false freedoms and return to social models based on the individual and the common good. Rio+20 is therefore an appeal for a noble ethics and it is in such a context that both the financial and the technological proposals made by the European Parliament gain value. These span the tax on international financial transactions, support for environmental conservation projects, a broader horizon of comprehensive fiscal reform replacing taxes on labour by taxes on resource use and assessment of the impact that production of biofuels can have on food supply and biodiversity, with the focus on global assessment of impact of technology on the environment and society. Our proposals are intended to prepare the ground for an international conference that would mark a true political turning point in planning the development of our planet. Vittorio Prodi  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, overall the report by Mrs Andrikienė report is an excellent report, which the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists &amp; Democrats in the European Parliament have worked hard on to provide ideas of the utmost value. Human rights have constituted one of the fundamental pillars of the European Union since its creation and respect for them is an essential point that the European Parliament must encourage every day. Wider acceptance of human and fundamental rights, globalisation and changes in our society require a new and different outlook that does not fit any of our existing canons. It therefore becomes essential to guarantee equal access to natural resources, as one of the fundamental rights of each individual. In the coming years, climate change will lead to an enormous number of refugees fleeing the poorest areas of the Earth and it is our duty to begin to take note of these potential migratory flows so that we can establish appropriate policies that will enable respect for the dignity of these people to be guaranteed. The expression ‘climate refugee’ has not yet entered the vocabulary of current international law. Naturally, we remain committed to the fight against desertification, just as we do to adjusting to climate change. These are the topics I have attempted to add to the text of the report, so that a serious debate can be opened on the issues. Vittorio Prodi  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to the Commissioner and to the entire EU delegation, who have helped to keep the process alive. However, we have not solved the real problems: firstly, we need to give political expression to the Bali Declaration – in particular, with regard to what we in Parliament have already called climate justice – and we need to generalise and simplify the emissions trading system, because it is inconceivable to have a market mechanism where half of the emissions quota is given away free. Secondly, I would like to stress the need to promote instruments for monitoring, reporting and verifying, in particular, those of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) range of services, of the satellites that will provide absolutely vital data in this area.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Vice-President Ashton, the defenders of human rights play a crucial role throughout the world, often putting their lives on the line. Respect for human rights is one of the basic values of the European Union and has always underpinned its construction. This is why it is now important to keep focusing attention on compliance with these rights as a whole. The work done in Parliament on this subject is crucial in ensuring this and I therefore thank the rapporteur Mrs Hautala for her excellent report to which the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament made a crucial and constructive contribution. We must, in fact, seek to look beyond. I believe the time has come to take clear responsibility, in other words, to begin to treat respect for human rights as a complex phenomenon; we must now seek to achieve a higher and more comprehensive acceptance of these rights. I am firmly convinced, Mr President, that fundamental rights should include the right of equal access to natural resources, to water and also to food, the right to health care, the right to education and the right of access to information. With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, I also feel we are bound to make the most of the new External Action Service by making sure it encompasses organisations and figures distinguished by their respect for human rights. This morning, in fact, Mrs Ashton mentioned the Russian Federation and our dealings with the Federation in this context. Such challenges, which we face a daily basis, are often underestimated. The European Union can and must continue to play a leading role on the international stage in taking up such challenges. Vittorio Prodi,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, climate change is a real threat that we must be ready to face despite the varying impact it will have on our countries. The degradation of ecosystems will cause a severe blow to the health of our economies and of European citizens. We have already in the past called for climate diplomacy and justice: now we have to build it, speaking with a single voice. I am convinced that the European Union must maintain the lead in the battle against climate change and that any delay in implementing that action will increase environmental, social and economic costs out of all proportion. We must first of all recognise the central role of local and regional authorities and the need to work with them to coordinate environmental and economic innovation facilitated by technological progress. By adopting the White Paper, we call on the Commission and Member States to promote public-private partnerships to help finance all of the initiatives tied to the adaptation policies. Each square metre of our territory has to be cared for to preserve the soil and retain water so as to prevent erosion and to supply the aquifers, including through direct reinjection of surface waters. In order for adaptation to be possible, a systemic approach which includes renewable energies will be necessary. I would like to warmly thank all of my colleagues who contributed to the success of this report. (Applause

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the 13th session of the UN Human Rights Council is an extremely important occasion. I would simply like to mention one or two cases that are not addressed very often. Specifically on the subject of prisons, but not those for terrorists, I would like to point out the truly inhumane conditions of the prisons in Rwanda and in Libya, where totally innocent people held in detention are sentenced to death. Furthermore, I would like to mention the issue of the Sahrawi people, which has remained unresolved for so long now, and I would also like to mention the rights of climate refugees who are driven from their countries by dramatic forms of climate change.

Madam President, Mr Carlgren, Mr Dimas, ladies and gentlemen, this morning I would like to talk about an 84-year-old missionary, Father Ettore Turrini, who has spent 59 years in the north-west of the Amazon. He has always fought to protect the indigenous people and their forest from anyone seeking to destroy them in the name of short-term interests. In travelling round the forest, Father Ettore has had seven air accidents, but he has carried on and has obtained tens of thousands of signatures through his activities, which he will submit to President Lula, to many ministers and to the Italian President, Mr Napolitano. He has been indefatigable. We met last Sunday and I told him that I fully shared his position, but that perhaps the world is coming to its senses and reaching the conclusion that these forests are essential as the world’s lung, for the local climate and also for carbon capture and storage. I told him that in Copenhagen, we will also find resources to compensate those countries that keep the forests intact. I told him that we are setting up monitoring instruments – GPS and INSPIRE – to measure how governments behave and that by 2030, we will put a stop to deforestation. In Copenhagen, we will be able to do all this and I will participate in the summit on behalf of Father Turrini as well.Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 As it stands, the management of intergovernmental agreements between individual Member States and third countries is more complex than ever before. Not only do we not know their exact number, but since there is no obligation to inform the Commission and the other Member States, we find ourselves faced with agreements that contradict or are incompatible with EU legislation on the energy market. Consequently, a set of regulations that brings about a clear break with the past seems equally urgent. Hence, legislation should require final agreements to be notified to the Commission and made subject to its approval. Moreover, it would be a good idea if the Commission were to be granted an ex ante
 compliance check, thus avoiding any time and resources being wasted. Unfortunately, however, this approach – which is the only option that is really compatible with the very idea of the EU – is once again being steamrollered by the interests of the Member States and their desire to act freely in delicate areas like the energy sector. It is nevertheless regrettable to note that the moderate and conservative forces of this House have also taken the same position, while they should always seek to ensure that EU interests take precedence.

 The quality package proposed by the Commission aims to establish a coherent legal framework for the EU’s policy on agricultural product quality. The proposal is, overall, worthy of support, thanks especially to the changes and amendments made by this House. Specifically, it is of the utmost importance to recognise the role, importance and responsibilities of producer groups, which can and must play a crucial role in product protection and marketing according to the established standards, thereby limiting the risks of abuse or, even worse, counterfeiting, as far as possible. I feel compelled, in particular, to highlight the changes made regarding the traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) scheme. In this case, the Commission’s proposal seemed incongruous and detrimental, especially the idea to abolish TSGs without reservation of the name, forcing associations to repeat the whole bureaucratic process to get new recognition. Thanks to Parliament, good sense prevailed instead. We believe that the introduction of a simplified procedure for TSGs registered without reservation of the name can ensure their survival and, above all, extend safeguards and reduce counterfeiting, benefiting producers and consumers alike.

 The management of highly migratory fish stocks calls for the constant cooperation and direct consultation among the countries whose fleets exploit such stocks, avoiding the risk of unilateral action that could be potentially harmful to long-term resource sustainability. Moreover, the EU has the responsibility to ensure that this cooperation requirement is respected and that Member States do not take unilateral action in disregard of the general interest in the conservation of the marine ecosystem. However, beside effective measures, in order to fulfil this task it is necessary to endow the EU with appropriate monitoring tools. As with other sectors, unbridled competition among the Member States may have adverse consequences. I have thus chosen to support the measures in the directive, in particular those designed to impose quantitative restrictions on EU fish imports, in cases where the fish is caught from stocks of common interest under the supervision of a third country. Similarly, I welcome the introduction of tools that can ensure that such measures are effective, proportionate and compatible with international legislation, as well as meeting environmental, commercial, economic and social standards.

 The report is one of the cornerstones of the reform of the common fisheries policy in that it increases the sector’s competitiveness, particularly for producers. It also includes aspects of prime importance for the health and confidence of consumers in the sector. In this respect, safeguarding the interests of consumers and satisfying their demands for clarity and transparency should be the goal of our common policies, because they can become a way of encouraging people to spend. This is all the more important during a slump in sales, when all the indicators show that people tend to purchase goods in a more conscious and informed way, which means they look for quality. That is why we are firmly convinced that the product packaging should show not the date when the fish were landed but the date on which they were actually caught. The landing date, however, which is supported by the moderates and conservatives, is not only misleading for the consumer but also unduly favours large fleets that are able to stay at sea for several days over smaller vessels that can only stay at sea for a few hours. Once again, we would have expected a more rational attitude from the moderates, who seem to have given in to the interests of the larger groups. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 Negotiations on energy efficiency measures are proving increasingly difficult and complex, particularly because of some large Member States which are not always fully prepared to support ambitious agreements and perspectives which, in the short term, may give rise to costs and negative effects on their competitiveness. In this case too, despite some improvements, we are faced with a directive which, although it contributes to achieving the 20% energy efficiency target by 2020, will not be sufficient in itself (a result between 15 and 17% is estimated). In our view, there will thus have to be an increased commitment to ensuring that long-term perspectives and requirements find a way to establish themselves in the face of the selfish interests which, in the short-term, can have a strong influence on Member States’ governments and, in particular, at a time of acute economic crisis. A structural and lasting solution to this crisis must instead be sought in measures that address and solve the roots of the serious issue of energy poverty. We need to think afresh about the way out of this situation. It is not possible to return to the production and consumption models that preceded the crisis and therefore we need to be ambitious and courageous in order to create new opportunities and new jobs.

 I chose to defend and strongly support Mr Färm’s report because – in addition to its content as a whole – I would argue that it represents an extraordinary turning point both in the relationship between institutions and for the future of EU economic policy. For the first time, the European institutions have paved the way for testing project bonds, or rather for one of the instruments for which Parliament has often expressed its support. While noting that unfortunately, the conditions needed to actually start implementing European bonds in a fuller and more forceful way still do not seem to be in place, today’s report opens up the possibility of testing the will of other European institutions to following the declarations. Implementing connecting trans-European infrastructure is of key importance strategically and therefore lends itself extremely well to testing the issuance of bonds intended to finance infrastructure projects. I fully support this report, and I hope that other European institutions agree that we need to find new ways to finance strategic investments in order to relaunch the European economy.

 The entire Mediterranean basin shares the same natural environment, and its shores are connected by the same history and culture. Significant opportunities exist in southern Europe, which cannot be seized without coordination or vision. The ‘Mediterranean climate’ results in similar ecotypes: the same types of agricultural product are produced and form a single, albeit diverse, range of products. Likewise, environmental problems are the same all over. Mediterranean biodiversity is particularly abundant, but also under serious threat. Appropriate, synergistic responses are called for. Within the EU, the Mediterranean area is unstructured and its performance in terms of cooperation and interconnection is very poor. Moreover, outside the gates of the EU, those populations living in the Mediterranean region have very low standards of living, despite last year’s events. The development of these societies is an essential requirement for them, and an opportunity for Europe as it could capitalise on greater security, more ‘sustainable’ control of immigration flows and direct participation in this growth area. This would positively impact on the performance of its own economy. For these and many other reasons, it is important to support the establishment of a Mediterranean macro-region.

The adoption of this regulation sends a clear signal of support for the safety of the millions of European workers and citizens who travel every day on Europe’s roads. Thanks to Parliament’s hard work, significant amendments have been made to meet the demands voiced on many occasions by trade unions, workers and many small enterprises: the introduction of tachographs for all heavy goods vehicles weighing in excess of 2.8 tonnes and the introduction of weight sensors are two clear examples of the good work done during recent months within the committee and then in the Chamber. Too often, the needs of the market and strong competition between operators adversely affect working and health conditions for lorry drivers, and also seriously jeopardise the safety of the millions of European citizens on the EU’s roads and motorways. The balance that has been achieved in this regulation between the needs for security and control and the flexibility to be given to self-employed workers and small enterprises is an excellent outcome, and has therefore been broadly supported by the majority of MEPs.

 It is evident that it will be difficult to achieve the Europe 2020 goals on employment rates, and yet, in the serious crisis we are going through, the strong and effective effort needed to reverse this trend is missing from national reform programmes. Commitment to younger generations has shown no sign of a turnaround, and yet in the discussion on future cohesion policy the Union has the opportunity to specify and introduce performance mechanisms into the regulations being examined by Parliament so that every euro spent under the new multiannual financial framework (MFF) is aimed at creating new, good-quality youth employment. A European investment strategy should be launched, centred on infrastructure modernisation, human capital and laying the foundations for a sustainable economy. To finance this initiative, the Union must add additional resources to its budget: these exist and mechanisms must be found to make them available. It is therefore necessary to introduce a tax on financial transactions, to set up an EU-wide strategy to reduce fraud and tax evasion and to allow Eurobonds to be issued. Without these tools, the risk of an irreversible decline and marginalisation of Europe’s economy and policy on the world stage will become more and more real. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 I decided to vote against the report by Mr Gauzès because, once again and for the umpteenth time, it employs a rationale that I did not and do not think is valid and that, as time has gone on, has played a crucial part in the worsening of Europe’s economic and social situation. I have fought and I contest the theory that the underlying cause of the crisis is to be found in the high number of countries that have been unable to put their budgets in order. On the contrary, the facts demonstrate that this is a crisis of growth and of a lack of investment. Confronted with this reality, the recipe put to us once again is mistaken and will once again prove to be counterproductive. In the past, we have fought hard against this outlook, opposing and voting against the ‘six-pack’. Since then, faced with a deterioration in the economic and, above all, social situation, rather than championing a change of direction and a radical change of gear, we have been going backwards, casting out the economic analyses which, in reality and in contrast to those from the right which have put us in this situation, we know to be right and potentially capable of putting a stop to what is becoming an irresistibly slippery slope.

 I decided, albeit reluctantly, to vote against the report because I think it is totally insufficient and inadequate for dealing with the pressing and mounting problems that this social and economic crisis has forced upon us. I decided to vote against because I think the growth measures that the report introduces are completely insufficient. Without even considering that the golden rule, albeit in a minimalist and even innocuous form, was rejected, the other growth measures also do not seem much compared with the straitjacket of austerity and the blind respect of budgetary restraints. The redemption fund, the groundwork for eurobonds and Heading 3 have been approved by a very narrow majority, due to the staunch opposition of conservatives, who, having obtained approval for austerity measures, have done everything to boycott all references to investment. That says a lot about what the Council’s attitude will be. We must find the courage to relaunch our ideas and initiatives with fresh vigour. If not, we will be complicit in the vacuity of the conservatives and their inability to improve Europe’s future prospects. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

Madam President, that the situation is dramatic is there for all to see. Add to this drama the fact that there is a clear gap between what we say, denounce and debate in this House and in the other European institutions and what we tangibly do for the younger generations in Europe. It is this gap that we have to close; this is the effort we have to make. In this regard, I propose two questions and two corresponding suggestions. The first is this. Can we bring in a constraint, even a legally binding one, such that in the coming years or months, every euro spent must be on policies for youth employment, thus creating the conditions for a true European platform/plan for youth employment? Let us not forget that the resources at our disposal are very limited. The second is that in the coming weeks, project bonds worth EUR 230 million are due to be issued. Can we give priority to projects which are able to increase youth employment in the short term? Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 The report proposes to help the Member States most affected by the financial crisis and unable to guarantee the necessary private funding for completing revenue-generating infrastructures. Private partners are not in a position to invest due to liquidity problems and the difficulties in accessing loans, so part of individual Member States’ financial allocations to the Commission is to be transferred in order to create a fund to cover the risks linked to the loans. This means that, in order to allow the completion of ongoing works, some Member States will in fact deprive themselves of part of their allocated funds. As far as we are concerned, while we support the instrument, we should have preferred intervention of a more structural nature for dealing with the endemic lack of liquidity in many Member States, in order to improve expenditure performance and avoid having to resort to drastic measures that could reduce resources. In this regard we are convinced that these difficulties could be overcome by introducing a derogation from the Stability and Growth Pact, in order to allow the national cofinancing of projects considered particularly important for economic recovery and job creation.

 The resolution retraces the link between effective measures to stimulate growth and defining a clear and united EU strategy for halving tax evasion by 2020. Lost revenues caused by the underground economy has pernicious effects on the European economy and a negative impact on the amounts invested in growth and employment. By recovering these lost revenues (20% of public spending and some 105.8% of total health spending), governments could wipe out their public debt in eight or nine years. At the same time, they would be able to increase public investment, helping towards the achievement of the goals of the EU 2020 strategy. We therefore welcome EU-wide initiatives and strategies that will cut back bilateral agreements and bring an end to banking secrecy, accelerating the exchange of information. Combating tax evasion must become an absolute priority for the EU. So far, much has been said but little has been done; now is the time to take incisive action. Paying taxes is a basic civic duty and a matter of social justice that can generate the funds required for leaving the crisis behind and reviving the real economy, without once again heaping further burdens on workers and the most vulnerable sections of society.

 The updating of Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 and Regulation (EC) No 987/2009, which we are approving at first reading today, thanks to the agreement already reached with the Danish Presidency – needed to reflect the changes in the legislation of Member States on social security and coordination of social security systems – is a text that is widely supported by this House as it has succeeded in accommodating the positive needs of the sector trade unions.

 The report deserves to be supported, especially because it underlines the fact that cohesion policy – by its very nature – has to take into account the specific characteristics of regions and of outermost regions, but, more generally, that it has to take into account all specific features. The very existence of funding for the ‘cohesion’ of regions with different levels of development in fact presupposes the need to operate in situations that are structurally diverse, in terms of their geographic features or socio-economic gap. To deny this basic fact would be to deny the very aims of cohesion policy, and the report also needs to represent a reminder when the regulations for the future 2014-2020 cohesion policy are being defined. Alongside the need to focus efforts on objectives that are considered to be fundamental, it is important to remember that, in order to achieve these very objectives, the different starting conditions of the areas in which the instruments are actually operating have to be borne in mind. If this is not done, efforts could be not only in vain, but even counter-productive. In addition, the report is also an opportunity to reiterate that future funding must absolutely not be less than at present. We can only get through the crisis by revitalising investment and, even more so in disadvantaged areas, the EU institutions have a duty to prepare the ground in order to make this possible.

 The necessity for the international economy to orient itself increasingly towards a system of production based on the reduction of carbon emissions is one that is being imposed on us by the ever more imminent risk of irreparable climate change, as well as by the need to move our system of production gradually away from the consumption of finite resources. Given all that, the obstinacy with which the forces of the right have wanted to put forward the nuclear option again seems simply incomprehensible, and in many ways also outside time and history. It is outside time and history, as are all recommendations on the safety of nuclear power stations, which have several times been served up to us and promptly been refuted by the facts. It is still more unthinkable in a country such as Italy, where almost 30 years after power stations were decommissioned, we still have waste heaps that have not been disposed of and where, not long ago, a new referendum firmly rejected the reintroduction of nuclear power. We therefore demand that a correct objective, the reduction of emissions and the transition to an economy based on renewable sources, should not become the pretext for allowing a means that has proved to be unsafe and dangerous, and one which Europeans have for this reason chosen to replace, creep in again by the back door.

 Since it marks only the first step in the long and tortuous route to the adoption of the 2013 EU Budget, the adoption of the ‘general guidelines’ has to be the occasion for strongly emphasising the role of Parliament in future negotiations, especially with the Council, with the powerful aim of influencing the guidelines to be adopted by the Commission in its draft budget. It must be clear here and now that the budget approach cannot avoid the urgency of restarting sustainable growth and quality employment, in line with the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. The European Commission and the Council cannot continue down the path of austerity that leaves no margin for the requirements of economic growth capable of generating new jobs. We have the duty to identify measures supportive of growth and employment and finally go beyond the mere requirement of balancing investment and austerity. For our part, moreover, there is a pressing need to draw attention to the worrying payment situation: we must not allow a repetition of what happened in 2011 and 2012, and the Council can no longer purport to decide a priori
 the level of payments based on political considerations, without taking into account the repercussions on past commitments. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 The vote on this own-initiative report gives us the chance to emphasise the need to plan and open a Commission initiative to re-launch the Statute for a European cooperative society as soon as possible. We have to see the adoption of this report as an incentive to take action in the shortest possible timeframe and not fail to grasp the important opportunity provided by the UN having declared 2012 to be the International Year of Cooperatives. The fact that only 17 cooperatives out of around 160 000 in Europe have signed up to the Statute shows the urgency of intervening to make the Statute more attractive, though without losing sight of its most important and positive aspects. The value of cooperatives in the European economy is common knowledge and, during our debate, it became clear just why cooperatives have managed to withstand the economic crisis better than other business types. It is therefore our duty to support them and to work vigorously and consistently to promote the European cooperative society as a positive framework for the development of European cooperatives.

 It is universally accepted that, during this prolonged economic crisis, the EU institutions should lead by example in implementing austerity and rigour, starting by freezing their administrative budgets. This should be done in a manner that is both effective and tangible, so as to be credible as regards the sacrifices that we are asking our fellow citizens to make day after day. Making savings, strengthening interinstitutional cooperation, sharing best practices between institutions and modernising policies on human resources, technology and environmental policy can, and must, become strategic objectives for the European Union institutions. This vote allows us to stress once again and with greater clout the fact that we must counter the need for drastic cuts in unproductive spending by multiplying our efforts to free up and make as many more resources available as possible so that we can get the global economy back on track as soon as possible and return hope to those who now easily succumb to the sirens of populist, anti-European sentiment. Citizens’ opinions of the institutions that govern them depend on the institutions’ ability to come across as sensitive to their needs and to the current difficulties, and, most importantly, the ability to put together suitable policies in order to ensure that we recover from this crisis as soon as possible.

 Parliament’s confirmation of the guidelines for the employment policies of Member States adopted by the Council in 2010 is an act that is not completed by a mere formality, even if the committee responsible voted to follow the simplified procedure. We have had the opportunity to hold another debate on the initiatives Member States will have to adopt in order to achieve the Europe 2020 strategy objectives, and to respond, in particular, to the by now unsustainable unemployment situation that young Europeans, more than anyone else, are facing. Opportunities such as this, and the Annual Growth Survey and its transformation into ‘annual guidelines for sustainable growth’, on which we are being asked to vote, allow us to make the future of the young generations of Europeans the focus of our debate and to play an active and immediate role in the interaction between Member States and the European Commission.

 The report follows the controversial confirmation of the European programme for providing aid to the needy. The text is a compromise between those who were in favour of the programme’s continuation and those who wished to see it come to an end. Therefore, the compromise reached avoids the risk of a sudden end to the programme which would have threatened the survival of that sector of the population which is dependent on this food aid. Recent statistics have shown that the crisis is affecting increasingly large and central areas of the continent. This means that increasingly wide sections of the population in rich countries risk finding themselves in poverty. In this context, the attitude of those who, in the name of futile austerity, insist on rejecting such important interventions which have such a limited impact on the EU budget seems increasingly short-sighted and counterproductive. This compromise is very welcome and a new agreement to guarantee the programme’s funding for the future would be especially welcome. In any case, the hope is to investigate the possibility of strengthening the campaign against food wastage, with a programme capable of using recovered food through distribution and rational use, and redistributing it to the weakest and most at-risk sectors.

 The crisis has highlighted the lack of direction in the dairy product market, making regulations to stabilise farmers’ incomes and improve transparency in the trade a matter of urgency. The long period of fixed quotas and high institutional prices, which created guaranteed outlets, has paralysed the market. The participants in the production chain have not been forced to respond to market indicators and had no incentive to innovate and increase productivity. However, we need to do the best we can to secure a smooth transition to the complete abolition of quotas, avoiding an overly inflexible and abrupt effect that could increase the risks faced by the sector and producers. Accordingly, the switch to advance contracts for the delivery of raw milk between producers and dairies looks to be capable of re-balancing bargaining power, particularly because it allows for joint negotiation of conditions through producer organisations. In the same vein, we welcome the possibility of planning and managing the volumes of certified quality (protected designation of origin – PDO) dairy products, as requested by Parliament. Consequently, it is essential that the urgent reform of the system does not cause problems for producers of the very best of the EU exports. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 I should like to point out the most positive aspects of this report, which offer a good rendering of Parliament’s position on the growth and employment survey. It is very important that the Commission, the Council and the Member States take all necessary steps to ensure that the headline targets of the Europe 2020 strategy are met on employment, education and poverty reduction. In particular, the level of youth unemployment in Europe means that specific measures need to be taken as a matter of urgency and the report puts forward a helpful method to support young people, ensuring that every young person in the EU is offered a job, an apprenticeship or additional training after a maximum period of four months’ unemployment. In terms of instruments capable of providing for financial cover, the report also calls for the introduction of a tax on financial transactions, which the report claims is one issue where the EU cannot remain inactive and to which Parliament must offer robust support. Lastly, it is important to strengthen Parliament’s role in identifying instruments for growth, which is the reason for the clear request to the Commission to transform the Annual Growth Survey into Annual Sustainable Growth Guidelines in future years, thereby allowing us to propose amendments.

 By adopting this report and the corresponding report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs (EMPL), Parliament has taken up very clear positions vis-à-vis the Commission and the Council with regard to the policies that must be in place as soon as possible in order to boost growth and employment. Too many Member States have lost sight of the headline targets of the Europe 2020 objectives on employment, education and reducing poverty. They have focused solely on the sovereign debt crisis and remained blind to the fact that only medium- and long-term measures capable of fuelling growth – namely, education, research, innovation and energy – can provide the answers to the tough period that the Union has been going through for too long. The call for the introduction of project bonds to finance key infrastructure projects, as well as the call in EMPL’s report for the introduction of a tax on financial transactions are useful proposals that can no longer be delayed, and Parliament is ready to get behind them. Lastly, the proposal on making the Annual Growth Survey subject to a codecision procedure does justice to the fundamental role that Parliament could have in the debate on the future of European growth and identifying development policies.

 The directive is certainly progressing towards better management of humanitarian funds, starting with improved transparency and more vigorous checks to prevent fraud and corruption. Above all, it is essential to take action to remedy the general character of the reports submitted, from which it is particularly difficult to obtain sufficient information on the results, output and outcome of projects. Furthermore, I welcome the report’s strong emphasis on the need to create continuity between emergency interventions and development programmes. In particular, it might be worthwhile considering a period of cooperation between emergency bodies and development bodies by implementing some form of transfer of deliveries. It is only with difficulty that those who effectively manage emergencies then also prove ready to deal with the problems associated with development projects. It is vital to go beyond the current system which risks creating discontinuity, cancelling out or undermining the potential long-term results. Lastly, the call for greater visibility for actions, not for ‘publicity’ purposes, but to enable better streamlining of interventions, is valuable and should be supported. This is why I voted in favour, and we must hope that account is taken of the recommendations contained in the report during the process of reform of the framework partnership agreement (FPA).

 A regulation defining collective redress is not only desirable but it is also urgent and cannot be delayed, especially when we consider that, in the majority of cases, the ‘collective’ victims come from the weakest sections of the population, both in terms of education and from an economic perspective. This implies that, in the majority of cases, the infringements perpetrated against these groups go unpunished due to economic barriers (the cost of an individual case being disproportionate to the possible compensation) and psychological ones (fears about the length of procedures) and difficulties in accessing the necessary information. Vice versa, bundling the claims would not only strengthen their legal position but would also make it possible to simplify the processes and reduce their costs. On the other hand, there remain quite a few problems, both with regard to the different jurisdictions in individual Member States and to the need to curb misuse of the instrument. In any event, it is advisable for the EU to have a common horizontal approach to the issue, without following the US class action model and without amending national laws, and to establish a horizontal reference framework instrument that enables citizens and companies to enforce their rights under EU legislation.

 First of all, I must point out that I intend to vote in favour of the resolution, even if only in order to maintain the unity of Parliament and to strengthen the position of its President within the European institutions. In this sense, I appreciate the reference to the failure to involve the President of Parliament in the informal meetings held as part of the European summits, an infringement of rights that should be quite rightly condemned and deplored. The problem is also one of defending and reinforcing the positions of political groups fighting for a united Europe, which are confident that the crisis can only be satisfactorily resolved if tackled in a unified manner and if the risk of nationalistic, egotistical breakaway tendencies is prevented. Every day, these groups, particularly in some areas of continental Europe, have to deal with demagogical and populist propaganda that denigrates the EU and its institutions. Our vote is also one of support for these forces. However, it is also important to emphasise that Europe cannot be bound up and represented only by the austerity measures in the ‘six-pack’, a measure we opposed because we felt it was wrong, and which we still believe to be both incomplete and inadequate. We are therefore voting for a strong and united Europe that will once more combine growth and social equity. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 The report results from complaints submitted by European citizens and shows how weak the role of the European institutions and their directives can be if they are not adequately backed up by a comprehensive monitoring network. Accordingly, the report primarily represents an extraordinary demonstration of how a democratic process originating from the grassroots can work and bring results. In particular, the report highlights the serious delays in implementing the Waste Directive in some areas of Europe, as well as numerous violations of it, including: excessive dependence on landfills, in breach of waste disposal policies; a lack of transparency in procedures for assessing the impact on the environment; and the inaccessibility of information for citizens. In any case, the recent issues affecting Campania – one of the regions discussed in the report – have shown that tangible results can be achieved if the EU method is pursued to fruition, using all the available – and perhaps coercive – tools, making it possible to overcome flaws and structural shortcomings. The role of citizens and their petitions is to be welcomed, but even more so the ability of the European institutions to fully comprehend their strength and their role. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 The growing number of countries with which the EU has reached an agreement on the protection of geographical indications (GIs) must be welcomed. The results of this go well beyond economic figures and reflect on the prestige and good name of the outstanding products of European agriculture and foodstuff production. All too often, instances of vacatio legis
 enable the international distribution of brands that fraudulently imitate the packaging of GI products, even though they do not match their characteristics. This is misleading for consumers and hurts both the profits and the image of businesses that strive every day to keep up the quality standards of protected goods. Recently, a striking case involved the exportation to the United States of fake San Marziano tomatoes. Even faced with the evidence of this abuse, the Commission admitted it could not step in because there is no bilateral agreement in place with the US for the protection of registered trademarks; for the right to protection to be granted, we would have had to appeal under the relevant US regulations. This is a paradoxical situation, which needs to be sorted out in short order. By voting in favour of this recommendation, we want to take the opportunity to ask that the time required to manage these agreements be cut down. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

The exponential growth in waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) means that hard-hitting changes to the legislation governing its recycling and production cannot be put off. The growth in the sector is directly proportional to the effect on the Europe 2020 objectives for a resource-efficient economy: to achieve this, national legislation is no longer sufficient; what is needed is systematic European legislation. In line with these objectives, in addition to avoiding further damage to the environment and in order to hold on to precious resources, what we need are high collection rates, appropriate recycling standards, targeted action against illegal exports and a fairer distribution of responsibilities and costs between producers, consumers and public authorities. Parliament’s amended text seems to be in line with these requirements and, in addition, puts forward two particularly sensitive aspects that deserve attention and support. Firstly, it includes eco-design, not only with regard to energy consumption standards, but also with regard to a simplification of the procedures for dismantling or recovery of raw materials. Equally important is the requirement for the costs incurred in the recovery and treatment of raw materials to become an integral part of the product’s price, so as to form an incentive for the purchase of products with lower impacts. I voted for this recommendation for these reasons. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 The report is part of the debate on the CAP 2020 reform, seeking to guide its content, in order to better adapt it to the significant challenges that farmers will face, and seeking to turn those challenges from potential risk factors into opportunities to advance the process to transform agriculture in an environmentally sustainable and energy-efficient way. To achieve these results, without jeopardising the survival of a large portion of small operators, especially those located in the outermost areas of the continent, it is necessary to take action on those levers that make running farms economically sustainable. The report sets out actions to eliminate distortions which, upstream, limit farms’ profitability. All Eurostat findings come together to show the disparity between the increase in input costs and that of farm gate prices. The report, which I voted in favour of, has the merit of precisely indicating the sectors for action, both hoping for an enhanced and more constant commitment to tackling the formation of cartels among suppliers of the main inputs (seeds and fertilisers), and setting out an environmentally sustainable and economically beneficial transformation of resource supply systems.

 That the level reached by the data on food waste has an ethical significance, as well as a social, economic and environmental one, is no longer surprising. Yet, despite the ever increasing amounts – according to Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) estimates, it may even reach 50% of the total produced – of goods lost along the entire food chain, in Europe, there is still no clear, unambiguous and uniform definition of the concept of ‘food waste’. As if that were not enough, just a few months ago, we had to fight a fierce battle to refinance the fund for the distribution of food to the needy. In contrast to this is the data, deplorable in many ways, according to which Europeans and North Americans waste up to 115 kilograms of food per capita. This situation is no longer acceptable but, at the same time, it is hard to resolve. One of the main virtues of this report is that it does not reduce the problem to its most obvious manifestation – waste generated by the end consumer – which, however deplorable, is but one part of a broader and more complex problem. Conversely, we need to identify intervention strategies tailored to the specific causes of waste for each of the five sectors (production, storage, processing, distribution, consumption) that make up the food supply chain.

 The work carried out at the conciliation table by the European Parliament delegation is both praiseworthy and positive. The financial conditions of Member States meant that no more could have been achieved. Yet difficult times like these require the will and the courage to make innovative political choices that in some ways represent a break with the past. The conservatism of some Member States (especially, but not only Germany) is dangerously slowing down the process leading to the introduction of measures which, conversely, increasingly appear to be both urgent and unavoidable. At the same time as the budget lines were being approved, not without difficulty, the Commission was beginning consultations about the eurobonds, which were met with a negative reaction by some national governments. However, eurobonds are just part of the possible solution. In the 2012 budget, the evident widening of the gap between commitments for appropriations and payments is symptomatic of how the current system of delivering EU resources is inefficient and inadequate, and that it is therefore time it was changed to reflect an actual system of own resources based not only on the tax on financial transactions (TFT) and a new value-added tax (VAT), but also on a new way of taxing energy sources.

 The need to introduce a framework of legal certainty that would oversee a common practice, in other words, the use of a financial instrument which was included in the previous general regulation and not in Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 and which has continued to play an important part in the management of unit trusts, is in response to clear evidence of its functionality. It is no coincidence that Member States have continued to use them, even in the absence of clear indications. It was therefore certainly urgent to clarify and increase the transparency of procedures. However, we wish to express particular support for the provision for re-use of the reimbursed assistance, which would be managed in a separate account and used for the same purposes. This instrument would guarantee suitable and effective reinvestment of the funds, and could also be a way to alleviate pressure on cofinancing by Member States. Overall, the granting of repayable funds and the setting up of a special credit line for individual beneficiaries to use both seem to be moving towards an expansion of the range of funding possibilities, which is all the more important at a time of serious financial difficulty for many Member States. For this reason, I have to support this report. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 There can be no disagreement with support for a measure which represents a real and substantial breath of fresh air for Member States with the greatest economic and financial difficulties. In the same way, there can be no opposition to backing a measure which represents an attempt to maximise the use of European funding, avoiding the risk of funds not being spent due to a lack of available funds on the part of Member States, and of a consequent further deterioration and weakening of economic and social conditions. Although limited to Member States that have had access to financial stability mechanisms, the measure should therefore be supported and approved without further ado. However, this does not mean that we should not draw attention to the fact that it is a demonstration of the failure of the stability pact and ‘six-pack’ as wished for and approved by the right-wing majority in the Commission and Parliament. More specifically, this ‘contingent’ action restricts itself to mitigating the effects, which are, by their nature, ‘structural’, of the vicious cycle created, in particular, by the failure to exclude appropriations for investments from the rigid criteria of the stability pact, also because of the failure to introduce a golden rule on investments. Stop-gap measures are welcome, provided we are aware that the strategy pursued was wrong and that corrective structural measures are urgently required. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 In the European collective mentality, the image of literacy as a goal to achieve suggests areas outside the continent or, at the most, limited, peripheral areas. However, it is also a problem in ‘western’ and ‘industrialised’ areas. It is no coincidence that recent studies have shown that in Italy, 71% of the population is below the minimum comprehension threshold of an average difficulty text. Despite these statistics, no coordinated policies to tackle the problem have been found in the individual Member States, which will make it difficult to achieve the target set for 2020. It is important, in line with the European platform for tackling poverty, to underline that there is a need to coordinate the two areas of action, creating a synergy able to reverse the rate at which ‘poverty’ affects the percentages of early school leaving and, more generally, of poor school attendance. National governments, in the grip of the financial crisis, have almost all reduced educational funding. This risks boosting the vicious cycle of ‘low school attendance-unemployment’. This is why it has become so much more important for the European institutions to take action and provide support, through the targeted use of Structural Funds and implementation of alternative financial instruments.

 It would be unthinkable, including in terms of the developments under the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), not to support the association agreement with Ukraine, which, moreover, has a fundamental strategic role in such an essential sector as energy resources. However, the well-known political and judicial issues cannot be considered of secondary import. Hence, as Ms Tymoshenko herself said recently, we need to strengthen the political significance, which must go hand in hand with the economic and commercial aspects of the agreement. As the document under scrutiny suggests, this must become the mechanism for incentivising development and the onward march of reform. This is by no means an easy path, as the rejection of the amendment decriminalising the abuse of power and the continued imprisonment of Ms Tymoshenko and other opposition figures show. This is not a matter of meddling in the domestic affairs of a sovereign state, but of shrewd and active supervision of the personal and political freedoms that are basic conditions for rapprochement with the EU. Support for the agreement must therefore be understood in this light, without losing any respect for the rights of minorities and democratic principles, which are, in any case, well expressed in the document itself.

rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, policies to tackle new and old forms of poverty, which, unfortunately, are on the rise in today’s Europe and in the Europe of the crisis of recent times, along with one-sided austerity policies, above all, on the part of the Member States, require new financial commitments and new resources not only with regard to the European budget, including within the framework of financial prospects, but also with regard to European policies – as just mentioned – from the European Social Fund to the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), as well as to the budgets of individual Member States. Above all, as regards individual states, we should utilise the European Semester to monitor year after year, in practical terms, the policies they dedicate to this fundamental challenge. In order to give credibility to the objective to reduce poverty and social exclusion for around 20 million European citizens, it is necessary to have coherence between the enormous resources that Europe and the States should make available and the concrete policies that we can put into practice. It is calculated that around EUR 2 billion are needed between now and 2020 in order to realise the objectives that we are proposing. The challenge that we as the Committee on Budgets are identifying and focusing on is this: coherence between the financial resources that we make available and the policies that we put into practice. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D
),  
in writing.

In the context of the very broadest aims of the Europe 2020 strategy, the European platform against poverty and social exclusion should be thought of in view of the unique characteristics of what is an intrinsically complex, multifaceted and multiform phenomenon which, as the economic crisis has made itself felt, has taken on even more striking and worrying dimensions. The gradual increase in the number of areas affected, or at risk of being dragged into a state of poverty or ‘severe material deprivation’ as a result of the financial crisis, means that we have to strengthen and differentiate our responses. Vice-versa, we are watching with concern at the distortive effects which, in this sector too, may be caused by the reckless decision not to exclude investment from Stability Pact funds. Even in a context of scarce financial resources, the platform offers a positive message that is in line with the need to develop specific, Europe-wide, socio-economic initiatives, moving beyond mere emergency action or temporary support and thus heralding a genuine reversal of this trend. Specifically, it highlights the importance of launching a much sought-after global initiative to bring in a guaranteed minimum income rule, which – if it can be adjusted to and made compatible with economic development – will help reduce and prevent poverty and social exclusion.

 Demographic change, as underlined in the Fifth Report on cohesion, poses one of the central challenges for the future of the European socio-economic system, and it is a challenge with a wide territorial context that cuts deeply into the management of services and infrastructures. Without in any way detracting from the task of individual Member States, this challenge, which could also become an opportunity, directly implicates European institutions and, in particular, regional development policies. These policies are characterised by different strategies that are adapted to guaranteeing the demands and needs, respectively, of areas with populations on the rise and in decline, as well as the varying needs of urban and rural areas. In response to these challenges, European Funds (both the ERDF and the ESF) can be used comprehensively to ensure that equilibrium is restored to demands and, to this end, we should welcome the prospect of also making use of specific demographic indicators to assign European funds as well as to redistribute finances at the level of individual States. I express my vote in favour in the hope for policies capable of correlating the effects of demographic change with the fight against old and new poverty. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

The exhaust emission limits for agricultural and forestry tractors were changed in 2005. When that change was introduced, the requirements were also applied in full to agricultural tractor engines without any specific impact assessment concerning the technical feasibility of doing so. However, there have clearly been difficulties in applying the measure to tractors – generically called ‘narrow-track tractors’ – used for automated cultivation procedures on terrain which presents certain distinctive features, such as orchards and vineyards. The technical impossibility of installing compliant engines, whilst maintaining the tractors’ operational functionality and manoeuvrability, if not corrected, would cause serious difficulties to some of the most advanced and productive agricultural sectors, further exacerbating the effects of the ongoing economic crisis. In complete compliance with the European policy to fight for emission reduction, which needs to be developed, the current unusual situation in the economy in general, and the sector in particular, fully justifies the decision to postpone the application of the standards for three years. This will allow the parallel development of the essential design and technology necessary for the application, also to narrow-track tractors, of after-treatment systems able to guarantee compliance with emission restrictions, without compromising operational requirements.

 The procedure which began with the publication of the Green Paper on the future of value-added tax (VAT) has to be supported. The need to restructure the system rules out any further delays, as the mechanism introduced on a provisional basis has proved to have numerous shortcomings, particularly with regard to the risk of fraud. The hope for the future is that a new VAT system, together with the taxation of financial transactions, will, as the Commission claims, become an important own resource for the European budget. In the meantime, we invite the Commission to act quickly and to continue along its chosen path to the end, actively encouraging Member States to put in place all the necessary preliminary conditions in order to avoid multiple and overlapping elements and to allow for smoother bureaucratic procedures and reduced administration costs. In times of trouble, it is important to devote significant energies to fighting the waste of resources caused by evasion and fraud. Therefore, I support the report by Mr Casa, and hope that in its proposal, the Commission will take due account, above all, of the call to adopt mechanisms to make cross-border fraud control less random, by making optimal use of mechanisms that have already been tried and tested in individual Member States, or by using all the resources made available by the latest technology.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the structure of the cohesion policy we are debating today is very commendable. I would like to focus these few comments on three issues. Firstly, I consider cohesion policy to be one of the fundamental tools for reducing imbalances between and within Member States. It is therefore also one of the fundamental policies for combating the long economic and financial crisis that we have been experiencing for some years now. Secondly, I think the idea of involving new regions and citizens in cohesion policy is a sound one. However, we would do well to discuss these issues with a clearer idea of how much this new policy will cost, what effects it will have on general cohesion policy, and how we are going to distribute the resources in the context of the reform of the financial perspective from here to 2020. Finally, I think the central role of the urban issue in cohesion policy is decisive. It is important to have made some progress in this direction with Mr Vlasák’s report, with which I strongly agree, and I believe that this report will allow us to better define the legal framework of the urban issue and also to introduce tools such as the municipal operational programmes as operational programmes capable of giving a new quality to cohesion policy. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are about to vote on a highly important strategic document that provides a solid framework of reference for financial perspectives after 2013. It begins with the request for coherence between objectives and instruments, and between the new role that the European institutions must perform – in the light of the Treaty of Lisbon and the recession – and the resources that, together, we decide to invest. Such coherence also implies a serious response to the demand for innovation from the public, from the recipients of EU policies, and from Europe’s social groups and industries. We did the same for cohesion, which is a crucial issue for deciding what we want the European Union to be in the coming years. Experience shows that cohesion is now a vital nexus of the European project, and an important asset for everyone to safeguard, protect and renew. On this front, the effort made on the idea of introducing an intermediate category of regions is particularly important, above all, because in a number of cases, the years of recession that we are emerging from have intensified internal divisions, further increasing the importance of effective and adequate support for less developed regions in Europe, combating wastage and bringing development policy sharply into focus. However, I maintain that the challenge of intermediate categories and the safeguard clause is one that we must take on in order to begin a new phase in Europe’s cohesion policy and also to realise, within the cohesion policy, the more balanced and sustainable development that we want to assure for Europe over the coming years. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Ivan. The report lists the innovations introduced in the changes to control and reporting systems. These too bring out a greatly varied picture, especially in terms of Member States’ reporting of irregularities and fraud. The report repeatedly highlights the unusually low levels of fraud and irregularity reported by various countries in relation to agricultural expenditure, structural funds and pre-accession funds. It is here that we really must have some clarification on the statistics which have been submitted. The context is made more complicated by the unresolved inefficiencies in recovering losses. In any case, one figure seems clear and confirms a long-running trend. The struggle for legality and transparency in the expenditure of European resources, in comparison to tax avoidance and evasion, cannot yet count on the full collaboration of Member States and governments with the European institutions. In this light, it seems that the calls for reform of the EU’s public procurement rules and the need for what I would call a public European register for the beneficiaries of EU funds are timely. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the economic, social and financial crisis of the last few months and years, the new Treaty of Lisbon with its new powers, and the challenge we have set ourselves with Europe 2020, require the mobilisation of massive new financial resources. The paradox we are witnessing, including in this debate, is that right now, both the Commission and the Council appear to be silent and incapable of deciding and making choices. However, we know that if we want to come out of this difficult economic and social phase, if we want to address the major issues of the environment, the development of cohesion policy and agriculture in the coming years, then we need to invest more heavily in Europe and Europe’s function, and hence its essential function, which is to say, its budget. To do so, we must not be afraid to discuss, even at a time of budgetary restrictions, the idea of investing more heavily in resources and to have the strength and ability to develop debate and discussion that tackle the issue of increasing resources and that of more effective and flexible use of resources. This is the challenge we face. Andrea Cozzolino,  
rapporteur. 
− (IT) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when the Treaty of Lisbon is giving Europe a more incisive role in the lives of millions of Europeans, the challenge of transparency and legality is crucial. Hence the report that we are presenting is the result of a highly coordinated effort. The work was confined, first and foremost, to the scenario outlined by the Court of Auditors, whereby the financial impact of irregularities fell from more than EUR 1 billion in 2007 to EUR 783 million in 2008. The fall concerns all spending areas except direct expenditure and pre-accession funds. Areas of major concern still exist in relation to the Structural Funds too. However, absolute amounts and values alone do not tell us where the urgent problems are hidden and where the situation is under control. Our analyses and meetings over recent months have led us to prioritise two requirements. Firstly, the urgent need to make the Member States more responsible for identifying fraud and irregularities, and for sharing the information needed to combat fraud, waste and distortions in expenditure and in the collection of taxes. Secondly, the importance of presenting proposals and working hypotheses in order to make it easier to implement measures in the Member States, with administrative procedures and management strategies that give priority to the quality of the projects and to their impact on the living and working conditions of European citizens. In order to achieve these objectives, we propose that Parliament insist on certain priorities: firstly, we propose that OLAF draw up 27 profiles, analysing with due care and attention the strategies followed by each individual Member State in combating fraud and irregularities in the use of European resources, with a precise map of the authorities responsible for performing checks in each individual country and data on the quantity and quality of the checks performed and on their effects. Secondly, reducing the number of irregularities and significantly improving the regulations. We are embarking on a legislative and regulatory simplification programme, intended in particular for the Structural Funds. Moreover, the fight against corruption, financial crime and breaches of public procurement rules must be stepped up. In this year’s report we have made progress on this point with the support of the entire committee. Thanks to an intense, concerted effort, proposals have been drafted on the main problems in this area. From the relationship between the EU and tax havens, to the databases on beneficiaries of European funds, the report makes a practical contribution to increasing the transparency of expenditure and to strengthening the anti-fraud and anti-corruption strategies. Lastly, with regard to OLAF, it is crucially important to guarantee its full operational independence, the full cooperation of the Member States and an appropriate human resources strategy, which it most definitely needs. We must keep the debate alive and kicking in Europe so as to establish the role of a single European Prosecutor. To conclude, I believe it is vitally important to fight together for the transparent and efficient management of European resources. In this regard we must ensure that the problems that do exist are not exploited in any way in order to call into question instruments of fundamental importance to the European project, such as cohesion policy and development aid. Rather, we must look clearly at the problems, at the distortions that still exist in the various European spending areas and use these data to take new, determined steps forward, thereby making the management of our finances more efficient and transparent. I believe that, by making this effort, the various European institutions really will make progress in the construction of a Europe that is stronger, more integrated and able to better satisfy the needs of Europeans. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been stated, the European Court of Auditors 2008 report first and foremost gives us some positive news: the percentage of EU expenditure, characterised by high levels of irregularities, has gone down from 60% in 2005 to 31% in 2008. This is a significant result; it signals a positive approach that we must continue to follow. As far as the Structural Funds, and more specifically cohesion policies, are concerned, there continue to be problems and difficulties. I believe that we should focus our attention on these areas in the coming months and years. With regard to the Structural Funds, when compared with the Court’s analysis of the period 2000-2006, the management and monitoring systems for the period 2007-2013 are giving rise to stricter regulations and greater reliability and transparency in terms of expenditure, as well as to greater accountability on the part of the Member States. The Court of Auditors strongly emphasises the need for greater simplification. Therefore, much work needs to be done in order to further simplify the rules. Quality of economic growth and transparency in the use of Community resources are two objectives of the same battle which we need to wage. I believe we need to do this by also making our debates concerning ourselves and, above all, concerning the citizens, more public. Cohesion policies, the Structural Funds and regional policies are, and will, remain a crucial element of the European project. They have given substance to the European Union’s fundamental values. We must work together to guarantee efficiency and transparency in the coming years. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the focus is usually on the pre-summits when the summits themselves count for nothing, but in this case, we are forced to focus on the post-summit because we had understood that something important had happened. Mr Van Rompuy, if you had gone into a national parliament in any country in Europe and made the speech that you made here today, I think people throughout Europe would have understood precisely the opposite of what they had read in the newspapers three days ago, that you had made Europe take a giant step forwards. I think it is essential to come here to this House not only to tell us what happened at the summit, but also to say what the Council intends to do after this summit. If you do not tell us that, you will be throwing away the chance to tell the European public that we are working towards a united Europe and to getting a step closer to rescuing the countries in difficulty. In your reply, Mr Van Rompuy, I would also like you to tell us exactly what you think of the position taken by the Dutch and Finnish Governments. It is your duty to say what your thoughts are on that, because otherwise we will have the impression that the Council ended with a statement that does not correspond to any genuine political will. You should be very careful about this, as I hope not too many journalists heard it, because you know how much influence the media has these days on the fate of countries and the evolution of their spreads.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, you were quite right to say that this is not a perfect agreement, Ms Malmström. If we at the EU had done it ourselves we would have done it differently, but this is not a directive, it is an agreement between parties. An agreement is always better than no agreement though, and this one does help us to move forward. It will also enable further improvements, because each year a European agreement – not secret agreements like those made with all Member States – will return to Parliament and be verified by this House. Therefore, we have to acknowledge a political fact: through this agreement, Europe is negotiating with the US and comes directly under US jurisdiction. I would like to thank my group for allowing free voting and for allowing the delegation from the Italian Partito Democratico
 to vote in favour of the agreement. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, the conclusions of the European Council were not what we were expecting, given that the Treaty of Lisbon does, in fact, provide the elements and possible coverage to put forward credible solutions. We had called for Eurobonds and a financial transaction tax, an increase in the bail-out fund and a review of the role of the European Central Bank. As you yourselves have said this morning, however, nothing was decided on any of those points. The Council’s response was budget discipline to curb the erosion of financial resources, but without investing in growth. This was a meagre outcome based on an agreement among 26 countries, reached after a tortuous procedure, which we have always rejected. Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, by excluding the Commission and the European Parliament, the Council chose to add a democracy deficit to the budget deficit. We have a two-speed Europe, Mr President: the Europe of the Member States and the Europe of the people. Parliament supports the Europe of the people, and I call on President Barroso to have the Commission side with us. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have understood that there are countries in the Arab world and in North Africa that need us. Public opinion demands that Europe be in touch with this wind of liberty, this eagerness for dignity, and it is a demand that is made of us and when I say ‘us’, I mean Europe. It is right for Europe to ensure that the international community is present, but that demand, the demand from these countries, is to ‘us’ directly. We can rightly undertake every diplomatic effort so that the international community intervenes, but it cannot intervene if Europe does not have a policy for the Mediterranean. We must strengthen this will to have a policy for the Mediterranean. It is said, and has been said very well, during the debate on the Syrian issue: ‘let us meet Turkey’. However, Baroness Ashton, we must have a clear idea of our relationship with Turkey, and it cannot be an intermittent relationship. One day, we want it to be close to us and the next, we do not want it close to us; this is not feasible. Europe needs to be clear on its relationship with Turkey and today, we understand how important it would have been in the past to bet on Turkey … (The President cut off the speaker) David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, to question Schengen is, in our view, to question Europe. If Europe is going to be even weaker, as right-wing governments desire, it will be increasingly tempting to ask ourselves whether remaining in Europe still makes sense, as the Italian Interior Minister, Mr Maroni, has done. The answer, however, is greater involvement of EU mechanisms. In essence, we need more Europe, not less Europe, and the Commission needs to say so more forcefully. The best of Europe was shown on Sunday night when, in an extraordinary chain of human solidarity, the people of Lampedusa saved 500 shipwrecked people who were heading towards certain death. The worst of Europe, if the news carried by The Guardian
 is confirmed, would be NATO military forces who do not intervene to save men, women and children adrift. If we are sure about which of these we prefer, Mrs Malmström, then during the European Council in June the Commission will have to convince Member States to formulate a European policy on immigration, because Europe à la carte
 would be tantamount to the collapse of the European dream. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last night, there was another tragedy in the Mediterranean. Immigrants from north Africa died trying to reach Italy and Europe. There are 130 missing and 20 bodies have already been found. When it comes to immigration, we must never forget that we are talking about men, women and children, not just numbers. There must be no more reticence; the Council and governments must act. Civil and democratic Europe must show its sorrow and, for this reason, Mr President, I ask you to invite the House to observe a minute’s silence in memory of the victims of immigration.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow’s vote is one of the steps which will soon lead to the accession of Iceland to the European Union. Iceland has made significant progress, as Mr Preda said. I will mention a few examples: the strengthening of judicial independence, a special commission of inquiry to investigate and analyse the processes that led to the collapse of the Icelandic banking system, the creation of a joint Parliamentary Committee between the European Union and Iceland, the situation regarding entry into the euro area, increased experience in the renewable energy sector. The very thorny issue of ‘Icesave remains open, and on Saturday there will be a referendum which will bring Icelanders to the polls. Although the outcome of the referendum is a matter of debate, I think it has very strong democratic value because it gives the people of Iceland a sense of responsibility and involves them even more in this delicate stage of negotiations. Although the first referendum did not bring a positive result, the Icelandic Government has worked hard to create a broad coalition capable of explaining to citizens the reason for Iceland’s commitment to reimbursing the UK and the Netherlands for the damage they suffered. Europe’s role at this time should be one of patience and respect, without exerting excessive pressure which might cause some sort of self-defence and closure in Icelandic society. With regard to fisheries and agriculture, I believe that Europe and Iceland must find the best solution to meet the criteria established in the Treaty and to preserve the Icelandic economy, ecosystems and the country’s specific characteristics. The accession of Iceland to the European Union will mean that Europe moves towards the North Pole, with significant positive effects in the political, economic, environmental and scientific fields. It is clear that belonging to Europe, sixty years on, is still an attractive possibility. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, you must have realised that this House enjoys plenty of solidarity, but this is not enough. To introduce and empower a European immigration policy, we must do together what others cannot do, in other words, achieve the consensus of governments. Take your proposals and put them before the Council. We shall support you, because you must have realised, apart from some xenophobic remarks, that you enjoy great respect and great solidarity in this House. Parliament will reaffirm this tomorrow, saying no to the refoulements
, yes to the implementation of Directive 2001/55/EC and yes to the implementation of Article 25 of that directive. Tomorrow, we will do our bit in Parliament. However we need others to do their bit; for governments to be much less selfish; for us to be seen sponsoring the solidarity needed to implement a European policy. Your work is naturally central to this effort, because without the governments, Europe will be weaker. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Mediterranean has made a dramatic return to the global political agenda and Europe has found out that it is very weak indeed. We failed to invest in a neighbourhood policy with the Middle East and the Maghreb, we did not give our backing to an area of free trade or a common immigration policy and what is happening in North Africa is having an effect on the Middle East, where the peace process has stalled. Baroness Ashton, Europe must help Israel and the Palestinians to restart negotiations on the basis of proposals that are now supported by both the Council and Parliament. The changes under way also affect Israel and, by investing in change, we can bring together security and peace. Europe must exert pressure on Israel to weaken its grip on the occupied territories and to halt the settlement policy, which is a necessary condition to restart negotiations. As we are currently seeing, these days, nobody is impervious when the desire for freedom explodes like this. Any further delay in resolving the conflict risks compromising Israeli and Palestinian hopes of reaching a fair solution and compromises the future of such a fragile area of the Mediterranean and the Middle East.

Madam President, once again, we have witnessed the inability of the Italian Government to protect the pro-European reputation of Italy and the interests of its businesses on a crucial point such as the adoption of the European patent. Twenty-five countries out of 27 and the overwhelming majority of Parliament support a proposal that regulates the field of patents and that has a real effect on the most innovative enterprises and those that are most orientated to international markets. By ruling ourselves out of this decision, we in Italy will expose our enterprises to the risk of not being suitably protected in Europe and across the world. It is quite incredible that a government that does nothing to spread Italian culture throughout the world, that cuts funds to cultural institutes and fails to value the language of the country that is host to the largest number of World Heritage Sites, can ride roughshod over the language issue while our enterprises have actually always asked for patents to be drafted only in English, which is now the lingua franca of the global economy. However, we have reached a result that allows anyone submitting patents to do so in their own language. Madam President, there was nothing that made it compulsory for Mr Barnier to force this through with such a hasty vote before the opinion of the Court of Justice which, as we know, will be expressed during the first week of March and will deal mainly with two crucial points: the use of one’s national language to defend oneself before the European Union Patent Court and the very legitimacy of creating a patent court. As we well know, these are important issues to resolve before taking any decision. Hence, the Italian delegation of the Democratic Party (PD) decided to abstain. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are pleased to have this debate with the Commission on the North African migration crisis. We have seen these people arrive in Lampedusa only to find no facilities able to receive and identify them. In fact, the Italian Government dismantled the existing reception centre and reduced the facilities there some time ago, under the banner of ‘Zero immigration’, thus preventing Italy from being able to tackle illegal immigration. We know that this problem concerns Italy, but it also concerns Europe. Considerable financial investment is needed to solve it within a coordinated policy framework, while complying with international treaties and ensuring that refugees are protected. In your response, Commissioner, I would like to know precisely when the Italian Government asked the European Commission to intervene, because there have been certain controversies, of which you are well aware.

In the resolution we have tabled and are shortly to vote upon, we point out that relations between Brazil and the European Union are based on mutual recognition and respect of the rule of law and of fundamental rights. There are therefore no question marks over our friendly relationship with Brazil. I should like to point out that, in Italy, the defendant, Cesare Battisti, has been found guilty of four murders. Although a fugitive, Mr Battisti had the legal assurances in his trials – which were all conducted in the presence of his defence lawyer – that the Italian justice system had run its course, with all levels of justice exhausted, and that they sentenced him to two life sentences. Mr President, even France – where Cesare Battisti had previously fled – decided back in 2004 to accept Italy’s extradition request, recognising his crimes and the corresponding sentences, because Cesare Battisti is a criminal who must be brought to justice. Brazil’s contradictory behaviour is difficult to understand, not least because the Brazilian authorities have not officially recognised him as a political refugee, which is one of the reasons to suspend the bilateral agreement between Italy and Brazil regarding extradition. This is why the decision of the Supreme Court seemed incomprehensible to the victims’ families and the wider public. Mr President, we are representing a Europe of rights and of rights for all. The victims have the right to know that those guilty of such heinous crimes will serve their sentence in the prisons of their own countries. David-Maria Sassoli,

Mr President, the situation is very serious. We think that this issue – which is also being trailed by Europe’s media – ought to be dealt with by the European Union and by Parliament, as well as urging the Commission to look into it, since it is a real humanitarian emergency. In this case, the Member States must do everything to try and help these refugees to leave that territory and we think that they could be accepted in European states. We call on the Commission to do everything possible to carry out this action, including using the funds available through the European Fund for Refugees. David-Maria Sassoli,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to add a paragraph to the resolution, which we feel is important and will not affect the structure of it too much. It concerns paragraph 9 of the joint resolution. I shall read it: ‘invites Member States to tackle this humanitarian emergency through the voluntary resettlement in the European Union of all the asylum seekers involved in this crisis; asks the European Commission to coordinate this operation and use available funding through the European Refugees Fund’.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last week we witnessed a disconcerting spectacle in the new body over which you preside: Mr Sarkozy and Mr Berlusconi called into question the treaties signed by their countries. We realised that the French President and Italian Prime Minister, in serious difficulty in their countries, wish to have a Commission that bends to their will. The former refuses to accept criticism, and the latter even wants to deny Commissioners the right to speak. We must remember, as Parliament has reminded us, that the Roma are European citizens on European soil. The treaties must be upheld. We have the instruments to do this, and we must not be afraid to open infringement procedures too. Moreover, if we do not defend the principles of European integration, how will we be able to agree on strategies to emerge from the economic crisis? The forces on the ground, Mr President, have had their say. Parliament, its Presidency and the Commission must respond to the populism advocating a fear-driven Europe with an enhanced social Europe and enhanced citizenship, and we believe this to be the challenge that this political generation must meet. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, for the second time during this parliamentary term and in this House, we find ourselves discussing the problem of press freedom. This shows, Commissioner, that it is a keenly-felt problem; it is a major problem in the eyes of the European public. I would remind you that, in May 2004, Parliament issued a resolution calling upon the Commission to take action to protect media pluralism and press freedom, but we have not heard the Commission speak up in all these years. As you know, the problem is now growing. The issues concerning Italy, Romania and Hungary are different but their background is the same. As you are well aware, Italy continues to experience a serious conflict of interest that is exacerbated by government occupation of the public broadcasting service. In Romania, the press is actually considered a threat to the nation. In Hungary, the government wishes to put journalism under scrutiny. The European institutions naturally cannot condone any government influence over the media. Freedom of information is not a commodity that can be evaluated only in accordance with market criteria. Rather, it is the public’s right to form its own opinions about politics, the quality of governments, and public life. There can be no more excuses for the European institutions; the Commission must take decisive action to reinforce common European standards. Your intervention, Commissioner, could offer European citizens the certainty that Europe is an area of rights and freedom. David-Maria Sassoli,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, members of the Council and of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, clearly, the start of accession negotiations with Iceland represents another step forward in the European integration process. We are talking about a country which has signed European partnership agreements for years, which has been a signatory to the Schengen Agreement since 1996, and which is one of the founding members of the World Trade Organisation. So far, Iceland has demonstrated that it meets many of the accession criteria, though there are some aspects that still need to be improved. I refer to the judicial system, mentioned by Mr Preda: it is important for Iceland to adopt clear mechanisms in order to ensure the independence of the judiciary and to resolve the problem of appointments of judges, prosecutors and supreme judicial authorities. The Icelandic Government must work harder: it is the Icelandic people who must be convinced about wanting to participate in the European challenge. There are, of course, some issues that still need to be defined, and one of those is whaling. The conference in Agadir on 25 June confirmed the moratorium on whaling, and Iceland must act in accordance with this decision and stop whaling even for scientific purposes, since it is often a cover for commercial whaling. Lastly, there is one point on which I think greater conviction is needed by Parliament and that is the Icesave issue, which has highlighted the need for a solid law on conflicts of interest in that country. Madam President, the negotiation stage can begin in order to reaffirm that Europe is not a geographical area or a closed system, and that, if they so desire and if they conform, the countries neighbouring Europe can participate in the development and the construction of the European project. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis is deep and Europeans are asking us for one thing: to put politics back in charge of the economy. This is the responsibility that we must take on by revitalising the Community method, safeguarding our currency and promoting measures to protect our citizens and provide employment. Making the financial markets accountable is a moral, but also a political duty for us, and Europe must speak with one voice at the forthcoming G20 summit. This is a problem that you, Mr Barroso, must address. Your Commission must endeavour to keep the governments at arm’s length and convince them that no one will emerge from the crisis on their own. United, Europe will win, or divided, it will fall. You must be like an orchestra conductor, Mr Barroso, making all the musicians play the same tune. What should the music score contain though? Firstly, regulation of the financial markets and the rating agencies, economic governance of the euro area, taxation of all financial transactions and investments for growth, and not just budget cuts. A striking example was your Commission’s positive opinion, according to the Italian Government, of Italy’s financial package, a package that will bring the local authorities to their knees. No one has ever achieved growth on the basis of budget cuts alone and today, what we need is growth. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteur, Mr Cashman, for the work he has carried out, and for reminding us of the importance of the New York summit. Europe has a great opportunity: that of presenting itself as a world partner for development. The information we have is still alarming: in 2009, a billion people suffered chronic hunger, and this figure has risen today with the economic crisis. We must add to this the damage caused by climate change, a factor that continues to magnify the problems that we have been trying to keep under control. We must recognise that the targets we set ourselves in 2000 were certainly ambitious and could only have been met by donor countries. In the light of these commitments toward developing countries, it is sad to see that some European countries are falling so far short of their agreed commitments. It is disappointing, for example, that my country – Italy – is now contributing a distressingly low 0.16% of GDP. We must introduce a binding commitment for all countries to reach 0.7 % of GDP by 2015, as established by the European Commission. All countries must feel it is their moral duty and political obligation to uphold this commitment. The outstanding work by the rapporteur, Mr Cashman, enables the European Parliament to play a key role in defending people’s dignity. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a Europe of the people and not a Europe of the States. The crisis we are experiencing is the crisis of European policy’s inability to govern the market. In order to save the euro, political institutions need to be strengthened and intergovernmental logic needs to be left behind to allow for European governance. This is not rhetoric because a few minutes ago in Berlin, German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, sounded the alarm stating that the euro is in danger. Voicing alarm without indicating strong and convincing measures risks further weakening the single currency for investors and the market and making all of Europe weaker. Imagine the response of the markets in the coming hours, considering that just minutes ago, the euro collapsed again. When we exit the House, Mr President, we may find ourselves poorer and more insecure. New European governance alone will allow us to defend the single currency, promote growth, employment and social inclusion. We must discard the old approach of coordinating national policies and equip ourselves with strong decision-making instruments. New European governance must assure three levels of intervention: a policy for growth, suitable financial instruments and emergency management. The EUR 750 billion rescue package was important but we have realised that it is not enough. Today, we need a strong political initiative that can guide the market to allow for greater mobility of the resources. The monetary and budget policies have proven inadequate in assuring productivity and competitiveness. We must not be afraid to invest, above all, in Community interest projects such as infrastructure, energy, the environment, knowledge and human capital. Mr President, Parliament has a great responsibility: to reinforce the capacity of Member States to leave intergovernmental policy behind and launch European spirit anew through its own independence.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a moment ago, a disgraceful speech was speciously made in this House against the President of the Italian Republic. I believe that the Bureau of this House should not allow people to bring national political issues into it, particularly when dealing with institutional and political matters of great importance. I would remind you – and remind all fellow Members – that the Italian Republic is not for sale, and that the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, is the guardian of the Italian Constitution. On behalf of the Italian delegation of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I call on the Bureau of this House to be more vigilant with regard to the topics debated and the speeches that are made. I am sorry that President Buzek did not intervene to stop a speech that attacked the President of the Republic, who, just one week ago, visited the European Parliament.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Italian police force last night arrested five people who were planning a mafia attack on one of our colleagues, Mr Crocetta, a Member of this Parliament and a former mayor of the Sicilian town of Gela. According to the magistrates, the attack could have taken place on any given day, starting from today, 20 January. I would remind you that the Belgian authorities have yet to provide a suitable escort for Mr Crocetta, who has been under protection in Italy for some time now, as Parliament’s Presidency is aware. I would ask the Presidency to show solidarity with our colleague on behalf of this House and of the European Parliament and to take action to ensure that Mr Crocetta receives adequate protection in his role as an MEP.

 Mr President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, the enormous tragedy that has struck Haiti requires an immediate response and many aid and rescue activities are under way, carried out by individual Member States, even if there is a good deal of competition between European countries. The new Europe with its High Representative ought to be capable of providing its own aid to the people who are suffering. The earthquake, moreover, has struck the poorest country in the western hemisphere, where 80% of the population live below the poverty line and 54% live in absolute poverty. Within this emergency, however, there is another: the emergency involving the children, the weakest sector of the population, who have been left with no family, no protection and no State. I would therefore like to call upon the High Representative for Foreign Affairs to examine actions intended to allow Haitian children up to the age of 10 to be taken in and looked after by European countries. Lady Ashton, Europe can take them in and offer them adequate living conditions; I mean for a limited period, until the conditions are adequate for them to return to their own country. All this could be organised, all this could be easy for the European countries, and it would be a fair way to respond to the need for solidarity, but also to avoid speculative and illegal actions being taken at the expense of children. We are talking about children, the most precious resource that we should protect in Haiti. David-Maria Sassoli,

Madam President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, our group is very worried by the situation in Yemen because there is a global threat there: the failed attempt to blow up a US aircraft, the threats directed towards foreign embassies and the intensification of attacks by al-Qaeda, the most recent being in Afghanistan, must be taken very seriously. Unfortunately, Yemen’s domestic situation does not help, and we should bear in mind the fact that it is one of the poorest countries in the world, with serious water shortages, high unemployment and an economy heavily dependent on revenue from oil and gas, which it is estimated will be exhausted within the next 10 years. I therefore believe action by the European Union is vital, in the shape of close collaboration between the European Commission, on humanitarian aid and development aspects, and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs, in relation to common security, collaboration with police forces and border control. I must also mention our concern over the clamp-down on representatives of the political opposition in that country, journalists and human rights defenders, which the humanitarian organisations operating in Yemen have been speaking about for a long time. Baroness Ashton, I therefore consider it a priority to ensure that humanitarian organisations can enter Yemeni territory and work in complete security. I also hope for an effort by the European Union to ensure that Yemen abides by the commitments made in 2006 at the international donors’ conference, namely to step up the process of political and economic reforms, to increase democracy and people’s living standards. Since the September 11 attack, we have realised that making at-risk areas secure depends on how much we are prepared to gamble on better living conditions. Baroness Ashton, democracy starts from here, from the ability to close the gaps between the rich countries and the poorest countries. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are preparing for the Copenhagen conference with a resolution showing our awareness that in order to tackle policies to combat climate change, it is necessary for all the geographical areas of the world to be involved. Also, it is the responsibility of the industrialised countries to establish with developing countries not only targets to be reached, but also the resources to be used to reach them. On this aspect, good work has been done in Parliament. The resolution sets out specific instruments and it is important that we have quantified the actions. The figure of EUR 30 billion proposed by us between now and 2020 can be viewed as an important figure, although it is a minimum, for supporting the initiatives of developing countries. Yesterday Mr De Boer, the United Nations negotiator, asked for USD 10 billion between now and 2012. After the choices made by the United States and China, it falls to Europe to take on new responsibilities and lead the fight against climate change. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to thank the Swedish Presidency for the work it has done and for having succeeded in putting in place the conditions for the final ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon. We sorely need the new treaty because it offers us the possibility of strengthening, of extending powers, for example, the powers of this Parliament, and of two new figures, who can represent political and institutional union. We therefore hope that the Council will be able to interpret the requests of the great European political families wisely, so that at the next meeting, an authoritative and strongly supported decision can be taken on the appointment of the persons called upon to occupy the new institutional positions envisaged by the treaty. What do we need? We need a President of the Council who is capable of guaranteeing consistency and continuity. We need a High Representative who, on the strength of his or her experience and authority, is capable of guaranteeing Europe a leading role in a multipolar world, and who, at the same time, will act as a link between the intergovernmental and the Community dimension of the Union. And then we also need a college of commissioners that is strong, united and balanced in terms of politics, geography and gender. It is particularly significant that this is happening 20 years after the fall of the Wall, the wall that divided Europe, and all this can rekindle hope in a united, strong Europe that will continue to drive the demands for solidarity and justice.

Mr President, in accordance with Rule 147 of the Rules of Procedure, I should like to remind you that, in the debate on human rights in the world in 2007, this House decided not to do as the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) proposed and make reference to persons who represent high civil or religious institutions for the purposes of strengthening political arguments. We therefore ask you to adopt the same measure with regard to the amendments to our resolution tabled by the PPE Group, which make explicit reference to the President of the Italian Republic, Giorgio Napolitano.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, every one of us is influenced by the circumstances in which we live, and you too will have been told before coming here to Brussels: ‘remember that you have a big responsibility, that we have a big responsibility’, that of making your country better. We know that our countries will be better if Europe is stronger and is able to respond with a sense of fairness to its citizens’ expectations. We are obviously aware that this is possible if we all act together; if we are able to pool our most precious resources, our Constitutions, that set of values and of legal rules, of rights, that are Europe’s true assets. So many controversies plague my country, but I would like straight away to reassure everyone that we are talking about a great democratic country, which has a great Constitution. Yesterday was a very important day for we Italians, because the Constitutional Court, faced with confusion and requests for impunity, reaffirmed a simple and time-honoured principle – that all citizens are equal before the law. However, we know that even great countries can go off course, can mix up public property with private interests. Nonetheless, we cannot allow the Member States to become weak. The right to independent information, without pressures or conditions on the part of government authorities, must be guaranteed, and this is a public good, a good for everyone, in every country. This good must be protected without hesitation by the Union. We must endeavour to provide common rules, to set limits beyond which information is no longer considered to be independent. There is an urgent need for the Union to intervene, to adopt a directive that lays down guidelines on pluralism and on the protection of a good that must be available to all. Mrs Reding, never forget that we are a Parliament and not a museum where things are left to moulder away. David-Maria Sassoli,

Thank you for your question, because it gives me the opportunity to explain myself. I did not have this opportunity in the time that was allocated to me. (The President asked the Members to allow the speaker to continue)
 As I was saying, I am glad you asked me the question because it gives me the opportunity to say that the directive that we are requesting from the Commission must be for all Member States. This is not an Italian issue: this is a European issue. I would also say that we want the question that we are to submit at Strasbourg to be amended. We want it to cover the debate on pluralism in Italy and in Europe. Thank you very much for your question. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Barrot, Mr Billström, ladies and gentlemen, we called for this debate to draw the EU’s attention to the grave violations of fundamental human rights taking place in Italy. Since May, over 1 000 migrants have been picked up at sea by the Italian authorities and handed over to Libya in the course of informal and indiscriminate refoulements without identifying the people, giving them the right to appeal or access to asylum procedures, with the danger that they will be subjected to inhumane and degrading treatment in Libya. As Commissioner Barrot confirmed when he asked Italy for details, we believe that these practices violate the fundamental principles which underpin Europe. This kind of action is compatible neither with the European Convention on Human Rights nor with Community law, particularly the Schengen Borders Code and the Repatriation Directive, nor with Italian law. Yesterday, the United Nations called on Italy to comply with international law and, also yesterday, 24 Somali and Eritrean refugees turned away by Italy lodged an appeal against Italy at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg for violating the European Convention on Human Rights. Moreover, ladies and gentlemen, illegal immigration in Italy has become a criminal offence, an aggravating circumstance. The mere fact of being a migrant entails discrimination and inequality, and gives rise to harsher punishments for the same crime. The fact of being an illegal migrant, as were the families of our Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Greek and Italian communities, blocks access to fundamental rights and to the most basic care, including health services, for fear of being reported. This is happening in Italy, Mr President, and has also been denounced by legal and constitutional experts and secular and Catholic associations. What does the Commission intend to do to end these violations? Parliament has always supported the fight against illegal immigration, but only in compliance with fundamental rights. We would like to know, Mr President, whether the Commission intends to take action on Italian legislation and examine the Italy-Libya agreement. Twenty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, we cannot allow certain governments to build new ones. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, your speech today, Mr Barroso, has not changed our opinion. Our view remains strongly negative. Throughout the years of your presidency, the Commission has shown itself to be incapable and lacking in autonomy. This was the case for the financial crisis and the same holds true for immigration policy: the safeguarding of fundamental rights and compliance with Community law must represent two sides of the same policy. You said in this Chamber that you intend to appoint a commissioner for justice and rights and a commissioner for internal affairs and immigration. Do not do that, Mr Barroso: immigration and rights must stay together so as not to endorse xenophobic policies. You have a majority here in Parliament, a right-wing majority, and clearly we are unable to identify with this majority. I understand the difficulties of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and the Democrats for Europe but, Mr Verhofstadt, do not tell us that the coherent approach that you called for in order to emerge from the crisis consists of the speed with which the Barroso Commission will be formed. It is obvious that we cannot identify with this majority. Our positions cannot be reconciled with those who do not resolutely fight for full and steadfast freedom of information, with those who do not fight to safeguard rights, and with those who view Parliament as a mere forum to represent national governments.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we have recalled in this chamber, next December the United Nations agency responsible for communications technology and information will meet in Dubai for the ITU World Conference on International Telecommunications. The aim is to renegotiate the International Telecommunication Regulations (ITRs). We cannot forget – I am pleased at the words used by Commissioner Tajani – the work that has been done so far, which cannot be up for debate, nor can we allow the authority of the European Union to be bypassed by a supranational organisation such as the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), to which, as we know, hundreds of States around the world belong, many of which are renowned for having problems linked to democracy, transparency and freedom of expression. We are not mistaken therefore in thinking that the pillars of the internet – in other words, freedom, participation, openness and innovation – are under threat. I believe it is necessary to safeguard the role of the internet and, more importantly, the role that the internet can have in reviving economic growth, as well as guaranteeing opportunities for all. Therefore, I hope the Commission will endeavour to ensure that in Dubai, Europe presents a united front and speaks with one voice. There are many controversial proposals on the table for the World Conference on International Telecommunications, particularly those that propose changes to internet governance that call into question the neutrality of the internet, with negative repercussions for consumers. The freedom of the internet or, more specifically, the freedom of expression and data protection, are therefore at risk. What some States have proposed would entitle a government to monitor not only the communications of its citizens, but even the data exchanged over its networks. It is a very small step from here to the curtailment of freedom of expression and censure, therefore I believe it is contrary to the fundamental principles of the European Union.

 I welcome this regulation, which aims to establish a series of harmonised standards on the production of agricultural and forestry vehicles. It is an excellent legislative text, in which there is the proper balance between the need to guarantee a high level of safety on the road and at work and to protect the environment. Adapting to safety standards is not just an obligation; it is an absolute necessity. This regulation moves things in the right direction, since it covers every aspect of operational safety in tractors, both as regards their movement on the road and in the performance of agricultural work. The proposed regulation significantly simplifies current legislation on approvals, replacing 24 base directives and approximately another 35 amending directives. The regulation was needed in order finally to harmonise the market for the agricultural and construction machinery sector too. I am delighted that the proposed approval at European level for all categories of vehicle takes account of cost-benefit considerations, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises.

 I voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a directive on consular protection for citizens of the Union because I believe that citizens who are abroad but whose own country is not represented should receive assistance from the diplomatic services of all Member States. Not only that, but the level of protection should be equivalent to that guaranteed by the Member State in question for its own nationals. Facilitating cooperation between diplomatic services locally, coordinating emergencies, giving out information to citizens including on the websites of the Commission and the Member States, should be objectives that the European Union should soon be able to guarantee for its own citizens.

 I warmly welcome the excellent report on passenger rights in all transport modes, which provides for clear and accurate information, transparency in ticket prices, assurance in the event of airline bankruptcy, the creation of a centre for claims and an EU-wide free direct line. Particular attention is paid to the needs of persons with reduced mobility who may, at times, be forced to pay in cases where there are inadequate facilities, and to the development of intermodal transport. I am also pleased by the inclusion of the request that the Commission should address the proliferation of unfair clauses in air carrier contracts, such as the unfair requirement that passengers must use both parts of a return air ticket in order. When the rights of passengers using coach/bus transport, dating from 2011 and not yet entered into force, are adopted, the European Union will have an integrated set of fundamental passenger rights in all transport modes. Even though the Commission takes the view that it is too soon, at this stage, to provide a single regulation covering passengers in all transport modes, I hope that Parliament’s requests will be heard by the Commission, since unfortunately we still see cases in which the rights of European travellers are inadequate.

 I voted in favour of the Sehnalová report on the establishment of the security system known as eCall, as I believe it is an excellent means of preventing road accidents and more. Thanks to this system, it will also be possible from now on to reduce the congestion caused by accidents, thus preventing more accidents from occurring. I regret the delays and the lack of progress in the voluntary deployment of eCall to date and I hope that all parties involved will act simultaneously in order to establish this service. I also believe there must be coordinated awareness-raising campaigns concerning the eCall system and its benefits for European citizens, with the aim of increasing both the understanding of, and the demand for, the service.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs who worked with me to draft this important recommendation, the secretariat of the Committee on Transport and Tourism and the secretariat of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament. After almost two years of lengthy and difficult negotiations with the shadow rapporteurs, the Council and the Commission, Parliament has managed to make considerable progress, in particular, by guaranteeing greater competition between rail operators, oversight by a strong, independent national regulatory body that ensures fair competition, the requirement, for the first time, to handle complaints within a set time ranging from six to a maximum of 16 weeks, the creation of a European network of national regulatory bodies and a rendezvous clause for the establishment of a European regulatory body. Moreover, the new rules – which should also lay a solid foundation for the financing of infrastructure thanks to contracts of a minimum of five years – and the agreement that we secured to strengthen the current rules and to create a single European railway area should offer all railway undertakings fair access to a wider range of services, such as maintenance and station services, including ticket sales, in addition to providing equal access to the rail network. In particular, with regard to the regulatory body, a key element of the railway recast, the new rules lay down more stringent requirements for the appointment of its staff and in order to guarantee its full independence: cooling-on and cooling-off periods and a declaration of interest that the regulatory body’s members must submit. The recast also provides for the regulatory body to make recommendations to licensing and safety authorities to prevent, for example, safety rules being used to limit access to the market. The recast will extend the regulatory bodies’ powers to ancillary rail services and to overseeing the separation of accounts. It will be made clear that regulatory bodies must review both the draft and final versions of network statements, which are an essential instrument to ensure that all the operators are aware of the market access conditions. Furthermore, in addition to acting in a limited timeframe in the event of a complaint, regulatory bodies will be able to intervene with regard to the introduction of mark-ups on the direct costs of infrastructure managers, control the criteria for the introduction of booking charges and regularly consult railway users. Thanks to Parliament’s involvement, we have also managed to obtain a network of regulatory bodies: the content of the information will be exchanged in a clear manner and will be guaranteed by the Commission, which will be required to evaluate how efficiently the regulatory bodies are cooperating with the new network and to propose supplementary measures to ensure a more integrated oversight of the European rail market, with the hope that in the future, a European regulatory body can be established. With regard to financing infrastructure, the multiannual contractual agreement no longer has a minimum duration of three years but five, and there is a provision requiring Member States to make good the deficit in the infrastructure manager’s accounts every five years at the most. A requirement has also been included … (The speaker interrupted her speech
) In order to have a single rail market, we need to provide non-discriminatory access to the market. Therefore, even if the separation requirements for service facilities have not been imposed on all kinds of infrastructure, the opening up of the services market is far-reaching, with an extensive list of essential services and non-discriminatory access to infrastructure and services. A ‘use it or lease it’ clause has also been included for services that have not been used for at least two years instead of three. With regard to charges, in particular, noise charges, we have reached a compromise that is optional for Member States – although it will be mandatory to comply with the applicable EU rules – that envisages a bonus system to facilitate the retrofitting of trains. As for the European Train Control System (ETCS), a compulsory system is planned for all Member States that must be implemented on European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) lines: the introduction of a bonus-malus system for trains equipped with ETCS systems in accordance with common criteria set out by the Commission. The differentiation of charges will be completely revenue neutral for the infrastructure manager. Despite my firm belief that there needs to be separation between infrastructure managers and railway undertakings, we have reached a good compromise on separation that provides for transparency of financial flows between infrastructure managers and railway undertakings in integrated companies, as well as a rendezvous clause for the presentation of a legislative proposal on separation and on the opening of the domestic passenger market by the end of 2012. I would like to remind Members that tomorrow, during the vote, amendments could be tabled. Should any of these amendments that are not part of this document receive majority support and be accepted by Parliament, the document would end up in conciliation. This would delay further still the opening of the debate on the fourth railway package. I therefore appeal to my fellow Members to understand the importance of adopting the railway recast tomorrow, so that we may then continue to work on the fourth railway package.

 I congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Ţicău, on her work. Certainly, the installation and use of a tachograph, if used correctly, can be an excellent tool to improve road safety and the working conditions of hauliers, while at the same time satisfying their legitimate needs for privacy. To protect drivers, more stringent rules on driving times and rest times are, of course, necessary. I therefore welcome the new rules that aim to improve tachograph functions, such as the use of wireless communications for roadside checks in order to lower the number of vehicles stopped, as well as the provisions on the training of control officers. With a view to ensuring road safety in the European Union at all possible levels, it is of prime importance to affirm a clear and full principle of co-responsibility, and I therefore consider positive the compromise obtained by the rapporteur whereby the parties concerned must carry out regular checks in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(4) of Regulation (EC) No 561/2006. With regard to the installation of tachographs in all vehicles which are not exempted, I would ask that we bear in mind that the obligations arising from compliance with the procedure must not overwhelm small and medium-sized enterprises with financial burdens and red tape.

 The recasting of Directive 2006/54/EC on the implementation of the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation has led to changes in the sector, but much remains to be done to reduce the gender pay gap. That is why I voted for the report on equal pay for male and female workers for equal work or work of equal value. I believe it is right for the European Commission to put pressure on the national governments to adopt measures aimed at reducing the gender gap and also to provide for sanctions in cases of infringements of the principle of equal pay.

 All consumers are susceptible to becoming vulnerable over the course of their lives, whether as a result of endogenous causes inherent in the person and the person’s cultural, psychological and physical situation, or due to exogenous causes inherent in the objective difficulty of accessing information. Hence, there is a need for greater special protection for vulnerable consumers that takes their individual requirements into account. Disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility require particular attention, especially as regards transport, and passengers’ rights must be improved by ensuring that information and fares are transparent when a ticket is purchased.

 Today’s vote on the progress made by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia takes into account the difficult challenges that the country has faced. Even if much remains to be done, I am pleased with the progress achieved in the social sphere and in the fight against corruption, when you consider that the country has moved up 40 places in the Transparency International anti-corruption index over the last five years. However, the recent serious episodes of violence are a matter for concern, and are the worst since 2001 when the country was on the brink of civil war between the Albanian Muslim minority and the Macedonian Orthodox Christian majority. In accordance with the 2011 progress report, I deplore the risk that the forms of power sharing could institutionalise the ethnic minorities and transform the country into a two-nation state, putting democratic principles at risk. I hope that the freedoms and fundamental rights established under the rule of law will be respected. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of piracy is not a new one here, and was dealt with by this Parliament in the 2009 resolution. Everyone is aware of the events involving two Italian soldiers, who were arrested for causing the death of two Indian fishermen. In this regard, I welcome the assurances of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Baroness Ashton, who has said she has been monitoring the case closely in order to bring it to a positive conclusion, and that the incident should be put, to quote her words, ‘into the broader context of international cooperation on counter-piracy and, more specifically, on the issue of regulating the protection aboard ships’. However, the episode forces us to reflect on the fact that the phenomenon of piracy in the Indian Ocean or off the Somali coastline is still an extremely serious problem. As part of its defence and security policy, the EU launched the Atalanta mission in December 2008 and, in the last few days, its extension to 2014 was approved, but the number of ships involved has fallen dramatically, from 35 in 2009 to 10 in 2011. As we know, the EU intends to exercise greater coordination over the naval forces and military personnel on board civilian ships belonging to Member States patrolling the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean. Do we therefore feel that it is useful to establish common rules of engagement? Generally speaking, what other coordinated initiatives does the EU plan to adopt to protect merchant ships from attacks by pirates? In addition, what measures does it intend to take against third countries that fail to safeguard merchant ships crossing between the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean?

 I voted in favour of Mr Schmidt’s annual tax report, which calls on the Commission to make proposals that will contribute to European competitiveness by eliminating distortions of competition which arise from the various taxation systems still in place. In terms of cross-border issues, the differences in the tax ‘excises’ on a number of products, such as fuel, drinks and cigarettes, can easily create cross-border competition distortions. The current economic and financial crisis has led to a significant rise in public debt in Europe, the reduction of which requires both expenditure restraint and tax increases, as well as streamlining of tax systems. Accordingly, we need to adopt measures that can make the national tax systems more favourable to common growth, ensuring that tax differences do not give business in one country an undue advantage over competitors in other countries.

The White Paper on Transport aims to improve the quality of transport in Europe. Mobility plays a key role in the internal market as it is a prerequisite for development and economic growth. While, on the one hand, the challenge is to develop sustainable transport, on the other, we must aim to build an efficient intermodal transportation network. Much remains to be done to ensure that the transport system is truly competitive in all areas and there are many issues and difficulties, especially in the road transport sector, which, in some countries, is one of the cornerstones of production and the economy. In this regard, I would like to see the creation of an authority responsible for road transport, which would be able to promote the harmonisation of Member States in this regard: for example, with respect to environmental sustainability, safety, training and professional certification, and which would supervise the process of liberalisation and resolve the challenges of the sector, in a manner similar to what is to be done in the railway sector.

 I voted in favour of the report on modernising customs because I think we need to simplify customs legislation in order to improve and influence competitiveness. Customs play an essential role in ensuring efficient safety checks and contributing, above all, to the fight against fraud. This, however, requires efficient IT systems so as to ensure product safety and to block the sale of less safe products. However, I did vote against the parts referring to non-preferential origin of goods, not because I do not support the principle, but because I think the reference to the definition of the product origin should not be in this report, which aims to establish criteria for improving customs competitiveness.

 I have voted in favour of this report which seeks to lay the groundwork for future debate on the reform proposal that the Commission is due to present in December, and that aims to simplify the process of working abroad for doctors, engineers, dentists and other professionals. If, on the one hand, professional qualifications should be recognised quickly by other Member States, on the other hand, the reliability and safety of their services should not be compromised. To this end, one notes that the professional qualifications of tour guides could cease to be recognised as, following the revision of Directive 2005/36/EC, their profession would be confused with that of travel couriers or tour representatives who would be able to conduct guided tours in all 27 Member States.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before beginning with a brief description of my report, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs who worked with me on the revision of the railway recast. I would particularly like to thank Mr Kuhn, Mr Tremosa i Balcells, Mr Zīle, Mr Cramer and Ms Wils. I would also like to thank the Chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Brian Simpson, the parliamentary group coordinators and all of my colleagues for the extensive debate we have had on a report that was particularly complex but also, I believe, important for the implementation of the railway system. It is a recast of the first railway package, which has not been correctly applied since its entry into force, and, in fact, 13 infringement procedures against Member States relating to implementation of the first railway package are currently under way. The objective of the railway recast is to achieve a single European railway market. It is an ambitious objective because the rail system is the most outdated transport system, which has not managed to catch up with other modes of transport. For example, the average percentage for rail freight in European countries is stationary at around 6-7%, while only 11-12% of passengers travel by rail. Therefore, it is clear that rules need to be harmonised, and that new systems and new elements need to be added and strengthened to ensure that railways can develop properly, particularly where they cross borders, which is the most problematic part for European integration. The creation of a single European market is therefore necessary, just as it was for the air transport sector. The creation of a single market will mean that citizens can use trains that can run throughout Europe, with better fares and a service on a par with that of other modes of transport. Currently, few trains can travel outside national borders. Now the aim is that they can compete with each other throughout the whole of Europe, something which – as I have said – is not the case today. The objectives which the first railway package attempted to deliver are therefore the aim of this recast and of all the measures for unification of the rail system that will follow. This means that, starting with the railway recast, some rules need to be revised. One of the most important points that we have discussed at length, and which I believe is also the key product of the railway recast, is the provision of a national regulatory body, a network of national regulatory bodies with clear responsibilities, a strong national regulatory body with resources like the energy regulator, which could – as many hope – allow us to have a single European regulatory body in the future. We have tried to provide clear rules for transparency and separation of the accounts of the infrastructure manager and the services manager, by prohibiting cross transfers between the network and the services manager as happens in the case of many holding companies, for example. We have tried to maintain the separation of accounts that has been in force since 1991, according to which public funds for infrastructures must be used solely to improve infrastructure and not to finance the business of transport companies, also because these subsidies prevent fair competition between all the service operators. As rapporteur I would have liked the railway package to be more ambitious. I would also have liked there to be a total separation between infrastructure and service operators. However, we have been given a commitment by the Commission that this will be put in place by 31 December 2012. Other important provisions concern ease of access to infrastructures, which is essential in order to guarantee that all new operators can use network services, and in addition to total separation, the Commission has made a commitment to present a proposal for national market liberalisation by 31 December 2012. We have also included benefits for operators that introduce significant technological innovations to reduce environmental impact, and we have included the possibility of an improvement in the sector by allowing 7-year instead of 5-year strategic plans as previously. Finally, we wanted to guarantee compliance with laws governing employment rights and safety in the workplace, and to maintain the right to strike. Debora Serracchiani,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is true, as my colleagues who have already spoken have said, that this proposal for a directive has been a very complex task, involving 724 amendments leading to 18 compromise texts. These compromise texts include Article 7, mentioned by the Commissioner, in which Parliament invites the Commission to make a proposal for national market separation and liberalisation by 31 December 2012. None of the proposals are in any way premature – instead, there is a clear invitation with an equally clear and precise direction. If this direction had been present from the start, it would probably have helped with the management of this extremely long railway recast. In the meantime, my assistant has had a baby, so this really has been a long and complicated gestation period, but I am sure that we understand the importance of expanding the railway system. We have said that we need a competitive railway system. In that case, we need to have rules. We do not necessarily need many rules, but they have to be clear, and to be complied with by everyone. We know that there is a problem of free competition on the railway market, particularly with regard to freight transport. The ambition of the railway recast is to create the single European market. Therefore, we are issuing a strong invitation to the Commission to make a clear proposal before the end of next year and, given that next year is so close, we propose that work should begin so that Parliament can fulfil its own legislative role, also because the text very recently issued by the Council is extremely cautious, including with regard to the proposals. Therefore, we hope that Parliament will give us a clear and full mandate to carry out a complete negotiation process that will truly open up the single European market to all the expectations to which – I am picking up on the shout of pain from Mr Cancian – we must provide a response.

I voted in favour of the report by Mr Kósa, which highlighted the physical and social obstacles that unfortunately still exist in many Member States and that restrict the lives of 80 million disabled people living all over Europe. To date, however, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has not yet been ratified by all the EU countries. Out of 27 Member States, 11 still have to sign, and even where ratified, implementation is still deficient precisely in accessibility to spaces and buildings. According to the EU 2020 strategy, one of the most important objectives is to increase the rate of employment. This requires removing all the barriers that hinder the access of disabled people to the labour market and developing national policies in line with the European Commission’s European Disability Strategy, including simple access to public and private transport. Social inclusion and employment must also play a bigger part in strategies and in European funding. Finally, I agree with the rapporteur on the need for a European mobility card for reciprocal recognition of care for people with disabilities, which would guarantee travel on any means of transport for all.

I voted in favour of the report on road safety by Mr Koch because I think that this issue has an important role to play considering that around 55% of fatal accidents happen on rural roads, 36% in urban areas and 6% on motorways. Over the last three years, road accidents in the capital cities of the European Union have caused an average of 1 845 deaths each year. Many of these victims are pedestrians, cyclists, elderly people and children. In order to reduce the number of deaths caused by road accidents, common and harmonised restrictive measures are needed across Europe, including the creation of safe road-traffic infrastructure, respect for driving and rest periods, and the establishment of safe parking areas for lorry drivers which are in line with the minimum social standards. I support the creation of the office of the European road safety coordinator by 2014, with particular responsibility for opening an investigation on the effectiveness of road safety policies in large and medium-sized urban areas and on the necessary elements for once again making travel safe for all citizens.

 I would like to thank Mr Fidanza for his constructive work. Tourism has enormous potential for achieving certain important EU objectives, such as sustainable development, economic growth and employment, as well as socio-economic cohesion. In recent years, growth in employment in the tourism industry has been considerably higher than in other areas. Indeed, the EU tourism sector generates more than 4% of GDP, with around 2 million businesses providing work for approximately 4% of the total workforce: around 8 million jobs. Therefore there is a clear need to support the sector, including by improving training and recognition of professional qualifications. At European level, the Union must put in place an integrated strategy with clear, high-level objectives, with effective, targeted measures that promote innovation and improve the quality of tourist services, providing, for example, ever greater accessibility for persons with reduced mobility. I support the creation of a European quality label and the idea of diversifying tourism through the promotion of culture, history and religion, and I would stress the importance of promoting tourism by giving due importance to Europeans who have spread European culture beyond this continent.

 In recent years, many businesses have been encouraged to invest in Libya. The serious instability and the political and institutional crisis that has affected several countries in North Africa, especially Egypt, Libya and Tunisia, have forced many European businesses to abandon Libya, leaving behind moneys owed to them, equipment, and so on. Council Regulation (EU) No 204/2011 of 2 March 2011 concerning restrictive measures in view of the situation in Libya, establishes that funds may only be used for humanitarian purposes and not to pay monies owed or damages suffered by businesses/companies that had been operating in Libya. As a result many European enterprises, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, are struggling to collect monies owed for the provision of goods and services in Libya. While on the one hand Europe must guarantee support to the Libyan people and contribute to the country’s reconstruction, on the other I believe that it must ensure that European companies do not suffer serious, irreversible damage due to a loss of liquidity resulting from uncollected moneys, and therefore it must guarantee their survival.

 Madam President, the new Hungarian constitution limits the possibility of intervention by supervisory bodies such as the constitutional court, and increases the powers of the executive, thereby bringing into question the normal system of checks and balances. Social rights have been negated, the state only providing subsidies to the needy if they agree to do community work. Finally, the right to self-defence has been sanctioned and weapons may be kept in the home even without a licence. The right to abortion has been banned and highly discriminatory laws against homosexuals have been introduced. All of this goes against Directive 2000/78/EC, which establishes a general framework for the fight against discrimination. I therefore ask the Commissioner what action she intends to take, in view of the fact that the fundamental rights in the new Hungarian constitution are hardly compatible with those of the European Union and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.

I thank the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, for his excellent report, which fits in with the recent debate on the implementation of the Schengen Agreement. The existence of effective controls along our external borders must be an important factor inasmuch as the security of the Schengen area depends on the efficiency with which each Member State controls its external borders. Although some problems remain unresolved, Romania and Bulgaria have proved to be sufficiently prepared to apply all the requirements of the Schengen acquis. We have discussed at length the practical efficacy of the state machinery of these two countries, as well as their levels of corruption; nevertheless, I believe that the application of Schengen should leave this out of consideration, given that – just as happened with the other Member States – it is sufficient to base a decision only on the efficiency of border controls and the preparation of police forces. Adding further requirements would create a precedent of discrimination which has not existed before, not even after the great enlargement in 2007. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 The arrival of streams of immigrants to Lampedusa in recent days shows that the immigration crisis is an ongoing issue that requires immediate action. We clearly need improved governance within the Schengen area, as established by the Commission Communication of 4 May. To this end, the solidarity mechanims must be strengthened in terms of redistribution of asylum seekers, organised mobility and new partnerships with third countries. Revising the mechanisms for applying the Schengen acquis
 must not be seen as an excuse to limit at will the right to free movement, but rather as a stimulus for new opportunities. I hope that concrete proposals will be made very soon to combat prejudice and discrimination, to combat lawlessness and to promote human rights, human dignity and peace. Governing immigration effectively and encouraging peaceful coexistence must be the daily commitment of a good policy that aims to promote development and security. Returning the massive flows of people to their countries of origin does not help maintain the distance between Europeans and immigrants. If anything, it risks increasing illegality, insecurity and economic costs. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 The nuclear accident at the Fukushima power station has caused an enormous disaster, with the radioactive contamination also affecting many people who were in the vicinity of the power station and who suffered injuries. Many hospitals are refusing to admit and treat them due to the risk of contamination. Although the Japanese Prime Minister has announced that the Fukushima power station will be decommissioned, the situation remains unresolved: the cooling system for one of the reactors is out of use and a considerable amount of radioactivity is being released into the environment. In the light of this, it is important to ensure that all the necessary humanitarian and financial aid is provided and to lay down international safety rules that are as reliable as possible, in order to prevent other disasters like that in Japan in the future. For this reason, I voted against the resolution, because it omitted the amendments calling upon the Member States to draw up possible strategies for abandoning nuclear power and immediately to inform regional and local cross-border authorities of their national programmes if their implementation could have a cross-border effect.

 Following the earthquake on 11 March, the consequences of the crisis in Japan for nuclear safety and the global economy have shaken the European Union, which is already grappling with instability in North Africa. I welcome the decisions taken at the special meeting of energy ministers, held in order to examine the implications of the accident at the plant in Fukushima, and trust in the determination of Member States to carry out stress testing of nuclear power plants in the European Union to be extended to non-European countries, and especially neighbouring countries. In this context, and giving due importance to the nuclear moratorium decision taken by some Member States, and the fact that public consultations on energy development are imminent, it is important that the Commission should report on the safety situation in European nuclear power plants that could affect neighbouring regions of Member States if an incident occurred.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the resolution on Turkey because the constitutional reform that took place 12 September last was unanimously recognised as an important step forward made by Turkey in relation to Europe. Naturally, there are still many more steps to be taken and in this vein, I would express my concern over the numerous arrests of journalists. I would like to underline that Turkey is the seventh largest commercial partner of the European Union, that the European Union is Turkey’s main commercial partner, and that trade – which has been carried out correctly for centuries – has favoured interpenetration and the peaceful acquaintance of one people with another. I therefore applaud the notable progress made in terms of getting started on connections between the European Union and Turkey, in particular, through the motorways of the sea that cross the northern Adriatic and the northern Tyrrhenian seas, which now see a flow of more than 250 000 truckloads per year in both directions, together with an important heavy-goods railway freight link from ports to destinations within Europe. In this way, it was possible to get rid of a significant amount of heavy goods vehicles on the road and I hope that this continues. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the reports on equality between women and men and female poverty in Europe and I am delighted that this has been debated on the very day that we celebrate the hundredth anniversary of International Women’s Day. Notwithstanding Directive 2002/73/EC on equal treatment between men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training, promotion and working conditions, further efforts still need to be made to achieve proper transposition. Suffice it to say that, although the level of female education has increased significantly in recent years and the number of female graduates is now higher than that of male graduates, women remain concentrated in traditionally female sectors and are frequently paid less and occupy fewer positions of responsibility in all spheres of society. The lack of access to support services for their dependents, such as children, the disabled and the elderly, to adequate leave schemes and to flexible working arrangements, all impede women from working. I would like to close by remembering the women of the world who are fighting for the most basic of rights and I would like this House to express its solidarity with the Iranian feminist associations that are today taking to the streets, inviting women to demonstrate without the hijab

 We hope that Croatia makes fast progress in the negotiations for EU membership. Speeding up Croatia’s accession is crucial if one considers its strategic geopolitical position as a gateway to markets in Central Europe. Hence the need for an integrated development of ports and connections to the European corridors, especially in view of the fact that Croatia will enjoy a significant flow of EU funding, of which 60% will be allocated to infrastructure. For this to happen, Croatia should continue to adopt the necessary reforms. In particular, it should strengthen public administration and the judiciary, fight corruption and ensure full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. I welcome the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Croatia on the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction. I am disappointed about the situation of the Croatian shipbuilding industry, a sector that was once the pearl of Yugoslav industrial exports, but which is now in almost total ruin. I hope that the Croatian Government is able conclude the restructuring process as soon as possible so that it can also close the chapter on competition. In particular, I emphasise the importance of the accession of Croatia in relation to the integrated maritime policy in the Adriatic, which will soon officially be an almost completely European sea.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, should like to thank Mr Cancian for his efforts in obtaining this difficult compromise. Thanks to this regulation, bus and coach passengers can enjoy rights similar to those of passengers on other modes of transport, such as trains and boats. The regulation, which applies to all national and international services wherever the distance to be covered is equal to or greater than 250 km, also protects passengers using regular services over shorter distances. I am referring, in particular, to disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility, who have been guaranteed non-discriminatory access to transport, the right to compensation in the event of loss of or damage to wheelchairs, as well as training on disabilities for bus and coach employees. I am also delighted that an agreement has been reached on compensation for death, including reasonable funeral expenses, or personal injury, and loss of or damage to luggage due to accidents. I also consider it a positive step that passengers can choose between continuing the journey at no additional cost or reimbursement of the ticket price in case of cancellation, a delay of more than two hours, or overbooking. In terms of information for passengers, I think it would have been useful to provide them with information on connections with other means of transport, thereby also ensuring dialogue between bus and rail passenger transport services. Lastly, I am very pleased that during negotiations, we managed to research and guarantee the maximum level of assistance for disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility, giving them the option of being accompanied at no extra cost.

Today’s vote on the EU-Libya Framework Agreement is the result of some tough negotiations, particularly on the issue of migrants. In Libya, the situation regarding human rights for refugees and asylum seekers is extremely dangerous. They have no legal recognition and there is no system in place to protect them. I hope that their fundamental human rights will be safeguarded, along with their right to asylum. Libya has not ratified the Geneva Convention of 28 July 1951 or the Protocol of 1967 relating to the Status of Refugees, and at the moment, does not intend to do so. However, in 1981, it did ratify the 1969 Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa. It is therefore bound to comply with the principle of non-refoulement of migrants requiring international protection, who must be identified in accordance with criteria that are no less strict than those established by the Geneva Convention itself. Under international law, people from countries such as Somalia, Sudan, Eritrea and Ethiopia have the right to humanitarian protection and political asylum, and I hope that the Libyan authorities will agree to cooperate with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

 We should not be shy or reticent about the European Union’s duty to uphold the freedom to profess one’s religion. In view of the undeniable exacerbation of violence against Christians in various parts of the world, the EU urgently needs to take a clear stance against any violation of the right to the freedom to profess one’s religious faith. The subject of religious freedom must be integrated in European policies, not least by including a binding clause on respect for religious freedom in our agreements with other countries. These principles are Europe’s banner, and we cannot make exceptions to them under any circumstances. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

When we speak about trafficking in human beings, we must think about not only sexual exploitation, forced labour and illegal adoptions, but also the problem of trafficking in organs, which is becoming an increasingly widespread crime. The European legal structure is not effective enough and the European Union and Member States must do more. We need an established structure for coordination between the institutions and the agencies of the EU, as well as those of the Member States and international partners. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, to date, access to employment has been regulated only for a few specific categories of third-country nationals. Indeed, not everyone benefits from the general principle of equality of treatment in access to employment. As a result, the European Union must take steps to guarantee equal treatment both for third-country nationals legally residing in a Member State and for those who qualify for refugee status or who require international protection, pursuant to Council Directive 2004/83 of 29 April 2004. We need to prevent a growth in demand, for example, for seasonal workers, just because they can be paid less and because they have different – lower – costs with respect to European citizens employed to do the same job. We must also avoid, for example, the risk of many multinational companies transferring their headquarters to countries such as Morocco or Turkey and sending their employees to work in European branches because it is cheaper. For reasons of social justice, we must ensure that European citizens are treated equally in terms of remuneration, working conditions and social security. For this reason, I believe that it is right to include seasonal workers, posted workers, refugees and self-employed workers in this directive. It would be extremely dangerous to make distinctions.

The latest violent events linked to the dispute between Morocco and the Polisario Front over the Western Sahara require greater attention due to the negative effects they could have on stability in the region. The clearing of the camp at Laâyoune seems to have resulted in about a dozen deaths, more than 700 wounded, 150 missing and 160 arrested by the Moroccan authorities and is believed to have led to the killing of a Spanish citizen of Sahrawi origins, Baby Hamday Buyema. We must not leave the Sahrawi people all alone, but we need to finish off the negotiations conducted under the aegis of the United Nations, in accordance with the principles of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, particularly Article 2. The European Union must intervene and urge the Moroccan Government to avoid further bloodshed and release those Sahrawi who have been detained illegally. The resumption of informal talks between the parties, which took place on 7 and 8 November 2010, must represent the first sign that a fair solution can been peacefully accepted by the parties.

I would like to express my satisfaction over the importance attributed to matters concerning civil law, such as the legislative proposal on reinforced cooperation in the divorce law sector and the recognition and creation of official public documents on inheritance. I am particularly pleased to see the emphasis placed on the need to introduce specific actions and programmes to promote an effective European judicial culture, based on the supply of training measures, to be held under Erasmus schemes for judges and all legal operators. The actions identified in the plan are very important for improving the guarantees of European citizens in respect of the law, but it is necessary to adopt a more strategic and less fragmentary approach based on the real needs of citizens and enterprises in the exercising of their rights. While, on the one hand, we must consider the difficulties of legislating in a harmonised manner within an area of shared responsibility, on the other, we need to extend EU regulations in the sector of justice and internal affairs. In this way, the parameters of legal certainty will be increasingly clear and supported and we will pave the way for a genuinely common legal theory and practice with a European Union.

 As the exchange of data between the European Union and the United States is increasingly necessary and frequent in the context of the fight against terrorism and organised crime, a general and common legal framework must also be drawn up to protect personal data. This framework must provide for protection equivalent to that enjoyed by European citizens within the Union. The Commission’s negotiating mandate is therefore heading in the right direction. With regard to the sphere of application, this legal framework must also apply to existing bilateral agreements. I hope that the Council adopts the mandate as presented and that Parliament is kept fully and promptly informed of all developments in the negotiations, bearing in mind that Parliament will have the final word on the future agreement.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Mrs Meissner for her report on integrated maritime policy, and I agree with her on the need to strengthen maritime transport and the shipbuilding industry, to safeguard coastal regions and to promote innovation and research activities. Today, maritime transport plays a fundamental role in trade. As a result, we must encourage cooperation between small and large ports that face one another in the same sea basin and which can facilitate more fluid trade. Furthermore, in order to ensure intermodality, we must invest in port and dry port infrastructure, especially in ports that can be connected via European corridors. Lastly, I believe it is important not to overlook another issue, namely port security. All the measures relating to safety within all European ports must be harmonised so as to better protect maritime transport and prevent unfair competition from harming those ports which actually have to incur greater expense in order to guarantee a higher level of safety.

I voted in favour on the indication of the country of origin of certain products imported from third countries. With this vote I wished to emphasise the European Parliament’s commitment to promoting European industry, the competitiveness of which must today be safeguarded and supported. Furthermore, the right for European citizens to know the origin of the products they buy will be guaranteed. However, I do not believe that excluding specialised and recognised production sectors with a long history and tradition, such as the optical industry, is in keeping with EU policy.

 I welcome the proposal for a directive, which represents a decisive step forward in relation to the directive currently in force. Once transposed nationally, regionally and locally, it will appreciably improve payment, particularly by public authorities, to companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, which will be able to count on having a more secure cash flow. In many countries in Europe, when the public authorities are in a difficult situation, they are known to generally pay late and very often cause some companies to go bankrupt. A glaring example is Italy where, by the end of 2009, the public authorities were in debt to companies to the tune of approximately EUR 60 billion, and the payment delay averaged 186 days, with extremes of 800 days. One need only think of the amounts owed to the hotels that took in the survivors of the severe earthquake that hit the Abruzzo region in April 2009. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of this resolution because I believe it is necessary at EU level to have a specific European strategy for the development of mountain and island regions: a strategy that takes account of aspects such as promoting the economy and structures, employment policy, the protection of natural resources, civil defence, and environmental and energy policy. The principle of territorial cohesion is one of the European Union’s key objectives introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon with the aim of reducing regional disparities and removing natural or geographical obstacles. Concrete actions and specific development strategies are needed to do this. It is necessary to create equal opportunities between these regions and the rest of the European Union. One such opportunity might be to promote sustainable tourism in the mountain regions, thus creating an important subsistence base for the inhabitants of these areas. Also, that very Madrid declaration by European ministers on 15 April 2010 stresses a more effective coordination of the measures implemented with regard to tourism policy, and on promotion aimed at more innovative, sustainable and social tourism in Europe.

Unfortunately, due to the constant increase in air traffic, the number of victims of civil aviation accidents has increased notably. Suffice it to say that in 2005, there were 1 454, an increase of some 90% compared to 2004. We therefore need new legislation which reduces discrepancies in the investigation abilities of the Member States and which creates a ‘network’ between the various national investigation authorities, with the aim of rationalising skills, personnel and resources. Therefore, I am in favour of this proposal for a regulation which, on the one hand, will ensure the absolute independence of investigations into accidents and, on the other, will oblige airline companies to guarantee the rights of victims and their relatives in the event of an accident.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the completion of the internal market in postal services by the end of this year is an important step, but the Commission should carry out an impact assessment – as some of the previous speakers pointed out – on the postal market liberalisation in order to better understand citizens’ requirements. Indeed, how does the Commission intend to safeguard the rights of European citizens who live in hard-to-reach areas, such as mountain or rural areas, so that they may receive post regularly, and what instruments does the Commission intend to adopt to ensure this occurs? Moreover, I do not think that we should use this directive, which already exists, to justify social dumping. It is the Member States which must apply the directive and which possess all the means to do so. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 I voted against the agreement reached at second reading by Parliament with the Council on the draft directive on the use of animals in scientific experiments. I am not saying ‘No’ to the advance of research but I am calling for a reduction in animal suffering, since the revised directive proposes some practices that go against that aim, such as the possibility of experimenting more than once on the same animal. Moreover, I believe the use of other satisfactory scientific methods that do not require the use of animals should be developed further. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 The legal framework on same-sex couples within the European Union is very diverse and radical differences exist between different Member States. Episodes of discrimination against same-sex couples occur virtually on a daily basis, hence the need to ensure respect for Directives 2000/43/EC and 2000/78/EC on combating discrimination based on religion, disability and sexual orientation. The European Union must make more effort to guarantee same-sex couples the same rights granted to heterosexual couples when they move to another Member State in the European Union to study or work, by virtue of the directive on the free movement of European citizens.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal on the rights of passengers travelling by bus and coach aims to aid and protect passengers, in particular, persons with disabilities or reduced mobility. It is the first regulation on the rights of bus and coach passengers and should form a guarantee for such passengers, as in the rail and air transport sectors. The position at second reading aims to establish a series of rights for passengers deciding to travel by bus or coach. I agree with the argument of the rapporteur, Mr Cancian, whom I thank for the excellent work accomplished and I believe that the scope of application of the regulation must be amended, excluding regional services when they are integrated with urban and suburban services. It would be fair and proper to guarantee the rights of passengers in case of accidents, cancellations or delayed departures, as was decided at Parliament’s first reading. Equally important is the question of information on passengers’ rights. Indeed, it would be useful to supply passengers with information on connections with other modes of transport, thereby also ensuring dialogue between bus and rail passenger transport services. Regarding persons with disabilities or reduced mobility, it is necessary to guarantee maximum protection and I would propose a 24-hour advance notice period for requesting assistance as opposed to 48 hours. I would also propose greater guarantees for compensation for and replacement of mobility equipment for people with disabilities in case of loss or damage. Furthermore, bearing in mind the needs of passengers with reduced mobility, all architectural barriers ought to be removed and existing infrastructure improved to render them accessible. This regulation aims to improve the competitiveness of the bus and coach sector and facilitate connections between modes of transport but, above all, it aims to improve the travel conditions of passengers.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteur, Mr Sterckx, who has done excellent work on this report which deals with how to increase free movement in the maritime sector, for shipping within the European Union. I agree with Mr Sterckx on the aim of this directive, which is to exempt all intra-European maritime goods transport from unnecessary administrative formalities. Indeed, in order to have a maritime transport space without barriers, it is not only important for the various competent authorities to work together well, but also for the various simplification systems to be implemented in parallel. This is in order to ensure the effective operation of the European maritime transport space without barriers, to make maritime goods transport more attractive, and to ensure it is used to the optimum extent. Harmonisation of administrative procedures between the Member States will ensure the smoother running of maritime traffic between the various EU ports and will revive maritime goods transport, which today represents only 10% of the total. Maritime transport is, at present, still hampered by the administrative formalities imposed on it. Electronic systems should therefore come into operation as quickly as possible in order to allow a faster data exchange system. Furthermore, interoperability is important for genuine simplification of administration. In fact, sending information by e-mail does no good and is of no use if the information systems are not technically interoperable. With regards to language, I believe that the use of a common language would certainly benefit European maritime transport. This would enable communication to take place more smoothly, and thus cause less confusion and fewer administrative delays. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 The report on the future of transport aims to support and develop an efficient and sustainable transport system in Europe. In order for this to come about, it is necessary that the internal transport market is fully completed and that all obstacles resulting from the late, or lack of, transposition of EU legislation in the Member States are removed. A transport fund will also be necessary in order to guarantee financing of the trans-European transport network projects and the systems to support the network. The TEN-T projects are a priority for transport policy, but the problem of missing infrastructure must be removed, as well as the geographical and historical obstacles of cross-border routes. Lastly, the issue of road safety – among other things – is one of the key points upon which the transport policy should be based in future. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 The development of an efficient and sustainable European transport system requires the revitalisation of rail freight, by means of coordinated action between Member States and cooperation between railway infrastructure managers to develop intermodality, market opening and the management of freight and passenger traffic. The proposal for a regulation aims to improve the rail freight service by means of a procedure for identifying the European corridors that must ensure a high-quality freight service. Freight corridor 5 has already been drafted at ministerial level in 2006, according to the Baltic-Adriatic corridor, pan-European corridor VI and Priority Project 23. It is therefore right to proceed with the commitments we have undertaken and pursue our established objectives; a point returned to several times during the TEN-T conference in Zaragoza.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteur for his excellent work on the European Union membership of the Human Rights Convention, which benefits European citizens: due to this convention, there will be a new court, external to the European Union, to ensure that the rights of European citizens are always respected by the European Union and Member States. Under the principle of democracy, the European Union and its Member States should always have the right to be able to defend themselves. I therefore believe it is crucial that every nation belonging to the convention should have a judge to explain the context of every appeal, just as I think it important that the European Parliament should have an informal body to coordinate information exchanges between Parliament and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council, and that Parliament should also be consulted during the negotiation process. I would also like to add that European citizens have the right to understand the mechanisms governing this membership, just as they have the right to know what their rights are. Therefore, I believe it is essential for the Council of Europe and the European Union to consider establishing guidelines, with a clear explanation of all the effects and implications that membership will entail.

 The affair of the Icelandic volcano and its current consequences lead us to reflect that the European Union must not be unprepared for an emergency or unexpected occurrences, but must protect passengers above all else using existing or new management instruments or measures.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr Leichtfried for his excellent work on the report on aviation security charges, which considers, among its various aspects, one important point: consumer protection and passengers’ rights. There have to be clear and transparent rules because, if airlines charge passengers extra for security measures, this information should be made available, in my view, to ensure that passengers are not out of pocket. I believe that it is only right that consumer protection organisations should take part in the consultations and thus gain an insight into the pricing of security measures, which they can then check against the ticket price. Only in this way will it be possible to guarantee greater transparency and information for passengers. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the recent rail accident in Brussels, which many Members have mentioned, the spotlight has once again been on the safety of the railways. Directive 2004/49/EC on safety of the railways in general stipulates that railway undertakings and infrastructure managers should bear the full responsibility for the safety of the system, each for their own part. In the specific case of the accident that occurred in Belgium, human error seems to have been the cause. We shall, of course, await the investigations. It would appear, however, that the train was not fitted with an automatic braking system. Is the Commission aware of which networks and which trains within the Member States are not fitted with this safety device? Moreover, does it intend to draft a legislative proposal so as to ensure that the Union’s entire network is fitted with this system? Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Croatia’s membership of the European Union accentuates the gelling of a European identity that is able to express the common values of our new Europe while incorporating, rather than glossing over, the individualities of its many occupants. The Republic of Croatia has made appreciable efforts to come up to the required standards, particularly in combating organised crime through new anti-mafia measures, but it needs to make further efforts, particularly in the judicial field, before the 2010 negotiations can conclude. The institutions of the Republic of Croatia can make further steps forward to come into line with the requirements of the first protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights, signed in Paris in 1952, by considering the return of nationalised assets to their rightful owners.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is committed to combating all forms of terrorism. When we speak of tackling terrorist offences, we need to ensure that fundamental rights are fully upheld and that the measures adopted to fight terrorism are suitable and effective. The rights of defence and fundamental procedural safeguards must therefore be fully complied with by the EU institutions, including when they draw up lists of individuals and bodies, in this case linked to al-Qaeda, that are subject to restrictive measures. It is equally essential that these measures are subject to proper democratic and parliamentary scrutiny, as rightly required by the Treaty of Lisbon. It is therefore clear, as also affirmed by Parliament’s legal service, that each measure of this kind must follow the ordinary legislative procedure, enabling the representatives of Europe’s citizens to fully perform their roles as legislators and guarantors.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur of one of the dossiers on Europol, I can only reassert what has already been said by the Members who have spoken before me. Thanks to its role in the collection, analysis and exchange of information, Europol facilitates investigations in Member States and has thus become an important tool in the fight against crime. We need to be more effective in tackling crime, but at the same time, we must resolutely assert the authority of this Parliament. The Council has decided that it will, in any case, adopt the texts of the Europol package on 30 November, without waiting for Parliament to obtain the power of codecision on this matter with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December. The aim of rejecting the proposals is not to stand in the way of Europol assuming its new role as a European body, but to have the powers of this Parliament, the European Parliament, extended, especially on important matters relating to freedom, security and justice. Finally, I think that it is right to give Parliament greater powers of scrutiny over Europol’s activities in order to check that the handling of data held by Europol does not undermine the rights of European citizens.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am aware that, on 30 September, the Commission presented a study on the indicators of media pluralism in the Member States. However, in 2008, this House adopted a report by Marianne Mikko in which the European Commission and the Member States were asked to safeguard, and I quote verbatim, ‘the multiplicity of opinions in the media, to guarantee the pluralism of information, to ensure that all EU citizens can access free and diversified media’. Even earlier, in 2004, Parliament adopted a report by Mrs Boogerd-Quaak on the risks of violation, in the EU, of freedom of expression and information. In this report, the Commission was asked to submit a communication on the safeguarding of media pluralism in all the Member States. To date, the Commission has still not given clear responses to Parliament’s requests. You will notice, Commissioner, that I have mentioned neither my country nor its Prime Minister. However, I, as a European citizen, am asking you in this House what the Commission intends to do at European level to ensure that media pluralism is guaranteed in all the Member States.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the motion under debate today sees the full implementation of the agreement that the budgetary authorities concluded in December on the 2012 portion of financing for the ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) research project. The ITER project, which involves the European Union as well as major countries such as Japan, the United States and China, requires a further EUR 650 million in appropriations and therefore the expenditure ceiling set out in Heading 1a of the financial perspectives needs to be revised by the same amount. Through this motion we therefore give the green light to this EUR 650 million increase in commitment appropriations. The agreement on which this important aspect of the 2012 budget is based has been a crucial aspect of these budget negotiations. In fact I would say that it has been a fundamental condition for the 2012 budget conciliation to reach a positive outcome and for the negotiations to conclude. It has allowed us to substantially increase the funds in 2012 for important programmes such as Lifelong Learning, Competitiveness and Innovation, the Seventh Research Programme, and especially for allowing us to fund ITER using transfers as little as possible. That was very important, representing a positive outcome that allowed this House to approve the agreement. ITER is therefore added to the 2012 budget without any negative impact on the implementation of other programmes and without becoming a burden on other programmes; that is a very significant fact. Furthermore, this agreement and this motion marks the real beginning of the sensitive matter of implementing the 2012 budget. Even through we focus all our attention on the negotiations for concluding the draft budget, there is then the important step of putting it into action, which starts with this step and will see us take particular care over the sensitive matter of payments. My hope is that, during the implementation of the 2012 budget, we will be able to re-locate the hitherto excellent spirit of cooperation between the Commission and Parliament in particular, which was crucial for finalising the budget and will be even more important for supporting its implementation.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank all my fellow Members for their substantial support for the report we are discussing today. I would like to emphasise that, predictably, during the debate we quite naturally looked into the substance of the ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) project. However I want to point out that today we are really giving life to the agreement signed in December, which enabled us to wind up the negotiations over the 2012 budget. We are therefore implementing an agreement reached in conciliation, which not only saw us finalise the budget conciliation but saw us finalise it in the best way possible, in view of all the negotiations we carried out last year, so that this important instrument is funded using transfers as little as possible. This is truly an important achievement, because we will not harm the other programmes financed out of the budget. To me, that seems to be the outcome that we should prize most highly. Above all, it gives me particular pleasure to point out that the conciliation process was the final step in negotiations that we managed to conduct with enormous cooperation and collaboration. Long may it continue. Francesca Balzani,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 18 November, Parliament and the Council reached a common position on the budget three days ahead of the conciliation deadline. This is a good sign: at a time of great uncertainty and difficulty, it means that the European institutions want to look to the future first; it is also a decision to shoulder their responsibilities. From the start, Parliament has put the EU 2020 strategy, the major crisis-prevention strategy for future growth and wellbeing, at the centre of the budget. Drafting a budget is no easy task for anyone today, not even for Europe, but Parliament made a choice, which was fully accepted during the conciliation. Thus, we have more resources for growth, research, employment, lifelong learning, immigration policies and international policies in Europe. Payments, however, fared badly in the conciliation. They fared badly, which is nothing new. Indeed, it is unfortunately the case that there is strong disagreement – clear and ongoing disagreement – over the issue of payments between Parliament and the Commission on one side, and the Council on the other. Disagreement that will have to be solved, that will have to be overcome, because this is a situation that we clearly cannot tolerate any longer. Unfortunately, however, conciliation is not the ideal forum in which to open discussions, in which to open conciliations, because – and the experience of the past year has clearly taught us this – opening major discussions in the strict and rigorous confines of the conciliation procedure is liable to simply jeopardise the forthcoming budget. The Commission’s faultless projections of funding requirements – and I want to emphasise this point – the Commission’s extremely authoritative and reliable projections, which Parliament endorsed, are thus rendered useless. I hope that this can be resolved. It is clear, in my view, that we will not find a permanent solution to this problem until the European budget is equipped with its own resources. However, what we, as Parliament, certainly can do – in line with the commitment to intervene promptly should payment needs increase during the year, which we signed and attached to the budget – what we certainly can and must do is to strive to ensure that this commitment is honoured and, above all, to work together to ensure that this commitment is not a victim, in terms of its form and schedule, of the next budgetary conciliation, because what we must do – and this is the decision that we made with ITER, that we made this year on the subject of payments – is to refrain from opening conciliations within the conciliation procedure. I should like to thank everyone: all my fellow Members who made an enthusiastic contribution to the drafting of this budget; the Polish Presidency, which played an important role and provided impetus; and especially the Commission, Commissioner Lewandowski, who maintained an exceptional balance throughout the entire delicate conciliation procedure. Then there are the policy advisors from our groups, and finally our assistants, who worked long into the night on this task. Francesca Balzani,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we live in a time of crisis – not only economic crisis but also a crisis of confidence. This crisis of confidence affects all citizens, but especially the youngest, who as a result find it harder to summon the courage and desire to build their own futures. The European Union has set a challenge to tackle this crisis, which is also a challenge for the EU itself: the great Europe 2020 strategy must genuinely combat this lack of confidence and help us back onto the path towards a better future and a better life. That is precisely why Parliament has put funding for this strategy at the heart of the budget for 2012, starting with its very top priority: higher employment, better employment and quality employment in a Europe that focuses on innovation and research. Hence, we in this Parliament have asked and are asking for greater resources for three key programmes, which are the true engines behind the 2020 strategy: the Lifelong Learning Programme, the Seventh Framework Programme and the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP). Today, therefore, what we need is consistency, to follow up on our intentions, to send out a positive message and hence start really building this future. Not funding a strategy to combat the crisis because we are in a crisis would be a gloomy message that would be hard to justify. Right now, our citizens are expecting us to act consistently and with sincerity. However, they are not the only ones watching us: this year the markets are also particularly attentive to our decisions and our ability to take the necessary decisions – in the right ways and in the right timeframes – in order to get back on track. Sending out positive messages is therefore a particularly sensitive issue. In this respect, it would not only be great to produce a budget that makes a genuine start on putting the 2020 strategy in place, but it would also be really important for us to do so in an atmosphere of major institutional collaboration. Parliament decided to place huge trust in the estimates of the Commission precisely in order to send out a positive message. The Commission is undoubtedly working as well as is feasible at this difficult time, which is why Parliament deemed its estimates on payment requirements to be reliable. There is another emergency: the institutional frameworks of many Mediterranean countries are currently undergoing change. Europe cannot remain removed from this process; we cannot stand in the wings but instead we must take a central role in international politics. We therefore need to react to the crisis and assume renewed leadership on the international stage. We request the use of the Flexibility Instrument for these two fundamental objectives. It will therefore be important to overcome these two challenges, instil confidence, prove our credibility and prove our reliability to citizens and the other institutions that are watching us. That is not all though, for I believe that this year there is yet another real challenge ahead: doing it in a transparent way. Indeed, our budget reading is not tactical or a negotiating tool: it is exactly the budget that this Parliament believes is essential for 2012, because I think this year it is also important to find a common position quickly and in good time, in order to communicate the essence, the ability and the image of a Europe that knows how to galvanise itself at the right time.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank all my fellow Members, as well as Mr Lewandowski and Mr Dominik, for this very interesting debate, which has seen a very important issue come to the fore. There is real unity in Parliament on this budget reading and I think this is due to something that has perhaps rarely been seen: Parliament has not limited itself to asking, but has also proposed painful cuts. As a number of my fellow Members have pointed out: on Heading 4 alone – one of the most difficult – Parliament has taken on the responsibility of making almost EUR 90 million of cuts. The motion has therefore been drawn up through effort and hard work, and – I would stress –not to fund Parliament’s priorities but to fund the Union’s priorities, because the Europe 2020 strategy is not a priority for Parliament but rather a priority for the Union. Today we are here to fund it, asking to invoke the Flexibility Instrument for EUR 240 million. We are talking about a total budget of EUR 150 billion, within the financial perspective of 2006, set up before the 2008 crisis, before the Europe 2020 strategy and even before the Treaty of Lisbon came into force. Here, today, we are asking to invoke the Flexibility Instrument for EUR 240 million, to start to fund the EU’s priorities, which we have put on the table as a way to fight the crisis. I therefore hope that our shared vision of the priorities that you have mentioned on a number of occasions, Mr Dominik, can reach its zenith in the conciliation procedure. It is difficult to talk about priorities if you do not want to take that extremely important step of turning written priorities into priorities that are realised, true, real and tangible. The year 2020 is almost upon us: we cannot wait for a new Financial Framework to start funding it and, as many fellow Members have said, it is not only citizens that are waiting to see what we do but also the markets. Therefore, I really hope that in the conciliation procedure we, as a budgetary authority, can find the unity that Parliament has found and I hope we can do so quickly. Francesca Balzani,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I simply have a technical amendment that is required in order to start the vote. In lines 05 04 05 02 and 05 08 06, the amendments BUDG1207 and BUDG1206, as recorded in the meeting reports, do not include the amendments to the amounts. These should be incorporated and adopted so as to correct the amounts in the draft budget. In relation to Amendment 1207, that means an additional EUR 2.5 million and EUR 3 million in commitment and payment appropriations, respectively, for line 05 04 05 02. In relation to Amendment 1206, that means an additional EUR 1 million in commitment and payment appropriations for line 05 08 06. However, the notes that follow particular agency budget lines must be adapted to make them consistent with the definitive amounts decided upon. Francesca Balzani,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the institutions involved in the budget procedure, namely the Commission, the Council and Parliament, described their position in the Council’s reading in July – the Council and Commission with figures, Parliament with a definition of its priorities. These positions are apparently very different, and often far removed from each other – I am thinking in particular of payments and research funding – but there are also points of convergence, and we must concentrate our efforts on these areas of agreement if we are to reach a common position. Parliament has an extremely difficult task, as it must also look to the future and play a proactive role. This is the most challenging area for elected institutions: they must operate with their feet firmly in the present, and hence be acutely aware of the tough times we are experiencing, the consolidation being carried out by Member States and the sacrifices being demanded of our fellow citizens, while always working to ensure investment, economic recovery and a more prosperous future. This year especially, the budget should strike a delicate balance between opposing desires: to maintain the stability of the present, but also to continue to look forward and start laying the foundations for the future straight away. This Parliament will make strong calls for funding for the 2020 strategy, starting with the creation of quality employment, but there are also new areas of responsibility, some of which are sensitive: I am thinking of the new responsibilities granted to us by the Treaty of Lisbon, and of the European Securities and Markets Authority. Then we have the level of payments, which should be correct from the outset, from the time of budget approval, and also undeniable emergencies such as migratory pressures and the situation in North Africa. Consequently, with regard to the documents on priorities, on which we have already voted, we will continue, in a consistent and transparent manner, to develop and create instruments that will enable us to implement our policies.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with the mandate for the trialogue the budget procedure entered its most concrete phase, the phase in which the budgetary authorities actually enter into discussions which may produce useful and significant results. This is why, above all, I hope that this trialogue is an opportunity that will be taken, an opportunity not to be missed. We embarked on the budget procedure in a spirit of great realism. The Member States are currently implementing tough national budgetary consolidation policies, and these policies have to find an important balance between the need to tackle the crisis and the need to relaunch the economy and investment. This is precisely why at this time the European Union budget, which has a great and unique ability to give added value to expenditure, investment and resources, can and absolutely must play a fundamental role. A fundamental role in which it is crucial that the Europe 2020 strategy should be taken as a starting point. This Parliament has made the Europe 2020 strategy a central issue of the budgetary discussions right from the start. The 2012 budget can and must be the first step in taking concrete measures towards this strategy, which is the tool that has been chosen precisely for the relaunch of our Union. In this sense, giving a financial dimension to the Europe 2020 strategy brings into play and gives a central role to our consistency and credibility. We cannot build such an ambitious strategy without implementing it immediately, precisely at a time when it is crucial that this tool for relaunching the economy be made to fully deploy its effects. Consistency, credibility and the ambitious Europe 2020 strategy therefore also become decisive and fundamental in guaranteeing the stability we need today within the European Union, as well as with regard to our single currency. There are also other facts and policies that are coming to the fore. I am thinking of democratic processes in the Mediterranean area and the need to guarantee an external dimension to the European Union, which at this time can truly play a role and resume an important position of leadership for itself. Let us not forget that the budget is not just an instrument to be approved when there has to be a forecast for the following year. It is also a tool that has to function throughout the course of the year. In this sense it is an issue requiring delicate handling not only with regard to the payments for the following year, but also with regard to implementation of the 2011 budget for the current year. Consistency, credibility and strong, decisive, single-minded use of the budget as a fundamental instrument for fighting the crisis and compensating for Member States’ consolidation policies – these are all issues that require a serious commitment on our part, that must truly ensure we once again play a crucial role in the security of the European Union, and above all – and this is my major concern – that invite us not to waste the opportunity of the trialogue. The trialogue can and must truly be a valuable opportunity for a concrete and useful exchange, which this year will bring us to a shared vision of the budgetary choices we need to make. I find that sharing choices when working on a document as important as the budget is another excellent sign of our ability to work within the Union, which is particularly important at this time.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that this very interesting debate, which follows on from the one we had in the special committees, shows that there is a great consensus in this Parliament as regards the fundamental strategies. Among the many others, the most important point is the budget, which is undoubtedly the only and most important tool for constructing the delicate balance between consolidation of the public accounts and the need to support growth. It is the only real bastion we have against the risk that consolidation might depress the European economy in a severe and irreversible way. The budget is therefore a focal tool. The European Parliament is not asking for a generally ambitious budget, but for an instrument that is strong on all the priorities that are today clear and easy to see. In the Europe 2020 strategy, the priority is first and foremost investment in work. Here in the Chamber today we have again mentioned research, development, social cohesion and energy, all priorities for which the budget is the most important indicator of the seriousness of our intentions. The seriousness of our intentions implies our strong institutional credibility. Today this focal budget is therefore a very important element among many, because we have once again drawn attention to the fact that it then becomes a driving force for transforming our commitments into reality, which is no small thing. The budget therefore becomes an important element for restoring stability to the European Union, and also to our single currency. Therefore, I hope that already in this trialogue this strong sense of responsibility that we all share, and it could not have been otherwise, will open the way to calm, responsible and constructive negotiations for the future of our Union. Francesca Balzani,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the document we are examining today is not merely a report on the priorities of the next European budget, but also and above all a strategic document looking at the new role that the European budget must play in the context of greater economic governance. This is the first year of the European Semester, which has been designed precisely to establish the greatest possible coordination between the Union’s budget and those of the Member States, the greatest possible synergy and the utmost complementarity. All of which essentially means one thing: convergence, and making the budgets of the Member States converge with the major goals of the European budget. Today, these objectives – these European objectives – can only be those laid down in the Europe 2020 Strategy: a grand, ambitious strategy with five highly important targets and seven big flagship initiatives. These are big, important goals, but they are also very specific. The first target is extremely important and involves building a more fully, better employed Europe by making the right investments. We therefore have a huge priority for the 2012 budget: we must not waste time in executing the 2020 Strategy, beginning with the first of the targets, that of higher employment in Europe. Immediately setting out the dimension of the 2020 Strategy in our budget is therefore essential and a matter of urgency. Two things are fundamental in order to achieve this: we must plan and we must look to the future. Planning means ruling out mathematical approaches to the budget, which are absolutely senseless. Mathematical, general and indiscriminate increases are of no use at all. Instead we must look at what exactly are the programmes and the actions that can contribute to the 2020 Strategy. Looking to the future has an absolutely crucial significance: taking the utmost care over our commitments and not simply over our payments, because commitments are the tool with which to build the sustainable financial future of our Union. Flexibility is another important subject. We are at the end of the planning period and so the budget is particularly rigid. I therefore think that it is really important that, right from the start, we consider all the available flexibility instruments as fundamental and indispensable for the budget we are going to draw up if we want it to be not only possible or essential to take the first step towards the 2020 Strategy – which absolutely must not be a failure, as we have seen in the past – but also if we want it to be a useful and effective budget. I am convinced that it will only be possible to reach all these major objectives if we work together patiently, right from the very start, to build a renewed climate of institutional cooperation. Institutional cooperation is one of the major challenges of the Treaty of Lisbon, which we always talk about rather carelessly. Institutional collaboration means really finding a renewed feeling of equality so as to work together on this sensitive issue, the budget, which is not only one of the most strategically important instruments to build our future, but also one of the most tangible and practical. Francesca Balzani,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the word ‘responsibility’ has been mentioned a number of times during the speeches. There is, however, one responsibility that I really think takes priority for the institutions: above all we are responsible for implementing our programmes and ensuring that EU citizens are not left with just our words. We have the responsibility to be consistent in what we say and what we promise. Today’s major projects are those set out in the 2020 Strategy. The first target of ‘more work’ is not only very ambitious but also very precise, since it can even be measured using unemployment reduction parameters. This seems to me to be a very specific and very ambitious goal and I think it is essential to start working to achieve it. As long as we continue to consider the 2020 Strategy as too big and too ambitious to be squeezed into a practical document like the budget, I think we will achieve nothing more than increasing the risk of another failure, which is exactly what nobody wants, starting with the Commission, if I remember the first communication on the 2020 Strategy correctly. There is, however, another important issue: austerity is not a policy, it is not an instrument, it is a condition against which we must take action, and not only by consolidating our expenditure, but also by using the European budget, an extraordinary instrument that is radically different from the national budgets and gives us the chance to do something different this year. This is precisely what the European Semester is for. Clogging up the first six months of the year is not its only use. It enables us to come up with a global strategy and to create synergies; and creating synergies between the budgets of the Member States and our budget is an extraordinarily European system to give more value to public resources and to create a real method to turn the 2020 Strategy – long and ambitious as it is – into a European reality. Francesca Balzani,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament has been called upon to express its opinion on two agreements that have been signed with the United States and with 11 Latin American countries, which will draw a line under a long and difficult affair. This affair has witnessed the European Union challenged at the World Trade Organisation, and more importantly has witnessed it as the losing party. It is a thorny issue, as the disputes relate to the principle of non-discrimination in international trade, which Europe has been accused of breaching in the way in which banana imports are organised within the Union. This is because we have a two-track system in that we apply one system to African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries and a different system to other countries. This system allowed ACP countries to bring this product to the European market without paying any import duty, unlike other countries, which have to pay a duty of EUR 176 per tonne. This agreement therefore brings the situation back into balance and most importantly allows ACP countries, which are in a fragile state of development, to export their products to the EU duty-free. At the same time, the other countries that have signed the agreements will be able to export bananas to the EU subject to the payment of import duties, which however will be gradually reduced over the period 2011–2017 from the current rate of EUR 176 per tonne to EUR 114 per tonne. However, as well as finally bringing the EU back into line with its commitments as a member of the World Trade Organisation and therefore in some ways restoring its credibility, including as an institution, the most important aspect is that these agreements make allowances for ACP countries in a vulnerable state of development, as they provide for instruments to give them financial support. These instruments will allow those countries to invest in diversifying their production and will therefore hopefully strengthen their economies. At present, these measures, worth EUR 190 million, are to be provided until 2013. I believe that these agreements are a positive step, not only because they draw a line under disputes in which the EU has been the losing party, with the ensuing consequences in economic and disciplinary terms and in terms of its institutional credibility as I already mentioned, but also because they lead to a balanced solution that respects the needs both of these ACP countries and of European producers in the outermost regions, who certainly cannot be abandoned to unbridled competition. I therefore propose that Parliament should approve these agreements, whilst asking the Council and Commission for firm commitments. In the first instance, they should provide, as quickly as possible, for an evaluation of the impact that these agreements will have between now and 2020 – quite a long timescale, therefore – on ACP countries and on European producers in the outermost regions, whose economies are closely tied to bananas. Secondly, Parliament should ask for a firm commitment to evaluating the effects of the financial accompanying measures earmarked for the ACP countries eighteen months before they are due to end. This would ensure that those countries could receive further assistance and support measures if necessary, so that they are not left to go it alone and are supported in combating, counteracting and mitigating to some degree any negative consequences that the entry into force of these agreements may have within the European Union due to the price adjustments and hence to changes in the competitiveness of bananas from other countries. I therefore believe that by resolving a tricky issue this agreement definitely provides a way out that also takes into consideration the needs of those weaker countries which, as I have already said, have always been our main concern, including during the long debate we had in the Committee on International Trade. I hope they will find strong support and a favourable solution in these accompanying measures, in particular in terms of monitoring and the commitment, which Parliament is asking of the Commission and Council, to look at the impacts of the agreement and the effects of the aid measures, and to extend and increase them if necessary in the future. Francesca Balzani,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think this debate has been very interesting and has partly restated some of the anxieties and issues which we have already looked at in the Committee on International Trade. I should like to re-emphasise an important fact that I think we lose sight of every now and then. These agreements represent the implementation of a specific commitment made by the European Union, in its role as a member of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). We must not forget this. Through these agreements, the EU is undertaking to resolve a serious problem with important countries, which it is having to sort out because it has breached the principle of non-discrimination. These are therefore agreements that restore our credibility and proper position as members of the WTO. This agreement follows on therefore from disputes and tensions, amid a climate that will certainly have been damaging for other areas of our relationships. As a definitive settlement agreement it is trying and succeeding to create a new balance, with particular attention, as we have said and have also stated in the resolution, to countries in fragile states of development. The accompanying measures will now certainly be monitored, and to my mind this is the most important point. It is important to have established the accompanying measures, but it will be even more important to have the evaluations of their impact and to have the commitment, which I am delighted to have heard today from the Council and the Commission, to keep constant track of the situation as it develops and above all the willingness to assist with further measures if they should prove to be necessary. POSEI (Programme of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity) itself has been incorporated into the resolution as a sensitive point that must be monitored due to the delicate balance between the financial contributions made under POSEI and the new situation regarding the outermost regions. Therefore the impact of the agreements on the outermost EU regions where bananas are produced will also be monitored and watched carefully. The Council also mentioned the need to work on transparency in the agri-food chain, which I am happy about, as it is an important point. We have been talking about producers the whole time, but there is also the major issue of banana distribution within the EU. There are many things that must be done going forward, therefore. We need to monitor the effects of the agreements, the implementation of the accompanying measures and the suitability of POSEI to protect Europe’s producers. We also need to use other instruments such as transparency in the agri-food chain and hence widen the scope of examination to take in the distribution chain as well, which has a major impact on the final cost of the fruit. We need to look at consumer protection, which is something that deserves our attention as much as all the other interests involved in this business. However, all these things, not least consumer protection, must start with the current situation and establishing the outcome of these disputes in which the EU has had to make concessions to the United States and the Latin American countries. I hope therefore that these agreements will be adopted, because I believe they form an essential basis for making the instruments linked to the delicate balance of the banana market work and can guarantee clear practices that will benefit other interests also, such as consumer protection, which is linked to transparency in the agri-food chain. These will in turn bring improvements to the banana market and to our European producers, which are impossible without a sound basis such as that provided by finalising these disputes within the WTO, to which the European Union belongs.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the amending budget we are discussing today and will be voting on in the coming days is an important document. It marks the last step for implementation of the European financial stabilisation mechanism, which was sorely needed in May to calm the severe storm that hit the euro and, therefore, the EU. One certainty came out of that storm: there are no individual Member State problems any more, because the individual problems inevitably become the problems of them all, and so a common response is required. Europe has found the courage and the strength to provide this common response that we are, in fact, discussing here today. This new budget line marks a clear boundary. It is the first step towards a new common approach to the financial policies and also, in the future, to the economic policies of Member States with regard to the European budget. It is the first step towards that integrated semester in which the budget decisions of the individual Member States and the EU budget will be compared more closely. The budget is therefore once again an instrument – which has always been the fundamental implementation of EU policies – that is taking centre stage and proving to be a fundamental vehicle for building Europe after the Treaty of Lisbon as well. Above all, it draws our attention to the importance of sound and responsible management of public resources as a prerequisite for real development and for a future of real European growth.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union and Turkey have strong trade links. The customs union has made it possible for the volume of trade between the European Union and Turkey to reach the significant figure of EUR 100 billion per year. Above all, the geopolitical position of Turkey makes it an important link between the Mediterranean area, the Middle East, Asia, and the Caucasus and Black Sea regions. Turkey is also a country which is at odds with Europe in that it has completely different demographic dynamics, is a young country, and one which first tackled the crisis and the challenging reforms which these dynamics required. So it is a complementary country because it is different to the European Union from many points of view and therefore there is a great degree of reciprocal potential: it is this that we must concentrate on. We must be careful not to waste this potential, but turn it into fruitful investments. It is true that the European Union is an important trading partner, but Turkey is looking ever more to Russia, Africa and the Middle East. Also, the customs union still does not apply to public procurement or services and there are still major obstacles to international trade. We must therefore work to remove the obstacles to this potential – and I believe the report that we are discussing today, and upon which we will vote in the next few days, is moving in this direction – because there are areas in which we must really make this potential grow: energy, the environment, services networks and infrastructure. This report therefore represents an important step and I think the work of Mr Kazak should be supported and I would like to thank him for it. Francesca Balzani,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the mandate for the trilogue is an important action, especially this year, because the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the single reading require as much clarity and as much cooperation as possible between the budgetary institutions from the outset. This budget is going ahead, developing and taking shape at a difficult time. The margins available for commitment appropriations amount to EUR 1 200 000 000 – and so are very narrow – but the matter is made even more sensitive by the fact that 70% of the appropriations come under Heading 2, the heading that covers policies for agriculture, conservation and natural resource management, and hence the fight against climate change. The budget is also difficult because of the many open procedures that will largely determine the quantities of resources that will actually be available. Such procedures include the budget review, financial regulation and the Interinstitutional Agreement, implementation of the External Action Service, but above all the meltdown and the instability of financial markets. The very meltdown that endangered the euro also demonstrated that the budget and resources are crucial to any European response, thus illustrating their importance, but also their limitations. Under these circumstances, the European Parliament must draw a line, and establish which of the priorities should have the highest profile in its main accounting document. As a group, we have chosen to tread a fine line between the need to uphold the purpose of this mandate, and the need not to debase its political meaning. Our central priority is therefore not to repeat our past mistakes, and this means we must guarantee appropriate resources for achieving the objectives of the 2020 strategy, but also keep enough resources for actions under Heading 2, particularly actions that help tackle unemployment. It is also important, however, to ensure that the fight against climate change remains central. There are therefore many challenges to be faced. We also recognised one challenge as central at the beginning of the mandate: the need to make a real effort to coordinate and restore consistency between our European budget and the budgets of individual Member States, because the consistency and coordination of the economic policies of the Union and its States are fundamental values for the future of the Union. Francesca Balzani,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the 2011 budget guidelines are the first step towards the next European budget, a very definite step. In the Committee on Budgets, we have made a great effort to establish the main identifiable priorities that highlight European action. The first priority is young people, not only because they are the resource on which to focus for innovation, research and development, but also because they are the basic starting point for farsighted social policies. However, the 2020 strategy is also a main priority: tackling unemployment, climate change and, above all, the need to genuinely and practically implement this new strategy for the future, allocating sufficient resources to it, without compromises and without cuts. However, these guidelines are also a very realistic first step. There is much less leeway in the financial perspective and this means that there are insufficient resources to carry out what is most important: new actions. This is particularly sensitive with regard to the first heading, the heading on competitiveness, growth and employment. There is, however, another important issue: the budget also needs to be highly flexible and to be able to respond quickly to citizens’ needs, to people’s needs and to changing needs. So there are priorities, but there are also essential conditions in order for the budget to really be a useful instrument to help Europe grow. These include sufficient resources, clear-cut implementation of future strategies, above all, the 2020 strategy, and lastly a definitive solution for a flexible instrument that – alone – can enable us to face future challenges. Francesca Balzani  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when we reach the end of a budgetary procedure and it is possible to assess the work carried out as a whole, I think that we need to ask a very frank, straightforward question: is this a useful budget? This budget is a transitional budget, one marking a shift towards the Europe of Lisbon, a shift within the major economic and financial crisis which has affected the entire world. This budget is therefore awkward in two respects. It needs to respond to the crisis, but reflect awareness that during a crisis, the resources available are scanty. It needs to make a positive contribution to economic recovery, but also cut, reduce and contain spending where possible. This budget will make EUR 141 billion available for next year. That is not much more than was available in 2009, but huge efforts have been made, a great deal of work has been done on the priorities and on channelling the available resources to the current priorities. The focus is on two budget lines: competitiveness and the environment. Competitiveness, because it contains social policies, employment policies and the delicate challenge represented by the Structural Funds, which still constitute the cornerstone of redistributive policies within Europe. This budget line will be allocated about EUR 65 billion for next year. The environment too, which encompasses agricultural policy, will be allocated approximately EUR 60 billion. This 2010 budget, however, relates, above all, to the economic recovery plan. This plan attracted strong support last year, but it was not fully financed in 2009. Today, thanks to significant efforts to redeploy resources, EUR 2.5 billion can at last be invested in energy infrastructure and broadband. Substantial efforts have also been made, however, to shape this budget in accordance with the Lisbon strategy, to provide even more resources than those provided by the Commission in the draft budget for the Erasmus programme, for lifelong learning, because there is a question which we must ask ourselves honestly, namely, whether this is a useful budget, but, first and foremost we have a fundamental yardstick: the usefulness of the budget must be tailored to Europe’s citizens. It must be a useful budget for every constituent citizen of Europe, and it is on the basis of this usefulness, tailored to the people, that I believe we must initiate and continue a sensitive debate on the review of the margins of availability and the resources that we wish to give to Europe for its policies. Francesca Balzani,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is precisely on the budget that Parliament can and should bring to bear all of its power as an institution directly elected by the citizens, in order to ensure that this vital instrument for growth, and also for fairness and justice, is fully able to meet citizens’ needs. The budget must have the ability to be tangible and dynamic, to listen and to respond. We have worked towards making the 2010 draft budget as flexible as possible at this time of particular economic and financial crisis. However, the budget must also be credible, feasible and tangible, and in this regard, it was fundamental to avoid making financial resources for the coming years too inflexible by restricting excessive spending beyond the maximum expenditure ceiling contained in the perspectives of the multiannual financial framework just to cases that really are an absolute priority. This is the case with the Recovery Plan. Again with the same aim, namely establishing a budget truly able to meet citizens’ needs, we have formulated specific amendments regarding payments in order to free up the maximum amount of resources possible with immediate effect. The European budget is structured on two tracks: commitments and payments. The commitments represent serious political intentions, but also real, concrete actions. Therefore, payments have been increased to EUR 127 billion in line with the draft budget tabled by the Committee on Budgets, compared with EUR 120 billion proposed by the Council and EUR 122 billion proposed by the Commission. Still with the same aim, with the same political approach, as a group we are strongly opposed to the creation of reserves, which are not genuine resources immediately available to citizens. The policy of establishing reserves at times of crisis should be reduced to the absolute minimum, to cases in which a reserve really is technically indispensable. In times of crisis, there is no point merely writing figures in the budget, but instead we should build a useful budget, immediately ready for action. Other matters also deserve special attention. As a group, we have taken the important responsibility of re-tabling the amendment to increase the milk fund to EUR 600 million, as decided by a unanimous vote of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and therefore with the participation of all the Members and groups, and also re-tabling an amendment for a microcredit project amounting to EUR 37 million which, and this is extremely important, does not jeopardise the implementation of other programmes under heading 2. There is a particular risk at times of crisis: that budget resources will not actually be increased, but transferred from one budget line to another. It is to counter this risk that Parliament, as a directly elected institution, with a role different to that of the Council and the Commission, must be especially careful in its actions, not least with regard to scrutiny.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as a member of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament who, even in the last few days, has watched with great sadness as one fire after another has devastated vast areas around the city of Genoa, in the Liguria region of Italy, I feel there is a truly urgent need for Europe to pay attention and to intervene in order to prevent these sadly recurring disasters. There should be no recurring disasters. We should work every day to ensure that there are no more cyclical disasters. This is why I believe that Europe alone can and must intervene effectively with binding acts to preserve these precious areas which, each year, are in danger of going up in smoke and which really are the heritage of us all, because it is true that fires are breaking out more and more frequently in southern Europe, and even when it is only a tiny part of this southern Europe that is burning, in reality, it is the whole of Europe that is going up in flames. We need to intervene with prevention policies and with suitable forestry policies – and by prevention I also mean intervening by means of a precise, thorough and targeted campaign against all forms of speculation directly or indirectly linked to these disasters – but I think that we also need to ensure broader, easier and quicker access to essential resources in order, at least, to mitigate the devastating effects of these disasters. I am referring first and foremost to the Solidarity Fund, an instrument that should undoubtedly be employed more quickly for the areas affected. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the single market is a major achievement and is now, more than ever, a key element in realising the ambitious objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. Twenty years of the single market is a long time, but there is still a lot to do. So it is fundamentally important that this celebration is used as an opportunity to relaunch the single market, and it is also important for us to look ahead and see what we still lack. For example, a common energy policy is now essential if all of Europe’s citizens are to be guaranteed secure and clean energy supplies at more accessible prices. Removing obstacles and relaunching the single market will prove decisive in Europe’s current economic and social crisis, because they will contribute to innovation, growth, development, the promotion of competitiveness and above all to job creation.

 Mr President, energy efficiency is one of the pillars of EU climate policy. That is why today’s vote is particularly important. It is the result of a satisfactory and timely agreement in terms of the content, in that it obliges the Member States to prepare a strategy based on indicative national targets that take account of EU objectives and, at the same time, enables energy companies to comply with energy saving requirements in accordance with the principle of reasonable flexibility. The goal of a 20% increase in energy efficiency by 2020 is therefore within reach. I believe that credit is due, above all, to this House, because if the most disruptive Member States within the Council have at last accepted this good compromise, that is due to the tenacity with which Parliament’s negotiators, starting with the rapporteur, safeguarded these goals. This is an important step for the creation of green jobs and, ultimately, to boost competitiveness and sustainability. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of this report because only a simpler and more coherent approach can effectively support vine growers in the future. According to the Commission’s proposal, Member States have to decide once and for all by December 2012 whether to transfer funds from the wine envelope to the single payment scheme (SPS). The draft report instead aims to avoid Member States planning five-year programmes at this stage, before they know the outcome of the common agricultural policy (CAP) reform. The proposal suggests converting the existing five-year measure into a one-year measure. We need to provide adequate support to vine growers and we must do so in the clearest way possible, while still ensuring a certain amount of predictability as regards funds assigned to farmers. Clarity and timely action are the key words in our policy to support vine growers, for a Europe which is a friend to the land. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, attracting investment in Europe requires concrete measures and courageous reforms. We need to ensure free and fair competition between enterprises. In a globalised and crisis-hit economy as we have at present the main thing we need to do is make businesses more competitive and increase their capacity for growth and job creation; jobs are the most important thing of all. Europe must once again become an attractive place in which to invest and work. The current crisis is a global one, and Europe must play its part to make business stronger, more competitive and above all more attractive. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, now that the European Union’s first two macro-regional strategies in the Baltic and Danube regions have materialised, there has been growing interest in this aspect of development. A macro-regional strategy ensures better cooperation among the EU’s various intervention mechanisms, going beyond the appropriations allocated to cohesion policy. I believe that the regions of the Mediterranean basin that share the same natural environment and the same history and culture have every interest in cooperating in this way. Significant opportunities exist in southern Europe, which can best be seized with the coordination and overview permitted by the definition of a macro-regional strategy. I am referring to the proposal for an Adriatic-Ionian macro-region in particular. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the committees have already stressed their opposition to this agreement. Tomorrow, it is up to Parliament to confirm this vote and put an end to this controversial dossier. The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) is a treaty that seeks to introduce a new framework for the protection of intellectual property rights, but does so without distinction, without distinguishing between commercial use for financial gain and consumer use by individual users not seeking profit. I think we need to fight the fake goods market, to combat counterfeiting, but without undermining the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In a nutshell, I believe that commercial interests must not allow us to eliminate civil liberties. For this reason, ACTA is the wrong way to go about this, which is why tomorrow’s vote is very important. Tomorrow, therefore, we need to say no to ACTA to ensure the transparency and protection of citizens’ rights. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, after seven years of income support for workers, the Indian owners of the Videocon plant in the city of Anagni have filed for bankruptcy and initiated procedures to dismiss 1 300 employees. A major company, the second largest in the region of Lazio, is closing down, and with it, related firms. This company was acquired with the intention to force it into bankruptcy and to shift production to third countries. Therefore, the institutions must now work to provide a future for Videocon and its workers who are going through a time of crisis, and who, for seven long years, have been living in a state of total job uncertainty. Italy and Europe must step in and deploy all the instruments necessary to provide work and a productive future for this important plant. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of this report because only a harmonised and coherent approach by Member States will allow for effective promotion of Europe’s energy objectives externally. If we want to achieve the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy and of the road map for a low carbon economy by 2050, we need to improve our cooperation in terms of energy policy today. From this point of view, both increased diversification of EU supply sources and the development of renewable energy sources will be essential. In this context, effective coordination with industry is crucial in order to encourage in concrete terms the investments able to favour economic growth and development and, at the same time, those able to ensure clean and safe energy. The challenge is open and Europe must play the game for sustainable competitiveness in the energy market. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

Mr President, I voted for this report since I believe that the time has come to build a more balanced partnership with China, based on reciprocity, fair competition, friendship and trust. The Chinese economy has grown significantly over the last 30 years. It has benefited from trade and is set to become the strongest global economy towards the middle of this century. We therefore need to open a new stage in EU-China trade relations based on transparent rules, an equal partnership and common development. Hence, we must encourage China to further open up its market to European companies and allow them to invest under the same conditions as those governing Chinese investments in Europe. A new partnership, then, so that China will no longer be viewed with concern by our businesses, but as an important opportunity for development and growth for our economy and, above all, for work and employment.

 Mr President, this document concentrates on the importance of regional airports as potential vehicles of territorial, economic and social cohesion. These infrastructures can, and must, perform this role, especially for citizens living outside major urban areas. The rule whereby the threshold for an airport to receive State aid was decreased to 200 000 passengers per year is good. Regional aviation can ensure that free movement in Europe is a reality not just for people living in major capital cities, but also for European citizens living outside of these areas, ensuring that these cities and regions enjoy not only the benefits brought about by greater mobility, but also by generating tourism.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on Europe Day, this regulation is a good example. The harmonisation of roaming charges is fundamental for the process of completing the internal market of the European Union. There is always much talk of a single market and the removal of tariff barriers, and yet barriers between European countries in the telecommunications sector as regards roaming charges seemed insuperable. Now this is no longer the case, and it will no longer be the case up to and beyond July 2014. Tariff reductions are finally real and tangible, and this is good news for citizens throughout Europe. The agreement binds all operators in the 27 Member States, without exception, to reducing roaming charges for telephone calls, messages and Internet connections, starting no later than 1 July next. This is an important and significant saving, at a time of crisis and grave economic difficulty for so many families. What is more, I am pleased with the measure that will enable users who are abroad to opt for the services of the most convenient operator as from 2014. No more chains, therefore. However, all this is not enough; it is only a first step. The real objective is ‘zero’ roaming; the real objective is the total abolition of roaming charges. Building a fair and competitive market also depends on Europe’s capacity to safeguard the needs and rights of its citizens. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the creation of a risk-sharing instrument must provide tangible assistance for the Member States worst-hit by the economic and financial crisis. The European Union must do more and support the Member States facing major difficulties in enacting projects such as infrastructural works. Consequently, we must ensure the continued implementation of the programmes cofinanced by the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund. This has to be done because these are key projects – especially those capable of generating net revenues, such as the construction of motorways – which can contribute to the economic and productive recovery of the affected countries.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, passing this measure will necessarily help to increase the level of investment and thus secure the European Union’s industrial future. We need to give industry the stimuli it needs to encourage investment capable of favouring economic growth and reducing CO2
 emissions at the same time. A low-carbon economy must not therefore in any way reduce the competitiveness of the European Union; quite the reverse, it must increase it. Finally, it is important to maintain the investment needed to encourage the development of renewable energy sources in order to guarantee savings and clean energy. On this issue Europe must speed up if it does not want to remain behind. Deeds and not words are what is needed for the ambition of having a genuine green economy capable of driving growth and sustainable development. Thank you. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, these guidelines for employment policies will be a great help in achieving the target of increasing participation in the labour market and reducing youth unemployment. Today, the future of young people is increasingly uncertain and insecure. There is no point in concealing the fact that sustained economic growth is crucial for the future of Europe. The youth unemployment figures are dramatic and unacceptable. The European Union must be committed to a medium- to long-term strategy for better, full and good-quality employment, especially for young people and their mobility, but also in terms of gender quality. At the same time, there must be parallel efforts to improve education and training systems at all levels. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important programme and an ambitious plan – to turn Europe into the world leader in terms of broadband speed, mobility, coverage and capacity. As has already been said, we need to aim to offer broadband for all. Europe is behind. The United States and China have already liberalised most of their radio spectrum. Therefore the agreement to open up the 800 MHz frequency band for wireless broadband Internet services by the end of the year, and to speed up mobile broadband to at least 30 Mbps is to be welcomed. These are important objectives. I believe that a European digital agenda could be a source of development, growth and unemployment. We have to act decisively in order to reclaim our leading role in the global knowledge economy. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 I voted for the report on collective redress because I believe that completion of the European single market also, and above all, involves harmonisation of consumer protection measures. However, it is crucial that Europe should not repeat the errors already committed in the US, where the practice of class action has become a primary source of profit mainly for a handful of powerful legal firms, only in very rare cases acting as an effective consumer protection tool. In this field, the European Union can do better than the US, first of all by encouraging the parties to reach alternative agreements not requiring formal recourse to legal means, thus simplifying and speeding up the process; and subsequently, by establishing a legislative framework that does not leave room for abuse, hence, with specific timeframes for proceedings, and rights to protection in line with European legal traditions. Only in this way will it be possible to prevent a useful tool for protecting citizens becoming a means of unfair competition between private entities. The report on which we voted today is a move in this direction, and is therefore a good starting point to build on in the future. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, open, free and fair trade is essential for ensuring and maintaining a level playing field for European businesses. Nonetheless, both companies and trade analysts, as well as the European Commission, have identified non-tariff barriers as the main hindrance to free access to partner countries’ markets. Since trade restrictions of this kind are highly technical in nature, they are perhaps being misused and it is extremely difficult to remove them. That is why a good starting point for overcoming these obstacles may be to work closely with the WTO and other trade organisations. The European Union needs to address this issue vigorously by seeking to remove barriers so as to complete the single market and by prioritising this issue in the new trade policy within the Europe 2020 strategy. Businesses need this, and so does development. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis is no longer simply a threat; it is a reality that is, in fact, capable of changing the social and political order, and which accordingly requires a powerful, ambitious response. While the success of the Europe 2020 strategy depends on the commitment made by the EU as a whole, the Member States must consider economic and budgetary policies as a matter of common interest. Some countries may be able to make faster progress on their own, but together we can all go further. We therefore need to become more coordinated when adopting and implementing budgetary measures and measures to combat tax fraud and tax evasion effectively. In this context, promoting international commercial links and enhancing the internal market are elements that are crucial to increased competitiveness and economic growth. However, the Europe 2020 strategy needs to have a broader regional and social dimension. Only by directly involving local bodies in the planning and implementation of programmes will it be possible to ensure greater awareness of the objectives to be achieved.

Mr President, the economic crisis that has affected labour markets since 2008 has caused the loss of 5.6 million jobs. That is why we need to reinforce human capital by updating skills and linking education and training more closely with work, just as we need to focus on small and medium-sized enterprises and on young people joining the world of work. There is, however, one point that baffles me, on which my group tabled two amendments that were rejected by this House. For this reason, my concerns remain and I did not support the report. This point in question relates to the way the single contract was presented by the Commission. The contract does not offer adequate legal guarantees or rights on working conditions, social security and the protection of workers under all types of contract. I maintain that the issue of the right to work and the right to social security is a very important point. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the experience of recent years tells us that we need a more robust economic governance framework, just as we need to broaden and strengthen the surveillance framework, making it credible and effective, and to introduce penalties, which will be an effective deterrent only if they are applied in practice. Ultimately I believe that Europe cannot solve the economic and financial crisis with austerity plans alone. The books need to be balanced, but it takes more than all that. We can do more and better, especially where fairness, development and employment are concerned, and that is why I felt I had to abstain on the Haglund report. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is important for the Stability and Growth Pact and the complete economic governance framework to support and be compatible with EU strategies for growth and jobs, with the aim of increasing competitiveness and social stability. We therefore need to introduce penalties for punishing fraud, pay the fines into a central fund for the permanent crisis mechanism and regulate the financial markets more. Ultimately I believe that the austerity measures being discussed today are in danger of weakening social justice policies. This is not the case with the Ferreira report, which I endorsed and which includes some valuable points in relation to social balance. It is the rest of the package that is wrong, because it focuses solely and exclusively on rigour and austerity and fails to promote growth. Europe will have a future only if we are able to marry fiscal discipline with the objectives of development, growth and employment. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report is an important step in the right direction. Research and innovation are both vital for development and economic growth. It is therefore urgent to propose a common framework for reorganising the existing schemes and programmes. Although Europe is the richest macro-region in the world, it has not actually invested properly in research, development and innovation. Suffice it to say that investment in these areas has been appreciably higher in the United States and Japan. We therefore have to act quickly to remove the inequalities that remain between the various countries of Europe. That will be the only possible way to prevent the scientifically or technologically more advanced countries from continuing to benefit more from existing European programmes. I therefore reiterate the need to reorganise the existing schemes and programmes and provide for new schemes with a view to producing a sustainable and inclusive growth strategy, while bearing in mind the objectives of stability, economic convergence and employment. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the key to establishing a sophisticated approach to the issue, one that does not relate exclusively to internal production factors, is to link trade policies to development policies: in other words, human rights clauses, labour standards and corporate social responsibility must become part of every agreement. Europe’s trump card in this respect are innovation policies aimed at guaranteeing supplies through a wide range of measures, the identification and extraction of raw materials in Europe, investment in new technologies for recycling and reusing materials, and compliance with fair and responsible agreements with non-EU suppliers. The framework programme is, moreover, one of the tools for reviving innovation policies, which are an important, indeed crucial element with regard to development and also with regard to work and employment.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the Sommer report because I firmly believe that Europeans should be able to make a free and informed choice about what they eat. In adopting this report, Parliament is giving the green light to clearer rules on food labelling. These rules concern not only the energy content and the percentage of fat present in the labelled food, but also the obligation to indicate the origin of the meat used. These are common-sense rules that have the merit of allowing citizens the freedom of choice, so that they can follow a healthy, balanced diet and know what they are eating. This regulation is a vehicle for citizens to be able to voice their specific requirements with regard to their choice of foodstuffs. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

Mr President, I voted in favour of this report because I take the view that the Member States should be equipped with a solid legal basis for deciding on the future of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), and especially because it needs to be acknowledged that the agricultural and environmental impact – as well as the socio-economic impact – can justify bans and restrictions. Indeed, I should like to point out that more than 60% of European citizens are against the development and cultivation of GMOs and that, as it stands, there is still no bedrock of scientific advice capable of dispelling all doubt about their impact on territories, cultures and consumers. Our legislative action must therefore once again be guided by the precautionary principle, because until we are certain that GMOs are not harmful for crops or consumers, we have the duty to protect European citizens from their potential damaging effects.

Mr President, this is a good report and one that is very important for the balanced, harmonious and sustainable development of our communities. Genuine solidarity between Member States allows our regions to be more attractive, more innovative and more competitive. Simplifying access to assistance, more effective controls and quality spending are the objectives for a better functioning of this instrument. We need greater investment in research, knowledge and innovation to boost growth, the development of small and medium-sized enterprises and employment. I have one final comment: creating a new intermediate category must not result in existing categories being deprived of resources, but must introduce and aim solely and exclusively at the deployment of additional resources.

Mr President, I voted in favour of the report by Mr Sosa Wagner because it effectively highlights the strengths and weaknesses in the European Commission’s approach to revitalising energy infrastructures: the need to identify the infrastructures required, the criteria for selecting projects of European interest in view of financing that will attract and boost private investment, the urgent need to deal with the dangers in Eastern Europe of relying on a single source which, as we have seen in recent years, can cause serious supply problems, and lastly the opportunity to invest part of the EUR 1 000 billion over 10 years provided for by the Commission for the reduction of pollution, combating climate change and improving supply quality for clean and safe energy.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Fukushima disaster has reopened the issue of nuclear safety. The problem of radioactive waste needs to be addressed and solved. To be brief, there are two issues that I consider top priority. The first is the ban on the transfer of waste. Every country must be able to discharge its own obligations and, above all, the ‘polluter pays’ principle is a fair one. The second issue concerns safety, and the health and safety of workers in particular. This is a point that I consider extremely important, and we have to give people peace of mind. We have to give the people of Europe peace of mind by ensuring that this subject is managed with the utmost transparency and above all, I stress, the utmost safety. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, the report on the mid-term review of the Seventh Framework Programme is especially significant. There are four reasons – which I consider to be paramount – why I voted in favour of the report: 1) the simplification and streamlining of procedures in order to make it easier to access funding; 2) the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are essential for growth and employment; 3) innovation for a competitive manufacturing sector capable of meeting the challenges of the market; and 4) the risk finance facility, which so far has produced very good results. Lastly, I should like to point out that the triangle of knowledge, education and research – on which the future of the cohesion policy rests – can only be consolidated in Europe through a steadfast commitment to research. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

Mr President, the report by Mr Garriga Polledo is a very important piece of work that allows us to set out a new financial framework for a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe. We need a budget that is designed for the challenges of the present day and that can provide a strong and innovative response to current needs. Its top priority must be research and innovation for small and medium-sized enterprises, to stimulate growth and employment, while the second objective is to reform the common agricultural policy in order to promote and support the competitiveness of agriculture in Europe. However, particular attention should be paid to the future of the cohesion policy, which I consider to be a very important instrument and one which provides financial support for investments that drive economic growth and, above all, the creation of new jobs. On this subject, I would like to revisit a point that I think is particularly important: the establishment of a new intermediate category. I believe, of course, that this new category cannot be created by siphoning off resources from existing ones, which are essential for supporting the balanced, harmonious and sustainable growth of our communities.

Mr President, I voted in favour of the report on the labelling of textile products because I think that Europe could and should do more to support enterprises in the industry. The proposal made by the Commission was purely technical and aimed to simplify the current provisions regarding labelling. Yet Parliament achieved two significant results. Firstly, textile products comprising non-textile parts of animal origin – fur and leather – must show this information on the labels in order to allow consumers to make informed choices. Secondly, by 2013, the European Commission must present an impact study on the introduction of labelling, clearly showing which garments have been produced in Europe, and which outside of Europe. The latter objective is an important milestone for the competitiveness of European textiles in Europe and the world. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mrs Merkies on her excellent work. I believe we have to invest more in innovation, research and knowledge, and we have to do so more boldly. Innovation must not be swallowed up by research. Innovation and research are not the same thing, and I welcome the fact that the report points out this strategic distinction. The report sets some important objectives: it targets ordinary people and workers through social innovation; it introduces measures to facilitate access to credit and finance for small and medium-sized enterprises; and, above all, it establishes an increasingly close and direct relationship linking together businesses, research centres and our universities. Facilitating and simplifying life for small and medium-sized enterprises through a one-stop shop and focusing on talent, creativity and innovative ideas are essential conditions for growth and development. Europe must take innovation policies seriously if we want to find a way out of the crisis and build a better future for our younger generations. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, after the tragedy of Fukushima, we all need to stop and think. Nuclear power is once more in the spotlight, and I believe we need to think above all of the future, of our children’s future. It is true that we need energy, but we need clean energy and safe energy. Safety is all well and good, but it is not enough. A moratorium is not enough; we need to go further than that. The tragedy of Fukushima tells us that there is no such thing as zero-risk nuclear power stations. Above all, it tells us that we need to organise a rapid exit from nuclear power and to focus our attention on renewable, alternative power sources. Europe needs a new energy policy in order to halt the construction of new nuclear power stations because of the terrible impact these power stations could have on safety, the environment, the climate and future generations. A radical change of perspective is necessary, for a safe future based on saving energy and the use of renewable sources. Francesco De Angelis,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if we are to restore confidence to the market, we need to prioritise the needs of consumers, workers and businesses. If we want to strengthen the rights of citizens, workers and users of public services, significant attention should be paid to guaranteeing the social dimension of the future Single Market. Growth, development and social awareness must go hand in hand. There must be economic growth at the service of citizens. From this point of view, the package of regulations regarding standards for companies contains some good proposals, including the action plan to increase access on the part of small and medium-sized enterprises to capital markets and new lines of financing for innovative firms and regional development. Small and medium-sized businesses are the heart of our economy and the growth engine of the internal market. Mr President, it is up to us to ensure these goals if we are to get out of the crisis and promote a new model of development, sustainable growth and new quality jobs. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Balzani, for the excellent work she has accomplished. Getting to the heart of the matter, there are four points in this own-initiative report that I think are crucial. The first, in general terms, is the explicit reference to the European Union budget and its redistributive nature, which are the cornerstones of European solidarity. The second, in specific terms, reaffirms the principle that outstanding commitments – which are particularly high in the cohesion sector – ought to be carried out and not, as the Council suggests, simply cut out. The third sets out some doubts – entirely reasonably in my view – as to the effectiveness of an estimate criterion based on performance in the previous year. The fourth urges the Commission to formulate proposals for the creation of new resources and, in particular, new resources must be designed to combat the persistent effects of the crisis with a robust and effective commitment to policies for innovation, research and growth in economic, productive and employment terms across Europe.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that the fragmentation of the rules on consumer rights creates a very significant obstacle to cross-border purchases and sales and is also a problem for the effective creation of a real internal market.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, news of the earthquake swarm that has been affecting the Far East and Japan in particular since 11 March has left us all astonished by the scale of the human tragedy that is unfolding. For these reasons, I think this resolution represents a necessary first step to guarantee the people of Japan all the humanitarian, technical and financial support they will need in the coming months and years. I believe that the incident at the Fukushima plant should force us all to reflect carefully, scrupulously and calmly on the risks of nuclear power. Europe must invest and must also direct the Member States to concentrate more closely and more effectively on alternative energy sources. Our thoughts go out to Japan today and our commitment for the future must be to avoid similar situations being repeated in Europe and elsewhere in the world. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs Schaldemose for her report which, above all, must be praised for proposing concrete measures to strengthen the surveillance systems for movement within the common European market of products that are safe for European consumers. It is an own-initiative report but it has the merit of going in the right direction to complete the single market and the protection of European consumers. Ensuring safety means providing traceability systems that are reliable throughout the products’ life cycle. In this respect, the report puts forward effective proposals: the creation of an information database on product safety; the strengthening of the Community Rapid Information System (RAPEX) regarding unsafe products from third countries; and greater resources to allow the surveillance authorities to withdraw products with serious risks from the market. I will conclude by emphasising that it is our job to ensure that the products circulating on the European market are safe for the most vulnerable consumers, especially children, the elderly and the disabled.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Nedelcheva, for her contribution. Talking about equality between men and women in the world of work today is not, and must not be, merely an exercise in rhetoric. On the contrary, female employment is a strategic issue for Europe, in both cultural and economic terms. As is evident from the available data, if the employment rates for women were similar to those of men, gross domestic product would increase by 30%. The current crisis must not, therefore, force us to take backward steps but, on the contrary, must make us move forward towards active policies on female employment. We therefore need targeted employment policies that allow the impact of the crisis on women to be assessed and counter-cyclical solutions to be considered. The report has the merit, moreover, of focusing on positive policies to promote the employment of women, the issue of vocational training and female entrepreneurship. I will conclude by saying that there is another phenomenon to face: the serious problem of violence against women. Europe now needs to have a comprehensive directive on preventing and combating all forms of violence against women. Francesco De Angelis,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, industrial policy is a key element for growth and employment in our regions and countries. At a time of severe economic crisis, therefore, we welcome the Commission’s initiative to provide Europe with a common medium- to long-term approach, and we fully support Mr Lange’s outstanding report for at least three reasons. The first is that the report takes an approach to the subject of industrial development that does not break down industrial and business interests into market sectors, but puts them together according to common objectives. The second reason is that it underlines the importance of regional structures through more effective support for clusters, innovation networks, knowledge transfer, research, and the improvement of skills and infrastructure development. The third reason – and I am finishing – is that it highlights the role and function of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are looking to Europe to find a way out of this crisis, which is liable to seriously jeopardise their future. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, more than 100 million workers depend directly or indirectly on small and medium-sized enterprises today in Europe. Yet small and medium-sized enterprises are experiencing an unprecedented crisis: lack of liquidity, bureaucratic obstacles and constraints and administrative barriers. Herein lies the crux of this motion for a resolution: Parliament is calling for credit and loan guarantee programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises and a vigorous European drive that is more than just a pipe dream to combat the new – and for many prohibitive – business-banking requirements, particularly with regard to higher collateral guarantees and risk premiums. Lastly, I agree with the need to significantly increase funding within the framework of the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme, and to revive the issue of simplification with strength and determination: streamline and simplify, so that firms wishing to access funds are able do so without having to resort to very expensive outside consultants. These are the reasons why I voted for this resolution: the SMEs and the 100 million European workers employed in the sector expect it of us. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Bendtsen’s report is positive for at least four reasons: – it reaffirms that energy efficiency is the most effective and fastest way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and that a firm commitment to provide resources and investment in this area will result in economic growth and job creation for small and medium-sized enterprises; – it makes valid proposals concerning workable financial instruments and calls on the Commission to firmly focus on professional training, access to information for small and medium-sized enterprises, and the refurbishment of existing buildings; – it sets specific objectives and confirms Energy Performance Contracting as an instrument for purchasing guaranteed energy savings and a launch pad for creating jobs and reducing European citizens’ bills; – lastly, the report will be all the more useful if binding emissions targets can be set without any ifs or buts. We must make the 20% target an achievable one; we cannot let this opportunity pass us by, since it would send out an encouraging signal to Europe. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my appreciation for this resolution, which is an excellent piece of work in four respects. Firstly, it reasserts that energy efficiency and energy saving are economically advantageous priorities to reduce Europe’s energy dependence and combat climate change. Secondly, it emphasises intelligent infrastructure. Thirdly, it urges us to fully implement current European legislation. Fourthly, it strives to bring about an energy policy with a robust and consistent international dimension. Finally, I should like to underline the importance of energy security and investment in research, development and innovation to protect the interests of consumers, businesses and citizens as well as possible. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Van Brempt, for her excellent work and for an agreement that will at last make it possible to free up significant resources for the development of renewable energies and energy efficiency in the context of the challenge for green growth. The programme includes priorities that the Member States should take into account, particularly in achieving the objective of competitive modernisation of our energy infrastructures. Lastly, I wish to emphasise what I considered to be the qualifying points of the criteria for access by public authorities to finance, in particular, the commitment to work on multiannual strategies through a system of multi-level governance from territories to local authorities up to regional institutions and the institutions of the European Union, even in the context of rationalising the available financial instruments. This is an important result for the public and for small and medium-sized enterprises. Francesco De Angelis,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs Weiler for the excellent work she has done. With this provision, Europe is putting an end to a procedure that has brought a great many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to their knees. Parliament is taking action to protect SMEs – the most vulnerable businesses and the ones most exposed to the effects of the crisis – from problems of liquidity and access to credit. The current practice of delaying payments is pushing a great many small businesses towards bankruptcy, with adverse effects on employment. That is why the provision is important: it sets the maximum payment period at 60 days, increases interest on late payments to 8% and outlaws the use of contractual terms that are unfair to the creditor. In other words, it lays down definite time periods, incentives and, most of all, no exceptions. These are measures designed to protect SMEs, stimulate our economic and productive fabric, and boost employment. It is now the turn of the Member States to take swift and effective steps to implement this directive, which confirms that Europe exists, is useful and can make itself felt.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the launch of the European Union 2020 strategy effectively marks the end of the previous Lisbon Strategy phase and it will have to tackle the negative structural effects that the financial, economic and social crisis has produced and is continuing to produce. I believe that if the 2020 strategy is to be effective, it must focus on two key aspects, the first being a system for evaluating progress which factors in the use of the carrot and stick mechanism; the second being a vigorous policy of investing in infrastructure, in addition, of course, to tools for regulating the financial system and policies aimed at restoring social dialogue and cohesion. Infrastructures are the cornerstone of the relaunch of innovation policy in industry, SMEs, manufacturing consortiums or research institutes and in the relationship between these and universities and local institutions. The van Nistelrooij report should therefore be warmly welcomed since, in addition to providing an in-depth picture of the work that has been done to date in the Member States, it starts to deal with the question of criteria for harmonisation of financial instruments and operational plans aimed at innovation. The harmonisation of rules, procedures and administrative practices for the management of EU projects and the simplification and streamlining of procedures are the solutions that the stakeholders on the ground and citizens have been asking us for for a long time. I believe that on this point, Europe can and must do much to promote growth, development and employment. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the five rapporteurs who have worked so hard on these matters, and since I can only deal with one of these questions, for the second I will wear something on my head in order to demonstrate my conviction that no fish, under EU law, can be landed without fins, and so I do not understand why sharks may be landed in this manner. Thus, in honour of sharks I am wearing a fin for the remainder of my speech. I want to support the position taken by Ms Lövin and oppose the Group of the European People’s Party’s alternative motion for a resolution. I think that this alternative motion for a resolution tabled by the PPE Group, signed by the Chair, poses a very serious problem because it deletes an important part of this report involving the conclusion of fisheries agreements in the Mediterranean. Without fisheries agreements with other countries, our Mediterranean is condemned to certain death. Removing the possibility of conducting a fisheries foreign policy in the Mediterranean means killing the sea. I would therefore ask the Chair to withdraw this motion before tomorrow, and call on all Mediterranean MEPs to vote against it if the motion is not withdrawn. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is the fourth time I have had to give an explanation of vote – which does not happen very often – under these conditions. The report by Mr Alfonsi that we have adopted today is of particular importance, especially for the Adriatic region in our country. The macro-regional strategy has a considerable impact both on European planning and on its implementing acts. I believe regional strategies will be extremely important for the implementation of these rules, not least for the sector that I personally am involved with – fisheries – during the revision of our fisheries policies. Unfortunately, this sector is not given due coverage in this report, although that does not make it any less important. Besides, the constraints of the Mediterranean are well known; these constraints in both the management and the implementation of certain policies often jeopardise Europe’s comprehensive strategies. I do not think I can say anything else in all this uproar. Guido Milana,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank Mr Stevenson for his excellent work and the structure he gave to his report, which addresses the two main issues. This is not a simple management plan for herring, but is about guaranteeing fishermen a future to some extent, and a plan of action that ensures the sea is protected for years to come. But the key point in this report is – and remains – the question of delegated acts. I believe that the Council should accept the line taken by the Treaty of Lisbon and I think that the time has come for Parliament to have the courage to take a very clear and strong position on the matter of delegated acts, with perhaps a more authoritative voice than would come from the debate in the Committee on Fisheries or a discussion on a report concerning herring. We assert the right to deal with these matters under the ordinary legislative procedure. I know perfectly well that this issue concerns not only many other kinds of fishing, which will be in a worse situation following the current reform, but also agriculture and other subjects. The right course is to respect the will of Parliament. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to avoid repeating what my colleagues have already said, I personally believe that Europe really has no strategy either for the system of controls or for the means of implementing international agreements in the Mediterranean. We must not forget that the Mediterranean comprises eight European and 22 non-European countries and that its bluefin tuna attract many fishermen from outside Europe. I therefore believe – regardless of whether Mr Romeva i Rueda’s good work could have gone further – that this debate is pointless if it does not lead to the Commission preparing a proper international relations proposal. What is really needed is to establish new relationships on this subject, and on many others concerning fishing in the Mediterranean, in an effort to create the right conditions and making resources available for those countries that apply the same European rules. It would serve the interests of the tuna, of European fishing, and of Mediterranean fishing in particular. Guido Milana,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries.

 Madam President, the Committee on Fisheries has carried out an exhaustive job, considering that this is a post-Lisbon codecision matter. In this sense, the execution rate was 97.20%, hence a good execution rate as recorded in the accounts. Despite this, however, under one of the headings, a specific heading, the heading for fish markets, number 1102, had very little execution, for which the Commission gave some quite satisfactory explanations, but these do not suggest that there will be much change in the following years. Equally, one of the issues underlined is the execution of international fishing agreements. In these, the commercial aspect is too dominant compared with the aspect linked to growth in the sector: 72% is a commercial agreement. Therefore, the fishing agreements probably need to have a slightly different execution that takes into account the policy objectives of these agreements. I will close, Madam President, with just one more small comment, which is that there are reports that have been challenged for almost a decade, the closure of which is still being delayed. This is a just a point of form with regard to the execution as a whole. Thank you in particular for the time allowed to me. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the excellent report by Mr Rinaldi has been a success in the House. I totally agree with the excellent opinion of the report. Nevertheless, I would like to raise a small issue. Compared with this new world that is trying to seek democracy and different economic conditions, our Europe is a Europe divided by the Mediterranean. It is precisely this special focus on the Mediterranean that I would like the Commission to have, as regards both environmental issues and economic trade in the Mediterranean. The Mediterranean is a fishing area. We are building a new fisheries policy in Europe in which Europe will set some very strict rules. On the other side, however, there are no rules. Therefore, why not use forms of fisheries agreements, support for these countries so that they apply the same rules that are applied in Europe? This would be healthy for European fishing, healthy for the sea and environmental conservation, and would ensure that this division becomes ever smaller but an increasingly homogenous place on which to build the future of Europe and of this new world.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank Mr Arsenis, Ms Patrão Neves and Mr Romeva i Rueda and their assistants for contributing substantially to the success of this initiative. Fish is a common good, as it provides 15% of the protein intake of more than 3 billion people, and the livelihoods of over 500 million people depend on fishing and aquaculture. This makes it a truly global common good. By approving this statement, we are indicating a clear path to the Commission on the need to encourage responsible conduct, both among the fishing community and on the part of consumers. The debate on the common fisheries policy now has one more reason to support actions to broaden the scope of European policy from a narrow vision, concentrating on fishing methods and a policy of inward-looking rules. Instead, we suggest a strategy which treats the sea as a privileged place so as to increase its function as a breeding ground, both within EU waters and through innovative fishing agreements with third countries. What is more, this is not only about protecting the environment and maintaining biodiversity, but also about responsible fisheries, economic and social sustainability, which is clearly in the interests of both fishermen and our economy. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you have done very well, Commissioner, to promote this initiative and this regulation, but I would like to return to one problem – the only thing I want to pick up on in my speech – which is the under-execution of funds. The Commission must intervene because here we are facing an example of under-execution of funds. You have moved very intelligently to accelerate this process. Mr Ferreira makes some excellent points, because there are a number of questions over this issue: I do not think that we can transform the common fisheries policy over these two years, but I think we can direct our resources appropriately, especially to the most vulnerable countries, which are in greatest need of assistance at the moment. I would add, Commissioner, that in order to make this expenditure effective, I would also suggest that the procedures for the execution phase should be simplified; that is something I would focus on. Sometimes, a closer look at the execution of spending and simplified procedures can further assist in this process. I would like to pause for just a second if I may, Mr President, on the Court of Auditors. We must be wary of considering the Court of Auditors’ report as applicable to the whole of Europe. Within the report, there are many different areas where efficiency was different. Thank you and excuse me, Mr President, for running over time. Guido Milana,

 Mr President, my remarks are intended directly for the Commissioner and the Minister. Commissioner, a year and a half ago, I urged you to act courageously as, in doing so, you would have had the support of Parliament. Now it seems to me that, instead, the idea prevails that Parliament is a sort of deadweight, a frill, in the procedures and that the Commission often prefers to take a stance that differs little if at all from the Council’s, which avoids having a genuine relationship with Parliament. Today, we are debating the reform of the common fisheries policy. Parliament is asking questions, while ministers are already mediating the Commission’s proposal. This goes beyond the application of Article 43(3). We must really reinstate the principle that the Treaty of Lisbon conferred on Parliament, and I believe that on this point, we must take a cultural leap in our relationships, rather than work in fine detail, trying to grasp whether we are on the right track by following this or that procedure. This is a different problem. I believe that we are still not aware of the role that Parliament can play when it comes to the fisheries sector. Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, we shall vote on the report that has been presented to us in a distinguished manner this morning by Ms Patrão Neves. If Parliament supports it, this resolution will immediately draw very important lines in the sand for the coming reform. I am not absolutely persuaded by the proposals regarding the socioeconomic aspect of the proposed reform. They effectively amount to driving the workforce out of the sector, not about finding alternative employment. I believe that here too we must take a culturally different direction. The list of issues you have drawn up is really short, as it does not set out a scenario for substituting fishing by some other occupation, where, say, aquaculture or tourism could have a key role. I believe that these measures have simply been relegated to a question of transferable rights, which, Commissioner, give absolutely no guarantee of a socioeconomic application for the reduction in fishing, because … (The President cut off the speaker) Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

Mr President, I am presenting an oral amendment with regard to the introduction of respect for human rights in this resolution. The text, which should be inserted after paragraph 7, is as follows: ‘calls on the Commission to introduce into the fisheries agreement with Morocco the clause on respect for human rights, as set out in the European Parliament resolution on human rights and social and environmental standards in international trade agreements’. I believe that this amendment improves the resolution and gives a timely reminder to the Commission, during the negotiation stage, to take into account the international context which often meets division in Parliament, particularly in this area. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a dreadful agreement, a dreadful extension and a dreadful performance over the years: these are the keywords in this debate! Well, we must consider this phase closed. If the Commission – or, rather, the Commissioner, who did not draw up this agreement – asks us to consent to the agreement, we must put this phase behind us and concentrate in particular on the new agreement and on what will happen in the coming years. As someone who has upheld the Sahrawi cause for many years, I am not sure if it is a good idea not to have any further relations with Morocco. We cannot replace the agreement, the lack of which would not help us resolve the conflict, which has been going on for more than 30 years. What Ms Lövin said was music to my ears. I wholeheartedly agree with her, although I do not think the fisheries agreement is the way to solve the problem. We certainly will not find a solution when the UN has had a mission in place for 30 years that has been incapable of resolving all the humanitarian issues involved. We should therefore say ‘yes’ to the resolution and ‘yes’ to extending this agreement, because the resolution should encourage the Commission and spur it on to negotiate hard, both to ensure that the new agreement truly responds to these requirements, and to ensure that it is a sign that the Union’s foreign policy must heed. Baroness Ashton cannot ignore the Sahrawi question any longer! Guido Milana,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it was wonderful to work with Mr Koumoutsakos. We worked well together, we had a good trialogue, and therefore my thanks are not merely formal but truly meant. We have become friends during this debate, and I think this friendship will probably lead us to give the Commission a hand because, Commissioner, the problem is the future. What we have achieved today has been thanks to Parliament, because if it had been down to the Council – incidentally absent today – we would not have achieved this result. A proposal of EUR 50 million was cut by the Council, and it is only thanks to the tough stand taken by myself and Mr Koumoutsakos that the Commission has been able to receive this EUR 40 million. The Commission can count on us for the future. It can count on a Parliament that believes in what it says. This Parliament is convinced to the extent that it knows perfectly well that the sea is made up of seas, coastlines and activities, and that there needs to be a common vision of these things. Coastlines cannot be the subject of urban and land planning that ends at the foreshore. The EU and Member States need to appreciate that town planning includes the sea – it does not end on the coastline. The activities themselves need to become compatible with one another. We need to initiate real planning in which tourism, fishing, mining and – why not? – the amazing wind energy that can be developed offshore can be an asset and mutually compatible, in the same way that fishing and fishing activities cannot be treated separately and considered only in terms of fishing methods and quantities. There, the focus will have to be on pollution-related issues, because dwindling fish stocks are not just the result of fishing. Commissioner, you have a major ally in Parliament. The problem will not be how to spend this EUR 40 million, but how we will all manage to have sufficient resources between 2013 and 2020 to do such important and wonderful things. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in this case, too, you have strong support from Parliament. Ms Lövin has carried out an extraordinary task, an excellent preliminary job, even though on some points and issues, she could have gone further. I have a different opinion as to whether or not it is appropriate or justified to set up a European coastguard, although I will support her position. I have a different opinion, but I will, in any case, support her position. Commissioner, there is only one real issue, and that is that the Commission needs to have a global role. We have said this in many different ways, and I think that this is the real key, to establish a real foreign policy for this activity. The relationship with the United States, China and Japan is crucial in this sense, because the essence of this activity lies within this relationship, within the construction of common rules and the resulting behaviours. Therefore the true goal is to increase awareness that fishing, in this sense, is a common asset, and a global common asset. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report was adopted with a huge majority in Parliament. I voted for it, but I would have liked to vote on something different, something bolder. In my opinion, Parliament has missed an opportunity to go further. It is quite true that the single European railway area can and must result in a much better relationship with consumers than we have had so far. Why stop, however, at a single national regulatory body and not push on towards a single European regulatory body? Why stop short of the issue of unbundling, bringing in a clear separation between ownership and service management? Yes, the budgets have been separated, but probably this time in Parliament it was not this House’s authority to make its voice heard that has prevailed, but rather the representatives of the abundant privilege and competition present today in the European railway market. We will only manage to truly change the fortunes of freight, improve people’s lives, improve the free circulation of goods when this single European space is worthwhile. Essentially, keeping well away from the train tracks is good for the health and not for economic policy; perhaps by getting too close you will get run over. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
).

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the budget sets out a few clear and important objectives within the scope of the Europe 2020 strategy; for this I should like to thank the rapporteurs, Ms Balzani and Mr Fernandes. It is essential to focus on investments and not merely on the careful management of the budget. The only alternative is to look on passively at the speculative way of thinking that dominates at present. We can no longer allow ourselves to follow individual interests and instead must finally act as a single, united structure, ready to face up to confrontation. I welcome the commitments adopted on the pilot projects and the preparatory actions in Heading 2, just as I welcome the fact that funding for the Integrated Maritime Policy is not to the detriment of other initiatives and programmes in the fisheries sector. This will allow us to implement policies for better marine resource management, through research and thoroughgoing exchange of data on fish stocks, bringing in new planning methods in the Adriatic area that can be used as best practices in other marine areas. I will conclude with a quick aside: with regard to future debates on the common fisheries policy (CFP) and in particular on the European Fisheries Fund (EFF), I hope that a greater effort will be made on fisheries control, which is at the heart of the fight against illegal fishing and is also a key issue in restoring stocks. Fish should be seen as a shared asset. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT) 
Mr President, I too welcome the vote on this report, even though a few points might well have been developed a little further. Reflecting on all the regionalisation and localisation of employment contracts cannot, however, fail to take heed of the important task of unifying workers’ rights. In other words, the greater the opportunity to develop territorial, business and sectoral autonomy to stimulate productivity and create the conditions for competitiveness, the greater the need to create the conditions for some fundamental rights to be applied on a supranational, or European, basis. That is why I am still puzzled as to whether this initiative could lead us to tackle the important issue of whether there can be a European policy on fundamental rights. Otherwise the alternative is that we will enter what I think will be a bad period in which there will be rich and poor workers, even though they are doing the same job. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Ms Koppa’s report is exceptionally current in what it really implies, and it comes at a time when the debate on Palestine is particularly important. Initiating this trade highlights the fact that we can no longer use this country just as a potential market, since until now, our exports to Palestine have been worth EUR 50 million and our imports from there only EUR 6 million. Instead, away from Israeli control, the country is preparing itself to play a role as an exporter to Europe, which we hope can truly help to change the fortunes of the Palestinian people in particular. I therefore voted wholeheartedly in favour of this report. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, many thousands of people die every year due to natural disasters and tens of billions of euro are lost. These are dramatic figures, and disasters are not always avoidable. Ms Gardini’s report is right on the mark in this respect, because it essentially identifies the two fundamental points in the new European civil protection strategy. The first is a thorough prevention plan, which can no longer be just the sum of the national prevention plans, and proper rules concerning prevention procedures. The second is the real, concrete idea of European civil protection, which cannot result from mere coordination but must be based on a genuine network. We have to move on from an emergency response requested by a country in relation to a disaster and the subsequent intervention, seen almost as a concession by another country, to a genuine strategy. With this hope in mind, I think the resolution adopted today is a useful one for the people of Europe. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is just a good initiative, but I think we will later have to develop a European policy on tourism. The European framework is a good idea, but I would like to focus on two issues. There is no sea or coastal tourism, we might say, but a coastal planning policy. I think the time has come for Europe to protect this important sector by producing an initiative in which ideas about the sea and coastline are not limited to a kind of town planning that ends at the foreshore and does not involve the sea as a whole. I think it will be useful to have an integrated policy on this, just as there will be a need to develop everything that lies behind the claims about rural tourism: rural tourism can be an excellent source of income for disadvantaged areas and areas where there is no work any more, where it is important to stop depopulation and instead encourage people to settle. For that, it is not enough just to make claims. We would need to suggest that Europe and the Member States take action on taxation. Perhaps developing tourism in rural areas could mean paying less tax; maybe that would create a real opportunity for tourism as a resource and for the people living in those areas. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have just three small points I should like to make, all centred on the fact that we need ‘more Europe’ in this area. I think it is an inescapable fact that on certain issues, we must not merely hope for more Europe, but actually set about building it. For example, more Europe means starting to really think about common traffic police and uniform safety rules. More Europe means having a European policy on training, not simply delegating it to the individual Member States, but instead putting together a proper training policy for schools, for young people and for slightly more at-risk categories, among whom motorcyclists were mentioned a moment ago, but we could talk about lorry drivers as well. More Europe means everyone having the same devices in their cars to improve safety conditions, such as alcolocks and anti-tiredness devices. This, in my view, would be a strategy well worth pursuing with businesses in the sector and European carmakers. Indeed, if all this was incorporated in a common policy, then I really think that conditions would, perhaps, improve. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt this is not purely a trade agreement. This agreement clearly contains a significant element of ‘political’ assistance. This does not involve treating Palestine and Israel in the same way; it is clear that their situations are different. The agreement with Israel is purely a trade agreement, a trade agreement that in some way supports a process leading to the constitution of a state, a process that brings improvements in the living conditions experienced by that population. Furthermore, the trade agreement with Europe has until now been mediated by Israel, and the result is one where imports form one tenth and exports nine tenths of our international trade. That means that we have seen, or rather, until now Europe has seen Palestine as a market and certainly not a place where producers should be encouraged to target the European market. It is my belief then, with compliments to Ms Koppa, that in this international context we would be doing the right thing tomorrow by using the vote in Parliament to send a strong, authoritative message that will help drive the process at the UN and the Warsaw meeting at the end of the month. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the single market, the freedom of movement and the Treaty of Lisbon are all elements which came about irrespective of changes to our method – either the European method or the national method – of lawmaking. We need to act on the commitments made in the light of these opportunities. In particular, we need to truly initiate a phase to simplify the legislative system, a simplification phase which must lead to a different kind of dialogue between Europe and the individual States. I would start precisely with our documents, and I would take this opportunity to suggest a kind of clarity test for our documents. When we draw up a white paper or a green paper, everything should be more understandable, and I would say that, in order to truly launch this virtuous phase of introducing legislation, the real, perhaps strategic proposal for our Europe, is to give particular responsibility to a European Commissioner who would have the specific task of clarifying legislation and relations between the States and Europe itself. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I support the adoption of this report because it has the effect of ensuring that the conditions applied to the Black Sea are proposed in other European areas, too. Regulating fishing in an area in which only two of the six countries bordering the basin are European is an important development. It is very similar to the situation in the Adriatic, for example, where different countries – EU, non-EU and candidate countries – with totally different rules exist side by side. The second reason is that I believe that the establishment of a European coastguard should be highlighted and viewed as a genuinely important development: it could actually be one of the first areas for discussion when planning how to protect the sea, fishermen and consumers. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT)
 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have taken the floor simply in order to lend my support to this report and to highlight two aspects in particular. The first, because it is part of the debate currently under way on the review of the common fisheries policy and on the fundamental decision relating to the regionalisation of a policy – a centralised policy – that has shown how utterly weak it is in recent years. This regionalisation phase is particularly relevant in the case of the Black Sea. I believe that the points contained in Ms Iotova’s report describe a specific situation, but one that is found in the rest of Europe, too: the situations in the Adriatic Sea, the Tyrrhenian Sea and the Aegean Sea are no different. In other words, the interaction between European fishing and non-European fishing, in particular, is often very harmful to European markets and to European consumers. The second aspect that I should like to highlight quickly is that of the call for a European coastguard. There can be no policy without controls. Controls are carried out today by different forces in Europe; I believe that the time has come to recognise that one of the main security forces in Europe, namely coastguards, can be managed jointly, can become more interdependent and, indeed, can form a single European body. In the hope that this will happen, I fully support the contents of Ms Iotova’s report. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Fukushima accident continues to produce very serious consequences, with radioactive water leaking into the sea at levels 6 500 times above legal limits. The risk of contaminated food products is high. Europe has established very strict controls but this applies only to fresh products. No rule has been issued to safeguard processed products, in particular tinned fish. We import 370 000 tonnes of tinned tuna. The principal suppliers are the countries of South-East Asia, which import fish from Japan. This means that tinned fish imported into Europe may contain Japanese fish. The provision of precise information about place of origin is crucial and urgent. Today consumers know where the tin was produced but not the place where the fish was caught. The Commission has recently acknowledged this and plans to close this gap with the reform of the common fisheries policy, but that will not enter into force until two years from now, just as the Sommer report, which is being debated in this plenary session, will not take effect until three years from now. We should not indulge in scaremongering but consumers have the right to urgent and clear information. The Commission should intervene as soon as possible. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I should like to express my overall satisfaction about the adoption of Mr El Khadraoui’s report. I believe it represents a step forward for consumer and environmental protection, including in terms of the positions of individual Member States, which sometimes complain of delays. Essentially, I think that by adopting this measure, Europe has demonstrated that it is further ahead than many Member States, which will clearly have to remedy this situation in short order. I come from a country whose government was rather tardy in expressing its interest in this directive. I therefore hope that Parliament’s decision will be productive and function as a stimulus so that the attitudes and the level of attention for this issue will be substantially improved in the not too distant future.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that this measure will mean that issues related to the Mediterranean are about to embark on an even more binding phase than has been achieved through the acts implemented to date. I believe that the act we are focusing on today is much more important than the effects of the 2006 EU regulation. I think it also offers a response to some limitations of that regulation which, because it is unilateral, has left large sections of the fishing industry with the idea that Europe is doing its bit but the other Mediterranean countries are not. I think it is strategic for us to address the issue from this aspect and with these characteristics. I believe that the work done by Mr Rivellini, which has been broadly welcomed, deserves formal thanks in this session.  However, I have the distinct feeling that the fact that we cannot resolve this issue on first reading and will move to a second reading, particularly over the interpretation of Article 28 of this regulation, raises one question: Parliament is siding with the Commission this time. Parliament is saying in essence that it is a good thing for these delegated acts to be the responsibility of the Commission and there is some resistance by the Council and, by the way, its absence today is significant. This act means that Parliament is now convinced that the operation of maintaining biodiversity, maintaining the abundance of fish in this important sea, will help secure the future of the fishers. That said, I think the next stage in the process must place the focus back on the idea of codecision. These delegated acts are delegated for a reason, and thus, today, they are the responsibility of the Commission, but the international agreements, when they come, have to be firmly the responsibility of Parliament. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think we have two problems, one relating to the method and the other to the merits of this matter. The problem with the method is that we are making use of an artifice, for which we thank Mrs Fraga, which is that of the oral question, to talk about something that should really, after the Treaty of Lisbon, be a Parliamentary right. I think this practice should end; we cannot resort to a strategy to see through an ordinary legislative procedure. Codecision occurs when this process is cultivated as the process develops. Today, we are having this debate, it will end, the agreement will go ahead and we will say yes or no at the end. This method should be changed. On the merits, however, because I agree with many things other Members have said, I simply wanted to stress the importance of measuring the effects of fisheries agreements to ensure these are not just mere trade agreements enabling us to buy cephalopods for EUR 1 per kilo in Mauritania. They must be able to measure sustainability but, above all, the impact on the economy of that country, to appreciate the quantitative change in employment figures, to appreciate the rate of innovation of small-scale fishing and to appreciate the use of these resources. It is not purely and simply about commercial trade, but a fisheries agreement, with all its implications. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

Madam President, a new season of rights is upon us, but these rights could have been more widespread. We must be aware that at distances of less than 250 km, the rights of the most vulnerable, of disabled people, old-age pensioners, and persons with reduced mobility, are not addressed at all in this measure. If it is true that homogenised quality standards are being established, it is just as true that excluding local transport seriously limits the number of passengers affected. Implementation over the course of the next four years will allow the sector to prepare itself as well as possible, but we will also need to monitor the establishment of the enforcement bodies. The result of this process represents a victory for Parliament and is a positive sign of our attention to citizens’ needs. However, compromise always implies mediation – and in this case concessions – of this House’s aims. Basically, we have shown that we are good interpreters of needs, in contrast to the Council which has shown that it only represents interests. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not want to break up this joyful atmosphere. It is true that we have come to the end of the phase begun in 2005, during which diplomacy helped to ensure that events unfolded in the best possible way. However, there are still many unresolved problems. This is a young country and will be a young country once secession has taken place. It is a country that still needs to establish its borders, address the issue we have heard mentioned several times of the conflicts in the Abyei region, the issue of the oil pipeline, which is the most important thing in that country, and also the international aid system. I would therefore like to make a very simple point to the Commissioner. There are two or three things that we need to do. We need to establish a strategy for Southern Sudan, and recognise this new State on 7 February, without waiting until 9 July when the results of the election are made official. We also need to put our international service into action immediately, and establish a delegation in Southern Sudan. This is the only way to support a process; this is the only way for smart, strategic diplomacy to support this country on the path to democracy. I would note that the first thing that the country needs to do is to draw up its constitution, and Europe can be of great help in this. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, it is important to link the condemnation of these attacks and the call for urgent, concrete measures to protect Christians around the world with the more general demand for respect for the freedom of religion and freedom of conscience and thought. There is no difference between someone who is murdered while attending mass and someone who is sentenced to death for adultery or for belonging to a Muslim, Christian or Jewish minority, or for having been born in a particular place rather than for practising a religion. The right to freedom and coexistence is universally recognised by humanist culture and international conventions. In contrast, we are seeing the world divided between those who uphold human rights and those who want to brutally extinguish them. Only an attitude open to dialogue and against any form of intolerance can provide a basis for protecting identities and values. A lack of respect for these can even lead to the expulsion of entire communities from their historical homelands. There is a great deal of work for Europe to do in this respect at a political and diplomatic level as well as in the cultural and social spheres. Today, we urge the Council and the Commission, and especially the High Representative for Foreign Affairs, to adopt clear guidelines for our relations with third countries in the context of the new European External Action Service. Bilateral agreements, too, must attach greater importance to the subjects of religious freedom and human rights more generally, violations of which should lead to the suspension of these agreements. I am also thinking that Europe should take a leading role in promoting dialogue between religions. A lack of such dialogue often goes beyond individual incidents and leads to real wars, in which religion conceals other, more complex reasons for conflict. Lastly, we must also look closer to home: there is no lack of cases of intolerance in Europe. Our cities are, in practice, multicultural, and that fact brings with it religious traditions and values that must be respected and afforded freedom of expression. There is, therefore, no alternative to dialogue and mutual respect. It is important to repeat the appeal made by religious communities. (The President cut off the speaker) Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have only one regret in this Chamber this evening, and that is that we are only discussing the Sahrawi people because the Moroccans have invaded the camp outside Laâyoune, and that is a shame for democracy in this Parliament. Parliament should have found the will to discuss this issue of its own accord, as it has been rotting on international negotiating tables for 30 years. This is the most significant political fact. We were forced into it by acts of violence, not because we autonomously decided to guarantee human rights. What is the fact that a referendum for self-determination should be held there, if not a question of respect for human rights? Precisely because Morocco is our friend, because Morocco is the strong party in the relationship, we must forcefully request that it is no longer possible to postpone this desire and follow up with all consequent actions. We must seek to create the conditions so that the aim of the UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) is not only to realise the conditions for a referendum which is constantly being postponed. We must try to use all the means at the disposal of the European Union to bring this event about and ensure that the referendum does justice to a people’s 30 years of suffering. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one minute is not long enough to cover four reports. I therefore congratulate the three other rapporteurs, but I will only comment on Mr Ferreira’s report. Adherence to the principles of biodiversity must be central to the actions which the European Union undertakes with regard to fishing and aquaculture. The compromise amendment is the result of the good work carried out by Mr Ferreira, who has clearly understood these concerns. We must not have preconceived ideas when looking for ways to improve fish farming standards, but we must be rigorous in the control and application of regulations which are as precise as possible, in order to avoid the risk of altering the environmental balance. In this way, the greatest support for organic production is a decision which is made in the general interest and which encompasses the protection of biodiversity. That, in fact, is the best way of optimising the production of native species. Commissioner, I hope that, as part of the common fisheries policy reform, this further measure with regard to aquaculture can be included in one simplified regulation. This will simplify matters greatly, and I hope that a single regulation on aquaculture will make the procedures as a whole even simpler. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 30 years ago, Morocco denied for many years that there was a war with the Sahrawi people and today, it is still denying that there is disproportional repression of these same people. Yet, in the Western Sahara, there are dead and wounded people of a population that is only claiming the right to live in freedom in its own land. Morocco has largely closed its borders to anyone who could witness these events. No information and no members of parliament are allowed in. A member of the French parliament and our fellow Member, Mr Meyer, were denied access. Europe looks on passively. There is no news from the Commission on this matter, which makes us subordinate to United Nations mediation, which continues to fail just as it has done for the past 30 years. Baroness Ashton, who is responsible for foreign policy, has not taken a stand on the subject. We need to react by Parliament making a stand. We need to react against Morocco, curtailing all initiatives on commercial agreements, beginning with the renewal of the fishing agreements. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur. When it comes to integrated maritime policy, we must go beyond the stage of good intentions and give fresh impetus to a strategy that will represent a route to growth and development in the European Union, making up for the huge amount of time lost in the prevention of environmental disasters, and in the fight against climate change and pollution. Only this morning Mr Pirillo reminded Parliament of yet another catastrophic event that occurred the other day in the town of Paola, in Calabria. The Commission must prove that it is making a real effort, that it is not just using its instruments of governance but actually implementing targeted legislative measures, and duly learning its lessons from past mistakes caused by an approach that was often too sectoral in nature. We are fully aware that this is a very complex process, but we are at a difficult and demanding juncture where no lapse in attention can be tolerated and where adequate investment and shared governance mechanisms are needed both at interinstitutional level and in international cooperation for the regional basins, among which the Mediterranean stands out because of the complexity of its jurisdiction. That is why it will be crucial to view the management of the Mediterranean basin as an asset shared by all the coastal States, on the basis of the res communis omnium
, or common heritage, principle. Otherwise, the increasingly widespread practice of unilaterally declaring exclusive economic zones or the like in the Mediterranean Sea, as well as running counter to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, would undermine the idea of effective, shared governance. I would point out in this respect that, only a month ago, this interpretation on the part of Libya resulted in an actual armed assault on a European fishing boat, and it would be wrong to argue that this is just a matter between Italy and Libya. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

Madam President, the revision of the agreement between Parliament and the Commission establishes the basis for improved collaboration between the two institutions. Much progress has been made with regard to procedure, legislative planning, parliamentary scrutiny, requirements to provide information and the Commission’s presence in Parliament. However, the point which I am most eager to highlight is the progress made with respect to the interinstitutional aspect of international relations. The role given to Parliament should not be considered as strengthened: it is a requirement. We hope that no one casts doubt on allowing the presence of European Parliament observers at multilateral and bilateral international conferences as anything but an act of responsibility. Indeed, denying the status of observer to Members of the European Parliament in bilateral agreements, such as, for example, fisheries agreements, prevents, de facto, full knowledge of the area being negotiated, upon which Parliament will subsequently be required to express its opinion. I believe that it is not possible to do without these preconditions, as otherwise we would end up with Parliament rejecting bilateral agreements which, by definition, cannot be amended and which, in the absence of a partnership, would make the vote a mere formality. Guido Milana,

 Madam President, Commissioner, Members of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, on 4 May we in committee unanimously voted in favour of the report on European aquaculture, which is essentially aimed at promoting the sustainable development of the sector. I would like to begin by thanking everyone who worked on this report over the last few months, providing me with valuable support. This text was, in fact, drafted over many long months of work, consultation and concerted action, and I hope it will provide the foundation on which to promote a suitable aquaculture policy in a serious, practical and effective manner. I also think that, in the light of its technological potential and innovative aspects, the healthy and sustainable development of aquaculture represents an extremely important resource for the European economy. In adopting the report, the MEPs have first of all demonstrated great awareness, highlighting that they have fully understood the urgent need for legislative clarity in this area. In other words, they have proved that they are indeed aware of the negative consequences caused by the lack of a single regulation on aquaculture, the confusion among operators in the sector, the complex and excessively bureaucratic procedures, the highly discriminatory situations, the market distortions and the low level of competitiveness of European production. The report maintains that there is a need to provide greater impetus to the sector by establishing a specific aquaculture fund that is either independent or part of the European Fisheries Fund, to be used to support research and innovation, to further the virtuous coexistence of sustainability and competitiveness, and to focus serious attention on employment issues. Admittedly, many measures are needed in the short term in order to deal with and resolve all of the problems that currently plague this sector, and they are not easy to implement. I am talking about an integrated maritime development plan, which is essential for making aquaculture facilities in freshwater, sub-coastal and offshore areas compatible with areas for tourism and other activities of financial importance, all within the framework of the regulations on environmental protection. I am talking about the drafting of a regulation that will consider the specific aspects of each type of aquaculture farming, to be introduced above all with the intention of lowering production costs and of guaranteeing environmental protection. From this perspective I believe that the contribution made by both technological innovation and scientific research is crucial. The task will be to actually establish facilities to reduce the dispersion of feed into the water. To this end it will be necessary to increase the utilisation of plant instead of animal proteins without altering the nutritional value of the catch. With regard, more specifically, to scientific research on feed, we will also have to focus on waste and processing scraps to prevent likely imbalances in the maritime system caused by dangerous overfishing for fish feed. The use of the European quality label helps us to compete with products imported from third countries and to meet consumers’ needs and health requirements. Indeed, I believe that it is now crucial that we introduce product certification and supervision of the sector to enable these products to be identified, and adapt the labelling systems accordingly. Last but not least, we need to design facilities that take greater account of the wellbeing of fish, farm density and slaughtering methods. Moreover, these are all measures that should be applied to organic products, too, which are in fact the result of production that is on a smaller scale and less damaging to the environment. The employment aspect must not be underestimated, since the aquaculture sector may also be the best place for fishermen who have lost their jobs. A full vote by Parliament will certainly be the best incentive for the Commission, after its communication and our reasoned opinion, to go beyond the stage of recommendation to the Member States and actually propose the measures needed in order to develop a European policy and to stop Europe being the producer of 1.2 million tonnes of fish and the consumer of over 5.5 million tonnes. Thank you, and excuse me for running over. Guido Milana,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the debate and for your positive comments on this document, which has all the same enjoyed widespread support over the last few months. Commissioner, you have a historic opportunity. In 2001 Parliament discussed this same subject and published a communication, but there has been no follow-up. However, today I believe that the time is ripe. Since 2001 world aquaculture production has increased by 6% while European production has barely increased by 0.8%. Indeed, with such a broad consensus – which I believe will result in a majority vote by this House in an hour or so – you have the real possibility to put our work to good use. What is more, the Council has also encouraged you in this direction by fully endorsing the stance that Parliament is taking. I believe, therefore, that this occasion must be fully taken advantage of in two ways. I would have liked to have said this to Mr Stevenson, who is no longer here: delegislation and simplification absolutely do not mean lowering the level of guarantees for operators and consumers. Often, delegislation can mean making the guarantees clearer for both consumers and producers. Therefore we need to make an effort along these lines. There is only one point on which I too disagree slightly. I believe that you are too resigned to matters to challenge the European framework surrounding the powers of the Directorates-General. Have the courage to do so, Commissioner. Have the courage to do so, because simplification in the interests of Member States and European citizens only helps to strengthen European integration. If there is one thing that is clear to me, it is the specific point that Parliament is making to you today: that one should not always be restricted with regard to the powers of the Directorates-General. There is someone who assigns those powers, I therefore ask you to reflect on them too. This does not mean taking away a duty or function from the authority supervising the environment. It does not mean taking away a function from the authority supervising consumer protection. It means having a Europe in which these functions are fully integrated. That is basically the sole aim of the single regulation: to streamline the regulations in order to make them simpler and more practical for operators. I have one last comment. After the speech this morning I am tempted to go on holiday to Scotland, and I may just consider doing that, but I would not be against Greece either, if I could change your mind there about the last few points which divide us. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to highlight two points and also thank Mr Romeva i Rueda for his extraordinary work. The first point is that this is an important occasion because we are adopting a law at first reading for the first time. The second is that this work has a deadline and that deadline, as Mr Romeva i Rueda already stated at the beginning, is the next Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) meeting, in four years’ time. If what we have written and will adopt today works, then in four years’ time we will probably not have the problem of inclusion in the CITES. That is my hope. I do not want this so much for the sake of fishermen, but for the sake of tuna. The effectiveness of our action derives from our ability, over the next four years, to apply the regulation that is adopted today and to develop supervision conditions. I would like to say a few words on this aspect. We have an extraordinary Control Agency in Vigo, which does a good job of controlling tuna fishing in the Mediterranean. Yet this agency, which has limited funding and needs greater resources, single-handedly coordinates controls, or rather it offers the individual Member States the possibility to do so. I think we need to take a look at this agency and try to create the conditions to grant it direct responsibility for controls and a greater degree of authority that goes beyond simple coordination. Please excuse me for running over. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I support – and I have also tabled amendments in this regard – the inclusion of bluefin tuna in Appendix II. Supporting this certainly does not make feel me like a criminal. On the contrary, I feel very much on the same wavelength as those who, before me, starting with Mrs Gardini, upheld a different position. It is deeply flawed to put tigers, polar bears, elephants and tuna on equal terms. The FAO would never allow itself to say anything different or to support a different position for these other endangered species. Holding a different view on how to manage the tuna issue certainly does not mean forgetting that biodiversity is a value that must be defended at all costs. The spirit of the motion for a resolution is absolutely worthy of support. However, at a time when some people seem to be taking a step backwards in terms of estimating tuna biomass in the sea, rapidly moving towards inclusion in Appendix I probably means overlooking the side effects of this choice, which are severe and sometimes irreversible in many sectors of our economy. In some ways, the same goes for the issue of coral and for its inclusion in Appendix II. Here, too, there is data that does not definitely indicate the extinction or endangerment of deep coral, coral that is at a depth of more than 150-200 metres, which is what is covered by the measure. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT) 
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make just two observations. I think that we ought not to argue about greater privatisation, competition or what have you. It is clear that the logic of rushing to reduce costs is a negative factor in terms of safety standards. When there are attempts to reduce costs because a major competition mechanism is launched, it is inevitable that safety standards should fall. The real issue is that I believe the Commission ought to initiate a more rigorous phase based around a more strategic role for the European Railway Agency. It ought to take on a role of greater coordination, control and supervision over the national safety agencies, and it ought to do so in a much speedier manner precisely because of the differences between the various countries, which my fellow Members have already alluded to, regarding contradictions between national and European legislation. In my view, there are huge delays on this aspect. The model ought to be that of the European Aviation Safety Agency, and it should have the same binding powers over actions and enforcement. If there is a call to be made to the Commission today, it is that it should move more swiftly in this direction. The Commissioner has said that we need to wait for the results of the investigations into the accidents. On the contrary, I believe that these results will add nothing to the existing situation. Another element, Commissioner, which probably does not fall within your sphere of responsibilities, and which is probably also outside the scope of this evening’s debate, is that, all too often, the legislation as a whole does not ensure that anyone suffering loss or damage as a result of a railway accident – given that the rate of railway accidents is still low – receives immediate acknowledgment from the person bearing liability for it.

 Mr President, we still have a long way to go, but today we may have taken an important step towards finally introducing and levying a tax on financial transactions. I understand the prudence, the caution, the need to do things gradually expressed by Mr Šemeta and the technical issues rightly raised by Ms Vestager. Precisely for this reason, though, I hope that Parliament will express a clear, political will, with a broad majority, in order to encourage and drive forward the initiatives necessary to address the unresolved problems, especially at Council level. We all want to closely examine the impact of this tax, but it is not right to stir up unfounded fears which could even lead to contradictory and counterproductive choices. I refer, for example, to the rationale behind the proposed exemptions. If we are careful to reduce the impact of the tax, it is important to have as broad a tax base as possible, with a low rate, and not to attempt to extend the exemptions ad infinitum
. To those who are concerned about the consequences for small investors, I would point out the progressive nature of the tax, so those who carry out several transactions are affected more, and it is clear that the competent authorities must, in any case, ensure that there are no attempts to offload the possible costs onto end users. I therefore hope that Parliament will vote in favour of this tax by a large majority. Leonardo Domenici  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to ask Mr Barroso some questions, but I am happy to ask them of Mr Rehn. Commissioner, have you and the European Commission read that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) does not expect Italy to balance its budget in 2013 or very likely in 2014 either? Does this forecast stimulate any particular thoughts? I am speaking about Italy, but I could very easily be speaking about other countries. The strangest thing is that the IMF tells us, of course, that if there were no recession, Italy would have a surplus of 0.6%. That is great. However, the problem is that there is a crisis, there is a recession, and it is difficult to pretend that there is not. Mr Rehn, in Europe, are we making choices based on an analysis of the actual situation we are experiencing, or are we simply applying a doctrine based on abstract principles? I believe that we continue to focus on objectives that are not in line with the economic cycle. Commissioner, today, we have been told about the European Commission’s plans for growth, but are you sure that growth based on supply-side policy principles is enough, without considering the at least equal importance of a policy that acts on the aggregate demand side? Commissioner, I shall end with an appeal. I beg you to speak truthfully to European citizens, truthfully about the crisis and the concrete fact that we still do not have any choices to take at the moment. Leonardo Domenici  (S&amp;D

Mr President, yesterday in Florence, an extremely serious event took place which has caused horror and anguish: an armed fifty year-old man opened fire on five citizens of Senegalese origin in two markets in Florence – two of these victims have died and three are now in a serious condition in hospital. The murderer then committed suicide. The man was a member of the racist and xenophobic far right, who wanted to kill people who were strangers to him, guilty only of having black skin. Florence is my city, and before being elected to the European Parliament I was mayor of Florence for ten years. Florence is a civilised and democratic city, with a gold medal for resistance to Nazi fascism. Yet this abominable racist crime took place in Florence, a demonstration of the fact that Nazi fascistic madness can appear anywhere and we must never think that it has been wholly eradicated. Mr President, I ask you to express the European Parliament’s grief and to repeat this House’s commitment to combating every kind of intolerance and racism and working to improve respect for the dignity and rights of all human beings. Leonardo Domenici  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis is not a new phenomenon; it has existed for several years. Perhaps now is the time to undertake a critical review of the policies implemented up to now: have things always been done well? Have we always analysed the situation correctly? Has the right approach been chosen? Has the European Central Bank which, as Minister Rostoski said, has saved Europe, always taken the correct course of action, even when it has raised interest rates through fear of inflation? President Barroso has identified a problem: the speed of the markets and the slowness of policy; yet is this the only problem? Of course, if we consider that we are still implementing the 21 July agreement, this ought at least to suggest that we need to prepare for and organise summits and their conclusions better, but policy will always lag behind the markets. We therefore need to look further, concentrating our efforts on combating unemployment and encouraging growth. These are the areas that the European Commission should focus on; even today in President Barroso’s speech, there was more substance with regard to the deficit than with regard to signs of growth and development. The Commission must overcome its failings and state that the priority is the fight against unemployment, job creation, the redistribution of wealth and public investment strategies, while also amending the rules in the new European Stability and Growth Pact.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Tusk, your speech fills us with hope, the hope that the Polish Presidency will help combat the Europe of national selfishness, which fails to look to the future, and will help further a Europe that genuinely thinks of itself as being real, integrated and sharing a common destiny. However, as you rightly said in your speech, presidencies have specific problems to tackle and solve. In the short time that I have, I wish to draw your attention to two crucial issues relating to the economic and financial crisis. The first issue concerns the reform of the financial markets. This is not a technical problem but a major democratic issue of our time. Too much time is being taken: we need to settle issues such as the one relating to the reform of short selling and over-the-counter derivatives. The second issue is that we have the matter of the tax on financial transactions to address; we need to look at this issue in detail, and we hope that the Polish Presidency will make a real contribution in this regard. Leonardo Domenici,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to join in thanking Mr Langen and the other Members with whom we have worked to finalise this complex report. I think that Mr Langen made a particularly important point when he said that we wish to maintain the scope of this regulation, keeping faith with the mandate of the G20 in Pittsburgh in 2009. The basic objective was to bring the majority of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives onto regulated platforms in order to prevent their continuing exposure to a high level of risk and speculation. When it comes down (as it did) to exchanging or guaranteeing USD 400 million without collateral, that is, without adequate reserves, the risks we are running become clear. Having said that, however, I should also like to raise two problems. The first problem is the relationship with the Council; the second problem is the coherence of the proposal for reform of the financial markets that we must take forward. I raise the problem regarding the Council first and I say it very clearly. The feeling is all too often that the Council represents an obstacle to reforming the financial markets swiftly and well. I hope that the new Presidency will take on this problem because this time too we have to factor in an extension that is due in large measure to positions, difficulties and disputes arising in the Council. It is a problem that also affects the procedure that we wish to follow. The second question relates to the coherence and specificity of the provisions. There is not only the measure on OTC derivatives but also the measure on short selling and other matters. I would like to draw attention to two points: the specific issue of the commodities market, a special market that requires special anti-speculation measures, and the problem of the exposure in derivatives of local authorities in EU countries. I think that these are problems on which Parliament must intervene. Leonardo Domenici  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we are witnessing a paradox. The package that should correct and prevent imbalances and asymmetries is based on an imbalance and a lack of symmetry. It is like a body that stands on two legs, but one is much longer and more developed than the other. The leg that controls fiscal policy is muscular and articulated, while the one that controls development policy, which should provide impetus and long-term drive, appears spindly and lacking in strength. I think that this inharmonious result in the final structure of the package is down to a difference of opinion about the origins and nature of the crisis. The difference between those who believe that disorder and imbalances in public finances are at the root of the crisis and those who think that the underlying problem has to do instead with the lack of rules and transparency in the markets, economic and trade imbalances and social inequality. We risk confusing cause and effect. We all want public finances to be controlled responsibly, but the goal of reducing debt is not sufficient to kick-start growth and competitiveness. The main thrust of these measures lies in procedures and sanctions. Far less emphasis – too little emphasis – has been placed on investment and sustainable growth strategy, which Europe should promote and implement. We know that our actions can lead to widely differing results, even without our intending it, and can even have the opposite effect to the one we are seeking to achieve. This is the heterogenesis of purpose. I fear that this problem lies at the heart of this package. Leonardo Domenici  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Podimata’s report contains many important aspects that are not limited to the issue of the financial transaction tax. The report is packed with analysis and suggestions and I hope it is widely supported by this House. It could be the basis for the genuine new European tax policy that we need. On the subject of tax harmonisation, this report also contains proposals that move towards a tax harmonisation that gives new strength and subjectivity to Europe, although it is clear that at the moment, the debate focuses mainly on the financial transaction tax, to be applied as a first step across Europe. I think this is the time for courageous decisions, which should be applied in a balanced way, but still indicate the direction forward. I believe that Europe has a responsibility to show the world the way ahead; I believe that this House has a responsibility to send out a signal and a political message. Let me say one thing to Mr Schmidt, whose intelligence and lucidity I really respect: be careful with the arguments we use, because if we say today that we cannot levy a financial transaction tax because there are tax havens, we will make European citizens feel helpless at a time when many of these financial institutions are starting to go back into the black. Not only the Socialists are saying this. In my country, Italy, this proposal is also supported by many autonomous and independent groups; it is also supported by the Catholic, democratic movement for the promotion of development and balanced growth.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although the theme of good tax governance has always been of great importance, it has become even more relevant and significant following the major economic and financial crisis of two years ago. European and international summits – the G20 – have discussed and continue to discuss it, particularly when they are concerned with fighting tax evasion and tax havens. All this is important. It is a sign of commitment and willpower, but we should not delude ourselves into thinking that an announcement is all it is going to take. We need an effective and ongoing policy. There are still many problems to be dealt with. It really is still much too easy to buy or set up a front company in order to avoid taxation. Just look around on the Internet: there are thousands of websites offering companies for sale, even in European Union countries. Often, all you have to do is send an email and attach a photocopy of a scanned passport in order to set up a company. We must put a stop to the practice of creating fictitious legal entities to evade tax. The report I am presenting is based on the European Commission communication of 28 April 2009 on Promoting Good Governance in Tax Matters. The report moves towards putting forward firm proposals, and calls for a strong commitment from the European Commission and Council, so that these proposals can be implemented. The fight against tax havens, tax evasion and illicit capital flight must be considered priorities of the European Union. Hence the principle of good governance, based on transparency, exchange of information, cross-border cooperation, and fair tax competition. The point is that we need increasing tax cooperation and collaboration in the European Union. The general objective that we must set ourselves is for automatic information exchange on a global and multilateral scale, but this must, obviously, start within the European Union. As Mrs Alvarez has already said, we must completely abolish bank secrecy in European Union countries and hasten to put an end to the temporary derogation that allows the application of a withholding tax, which is often evaded or underestimated, instead of an exchange of information. I do not wish to dwell on the tangible proposals that the report contains. I will, however, stress that we still particularly need the following things: to extend the scope of the 2003 Savings Directive, to fight VAT fraud, to create an EU public register listing the names of individuals and undertakings having set up companies or accounts in tax havens and to give new impetus to tax harmonisation projects, beginning with the common corporate consolidated tax base. The European Union must also send out only one message internationally, and fight for the improvement of OECD standards to achieve the automatic sharing of information, instead of sharing on request. Mr Kovács, having listened to the other reports as well, we need strong commitment by the Commission and we now also need these priorities to be emphasised to the new Commission at the time of handover. As the European Parliament, we are entitled to call on the Council and the Commission to account for their work. I thank my fellow Members, and especially the shadow rapporteurs, for the contribution they have made to this work, which I hope will be adopted by Parliament. Leonardo Domenici,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my thanks for the comments on our reports, the products of a collective effort. I hope that these comments are a good omen for a positive vote by the European Parliament. I believe that – as Mr Stolojan and Mr Casa also said – our reports deserve support, if only on behalf of all our fellow citizens: honest taxpayers, who are the first to suffer from fraud and tax evasion. The aim is to make everyone pay, so that each individual has to pay less. I would just like to make two comments. Mrs Lulling spoke, at the beginning of the debate, about tax colonoscopy. I know from experience that a colonoscopy is not a pleasant examination, even if it can be very beneficial to human health. In the sphere of tax, there is a very simple way of avoiding it: it is simply not to conceal, not to hide one’s own income and not to evade one’s legal obligations. The second comment is that it is right to always be concerned about how public money is being used, but it is also right to do so when governments are forced to use that public money to bail out banks and financial institutions that have speculated their money.

Mr President, we are here to debate again a topic of great importance. The positive outcome of the negotiations on the treaty for visually impaired and blind people will finally open access to millions of books across the world. We are dealing with a fundamental right, not with charity. Commissioner Barnier, I remember and recognise your personal commitment more than a year ago here in this room. We are now taking the very last steps before an agreement. In Marrakesh the Commission and the Member States must find a compromise to the deadlock we are now facing. Two points are still open. Excuse me if I go into detail. Are you going to change the provision in the current text on the commercial availability requirement which is basically watering down the meaning of the Treaty, which would be, paradoxically, even less ambitious than a memorandum of understanding? We must delete commercial availability. Secondly, are you allowing for the possibility of sending a book to an individual rather than two organisations? Remember the opportunities offered by current technology. Let us come back to the core reason for the treaty. The current legal framework and the functioning of the market are not sufficient to provide a real solution to the book famine that the visually impaired still live with. Our goal is to have a good and effective treaty for the benefit of blind and visually-impaired people. We will not just be unlocking a problem affecting millions of European citizens, we will also be showing our loyalty to our constitutive values – human dignity, culture, equality and freedom of access.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to congratulate Ms Geringer de Oedenberg for her most patient and persistent work, which has led to a result that we look upon favourably, despite a number of question marks. The directive we are going to adopt is important, not only because it increases the number of people with access to artistic and original works – which, in itself, is highly significant – but also because it marks a break from a position which, to date, has had a negative effect on the spread of culture: a reverence for copyright to the extent of wishing to defend it even if there is no right holder, who might have died or is unconcerned. Moreover, the narrow-mindedness of collecting societies is an obstacle to the spread of culture, which is why we have arrived here with delays and with great difficulty. I refer, for example, to attitudes on access for blind people to cultural works and attitudes on private copying. On this issue, we have found ourselves confronted with a kind of wall, which today – thanks to this measure – we have been able to demolish or at least breach. The measure we are going to adopt has great political significance and the step forward we are about to take surely deserves our approval. There are, no doubt, some shortcomings – so I also understand some of the concerns raised by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance – but these do not add up to a reason to fail to grasp this opportunity and the significant innovation that this step represents. Fortunately, Mr Barnier has tabled the regulation on collecting societies under debate in our committee, so we are addressing this critical issue in order that the whole range of arguments and topics relating to copyright can be dealt with in the right way. It is a good proposal, which we think needs amending and improving but is worthy of support, thus convincing us yet further to vote in favour. Luigi Berlinguer  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to draw this Chamber’s attention to the fact that yesterday, it was officially announced that the Higgs boson has been measured and definitively identified. The particle that gives mass to all the others and their existence, and this happened on European soil. Science brings our earth to life, it gives us civilisation and well-being and, for a time, we can aspire to becoming a scientific hub once again. Utopia is characteristic of man, who invents a utopia and wants to build it, and it is through science and this wonderful ambition man has that today someone who is blind, who has no eyes, can see with his hands or read a book with his ears, and a young South African boy who has no legs can compete in the Olympics in a race. Well, Europe must be the home of science! This great event that will open up new frontiers of knowledge must be completely supported by Europe. Luigi Berlinguer  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) has been a very serious political mistake, not to mention a legal one, because it has caused a worldwide reaction of immense proportions, and that is enough to say that it is a political mistake. Why immense? Because it has created the suspicion that access to the Web, which is a great modern revolution, would really be inhibited. Why is this? Because it has made the mistake of lumping together counterfeiting and piracy, which are two totally different issues. The way to combat counterfeiting has nothing to do with copyright. Then there is another mistake, in that it has excluded Parliament from an important activity that it has been doing for some time: creating a new copyright, although some people would like to retain the old copyright law, which existed before the Web. The point is that we have to work on copyright and put ACTA aside, as it is an obstacle. We have to reject it, exclude it, because it is an obstacle to our work. Fortunately, the Commission, after months and years of hesitation, has brought two important measures to the attention of Parliament: orphan works and the one regarding copyright management companies. This is positive; let us work on this rationally rather than just emotionally, but without letting ACTA get in the way. Luigi Berlinguer,  
rapporteur. 
– Madam President, let me thank all the colleagues of the Committee on Culture and Education for their collaboration in preparing this report on the Bologna process on the consolidation and development of a European university system. I have a dream that every student applying to a university in any Member State should be enabled to get a degree, a qualification valid in all the territories of Europe, within the whole European labour market. This is definitely one of the ways to build up European unity and European citizenship. This is the deep meaning of this report. (Loud applause) Luigi Berlinguer,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I too would like to echo the warm greetings extended to Mr Lechner and the assessment of his work, which he carried out with competency, tenacity and determination: a labour of love, sometimes this draft regulation met with an obstacle and he withdrew it and began negotiating again with the Council, with the Commission, and with the Committee on Legal Affairs. I believe he can be proud of this. I note that there is unanimous consensus in his favour. Turning to this regulation of ours, I too am convinced that this is an important thing, which may not hit the headlines in the press, may not be considered high politics, but the construction of the European Union also involves meeting the needs of citizens in their daily lives – first and foremost of those millions of people with interests in more than one Member State dealing with procedures that are difficult to unravel, tedious and which sometimes touch on sensitive issues at the heart of a family which politics generally finds difficult to grasp. The European Union should take pride in being based on such sensitive attention. The solutions that have been proposed are new and intelligent ones. For example, those drawing up a will have been given the freedom to choose between their habitual residence and their state of origin. This makes decision-making more flexible, since there are such major differences between one State and another that the question of succession could always be rather tricky. But the law has also been made more certain, because once the legal solution has been chosen – either habitual residence or country of origin – this requires limitations of the jurisdiction and of the conflicts that can arise and therefore it is a more peaceful way of proceeding in this area and so there is more freedom and more certainty. Then there is the certificate of succession: now, we may believe that certificates are of little importance, but they create the conditions to ensure the heir is in a condition of greater flexibility and certainty with regard to all the possible difficulties that may arise. That is a positive aspect of this law. It is true,  this law is by no means perfect: there are problems concerning whether there is an executor of the will or not, the feasibility of direct inheritance, and so on, but I just want to say another word of a political nature. We hope that the Council will approve this text, and we hope it will become law. However, we must not lay this text to rest, because we cannot have England in a different condition – with the United Kingdom left like that – because Europe cannot do without the United Kingdom, and so we must therefore make sure that we overcome these difficulties. Thank you. Luigi Berlinguer,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has produced a massive amount of laws and standards to establish European legislation, and has created the European area known as the Stockholm Programme. There is an imbalance between this monumental amount of legislation and the use which citizens make of it, which is numerically, in percentage terms, very limited. On the other hand, national judges, lawyers working within individual States have grown up with the legislation of their own country and are mainly trained in this sense, whereas we believe that the true European judges are national judges capable of changing their mentality and imbuing themselves with a knowledge of European law. Therefore, before talking about training we need to discuss a great communication campaign aimed at citizens and legal practitioners, so that they can be the vehicles for this great innovation andso that they can increase capacity to profit from the benefits provided by this legislation. Primarily, though, it is a grassroots movement that must be created, through in-service training – we cannot provide judicial training of professionally highly qualified adults as if it were a lesson for schoolchildren. We must stimulate curiosity in dealing with their cases, encouraging them to connect with other colleagues and to come up with solutions, given that today common law and civil law are converging, and are not as far apart as they once were within our judicial culture. This is the real point. In our proposals, and I am happy that the European Commission is now convinced of this, we are calling for a reversal of the trend: bottom-up, more legal status than judicial training. There in a very interesting example in the Netherlands, called Eurinfra: it is a network of leaders in every court who spread this knowledge and push magistrates on this issue. This is the substance of our project, and we hope to have the full support of the Commission. Luigi Berlinguer,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the purpose of this report is to relaunch the initiative on the Bologna Process, keeping in our minds and in our sights an important goal, which is that qualifications awarded by universities across Europe must have overall recognition and validity. Once someone has earned a qualification at a university in a Member State, it must be such that all other universities recognise it, this is the main objective. It is a mistake to consider university education as a matter that is exclusively internal to Member States. The true dimension of the university and place of study is international, because studies and research are international, and professions are now international. We need to free the professional market from the shackles and ties which today impede employment mobility within Europe. This is a precondition that has economic value and also provides a response to a great aspiration on the part of young people. Who is this task incumbent on? It is up to individual Member States to organise study courses, but recognition abroad is not a task that can be performed within the State, it is up to the European Union to provide and make a policy to encourage this. Article 149 of the Treaty of Lisbon states that it is the task of the EU to recognise qualifications, contribute to the development of the quality of education and higher education, and develop its European dimension. For this reason, our report points out that, as well as the responsibility of the Member States, there is also a need to underline the EU’s responsibility; and the biennial meetings of the ministers of education, such as the upcoming one in Bucharest, must gradually come under the remit of the EU. What is to be done then? Our report identifies a number of measures, within the framework of a series of procedures, a gradual approach to achieve them: to support any actions that tend to give a European profile to universities within the EU; curriculum flexibility; learning outcomes and consequently monitoring for the assessment of learning outcomes; assessment for the quality of what happens in universities as a condition to create that trust between different higher educational establishments which lies at the heart of mutual recognition. The final goal is to set up automatic procedures that attest to the validity of qualifications throughout Europe. Secondly, remove social barriers against young people, against students from weaker sections of society, which today are being exacerbated by the cuts on the part of many governments. Change the teaching, to make it more learning centred, develop life-long learning, build a European higher education sector to enter into dialogue with the European research sector. These measures are instruments of growth. More than 900 years ago in Bologna, a great jurist, Irnerius, spread the idea of creating with the Alma Mater
 the unification of European culture. It was a time when there were no States. Now that States do exist, there is a supranational dimension and today for that reason we call upon the EU to promote a European university citizenship. Thank you. Luigi Berlinguer  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what we are asking for is a new treaty to regulate exceptions for the visually impaired on cultural works and on books. This is not charity – it is a fundamental right to access culture. The European Union and, in particular, the Commission, has not been particularly active: it has not done enough and has, in my opinion, been too conservative, almost to the point, in essence, of boycotting the Treaty itself. I refer to the amendments proposed by the European Union in November in Geneva. Fine words need to be followed up by concrete action. Voluntary agreements are not enough: it is a treaty that we need. So we must remove the legal obstacles that block the circulation and usage of works in Braille and in electronic format, the latter being particularly suitable for the visually impaired. We must no longer come up with the pretext that the treaty represents a danger for copyright per se

Madam President, Commissioner, in Europe growth is now a necessity we can no longer put off. It depends also on liberalisation measures addressing the obstacles and privileges that are strangling the internal digital market as well. Among these is the need for a new copyright regime, in particular for collective rights management, given that copyright represents 7% of our European gross domestic product (GDP). Reform is urgent, Commissioner, and we have awaiting it for a long time now. It has been announced many times with deadlines and dates that have never been respected, as you have indirectly admitted. We have been waiting for this directive for over two years, just as we have been hoping that the subject of Directive 2004/48/EC on the Enforcement of Property Rights and Directive 2001/29/EC would be addressed by an up-to-date scheme of exceptions. One had hoped that it would come to pass within this parliamentary term. Yet today our debate is contaminated with ‘ideologisms’ that artificially set artists in conflict with the right of free access to the web, in a paralysing conflict that is both noxious and sterile. All this must be resolved with innovative legal and technological ideas for a new concept of artists’ rights, which begins in the first place with their management. Although interesting proposals and opinions have been put forward, no progress has been made on this idea. Mr Barnier, you had significant success with patents, for which I congratulate you because I hold you in high esteem. On this issue, however, you are stalling. Why? Both you and the rapporteur, Ms Gallo, have spoken of genuine difficulties which, as you have said, partly justify this delay. The problem is that existing collective management companies and record companies represent powerful interests that are defending their patch. That is the main obstacle. I say no to territoriality, no to reasonable derogations, no to broad collective licences, no to incentives for new business models, no to greater transparency, no to interoperability for format shifting. All this is what makes for delay. What we need are well-fashioned reforms that do not create oligopolies capable of distorting the market, the cultural industries and small players and of stifling diversity and the cultural wealth of Europe. That is why we are hoping that this ‘spring’, awaited so earnestly by all, will finally arrive. Luigi Berlinguer  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the absence of a European patent can no longer be tolerated. Businesses in Europe are being penalised when it comes to patenting by costs 10 times as high as those faced by their US and Japanese competitors. Besides, the fragmentation of copyright in patents is one of the causes holding back economic recovery. The Commission is offering us enhanced cooperation with a specific language regime, something that we do not welcome. Nevertheless, there is something new. 25 out of 27 states are participating. The political framework has changed. Positive development may be possible, with an enhancement even of the proposer’s language, for example. We must all now work to achieve better respect for all. Besides, we want the Italian language to be protected and enhanced, but our government has cut funding and is very neglectful of this aspect. It is on this other ground that we shall be urging it on, but we must achieve a European patent. Luigi Berlinguer,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, due to the change in the agenda approved yesterday by this House, I would firstly like to express my approval for the fact that the Committee on Legal Affairs has unanimously approved the draft report that we are voting on today. The fact that the construction of the European judicial space finds such a broad consensus in Parliament is important. The Stockholm Programme envisages that everyday life should be intrinsic to the process of constructing a Europe of citizens and not merely of political forces or institutional representations. It sets out to resolve the everyday problems of Europeans by the real and unified creation of an effective market of labour, goods and services, entrepreneurial activity without internal borders and without red tape, to strengthen the common basis of rights of succession, contracts, consumers, timely payments, the family, children and more. It will also be the duty and responsibility of the justice system, national judiciaries, solicitors, accountants and workers who operate within individual States to build Europe, to interpret the laws that unite our continent. Our past is marked by different judicial and legal traditions – Common law and Civil law – with differences between the French or German systems and histories that are sometimes very different. We respect national prerogatives and the principle of subsidiarity, but we realise that in order to build Europe – and fortunately we are still on that road – we need progressive convergence that is based on the great constitutional tradition of fundamental rights for which Europe stands. Mr President, the Action Plan that we will approve sets out to construct, reinforce, extend and disseminate a solid European judicial culture, a European legal mindset. That is why I will vote in favour. Luigi Berlinguer  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in recent days, the Veneto region of Italy has been hit by serious natural disasters, in particular, the provinces of Vicenza, Padova and Verona. These catastrophic floods have affected around 500 000 people in various ways and have caused hundreds of millions of euro of damage. This tragedy has brought all productive sectors, small and medium-sized enterprises, and various other sectors, to their knees. I should like to appeal to my fellow Members and the European institutions to do everything possible to support these people and find solutions to respond to this disaster, within the limits of the rules set out by the European Union Solidarity Fund and the Structural Funds. I should also like to note that Italy also has another reason to weep today, although for a completely different reason: the collapse of Pompeii. I only wished to note it here in order to emphasise the significance and importance of an event of this type and the need for Europe to keep an eye on these things as well. Luigi Berlinguer,  
deputising for the author.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we called for this oral question and a parliamentary resolution to make the Commission aware of the vital importance of fostering a common judicial culture throughout Europe as part of the Stockholm Programme. I would like to say at the outset that this is important but also that, with a view to the communication that the Commission will have to produce on future pilot projects, as already discussed, we would like to clarify some points. First of all, we would like the parliamentary consultations to start soon so that we do not get to the initial phase, when we begin to draw up an idea for these future projects, too late when the projects have already been more or less fully formulated. I say this because we have some basic observations to make. National judges and prosecutors in individual states are now crucial pawns in the construction of Europe because, by interpreting national rights in a European light, they can lay the ground for settling disputes and regulating the daily lives of citizens. By doing so, they engender a sense of European citizenship; they engender a European sensibility in everyone who inhabits these lands. This comes about because the people are made to feel the tangible benefits of introducing European elements and hence Community law, above all, into all State laws so that our citizens can live better lives. This offers real advantages for overcoming problems that would otherwise remain unresolved. By saying this, my aim is to turn the whole system slightly on its head. For example, we do not agree that these projects should be along the lines of Erasmus projects because the number of judges and prosecutors involved in Erasmus-style projects would be very low. This could not be otherwise due to the high costs of physical mobility in this field and the numbers would not therefore be very significant within the judiciary as a whole. The most important question concerns the term ‘familiarisation courses’, which we introduced in our paper. Judges are not schoolchildren sitting behind their desks waiting to be taught a lesson. They are mature and highly professional people with little time to spare and who cannot therefore easily move around. Despite this, they hold a valuable store of knowledge and should be stimulated to pit their knowledge against the new problems of European law and European culture. This will create fertile ground for exchanges, virtual rather than physical, using technologies, the Internet and the various opportunities such exchanges can create. Their starting point should be not so much a general approach but rather the individual cases, the individual problems that judges and prosecutors have to deal with. The cases and problems are new and must stimulate the professional growth of these legal operators, providing them with the stimulus they need to make an effective contribution, based on autobiographical reflection on their experience and what they have learned, to respond to the challenges represented by Europe in positive terms. As you see, Mr President, Commissioner, we intend to break with the tradition of the courses that have been held so far and that we feel are not really fit for purpose. We would like to know how much and what funds are available and express our doubts over the idea – as we stated in our communication – of a Central European institution to oversee this process because we are in favour of a bottom-up movement and against centralisation. This is a new approach. What we wish to point out, however, is that unless we shape a European mentality among judges and prosecutors, who will, in this way, offer their services to justice and the citizens who call for it, we will not make Europe. This is therefore not only an important charter for European justice; it is an important charter for the development of European unity as a whole. Luigi Berlinguer  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, concluding negotiations with Croatia during 2010 is a feasible aim and the Swoboda report is a balanced examination of our progress and the steps we still need to take. Justice is now the area in which hard-hitting reform is still required. It is not enough to complete the necessary system reforms, adopt new laws and cooperate as required with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. I stress the need to build a true legal culture and mentality in line with European standards. Crucial to this is the independence of the judiciary, which is a central issue, and also the training, recruitment and career of magistrates, in other words, the fact that the government must not impose conditions of any kind on judges. I call on the Commission to consider the need for hard-hitting measures that address these issues during the final stage of the negotiations. Luigi Berlinguer  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, two innovations have been introduced by the Stockholm Programme as compared with the Hague Programme: a fair balance between rights and security and legal protection in both the criminal and the civil spheres. Security is a right: it means not being attacked in one’s own workplace, walking the streets without risking one’s life, not being the object of violence as a woman, not being exposed to acts of terrorism. The Member States and Europe must guarantee security. However, security measures that diminish the guarantees of freedom are measures that remove certainty from the law, and are thus the source of insecurity and barbarities. Think of Guantánamo. Europe is the fatherland of rights. The Stockholm Programme defines them today with an abundance of detail. There is a fair balance between, on the one hand, the discipline of measures to prevent crime and, on the other, the daily lives of citizens and their family, social, economic, work and study relations, which are all regulated by civil law and the civil justice system. That is the citizen’s Europe. It should be constructed within the Member States and the Community institutions. European society is more united, and mobility is more pronounced than is commonly believed. Mobility is now a right. The borders between the Member States are not impermeable walls, but nets through which society filters daily. The Stockholm Programme constitutes the institutional cornerstone that provides for judicial cooperation and mutual recognition, a European justice system (made up of the national systems and the Community system), both national and Community law, European citizens and European courts (both national and Community courts). European rules are dictated by Community rules and by the case-law of the European courts, but they also derive from the conduct of workers, businesses, students, and judges, both national and belonging to the European networks between operators of justice. It is a bottom-up process that the Stockholm Programme wishes to support. Parliament has done a great job with this resolution, which I hope will be adopted here by a large, unanimous vote, for which we have worked extremely hard. The Council should take it into proper account. The Treaty of Lisbon has not yet entered into force, but it is here, and present. Minister, may the Council be ambitious, and may it take to heart what we have drafted here and the many demands arising from it. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, an excellent compromise has been achieved which puts Europe on the right track to achieve the goals of the climate package. One of the successes is having maintained the target of 3% in relation to the energy efficiency of public buildings, an ambitious target at a time of economic crisis, which has great environmental value and will act as a lever for the EU’s economic growth. The directive lays the foundations for redesigning energy saving strategies, for which both private and public operators will need to call on experts in the sector, without whom the established goals will be difficult to achieve. That therefore paves the way for encouraging national training programmes for audit and energy saving experts. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, we have to face the evidence that all the available data are pointing to, which is the depletion of fish stocks. Some fish stocks have been seriously jeopardised, and therefore our objective must be to guarantee sustainable fishing if we wish to increase future fish production in our seas. Today’s debate is an anticipation of some of the central issues of the common fisheries policy. The lack of reliable data means that it is not possible to reach a shared definition of over-capacity, and it is crucial to avoid the risk of adopting measures that could penalise fishermen, given the serious crisis that has hit the sector. Fishing needs to continue to be an important source of employment and sustenance for families. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 as regards electronic identification of bovine animals and deleting the provisions on voluntary beef labelling is of fundamental importance for the defence of quality rearing, the protection of consumer information and food safety. By proposing the abolition of voluntary labelling, the Commission is weakening these aspects and preventing the consumer from having access to additional information, such as the sex, age and diet of bovine animals – elements I consider fundamental for two reasons: because they can help the consumer to make a more informed purchase and because they give added value to the product. The criticisms the Commission has made of the voluntary labelling system are based on heavy administrative burdens not offset by sufficient advantages. I should like to know on what basis this assertion is founded, given that the simulations provided by independent associations instead show that these costs are contained, and therefore justified in order to guarantee information that protects and benefits the consumer. For these reasons, I do not agree with the repeal of Articles 16, 17 and 18 in the Commission’s proposal. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

High-quality products and a strong propensity for research and innovation are the strong points of our economy; if they are to play a more important role then they need a true internal market, where businesses can compete openly. The Programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs 2014-2020 must provide a real opportunity for small and medium-sized enterprises. We need to create a new energy model that is not conditioned by the rising price of oil and can offer European businesses affordable energy access. The creation, as set out in paragraph 16, of a European observatory capable of monitoring the reduction of tax and bureaucratic barriers, and the implementation of cohesion policies, is an interesting idea.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, water is an essential and vital public good, which must be protected by means of an holistic approach to preserve it and rationalise its use. Improving efficiency and sustainability is a duty that we must not shirk, not least in view of the challenges of climate change. The target that we have set ourselves of achieving ecological and chemical ‘good status’ for our water by 2015 is a sine qua non
 of Europe’s environmental policy and a commitment to be strictly monitored. The European Union’s water legislation needs to be enforced and stricter penalty measures should be introduced. Some 20% of water in Europe is lost due to obsolete infrastructure, which it is crucial to improve if we want efficient water resource use and sustainable water management that can address the problems of water shortages and drought.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to congratulate the rapporteurs on the compromises reached in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, as they strengthen the Committee’s proposal by ensuring greater protection for vulnerable groups of consumers and an increase in the information provided. The exclusion of gluten-free products in the initial proposal is a prime example. It would have penalised a continually growing group of people affected by an illness caused by intolerance to an allergen, which does not allow them a complete and balanced diet able to provide an adequate nutritional profile to ensure physical well-being. In future negotiations with the Council a cross-cutting regulation may be proposed in conjunction with regulation (EU) No 1169/2011. In this case the generic term ‘gluten-free’ must appear with the term ‘suitable for coeliacs’ to make a clear distinction between products free from allergens and those for proper nutrition.

 We all remember the extensive damage caused by the flooding in Liguria and Tuscany, which rendered thousands of homes unusable, destroyed networks and infrastructure, and led to the loss of several lives. The economic damage is extremely high. I am astonished that, faced with this emergency, the funds provided for by the Solidarity Fund have not yet been granted. The rapid intervention of the fund is, in fact, essential for its credibility, and we cannot allow mere red tape to delegitimise the instruments that we have put in place. At a time when, following the crisis, citizens are starting to lose faith in Europe, it is vital for the institutions to respond in a timely manner, especially during an emergency.

 With today’s vote, Parliament has shown once again that it fully recognises the importance of volunteering in terms of mutual intercultural enrichment, social inclusion and active citizenship. I would say that it is Europe’s duty to promote and raise the standing of this activity among our citizens. In terms of the creation of social capital and cross-border development, I must stress that by promoting volunteering, the European Union can grasp a precious opportunity to assert and give form to the solidarity and socio-economic cohesion that inspired our founding principles. To that end, I agree with the creation of a European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps and the introduction of instruments providing for greater recognition of the professional skills acquired.

 Mr President, despite the progress that Turkey has made on human rights, I regret to say that violence against women is still one of the country’s most pressing problems. The official Turkish statistics are alarming: 39% of Turkish women are victims of violence. The establishment of the Committee on Equal Opportunities within the Turkish Parliament and the Gender Equality Commission within the Ministry of Education represent a step forward. The recognition of Turkish women’s rights must be an essential part of the negotiations for accession to the European Union. They must be granted the same rights to education, access to employment and to justice that men have. I voted in favour of the report because I hope that Parliament’s requests will be accepted in full by the European Commission. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 The citizens’ initiative introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon is a tool for participatory democracy, which involves citizens in decisions and actively helps to establish the political agenda through a shared path towards stronger European integration. Being able to present the initiative in a public hearing with the direct participation of the relevant parliamentary committee helps to strengthen our dialogue with European citizens, at a particularly difficult time for the solidity of the economy and for consolidation of political Europe. The times we are living in are characterised by the development of Eurosceptic movements, which is why I believe that the initiative is an important step to bring European citizens closer, even physically, to the EU institutions. For this reason, I voted in favour of the amendment to the Rules of Procedure. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, China is an important trade partner for Europe, and I firmly believe that our relations must be strengthened, without neglecting the numerous and persistent obstacles to fair, balanced trade. A new chapter in EU-China trade relations needs to be written, based on reciprocity and compliance with the rules. It is regrettable that China continues to apply non-tariff barriers that limit European companies’ presence in the Chinese market, giving rise to additional costs without creating opportunities for trade. Non-tariff barriers, breaches of intellectual property rights and human rights abuses remain among the biggest problems to solve. I hope that cooperation with the Chinese Government will eliminate the remaining obstacles by 2016, when the World Trade Organisation is due to grant China market economy status.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Armenia is fundamental and strategic for strengthening bilateral relations in the South Caucasus. The renewal of the association agreements with the EU will be crucial in order to pave the way for strengthened regional cooperation. With the EURONEST delegation, I have had the opportunity to visit Armenia and to see for myself the progress that has begun to take place in democratically building the rule of law and respecting human rights on the basis of the partnership agreements initiated in 1999. The participation of Armenia in parliamentary cooperation with EURONEST is an excellent indication of their willingness to adhere to European values and principles, for which there is broad consensus in civil society. I voted in favour of the association agreement and I feel that Armenia should commit itself to resolving the conflict in the south so as to avoid undermining the stability of the country.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the goal of reducing CO2
 emissions by 80-95% by 2050 enables us to lay the foundations for a post-carbon European economy. It also requires us to launch a new industrial revolution based on new thinking about the system of production, involving the whole socio-economic sphere, to create better awareness of energy consumption and the efficient use of land. Research will play a key role in fully exploiting renewable energy. With firm and binding objectives, we shall be able to prepare industry for the transition while preserving its competitiveness at the global level. Europe must take pride in having set out at every level on the road to protecting the environment and combating climate change. There is no way that we can negotiate with the environment, and that is why we must insist on solutions that lead to zero emissions, and why I am convinced that nuclear energy must not form part of the energy mix. As the rapporteur for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE), I am grateful to Mr Leinen and Mr Davies for their excellent cooperation. Thank you. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the report on the European Fisheries Fund (EFF) because I believe it is necessary and should not be delayed, in order to align EFF expenditure in all the EU countries as a matter of urgency. Therefore, I agree with Mr Ferreira in asking for its application at first reading. Ms Damanaki did well to propose an urgent measure for countries with little investment capacity, as this has often been reduced to historic lows as the report shows. The debate about the reform of the common fisheries policy has already begun and therefore, EFF expenditure needs to be accelerated also by increasing the cofinancing threshold by 10%, in order to avoid there being resources from the old programming period still to be spent from the time the new reform applies. It is important to avoid overlapping between the EFF and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF). Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the progress made by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia shows its strong desire to join the European Union. It is a strategic country in the Balkan region, is involved in several European initiatives, and is giving proof of cooperation and openness. The reforms of the judicial system, administrative decentralisation and initial, if weak, signs of a willingness to discuss freedom of expression are very hopeful signs for the future. However, the following issues are still worrying: respect for human rights, corruption levels and the lack of pluralism in the media. This country still has a long way to go, and the years leading up to its entry must act as a stimulus to speed up the necessary reforms for the country’s democracy to develop. I believe in an enlarged, strong Europe, and therefore I voted in favour of the resolution. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the progress that has been made, we do have to admit, unfortunately, that women are still subject to many instances of inequality in all areas, including active participation in decision making and the political process. This is a feature of all Member States and even of this House, since women occupy just 34% of the seats here. In order to achieve equality between men and women, we must first of all remove the cultural obstacles and start to talk about gender policy. The parties themselves have got to initiate this first step towards change. Various positive measures are put forward in Ms Pietikäinen’s report, which I wholeheartedly support. These include the measures on quotas for women which, while not the ideal solution, are the only feasible approach until we see a change of culture and outlook, as I said. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, the current economic crisis, together with the austerity measures adopted in some countries, has created new social categories at risk of poverty, including young people and elderly people. Given the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, the Annual Growth Survey must ensure consistency between the various priorities in its political guidelines in order to ensure that budgetary needs are based on social justice. I agree with the rapporteur on the need to act immediately in order to improve employment conditions for categories at risk of social exclusion and to make tackling youth unemployment a priority. Future national reform plans will need to include training programmes able to develop lifelong learning and to create qualified jobs with dignified pay and conditions. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, today’s vote is a first step in the direction of economic governance in Europe, as hoped for by Mr Delors as early as 1993. The introduction of Eurobonds, which I hope will come about within a reasonable timeframe, is part of a wider process that will lead the countries in the euro area to strengthen the coordination and achieve the integration of their economic and fiscal policies. The three options indicated in the European Commission’s Green Paper propose three different types of Eurobond, with a decreasing degree of solidarity between Member States. The serious economic crisis we are currently experiencing shows that no country is safe from financial speculation. To sceptics, I say that Eurobonds are, to date, the only practical answer to reviving growth and development in Europe. This is why I voted in favour. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the hundreds of petitions to the European Parliament from various EU countries clarify the extent and severity of the waste management problem. An interesting aspect of the report is the attention paid to the disposal of illegal waste that affects many regions. In my region, as a delegation from the European Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety was able to ascertain, high levels of caesium-137 have been detected. This is typical nuclear waste even though there are no nuclear power plants in Italy. It is clear that this is a Europe-wide problem. There is illegal trafficking of waste that must be monitored and curbed, but which has so far been ignored by the European Commission. It is therefore easy to state that only a few countries, including Italy, do not apply European standards. Instead, given that illegal trafficking of waste extends beyond national borders, we need to think about how to deal with this at a European level. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, this own-initiative report highlights how crucial the issue of the supply of inputs is for the competitiveness of European agriculture. Over the last decade, European farmers have seen an intolerable increase in production costs, which is not adequately reflected in sales prices. European agricultural production still depends, to a large extent, on oil. Over the last decade, the price of oil has risen by 60%. In order to address this challenge, the new CAP must increase the use of renewable energy by implementing self-sufficient energy production in farms, using agricultural waste and so forth to feed biomass and biogas plant. This will give us sustainable agriculture and a reduction in costs. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it has not been easy to find a balanced compromise to combine the objective of greater protection for human health and the environment with a faster and more efficient authorisation system for the industrial sector. However, I would have preferred a European authorisation from the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) for new biocidal products immediately, and not in stages. That said, the centralised authorisation system will definitely have positive repercussions on the internal market, because it will allow equal application of the requisites in all the Member States. In order to streamline bureaucratic procedures for small and medium-sized enterprises and facilitate the entry of biocides onto the market, we needed to remove comparative assessment, still required for biocides that have been proven to be safe for use. This places a hefty bureaucratic burden on companies. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, of all the EU’s instruments, the ‘Intelligent Energy’ programme has been the most successful. It has funded over 500 projects, involving more than 3 000 partners – the majority of which are small and medium-sized enterprises – not to speak of the added value that the programme has given to the renewable energy and energy efficiency sector. Like my fellow Members, I am concerned about the future of the programme, which has played a central role in awareness raising actions, the exchange of good practice, and energy policy implementation in the European Union. I therefore ask the European Commission what it intends to do in order to continue the programme, as stopping it would put an end to so many hopes. To conclude, I would like to ask what the programme is for the Multiannual Financial Framework that will provide the necessary funding. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

Mr President, I can only welcome today’s report on the review of European Neighbourhood Policy and, in particular, the vital proposal to strengthen the EU’s Southern partnership, following the historic events which took place last spring, for the democratic consolidation of the area. Funds for countries on the southern shore of the Mediterranean were allocated before the crisis and, in the light of the concrete needs and modernisation of society in these countries, they seem inadequate; I think we should increase support for the instrument for civil society. I will table Parliament’s proposal to establish Euro-Mediterranean Erasmus and Leonardo programmes to the European Commission again, so as to encourage the mobility and the exchange of best practices amongst young people.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank Mr Perello Rodriguez for the excellent work which he has done. It certainly cannot have been easy for such a complex directive to manage to combine the demands of consumers with those of business, just as, to encourage free movement within the European Union, it was not easy to lay down rules on composition, manufacturing specifications and labelling of fruit juices and similar products. We are now at the second amendment of Council Directive 2001/112/EC, which has been necessary in order to continue including provisions of the Codex Alimentarius in European legislation. I am extremely satisfied and I consider the fact that we have avoided the serious risk of finding orange juice on our table which is actually a blend of oranges and mandarins, unless it has been properly labelled as such when sold, a victory both for consumers and for our market. The new changes will finally allow consumers to understand the difference between fruit juices and fruit nectars, and if the fruit nectar naturally contains sugars, then the label can state that the juice contains natural sugars. Important progress has been made, above all, with regard to nectar, and I believe that the directive is going in the right direction to help consumers make informed choices in terms of what they purchase. In Europe, the fruit juice market represents 10% of the non-alcoholic beverage market. I hope that in future, we will be able to encourage purchases of locally produced products that reflect high quality and sustainable development in agriculture in line with European food security principles. The annual demand for orange juice from European industry is estimated to be around a million tonnes, whilst internal production only provides 10% of that. It is therefore obvious that we should increase production of citrus fruits and I hope that the new CAP will include financial incentives to encourage an increase in the cultivation of citrus fruits and the associated creation of a virtuous food and agricultural supply chain to utilise fruit that cannot be used in the fresh market due to small defects or size in the production of fruit juices. This request is obviously directed at Commissioner Cioloş, who is here today. To conclude, Mr President, I believe that this directive achieves two fundamental aims: a more complete labelling system and an increase in product quality. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, with today’s vote, Parliament has laid the foundations for future discussion on the new directive which, as anticipated yesterday by Commissioner Barnier, will be presented on 13 December. I approve of the report given by the rapporteur who, in collaboration with all the rapporteurs, has managed to synthesise the view put forward last June by the Commission with the Green Paper. I feel I should underline two key elements at the heart of the report: language and training. I believe it is necessary, in particular with regard to health care professions, to introduce an accurate means of evaluation of the level of linguistic ability that should take place prior to the authorisation of allocating work, and to raise the minimum training requirements common to all Member States, with a view to ensuring ever greater security to European patients.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the last five years, gambling has spread over the whole of Europe. In Italy, according to the state monopolies, online gambling increased by 153% from 2008 to 2009, and by 29% from 2009 to 2010. These worrying figures provide evidence of the widespread impact of this phenomenon. We must consider this issue seriously. Although online gambling falls within the jurisdiction of the Member States, common actions must be established across Europe to protect vulnerable consumers and to tackle illegal gambling. The report on the initiative opens the door to actions which I hope will soon be initiated and I agree that there is a need to implement preventative measures with a view to reducing addictive behaviour. The trials taking place in some countries could set the measure for ‘best practice’ to be replicated all over Europe, with the aim of monitoring the phenomenon and promoting responsible gambling.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today’s vote has drawn attention to the beekeeping sector, which plays a crucial role in European agriculture by helping to maintain biodiversity and provides an income for around 600 000 workers in the European Union. I consider the programme launched by the European Commission for monitoring the health of honeybees to be a useful one that has the aim of identifying the reasons behind their increased mortality rate in recent years. The impact of pesticides on the health of bees must be explored in more detail. I have voted in favour of the report and I am disappointed that the reference to a correlation between some pesticides and bee mortality has not been supported, as proposed by the rapporteur. I call on the European Commission to provide greater financial aid to the beekeeping sector in the new common agricultural policy (CAP) for 2014-2020. Mario Pirillo,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the mobility of European workers is one of the pillars for full implementation of the internal market, as well as leveraging development and the economy. It is estimated that there is a need for around a million health care professionals in Europe. This means that we need a quick and efficient system for recognising qualifications, and the professional card could facilitate this process. However, in the health care sector, mobility must be combined with safeguarding and ensuring patient safety. This is the direction taken by the report voted for by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for which I was rapporteur. Mobility and patient protection must be considered two sides of the same coin. Therefore, extension of the rapid reaction mechanism to the health care professions is not only commendable, but also necessary. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I voted for Mr Tatarella’s report, which seeks to postpone by three years the entry into force of Stage IIIB for the placing on the market of more efficient tractors for the reduction of CO2
 and pollutant gases. In the case of tractors, a number of reasons led to the parameters laid down by Directive 2005/13/EC being revised: the sudden fall in sales caused by the current economic crisis and the lack of technical solutions capable of limiting CO2
 emissions. It will be particularly important to transpose the amended directive rapidly so that it may be applied without delay. I hope that the European Commission will take into account the European Parliament’s call for it to examine in advance whether the technology available will be capable of meeting the requirements of Stage IV, scheduled for 2014.

I hope that the Member States and the Commission will heed the call to prepare legislative acts that facilitate their inclusion. The Member States have not yet signed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Despite this time of economic crisis, I hope that the national governments will prove capable of protecting them by putting in place policies in line with the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020. I welcome and endorse the report tabled by Mr Kósa, who, by drawing on his own experience, has managed to give heartfelt, practical suggestions in order to offer people with disabilities non-discriminatory access to social protection and to health and education services.

 Mr President, with today’s vote, we have laid the foundations for the future revision of the Procurement Directive. Simpler bureaucratic procedures and principles for participation in public tenders are a fundamental means of speeding up implementation processes and ensuring the full realisation of contracts between public authorities and the private sector. The increased use of information and communication technologies would allow businesses and public authorities to save money and time, and would provide greater transparency and accessibility. I would like to stress that the criterion of the lowest price should no longer be the determining factor when awarding contracts: it should really be replaced by the criterion of the most economically advantageous tender, in order to draw economic, social and environmental benefits.

 Mr President, today, Europe has taken an important step in recognising the fact that organised crime is a European problem that has been underestimated for too long and traced back to local situations or individual Member States. I fully support the content of the report and hope that a legislative proposal will soon be presented, one which leads to the creation of a European anti-mafia committee able to expertly review and fight the phenomenon of organised crime through the institutions. Culture, education, development and work in Europe are defences capable of preventing criminal organisations from recruiting young people. I would like to thank Mr Crocetta, shadow rapporteur of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, who has always been at the forefront of the fight against the Mafia and who made a significant contribution to the improvement of the text.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to the many Members who have signed this oral question. The EU’s objectives in terms of the fight against climate change have resulted in the implementation of what are very demanding EU policies and measures for European industry. The target of reducing CO2
 emissions is, at present, a unilateral commitment that is exposing a large proportion of Europe’s industrial system and, in particular, its energy-intensive industries to a high risk of carbon leakage. The emission reduction targets, while worthy in their aims, should be pursued in a realistic and practical way. We are calling on the Commission to adjust the tools for applying the Emissions Trading System (ETS) and the financial compensation measures envisaged as carefully and as accurately as possible, in order to prevent any imbalances in the EU internal market. Under Directive 2003/87/EC, as amended in 2009, thermal power companies will be obliged, from 2013, to purchase allowances for all of their CO2
 emissions, which means that the increased costs will be passed on in electricity prices and hence, that production costs will rise significantly. According to Eurostat data, the ETS will cost European industry an estimated EUR 8.5 billion more each year in increased electricity prices. Indirect emissions, as opposed to direct emissions, do not benefit from a compensation system to prevent differences in treatment between industries in the same sector that have different production processes and which face obvious distortions of competition within the European Union. If an equivalent compensation system is not established for indirect emissions, there is a very great risk that companies will relocate. Choosing sectors exposed to carbon leakage on the basis of the NACE code classification system is simplistic and restrictive, since it does not allow for the specific type of energy-intensive production to be identified, with the result that compensation cannot be granted to subsectors. In the case of steel production, there are two production processes: the electric furnace and the full cycle, which uses fossil fuels and a small amount of electricity; it will receive almost all of the free allocation of allowances for direct emissions. The electric furnace process, on the other hand, will receive only 30% of the free allowances due to the lack of a compensation system for the electricity portion, even though it emits a fifth of the CO2
 produced by the full cycle. Therefore, because of the type of production process used, the same product will see its price increase in Europe. Fears of such a market imbalance have been voiced by many parties, by many industrial sectors, as can be seen from the responses to the public consultation launched by the Directorate General for Competition. How does the Commission intend to proceed with regard to State aid for energy-intensive industries, in order to ensure the continuation of European industry and to guarantee jobs and prosperity? Could the revenues from the sale of allowances not be used to offset the imbalances that will be created from 2013? Are we certain that the sale of allowances will not lead to speculation? How does the Commission intend to rectify competitive disadvantages? Mario Pirillo,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I must thank all my fellow Members, from all the political groups, who have spoken and who have strongly supported my question. I cannot say that I am satisfied, because the catch-the-eye procedure will follow, and then the Commission will speak; this makes no sense to me, and I hope that we will adapt the Rules of Procedure accordingly. I must say that I will be making this statement to the press but, if I may be so bold, I am truly disappointed by the response that the Commissioner, as the Commission’s representative, has given to my questions. I think that the Commission wants to wash its hands of this problem; it is a major problem as my fellow Members have described magnificently. I hope that the Commission will answer my questions, the questions I asked in my speech, and I hope that it will give serious consideration to this major problem that is affecting Europe: this industry that we boast about in Europe and then undervalue.

That shows how our different political ideologies have been overcome on important issues, such as this one of humanitarian aid. The principle of European solidarity among Member States in the event of a disaster is the central pillar of this report, supported by liaison and interaction initiatives within the European Union. The merging of the humanitarian aid crisis rooms is a step in that direction.

Parliament has today voted in favour of setting up a new common framework for European tourism in line with the new powers introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon. Emphasising the importance of the quality of the tourist services offered as a decisive variable in the choices made by tourists was an appropriate decision to increase the competitiveness of Europe’s tourism industry. Niche tourism – religious, spa, mountain, rural, etc. – should be encouraged through measures to improve it in terms of quality and quantity. Lastly, I hope that the harmonisation of the hospitality industry classification systems will continue so as to define unequivocal quality standards for all Member States. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

The efforts made to make the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development more favourable to small and medium-sized enterprises have not improved their participation rate. Simplification has not hit the target. As the report by Ms Matias clearly indicates, there is a need for administrative simplification and a significant reduction of financial reporting requirements.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the gas and electricity market is an instrument for driving economic growth and job creation, crucial factors in restoring the Union’s competitive edge and enabling it to overcome the crisis without delay. We must therefore prevent abuse and manipulation of the market, where monitoring and the application of penalties, along with the prohibition of insider trading, are a national responsibility. The recent introduction of the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) enables market transactions to be monitored, and the national and European registers of market participants make it possible to register transactions in wholesale energy products, thereby promoting transparency. Today’s vote, which is the result of close cooperation between the Polish Presidency, the Commission and Parliament, has laid the foundations for a more transparent market that safeguards consumer interests.

Today’s vote is a first step. I agree with the call for Member States to reflect on the role of women as care-givers. This role, if legally recognised, could create forms of official employment that make it easier for women over 50 to work. As for the pension system, I repeat the call for the Commission to introduce forms of protection to reduce the pension gap between women, who have often had to interrupt their careers in order to care for and look after their family, and men.

Better still, I hope that cooperation will be strengthened between the inspection bodies in order to establish common and independent standards at European level. I think that the proposal to establish a Mediterranean Offshore Authorities Forum is a positive one. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

Mr President, today we voted on the vexed and controversial issue of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Offering Member States the chance to prohibit or restrict the cultivation of GMOs in their territory means that the European Union will surrender its leading role on this most delicate of issues. Many questions remain to be answered. Do we know what the long-term effects will be on the ecosystem? Are we reasonably sure that the use of GMOs does not carry serious health risks? Are we sure that consumers whose government has banned their cultivation will not find themselves eating them anyway? We are a long way from any definitive answers. The only thing I know for sure is that both the Commission and the Member States should guarantee that the necessary resources will be made available for independent research, and that GMOs will not be merely a short-cut to profit.

Mr President, there is huge anticipation for the legislative proposals on the forthcoming post-2013 cohesion policy, which will be tabled in September. The Commission has already announced that this reform will see the introduction of an intermediate category, which should replace the current system of phasing in and phasing out. I am left perplexed by the implications that this new category will have, since it will also include – or at least seems to include – the regions that currently are neither converging nor competing. I should like to point out that the priority of the cohesion policy is to assist late-developing regions, and I therefore would not want the reform to damage precisely the poorest regions of Europe, which struggle to put development policies into action. I hope, however, that the new programming can give European growth a kick-start. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the idea of setting up horizontal multi-fund programmes with clearly defined aims and streamlined access mechanisms is something I fully support. I agree with Professor Barca’s report, according to which an approach based on local development is the way to improve efficiency and effectiveness and to operate in a more integrated manner. We need to focus attention on the urban dimension and to ensure coordination between the funds and the other financial instruments of the European Investment Bank (EIB) and European Investment Fund (EIF). In a situation in which the budget is tight, these instruments, together with revolving funds, would allow results to be monitored. This would multiply the available resources and increase the number of beneficiaries, which in turn would deliver more results. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, everyone is aware of the importance of the common agricultural policy and of the contribution it has made to the development of the EU and to food security. Environmental challenges and the fight against climate change mean that the post-2013 CAP now has a new role to play, for which I believe we need a stronger and more sustainable CAP equipped with a budget that can meet the objectives to be pursued, with particular attention to the development of quality food products and to the needs of small farmers. Speculation in agricultural commodities and extreme price volatility put food security at risk and require flexible measures. Possible market fluctuations must be tackled with counter-cyclical measures, which should be included in the first pillar and be capable of responding swiftly and automatically.

Mr President, today’s vote represents a marked step forward in bringing in the ‘polluter pays’ principle, including in the road haulage sector, which makes a significant contribution to atmospheric and noise pollution. Despite the criticisms of industry organisations, I think that the Council’s position is the best compromise available right now, even though I hope that improvements can be made in the future. I voted in favour. I must point out, however, that we need to identify better ways to use the revenues, making it mandatory for the Member States to invest these resources to improve the trans-European transport network (TEN-T) and infrastructure for reducing pollution. This is the only way that, in future, we will be able to say that today’s decision has had positive results. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

Mr President, research and innovation play a central role in the European Union’s development and competitiveness and they are crucial in terms of reaching the objectives set out in the Europe 2020 strategy. The Seventh Framework Programme is the main instrument for funding research in Europe, as shown by the report voted on today. However, there are still many problems being caused by excessive amounts of red tape for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). In its resolution of 11 November 2010, Parliament asked the Commission to introduce procedural, administrative and financial simplification measures into the current management of the Seventh Framework Programme, yet these measures have still not been addressed. I call upon the Commission to acknowledge Parliament’s observations and to identify solutions to make it easier for SMEs to access the seventh and eighth research programmes. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

I voted against the resolution rejecting the indication of the presence of DHA in milk substitutes for babies because I think it is right to advertise the reasons for which DHA is added. I want to mention here that DHA is an omega 3 fatty acid which is present in breast milk and has a positive effect on children’s eyesight. I would point out that the EFSA, the European Food Safety Authority, expressed a favourable opinion to extensively indicating the presence of this substance. I have not appreciated the many e-mails received indicating the belief that we want to favour artificial milk over breast milk. We must always provide adequate information on substances added to food products, especially when they are for children. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the news regarding Fukushima is increasingly worrying. Safety limits have been greatly exceeded and we do not know what will happen in the near future. There has been a lack of clear and transparent communications. Stress tests should be conducted on existing nuclear plants and if the outcome raises concern we must have the courage to call for their immediate closure. We need to introduce higher international safety standards and there should be no thought of constructing new nuclear plants. We must prepare the way for a gradual withdrawal of this type of energy which causes irreparable damage to the environment and human health. Careful thought on the development of future energy policies is essential. We must urgently develop policies that aim at energy conservation and efficiency, and increased investment in research into new technologies and renewable energy sources. Finally, we should open a debate involving citizens and local authorities. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, women have always had an important role in the agricultural and rural sector. Indeed, women account for 42% of the labour force out of a total of around 27 million workers. Despite this high percentage, women are not well represented in sector organisations and face discrimination in the decision-making process. There are many areas in which women’s circumstances could be improved, including ensuring adequate social cover. The European institutions should therefore act to balance this inequality, perhaps by monitoring the sector through an observatory for female entrepreneurialism in agriculture, as already operated in Calabria and other regions in Italy. The report voted upon today – which I supported – also takes a long hard look at the issue of the exodus from the countryside. In order to help keep employment levels steady we need support policies and strategies which are designed to build infrastructure and create services suited to the requirements of modern life, which can be implemented in rural areas.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as an elected representative from Southern Italy, I join the chorus of fellow MEPs who have preceded me in calling for appropriate action to address the critical situation faced by citizens and migrants in Lampedusa. The health and sanitation situation on the island has exceeded all limits of decency. I appeal to the sense of responsibility of the Italian Government to ensure it adopts all measures available to it, and call on the European Commission to implement the measures provided for in the EU Directive on temporary protection for immigrants. The next European Council of Ministers of the Interior, scheduled for 11 April, must take appropriate measures to ensure that neither the migrants nor the citizens of Lampedusa are left in a desperate condition. We therefore need to initiate a serious debate on the European Neighbourhood Policy which will focus on initiatives to support the path to democracy, especially in the countries of the southern shores of the Mediterranean. I congratulate Mr Provera. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over the past 15 years, the number of natural and man-made disasters has increased significantly and we see phenomena that are more severe and more frequent in almost all European Union countries with serious consequences for the economy, infrastructure and ecosystems. We need an urgent EU approach to develop preventive policies and to identify and adapt the relevant financial instruments. The European Union Solidarity Fund and national funds are no longer able to cope with frequent disasters. I would ask the Commissioner who is present when will it be possible to provide data and a map of areas at risk, as announced in his communication of 23 February 2009? I regret, finally, that the Soil Directive for the improvement of land management has been blocked for some time in the Council. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the current economic crisis has revealed serious shortcomings in the framework for monitoring the financial sector and the need to respond with new instruments and new fiscal policies. The financial system has started to generate profits from speculative transactions and it is absurd that this sector is not subject to any taxation. We need a cure, a financial transaction tax, which is why I voted in favour. For other policies such as energy or the environment, Europe has managed to be the world leader, becoming an example and a stimulus for other countries outside the European Union. I believe we should do the same for the financial system. I hope that the Commission will respond soon, presenting a legislative proposal that can meet the expectations of citizens, on whom the burden of the crisis has fallen. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, the deep international economic crisis has hit industry especially hard. The idea that the markets should regulate themselves has been proved wrong. Europe has lacked the ability to give a unified response or to perform an economic analysis. Europe therefore needs to equip itself with a solid, competitive and diversified industrial base. Europe’s new industrial policy must be able to look to the future by taking a global approach to its own policies aimed at reaffirming the core importance of industry, especially manufacturing, which must continue to be the driving force of our economy and to prompt new intelligent, sustainable and inclusive modes of growth. I endorse and congratulate Mr Lange on his report, which examines all these factors and provides some interesting food for thought. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in which bluefin tuna fishing finds itself in the Mediterranean continues to cause incalculable economic damage to fishing communities. The Italian Government adhered to the decisions of the ICCAT and reduced fishing quotas for bluefin tuna for commercial fishing vessels only, with a de facto 
increase in the quantities intended for recreational fishing, an absurd measure that penalises only fishers, who are already facing a very difficult time. In this sense, I remind you of the negative effects on the industry of failing to take the decision to grant a derogation for whitebait fishing. I hope that one outcome of the forthcoming meeting to be attended by Commissioner Damanaki, who is here today, will be that fishing for whitebait can resume in 2011, at least in certain districts, such as Schiavonea and Corigliano Calabro in Calabria, with a possibility of a review for 2012.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even today in the European Union, health inequalities still persist over access to services, treatment and social factors, and this necessitates an integrated response. The reasons for these differences are, in many cases, avoidable and unjust, because they are due to discriminatory factors such as the reduced economic capacity of individuals. I believe that reducing health inequalities should become a fundamental priority for Europe, with an approach based on ‘health in all policies’, enhancing the quality of care for all. In the coming months, the European Parliament will discuss the revision of the directive on recognition of professional qualifications. It is an appropriate opportunity to achieve an improved mechanism capable of dealing effectively with emergencies without any discrimination. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is essential for Europe to ensure a fair balance between the need to support a vital sector, in other words, the agriculture of Member States, and the need to strengthen Europe’s international trade policy. A business strategy highly focused on pursuing the dynamics of global markets would end up sacrificing the ability of the European agricultural sector to compete. This not only damages the sector economy, with serious implications for employment, but also undermines any possibility of developing our rural areas. It is necessary to defend the quality of agricultural production and impose the maintenance of equal quality standards in terms of food security, human and animal health, and welfare and social rights when drawing up trade agreements with third countries.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, everybody has said that the free trade agreement with the Republic of Korea is an institutional and strategic innovation on the part of the Union. On the contrary, it is an unbalanced agreement that will have a negative impact on the European manufacturing industry. The elimination of duties on Korean products in return for a rise in environmental and social standards in Korea cannot be considered fair. The Korean shipbuilding industry benefits from substantial state aid, which has enabled it to attain a 30% share of the world market. This means that European industry, be it automotive, textile, chemical or any other, must defend itself against competition that if not unfair in form, is unfair in fact. The introduction of the safeguard clause is an appropriate measure, but it is not sufficient to patch up the many weaknesses in the agreement. I therefore call on the European Commission to be more prudent if it really wishes to defend European economic interests. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the transition towards a low carbon economy and the achievement of the objectives set out in the climate change package mean that we need to establish rules to regulate CO2
 emissions in various sectors, including the automotive sector. I am very pleased with the negotiations, which led to an agreement with the Council to limit emissions to 147g CO2
/km by 2020. This is a realistic limit that also represents an excellent balance between environmental, social and industrial rules. I hope I also played my part in this as shadow rapporteur for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. The agreement reached takes account of the economic crisis that the sector is experiencing and also makes reasonable allowances for the difference between the passenger car sector and the light commercial vehicles sector. Just as we saw with the regulation on passenger cars, the European automotive sector will also manage to develop green, competitive and environmentally beneficial technology for light commercial vehicles. I hope it will also manage to take advantage of the environmental challenge to invest even more in innovation and research. Paolo De Castro,

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which I have the honour of chairing and for which I drafted the opinion on the interim report, clearly expressed the wish that the common agricultural policy budget should be frozen in real, not nominal terms, as proposed by the European Commission. Although this is evidently the majority position, at this sensitive point in the negotiations I am in favour of giving full support to the own-initiative report drawn up by Mr Böge and Mr Kalfin, who have done an excellent job, providing Parliament with a strong, cohesive and united negotiating position. However, I should stress that were further cuts to be made to the common agricultural policy budget, it would be very difficult to reach an agreement on reform. All of the political groups in the committee have always stressed their wish not to have a final vote on the reform reports until there is clarity on the budget question. Indeed, the budget must be equal to the challenges posed by the agriculture of the future. Paolo De Castro,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the regulation on agricultural product quality schemes, on which we will be voting tomorrow, is the second most important legislative provision in which Parliament has been fully involved under the ordinary legislative procedure for agricultural legislation. As happened with the Milk Regulation, Parliament has again managed to introduce significant amendments to improve the Commission’s proposal. I would highlight, for example, the stricter rules to protect certified products against misuse and imitation (the so-called ex officio
 rule); the new system of optional quality terms, starting with the ‘product of mountain farming’ quality term; area marks; and greater simplification in the authorisation procedures for Protected Designation of Origin (PDO), Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) and Traditional Speciality Guaranteed (TSG) products. I would also like to mention the amendment to the list in the annex, which at last makes it possible for chocolate to enjoy a protected geographical indication. Allow me to take this opportunity to greet the friends of Modica chocolate who are here in this Chamber. These are just a few of the many amendments that Parliament has successfully introduced to strengthen the prospect of leveraging quality in order to compete in the sector. This was made possible by the excellent work done by the rapporteur, Ms García Pérez, whom I thank, as well as the shadow rapporteurs and the entire Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. The only regrettable fact, as the rapporteur herself mentioned, is that Parliament has not managed to persuade the Council of the need to extend production planning, which we usefully introduced in the milk package, to all the other protected designations of origin, particularly in the ham sector. However, as has been pointed out by Mr Dorfmann, one of the shadow rapporteurs, we shall not fail to do so in the debate on the reform of the common agricultural policy, and on the single common market organisation document in particular. Paolo De Castro,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to direct your attention to the six legislative reports on alignment with the Treaty of Lisbon that we are about to vote on. They do not just address agricultural issues, but affect all of Parliament. Indeed, we risk losing the new powers that the Treaty of Lisbon has given us. The Council systematically opposes delegated acts, replacing them with implementing acts that exclude Parliament from the decision-making process. We must press on to defend Parliament’s powers. Hence, I would ask you to lend your vigorous support to the decision already reached by a huge majority in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. Paolo De Castro,  
rapporteur. 
– (IT) 
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon abolishes the old comitology system, replacing it with a two-tier structure, consisting of delegated acts which include Parliament’s and the Council’s right of veto, and implementing acts which completely exclude Parliament from each step in the approval process. The existing body of legislation therefore had to be aligned to the new legal reality. We started this exercise with the three most important regulations all of which, Mr President, I shall deal with together, and which make up the heart of the agricultural policy: the regulations on direct payments, on rural development and on the common organisation of the markets. The Commission’s proposals immediately appeared to be quite balanced and there were very few changes made by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI). In particular, as regards direct payments, delegated acts must be used in cases where the basic act is amended, and in cases where rights are conferred to farmers or reversely where negative consequences may be incurred. In addition, given the spirit of the treaty on the common agricultural policy (CAP) budget, we felt that the financial discipline process could no longer be applied without the participation of Parliament. Indeed, maintaining Article 11 unchanged, with the Council acting on a proposal from the Commission, would constitute an unacceptable continuation of the Council’s exclusive right to implement measures directly. As regards rural development, we believe that the Commission has done an accurate repartition between more general provisions establishing additional elements, and which therefore require delegated acts, and more technical elements that are very much connected with the discretion that Member States enjoy in implementing this measure, and which therefore require implementing acts. By contrast, the proposed alignment with the regulation on the common organisation of the markets has proved to be more problematic, especially on issues connected with Article 43(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The article in question provides that the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, shall adopt measures on fixing prices, levies, aid and quantitative limitations. This is an exception to paragraph 2 of the same article, which requires the ordinary legislative procedure (OLP) to be used for the common agricultural policy. As an exception, Article 43(3) needs to be interpreted restrictively, that is, only when there are provisions that do not form part of the fundamental policy decisions, which must be taken pursuant to Article 43(2) of the Treaty. We therefore believe that the Commission proposal does not interpret Article 43(3) in a sufficiently restrictive way. The task of drawing up conditions and criteria for fixing aid amounts, export refunds and minimum export prices should remain with the legislator, which means Parliament and the Council, leaving to the Commission the fixing of amounts through implementing acts. Once these three recommendations had been approved by an overwhelming majority in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, we began to negotiate with the Council and the Commission so that we could reach an agreement at first reading. The urgency was dictated by the imminent reform of the common agricultural policy, which we would not have wished to be encumbered by complex negotiations on institutional issues. Despite our willingness to negotiate, to concede something with respect to our initial position, and despite the outstanding activism first on the part of the Polish Presidency and then from the Danish Presidency, we were unable to find a compromise solution, hence the need for the committee to act efficiently and in a timely manner, on the one hand, and the new and stronger powers conferred on Parliament by the Treaty of Lisbon, on the other. The main obstacles we encountered were from the Council, which wishes to systematically and horizontally eliminate delegated acts, even where these are legally required, in order to replace them with implementing acts which completely exclude Parliament. Such a position is unacceptable to us, because it means surrendering the new prerogatives that the Treaty has assigned to us, thereby severely limiting the powers of Parliament. Another factor that made negotiations more difficult was the attitude of the Commission which, during the negotiations, moved from a position close to that of Parliament to siding with the Council’s, leaving us alone in the battle to defend the most authentic interpretation of the Treaty. We are now faced with the difficult negotiations on the reform of the common agricultural policy; we therefore decided to ask plenary to confirm the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development’s vote on alignment, so as to strengthen our position when we negotiate future agricultural policy. Indeed, only by defending the prerogatives of Parliament can we be sure to respect the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon and, at the same time, ensure that in future, the CAP is more democratic and closer to citizens. Paolo De Castro,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take advantage of this minute just to thank my colleagues for their comments and also to thank the Commissioner. We take note of the support that the Commissioner has shown today, in the hope that the difficulties of reaching an agreement with the Council on implementing acts do not turn into difficulties of reaching an agreement on common agricultural policy reform. For this reason, I appeal to the Commissioner: we are in the Lisbon era, the Council needs to understand that Parliament has new prerogatives, which it is not prepared to surrender. In tomorrow’s vote, we will be following the Commission’s approach, so we hope that the Council will, in the end, join with us on these positions. Paolo De Castro,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in its capacity as co-legislator it is essential for Parliament to know the Member States’ simulation data for the new biophysical criteria put forward by the Commission on identifying Less Favoured Areas. The lack of transparency and unwillingness to send this data to the representatives of EU citizens reveal the ongoing ignorance of Member States and the Council of the democratic revolution enshrined by the Treaty of Lisbon. Parliament is co-decider on agricultural matters and, together with the Council, we are preparing to reform the common agricultural policy. We cannot therefore accept any discrepancy in the information held by the two institutions. We must be on the same standing as the Council in order to be able to evaluate the criteria put forward by the Commission in full awareness of the facts. The Commission – I would remind the Council – will not let us have this data, as some Member States have opposed it being given to Parliament. We therefore urge the Council to appeal to the Member States for the utmost transparency and full cooperation, in the light of what is a new institutional reality. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to express my delight in the fact that we have achieved the highly important goal of extending the programme for food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Union to 2013. It has been a long and difficult process, involving the efforts of all of Parliament. Now, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have together urged the Commission to make a clear commitment to the European Parliament to pursue the programme after 2013. The statement of 6 December 2011 in which the Commission acknowledged the opposition of some Member States to a new programme must not prejudice the Commission’s right to legislative initiative as provided for by the Treaty. The Commission must take into account the strong desire on the part of the European Parliament and the vast majority of EU Member States to continue this programme. Therefore, we are pleased with the statements the Commission has made to us today. We are talking – let us reiterate this – about an instrument which allows the EU to distribute 440 000 tonnes of free food every year to over 18 million poor people and struggling families, a number which, unfortunately, also includes many children. This is why we cannot consider our political initiative to be over. Mr President, Commissioner, taking into consideration also the new global challenges, such as food security, which are making life even tougher for the disadvantaged, Parliament will do its best to ensure that differences are overcome and that the programme can continue in 2014.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the vote on opening up the tariff quota for imports of high-quality beef marks an important moment in good transatlantic relations. What is more, thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament is, for the first time, playing a fundamental role in approving this sort of decision. This fact increases the United States’ interest in and understanding of Parliament, as we saw first-hand during the meetings held with the US Congress by a delegation from our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI) last June. This agreement puts an end to a long-held, age-old dispute, thereby enabling the sanctions imposed by the US to be lifted, while also maintaining the ban on imports of meat treated with hormones so as to guarantee our own high standards on food quality and safety. For these reasons, the AGRI Committee – which I am honoured to chair – gave staunch support for the conclusion of this agreement and did not present any amendments, in the spirit of deepening transatlantic trade relations and improving dispute resolution within the framework of the World Trade Organisation. My heartfelt thanks to Ms Quisthoudt-Rowohl and to the rapporteur for our committee, Mr Lyon. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that tomorrow we will be voting on the recommendation for a second reading on the programme for the distribution of food products to the most deprived persons in the Union, which involves the continuation of this important programme until 2013. After all these months and the commitment of so many people, whom I would like to thank, starting with our rapporteur, Vice-President Siekierski and Commissioner Cioloş, we have managed to achieve this important result, which means not abandoning 18 million poor people in Europe to their fate. The European Parliament has often expressed its approval of this programme and also of its continuation after 2013. Our political initiative will therefore continue, we will not rest just with tomorrow’s vote, Mr President. In full compliance with the ruling of the Court of Justice, Europe must also be able to continue offering solidarity to the weaker members of our society in the future, particularly during these tough economic times.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the measure we are about to approve represents the culmination of a process undertaken by Europe after the 2009 crisis in order to find solutions for stabilising the market and revenues of dairy and cheese producers. The work and commitment of the European Parliament and our rapporteur Mr Nicholson, whom I must truly thank for his enormous commitment along with the shadow rapporteurs of this important report, have meant we have reached a rapid agreement on a text that improves the Commission’s proposal. An important new provision is the possibility of managing and planning the volumes of certified quality dairy products. Such a tool is even more strategically significant at a historic time of prolonged and considerable market volatility, and we will consolidate it within the new regulations on quality agricultural and food products. The new possibility of involving representatives of the trade in interprofessional organisations is very important, as it will promote and consolidate positive links between all the components of the supply chain. Today, Mr President, Commissioner, we are showing that Parliament knows how to face up to its responsibilities and work swiftly as a whole towards completion of the legislative process. This is our first testing-ground before the major challenge of the debate on reform of the common agricultural policy. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with the report by Mr Bové, whom I thank for his work, Europe is focusing decisively on establishing a legislative framework to ensure fairness and greater transparency in relations within the agri-food industry. In this field, the ideas and requests approved in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are very much to be welcomed. Higher levels of transparency in prices, the reduction of the costs of production inputs and more effective management of energy and natural resources within the industry are just a few of the most important points. Madam President, on these grounds, and taking advantage of the presence of Vice-President Tajani, I think it appropriate to recall the central point of the joint resolution on the imbalances in the food supply chain, to which my fellow Members have also referred: a European system to harmonise the length of time taken for payments in commercial transactions between agri-food producers and the distribution system. Mr Tajani, we can no longer allow distortions of competition between European producers; it is no longer acceptable to have different national legal systems that regulate deadlines for payment, contractual agreements and discounting practices differently. There is a lack of territorial homogeneity exacerbating this phase of extreme market volatility where sharp price rises are not translating into higher margins for farmers; they, on the contrary, see their incomes dropping lower and lower. Mr Tajani, we in Parliament are ready to support a legislative proposal that goes in this direction and I know of the work that you are doing with the high-level group. I therefore sincerely hope that we may soon see a legislative proposal on harmonisation of the distribution systems in Europe. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the importance of cultivating trees for the landscape and the environment is already well known and acknowledged. Different scientific studies demonstrate that trees are more capable of reducing CO2
 levels than meadows and pastures. Considering the dispositions of direct payments, which anticipate that 7% of farmed land should be set aside for ecological purposes, what, Commissioner, will happen in the case of an olive farm that already comprises within it dry-stone walls and rows of trees, and that includes centuries-old trees of important value to both the landscape and the economy? Do you not think that such farms are already sufficiently sustainable from an environmental point of view, and that the application of the required 7% indicated above would instead risk causing harm to economic sustainability and the environment, with farmers forced to cut down part of their olive grove? Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for the response. We hope that no olive trees will be cut down. I will take this opportunity to ask a quick question. Commissioner, yesterday the result on help for the destitute was important and a very important agreement was established; we can now move forward with the 2012-2013 programme, and for this I thank you. However, what I would like to know is this: will the budget remain the same, at EUR 500 million, or will it be cut? Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Sawicki, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, the food aid distribution programme for citizens at risk of poverty represents an extraordinarily important tool to sustain the most underprivileged in our society, an instrument that has been a success for the common agricultural policy in recent years and which enables the Union to distribute 440 000 tonnes of free food each year to over 18 million poor people and families in difficulty. This number unfortunately includes many children and looks set to rise at a time when access to food is defined as a fundamental right. We therefore cannot but express incomprehension and opposition when faced with the blocking minority in favour of cutting aid which has emerged within the Council of Ministers for Agriculture. We are aware of the Court of Justice’s ruling and we will work to ensure that from 2013 there will be a text which will, of course, take account of the Court’s comments, but we certainly cannot allow this programme to be interrupted. I believe that, while Europe is today discussing a EUR 500 million programme of aid to its internal population, in the United States for over 40 years the US ‘Fair Deal’ law has been providing aid to the US population with a programme worth more than USD 20 billion. I would therefore argue that we must all redouble our efforts and in this respect I would like to thank the Polish Presidency and Mr Sawicki, and to commend Mr Cioloş, who has taken this matter to heart with courage and determination. We must find a solution. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report on information to consumers allows Europe to take a new and important step towards achieving its specific objective of protecting consumer rights. I would like to thank Mrs Sommer for this, and all the shadow rapporteurs, in particular the shadow rapporteur from my group, Glenis Willmott. While it may be true that Europe can look to the future with more confidence now that the instruments for food protection and transparency have been made more effective, it is also true that the agreement in second reading redefines, albeit in part, what this House approved at first reading. For example, we would have expected more, Madam President, on origin labelling for foodstuffs. The obligation to indicate the origin of all meat, given to us in the new paragraph 25, is a significant change that meets the expectations of large numbers of European consumers. At the same time, we have to underline its less ambitious approach with regard to the introduction of mandatory labelling for all fresh agricultural products and single-ingredient processed foods, which this House had approved. Meat labelling in Annex XI excludes some important products that require an equal level of protection, such as rabbit meat, which for some reason has been excluded. However, the way forward in food transparency has been shown, and we now need to pursue it with the same commitment and responsibility that have brought us this far. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, fifteen years after the emergence of BSE, we should take stock of the implementation and prospects of the European legislative framework and the relative checks carried out on feed and food. As the rapporteur has said, figures show that the number of cases testing positive in the European Union has fallen from over 2 100 cases in 2001 to just over 65 cases in 2009, and in the light of this declining epidemiological trend we can conclude that the legislation implemented helped to eradicate BSE. This is why the report we are about to vote on is an important opportunity to show commitment and responsibility in moving towards aligning legal provisions with the actual situation in terms of risk. One good signal in this regard is the review of the ban on using animal meal in feed. The period of panic having passed, scientific progress shows that the time is now ripe for reviewing the ban on feeding non-ruminants with processed animal protein. This is an important new factor, and one which, in full compliance with food safety rules, is of strategic importance, particularly in light of the EU’s current protein deficit. At the same time, it is naturally important not to lower our guard in terms of checks and monitoring. We need to make sure we do not threaten the extraordinary progress Europe has made in consumer and animal health protection. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Dess report marks the beginning of a new phase in the common agricultural policy (CAP) reform process. It is the result of several months’ hard work by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, for which I would like to thank Mr Dess and all the shadow rapporteurs and parliamentary groups. Today this House can give a clear opinion on the future of the common agricultural policy: it must be a robust, simple, flexible and greener CAP that takes young people and employment into account. That, Commissioner, is why we are worried by the news in the press today about budget cuts, especially in the second pillar. That would be incompatible with both the Dess report and the report on the European Union’s financial perspective by Mr Garriga Polledo, which we adopted in plenary in recent weeks. The latter report introduced the important principle for the CAP of maintaining the current level of funding in the next financial programming period. Therefore, Commissioner, we would like some clarification about the news that has been circulated, and we would like to know whether as far as you are concerned there are different guidelines from what we have been told up to now.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we have an important chance to tackle the growing problem of antibiotic resistance in animals responsibly and with commitment. This is a strategic issue for the agriculture sector and, in particular, for the future of the European animal husbandry system. The data show that around 50% of the antibiotics in Europe are prescribed for animal use. If used properly, antibiotics are a useful tool that helps farmers keep their livestock healthy and productive and safeguard its welfare. Therefore, we are not here to demonise antibiotic use in animal husbandry, but we want to ask the Commission to provide a concrete response for the more efficient and effective use of antibiotics, in order to reduce resistance in animals. In our resolution of 5 May 2010 on the EU Action Plan for Animal Welfare, this House underlined the link between animal welfare, animal health and public health, and urged the Commission and the Member States to address the difficult problem of antibiotic resistance in animals in a responsible manner. In particular, we called on the Commission to collect and analyse data on the use of all animal health products, including antibiotics, with a view to ensuring the effective use of such products. A year later, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which I have the honour to chair, is here to ask the Commission to implement all relevant initiatives to resolve this long-standing problem, which can also have consequences for human health. What is needed, Madam President and Commissioner, is a tangible commitment from the Commission that it will use the data collected to put the results obtained into practice, not only encouraging research and monitoring activities, but also ensuring more effective use of antibiotics as an important tool for fighting animal diseases. On that front, I would point out that some studies show that low-energy animal feed could lead to a higher incidence of diseases and, hence, more antibiotic use. It would therefore be desirable to review the ban on the use of animal meal for non-ruminants, in line with the opinion of the European Scientific Veterinary Committee. These are the requests made in the resolution adopted in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on 12 April this year and which will be put to the vote in this Chamber tomorrow. It has been hard work for the last few months, and for that reason I would like to personally thank Mrs Paulsen, the shadow rapporteurs and all the parliamentary groups for their invaluable contributions to establishing a common text on this issue. The future competitiveness of European animal husbandry may depend on how this problem is managed, and its cross-cutting nature calls for commitment and responsibility, through a coordinated approach and a shared political will.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank Mr Wojciechowski and all the shadow rapporteurs for the work carried out on this report, which aims to make the rules on vaccination against bluetongue more flexible. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has made every effort to approve the text as a matter of urgency in order to allow the vaccination campaign to go ahead before the summer. The European Commission had presented a proposal which did not take into account the approval of the Treaty of Lisbon. In other words, it left decision-making power solely with the Council, totally excluding Parliament. After intense discussions, for which I would like to thank Parliament’s Legal Service and the secretariat of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, we managed to reach an agreement to change the legal basis, in accordance with Article 43(2) of the Treaty; in other words, within the framework of the ordinary legislative procedure. Now we expect the Council to be equally efficient in accepting our position and including the correlation tables, in order to give a prompt response to European livestock farmers. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the petition under discussion today has arrived at a time when Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and its Committee on International Trade are debating the new chapter on agriculture in the agreement with Morocco. The European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) confirms that there have been irregularities in the calculation of duties on tomato imports and that this has been damaging to European producers, the very same producers who are expressing their concern at the expected increase in tomato and fruit and vegetable imports in general that will take place if the agreement is signed. We are obviously sensitive to the concerns brought about by bilateral agreements where the agricultural element is often sacrificed for the sake of broader industrial interests. It is not a good way to proceed, and we will continue to repeat this to the European Commission. However, I would like to point out that the current economic and political crisis throughout the Maghreb area should lead us to consider this agreement carefully and with greater solidarity. Paolo De Castro,  
Chair of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to speak briefly just to underline the importance of the Wojciechowski report on bluetongue for an institutional issue which concerns us all. As far as the content is concerned, there is no conflict between the Commission, Parliament and the Council. However, the inclusion of the correlation tables in the text remains a very sensitive issue. Despite the fact that the Council was totally opposed to it, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development decided to vote for a text that includes the correlation tables, which oblige Member States to report on transposition of the directive. It is now up to the Council to decide whether to accept the correlation tables and conclude the agreement at first reading, or to answer to European farmers for causing the bluetongue vaccination campaign to be missed this year in order not to give way on this point. I believe that this report can act as a precedent in future negotiations with the Council. We must be united and determined in calling for maximum transparency from Member States and in defending total compliance with EU law. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, social tensions, such as the recent ones in North Africa, are almost always triggered by rising food prices. The record increase in the prices of cereals, sugar and vegetable oils is a clear sign of the increasing imbalance between global supply and demand. A further – sadly possible – rise in prices would have dramatic consequences particularly for those parts of the world where food expenditure accounts for more than 40% of per capita income. It also poses a real risk of creating tensions throughout the entire planet in an increasingly interdependent world economy. The European Union must therefore have a clear awareness that agricultural policies – the common agricultural policy for the European Union and the Farm Bill for the United States – have a role of extraordinary and strategic importance to play in the world order, a role that goes far beyond the legitimate protection of farmers’ incomes. We need, Madam President, a new global food policy capable of coordinating agricultural policies at international level. Personally I hope that the forthcoming G20 summit will be an opportunity to actually embark on this new path. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should also like to thank Commissioner Dalli for coming to the Chamber today to report on this case, which is a source of great concern for European consumers. Next week, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which I have the honour of chairing, will also meet to look further into the debate on the consequences of this serious episode. Despite the fact that Europe is very much committed to food safety, further efforts in terms of transparency and checks are needed in order to avoid further cases of food contamination. I would note that last year, Parliament adopted an own-initiative report on agricultural product quality and, above all, that this Chamber adopted the regulation on the provision of food information to consumers at first reading, introducing obligatory marking of the place of origin of agricultural products on labels. Unfortunately, this important development stalled on 8 December in the Health Council. We shall try to reintroduce it at second reading, because it is an important objective for protection and transparency in favour of European consumers. Parliament is therefore moving in the right direction, showing that it is on the side of consumers. We hope that the Council and the Commission adopt a similar attitude. Paolo De Castro,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today represents an important opportunity to discuss the strategic issue of protecting animal welfare in agriculture. On 1 January 2012, the terms of Council Directive 1999/74/EC will enter into force, laying down minimum standards for the protection of hens, tantamount to the abolition of conventional battery cages as a system of rearing for the production of eggs. This method of animal housing will be banned in favour of systems of rearing that guarantee better animal welfare. Mr President, the memory of the Council of the European Union on Agriculture, held on 19 July 1999, is fresh in my mind. It was an important day, on which, as the representative of my country (at the time I was the Italian Minister for Agriculture), I contributed to the approval of this important directive by voting for it. Now, one year after the irrevocable entry into force of the new legislation, data show that European producers are proceeding to adapt their production system, but not without running into difficulties. What we need is a concrete commitment from the Commission to safeguard animal welfare, to protect producers who have adapted their system of rearing to Council Directive 1999/74/EC, and, at the same time, to effectively guarantee the passage of the new legislation, avoiding distortions in terms of market competition. This is why my fellow Members and I felt it appropriate to add this important topic to the agenda of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which I have the honour of chairing. Hard work over recent months, involving all parliamentary groups, resulted in the oral question of 28 October 2010, which puts three important issues to the Commission: Firstly, to report on the implementation of the new legislation within the Member States; Secondly, the actions to be taken in the Member States to guarantee compliance with the terms of the directive, and compromising where necessary with those undertakings that show a genuine desire to adapt. Lastly, measures and guarantees to be adopted to avoid crises in the egg market in the coming years and to prevent unfair competition from third countries that are not obliged to respect the European Union directive within the European internal market. These are the queries to which we are awaiting concrete and definitive responses from the Commission. Lastly, we ask the Commissioner to guarantee a more transparent market, along the lines of the concept of so-called reciprocity of rules, in order to facilitate the prospect of greater international convergence on the animal welfare standards applied by the European Union. Attending to this matter, which we have discussed a number of times in committee since the start of the legislature, is essential to prevent Europe’s efforts on animal welfare – our efforts, Commissioner – from being rendered useless by a market that is incapable of recognising the social values that are bound up in foodstuffs. We need to reduce the distorting effects of the possibility that producers outside the European rules system could translate the lesser restrictions they are subject to into greater competitive advantages. Mr President, adopting the motion for a resolution on the welfare of laying hens, which we will vote on this morning, could represent a first and important step in this direction. Paolo De Castro,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as Chair of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I am deeply disappointed for several reasons with the contents of Mr Szájer’s report, which is being voted on tomorrow. Firstly, none the amendments voted for by my committee unanimously – and I stress, unanimously – were taken into account, even though the common agricultural policy is one of the policies with the most acts adopted under the comitology procedure and is therefore one of the ones most affected by the adaptation of legislative acts under the Treaty of Lisbon. Secondly, under the text of Article 10, the European Parliament will have no power to exert pressure nor a margin to negotiate with Council over the adaptation of CAP legislation to the new treaty. We are aware, in fact, that the Council has already demonstrated its unwillingness to agree acts delegated to the European Parliament and, with the adoption of this Regulation, the Council will not have any interest in proceeding with negotiations because the automatic adaptation – which excludes delegated acts and only covers implementing acts – has no deadline because it is transitional. For this reason, together with other fellow Members, I tabled an amendment that makes the automatic alignment genuinely temporary and I call on you all to support it in order to reinforce the role of the European Parliament. There is no reason, in fact, to come to an agreement at first reading over such a sensitive file that sets the rules for implementing the treaty for the coming years. This is the reason why, for this all-important file, we have the right – I would even go so far as to say the duty – to improve the text as much as possible and therefore proceed to a second reading without giving in to blackmail by the Council, which is threatening not to move on this file in order to force us to accept this negative agreement. After the budget, I think this is the most important file we have to vote on, because it redraws the balance of power between the European institutions. Here in this Chamber, we must vigorously defend the prerogatives of Parliament, which has been democratically elected and represents all European citizens. Paolo De Castro,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution we are about to vote on represents the view of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the European beekeeping support policy. As is normal practice for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, this important paper has benefited from the participation of all the parliamentary groups, who have added their valuable contribution to the end result. Despite the recent increase in the annual budget for measures to improve the general conditions for production and marketing of bee products, a widespread concern persists with regard to the numerous challenges and problems that beekeeping will have to face in the near future. Difficult production and marketing conditions, strong and prolonged price volatility and difficulties emerging from the increasingly widespread mortality of bee stocks are some of the critical factors that afflict one of the most important sectors of European agriculture. Like all other primary sector operators, European beekeepers must be put in a position where they can plan their own affairs. Since the current support depends on European agricultural policy implementation procedures in force at present, the future of this policy after 2013 is uncertain. This is the background to today’s resolution, whereby we intend to call on the Commission to make an active commitment to defend beekeeping. The main demands to the Commission contained in the motion for a resolution include the following: a specific undertaking after the expiry of national programmes, also in view of new challenges and problems in the sector, namely bee mortality, price volatility etc.; a commitment to the necessary improvement in statistical measurements, for more effective control of non-EU honey imports and research development; a strengthening of the role of European veterinary policy; an action plan to tackle the phenomenon of widespread bee mortality, partly through specific undertakings in the field of research; greater financial support in the field of operator training and education and, lastly, a revitalised role as a leading player for the beekeeping sector within the common agricultural policy after 2013. In thanking Mrs Lulling and all my fellow MEPs for the common work carried out, I would like to remind you, Madam President, Commissioner, that the International Year of Biodiversity is about to end. This is why we hope that approval of the resolution will definitely mark the start of the road to relaunch a sector that is particularly strategic from the viewpoint of environmental sustainability and maintenance of biodiversity, as well as in terms of economic and social impact.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are here today to call on the Commission to implement suitable efficient and flexible market instruments to combat the crisis into which the European livestock sector has plunged. We hope that the proposal that the Commission will shortly present on market instruments for the milk and dairy sector will also include proposals to limit the impact of price volatility on the agricultural sector as a whole. Many actions can still be deployed to send out a strong signal to European livestock breeders. We believe, for example, that it would be very useful to the livestock sector to review the current ban on the use of animal meal for non-ruminants, for example, for the avian and fisheries sectors. As you know, this ban was introduced following cases of BSE but now, a few years on, the scientific community agrees in stating that the ban can only be justified for ruminants. In the case of non-ruminants, conversely, there is no danger to human health and the environment and we therefore hope that this ban may be overturned with the aim of offering these animals a greater possibility of higher-energy diets.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after a year and a half of difficult negotiations between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, we have at last arrived at a compromise text in the sensitive dossier on animal experimentation. It has been difficult work and I should like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Jeggle, and our shadow rapporteurs, for having carried out such intense negotiations. The text was adopted unopposed, with only 4 abstentions, by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which it is my honour to chair. It achieves a good balance between the need to improve the welfare of animals used in experiments and the need to allow for progress in medical research. The proposal aims to examine and improve the 1986 directive, which is now obsolete, and harmonise European regulations on the subject. Animal experimentation is a particularly sensitive topic for all of us as well as for the general public, but I can say with conviction, ladies and gentlemen, that the text on which we are about to vote is reasonable and the outcome of serious, meticulous work. It is a definite improvement on the existing legislation in terms of animal protection while, at the same time, it does not lose sight of our moral responsibility to advance medical research. Paolo De Castro,  
Chair of the AGRI Committee.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as chair of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which is the relevant committee for this topic, I am against referring back the Jeggle report. After more than a year and a half of intense debate, our committee has already come out quite clearly in favour of the compromise reached on the common position, without any votes against and only a few abstentions. I therefore see no reason for re-examining the text: we already have everything we need to vote on it today. Paolo De Castro,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Jordan River is a major asset of not only environmental, but also agricultural and economic significance for Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian Territories, and the degradation it is suffering cannot fail to worry us. It is important to point out that roughly 98% of the 1.3 billion cubic metres of natural fresh water in the lower course of the river is diverted away every year, and long stretches of the river are at risk of running dry. This is devastating not only in terms of biodiversity, but above all in terms of local communities’ access to sources of water. Several international actors, including the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly and the United States Senate, have addressed the situation of profound degradation of the Jordan River. We, too, must demand intervention, not only from the local governments and authorities, but also from the Council, the Commission and the Member States, to provide technical and financial assistance for the rehabilitation of the river. In particular – as stated in the joint resolution signed by all the political groups, whom I thank for their wholehearted support – we must ask the Commission to insert a clear, specific reference to this project in the action plans of the neighbourhood policy with Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority. An initial step could be to set up a joint study on the situation of the Jordan River. We are well aware that water is a precious, inalienable asset, so I would like to point out that distributing the water fairly means paying equal attention to the demands of all the communities in the region. This is a matter of supreme importance if we want to achieve lasting peace and stability in the Middle East. We have been watching the resumption of peace negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians in recent days with some hope, as these negotiations have identified water resource management as one of their essential points. We hope that the governments, local communities and civil society organisations in the countries and territories involved will begin to cooperate effectively as soon as possible in order to save the lower Jordan. This is a duty not only because of the high symbolic value of this river but, above all, in order to improve the living conditions of the local communities. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over the next few years the challenges accompanying the development of the European agricultural system will be huge: the growing demand for food will have to be met through the sustainable use of natural resources, with a parallel increase in the level of environmental performance. This outlook, which strengthens the relationship between the agricultural sector and the production of public goods, gives agriculture a new strategic importance: the creation of the future common agricultural policy (CAP) today represents the solution to these major challenges facing our society, and the policy will play a crucial role in responding to what is already a food crisis. Therefore, it is a case of producing more while polluting less: this is the difficult objective that European agriculture will have to fulfil over the next few years. Based on these assumptions, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which I have the honour of chairing, has produced an intense and concise piece of work – which Mr Lyon, with the involvement of all the groups, has overseen in an excellent fashion – in the shape of the report presented to Parliament today. It is a report that we are convinced will help lay the foundations of the future CAP and will provide the European Commission with some clear pointers so that it can prepare the year-end communication on the future of the CAP after 2013.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a new phase of reflection has opened in Europe today on the issue of quality, which is intended not only as a guarantee for consumers but, above all, as a stimulus for our producers to be more competitive in a market that is far larger and far more competitive. Our businesses need to gain market recognition of the distinctive and quality-related aspects associated with their products. In this sense, as Mr Scottà’s report intends – and I, too, thank him for my part – we are making progress in guaranteeing, first of all, more information on the origin, composition and characteristics of production processes. At the same time, Commissioner, it is fundamental that European regulations allow organisations designated for the protection and promotion of quality products to plan their product supply and to adapt their production potential to market needs on the basis of fair and non-discriminatory principles. We hope that the approval of this report will signal the definitive establishment of quality as the lynchpin of the European strategy for the agri-food sector, and that the Commission will seriously consider our committee’s proposals, so that one of the principal strong points of European agriculture can be transformed into a precious competitive advantage. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT) 
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I must express my sincere regret, and that of the entire Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which I have the honour of chairing, that no reference whatsoever has been made to the agri-food sector in the 2020 strategy. It is absurd that the Commission’s proposed strategy for the next 10 years does not include the central issue of the challenge relating to food security, growth and job retention in rural areas. Madam President, how can one conceive of a green and sustainable Europe without taking into account that 45% of all European territory is managed by farmers? How can one fail to take into account the nearly 30 million people who work on that territory? These are workers who must be safeguarded and protected. Before we focus on new jobs, we must protect the existing ones. I would remind you that agriculture provides a whole host of essential services relating to, among other things, food, biodiversity, the landscape and the environment, and these are tasks that are performed for the sake of the social and economic life of rural areas. The Spanish Presidency has also insisted strongly on the need for a powerful common agricultural policy. I am therefore concerned about this very serious omission, which I hope Parliament will be able to put right. Paolo De Castro,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, here we are once again discussing the crisis in the agricultural sector. In recent months, Parliament has spoken several times on the difficulties that have seriously beset the milk sector, and asked the Commission and the Council to take urgent action. We have achieved results, albeit only partial results, but on the basis of these initiatives, a special fund of EUR 300 million has been made available to deal with the emergency. However, we must now take note that the crisis that has affected the dairy farming sector is rapidly extending to other sectors of European agriculture, with the wheat, olive oil and fruit and vegetable markets showing alarming signs, as Mrs Fischer Boel has just said. As for milk, we are facing a cyclical phenomenon that goes hand in hand with the difficult economic situation that has inevitably resulted in a fall in demand and in the ensuing stagnation of the markets. This crisis is starting to take on a decidedly worrying dimension, as demonstrated by the numerous protests led by farmers in many regions of Europe. These are symptomatic of a pressing and alarming situation and of widespread concern for the future of the sector as a whole. That is why, at the last meeting of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on 1 December, we decided unanimously to invite the Commission to the House to report to us on the status of the crisis faced by our agriculture and the trends that the various productive sectors are going through. On this front we expect, first of all, the Commission to make use of all the measures at its disposal to stabilise the market and to stimulate the recovery of consumption but, at the same time, we believe that this opportunity should also be seized upon to look to the future, and help guarantee that the common agricultural policy will continue to be an important European policy, which will look after the interests of all citizens and all European regions, from northern Sweden to southern Cyprus. Farmers expect immediate answers, and today we are here to accept responsibility to speed things up, to tackle the crisis in a decisive manner, and to put the lessons of recent experiences to good use, thus avoiding wasting time and quickly remedying a situation that is in danger of becoming even worse. We would like to receive an answer and also news from the Commission in this regard. Paolo De Castro,  
Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, here we are once again discussing the crisis in the milk sector. The dramatic nature of this crisis continues to concern us, just as European farmers continue to express their hardship and voice their fears for the future. Parliament has already expressed its views on this matter, both by adopting a resolution with our proposals and by adopting the Commission proposal to extend the intervention period for milk powder and butter, to which we added the request for the measure on the private storage of cheese. At that time, we pointed out that the measures proposed by the Commission did not go nearly far enough. We now have to decide whether or not to allow the urgent procedure for the extension of Article 186 of the single CMO Regulation to the dairy sector, namely the possibility for the Commission to decide, in the event of a market crisis, to implement emergency measures without going through the normal procedure in Parliament. Yesterday evening, an extraordinary meeting of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development was held to discuss this, with Mrs Fischer Boel attending. Firstly I, and the committee which it is my honour to chair, would like to thank the Commissioner for coming to us in Parliament right at the end of the Agricultural Council which was held in Luxembourg. This gesture was one of great attentiveness which we appreciated. Yesterday evening, the debate was very spirited, Mr President, and our fellow Members voiced a lot of criticism. First of all, it was pointed out that the Commission was very slow to act, and did not adequately grasp the seriousness of the crisis under way. Then the objection was raised that Article 186 deprives Parliament of its decision-making prerogatives, thereby giving carte blanche to the Commission. It was also said that the Commission should have made more funds available to tackle the crisis. These are legitimate concerns which we agree with in part. Nevertheless, Mr President, I feel compelled to admit that the Commission has made considerable efforts and progress, showing that it takes Parliament’s opinion and wishes seriously. It has explained how it intends to use a fund of EUR 280 million – which, I would remind you, we will be voting on this Thursday in the context of approval of the 2010 budget – and set out some of the measures it will implement, such as the private storage of cheese and raising the ceiling of de minimis
 aid from EUR 7 500 to EUR 15 000, as requested in our resolution which was adopted in September. Although I am aware that all this still does not go far enough, I nevertheless believe, Mr President, that today we should vote in favour of the urgent procedure. European farmers expect immediate answers and too much time has already been wasted. Today we must take responsibility for speeding things up in order to face the crisis head on. Let us show, ladies and gentlemen, the same responsibility which pervades our preparations for the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon with codecision in agricultural matters. Paolo De Castro,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Mrs Fischer Boel, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to take the opportunity to say how pleased I am at the responsibility shown this morning by the House when it adopted the urgent procedure to include the dairy sector under Article 186 of the single CMO Regulation, along with many other agricultural products. The rapid extension to this sector of the rules governing intervention in the event of market crisis enables us to provide a significant response at an extremely difficult time for farming as a whole and the dairy sector in particular. At this point, we expect the European Commission to take onboard, as Mrs Fischer Boel just said, Parliament’s requests, which have pointed out several times that the measures taken until now have proved to be inadequate given the seriousness of the current crisis. Parliament’s openness towards the Commission today should not be interpreted as full delegation with unrestricted powers, but as a gesture of responsibility in a dramatic and wholly exceptional situation. I am keen to stress that in this regard, Parliament considers it essential to be involved at every stage of the decision-making process in order to guarantee democratic scrutiny, and this is why we believe that the Commission should notify Parliament in advance of how it will actually use these new powers conferred under Article 186 for the milk sector as well.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 2 October was a great day for Europe thanks to the Irish who voted in favour of the Treaty of Lisbon. The entry into force of codecision will be a veritable democratic revolution for the common agricultural policy in particular. Parliament will finally have decision-making powers equal to those of the Council of Agricultural Ministers, thanks to the agreement of the Irish and the favourable votes received in the national parliaments, including the Czech Parliament. Any delay would create problems for farmers throughout the Member States. In fact, the agricultural sector is going through one of its most delicate and difficult times of recent years, with a fall in the prices of most products, and not just of dairy products, as we have seen these last few days. As we await the formal entry into force of the Treaty, we expect the Council and the Commission, Mr President, to give careful consideration as from today to the decisions taken by Parliament – which was democratically elected by all European citizens – regarding agricultural matters too, starting with measures to address the crisis in the dairy sector.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the dairy farming sector is going through one of the deepest and most serious crises of the last few decades: the fall in the price of milk and the more general crisis in the dairy farming market have now become a source of concern throughout Europe. This is a cyclical crisis, caused by the difficult economic situation, which has led to a decline in milk consumption and created stagnant markets, with the prices paid to producers in free fall. The prices paid to milk producers have plummeted everywhere, averaging 24 cents per litre within the European Union. Many economic operators are in an even more serious situation, as they get prices of less than 20-21 cents, when their production costs come to at least 40 cents per litre. Other markets, such as the cereal, olive oil and fruit and vegetable markets, are showing some alarming signs too. On this front, first of all, we should continue to make use of all the measures at our disposal so as to stabilise the market and to stimulate an upturn in consumption, but at the same time we need to be able to look to the future with medium- and long-term policies and to do everything possible to identify acceptable and lasting solutions aimed at minimising the risk of price fluctuations. In this context the Commission proposals extending the intervention period for butter and skimmed milk powder have been welcomed and accepted within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, as the unanimous vote of 2 September demonstrates. We believe, however, that these proposals are not enough to mitigate the serious consequences of the crisis in the sector. That is why, still in relation to the adoption of the European Commission’s proposal, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has adopted an amendment to my proposal that also reintroduces aid for private storage of cheese, which was abolished under the health check on the common agricultural policy in November 2008. This was a unanimous decision, Madam President, Commissioner, representing what are, in essence, identical views shared by the members of the Committee on Agriculture, which I have the honour of chairing, and expressing our desire to send out a strong signal to the Council and the Commission at a sensitive time for an extremely important sector for European agriculture. As well as being a first important demonstration of the positive leadership that we as the European Parliament want to provide when looking ahead to codecision in agricultural matters too, this is a measure that can also offer immediate help to dairy farmers, who are grappling with an increasingly difficult market and with an obvious and dramatic fall in sales. However, these initial measures, on which we will vote today, are not enough to support the producers in crisis, and that is why the Committee on Agriculture, through an oral question and a resolution on which we are preparing to vote, is calling on the European Commission to introduce new and effective measures to combat the crisis and to support the sector. We want to encourage and at the same time support the European Commission in the process of deciding what must be done to end the crisis in the European dairy farming sector once and for all. In this sense we hope that the Commission will provide an exhaustive answer to our questions and will take our proposals seriously, so that interinstitutional cooperation produces the results that European agriculture deserves and shows its solidarity by offering practical support to European farmers in crisis, who need our help today.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank the Commission for deciding to come here to Parliament today to present new proposals on the crisis in the dairy farming sector. It is important for the parliamentary term that has just begun to be characterised by an interinstitutional dialogue between the Commission and Parliament, a positive dialogue, which has in fact already launched the codecision process. We will assess your new proposals very carefully, Commissioner, and it will be my job to ask the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to issue an opinion on the new ideas immediately, without delay. May I conclude, however, by pointing out that, if the amendment adopted unanimously within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is also adopted by this House in plenary, it will become a political problem if the Council, after the ratification of Lisbon, should then vote it down. I therefore invite you, and the Council, to give it serious consideration. Rita Borsellino,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is an emotional moment for me as I come to present my own-initiative report on the European Union’s internal security strategy. It is, in fact, 20 years ago this week – on 23 May to be precise – that Judge Giovanni Falcone, his wife and his police escort were murdered. I would like to dedicate the adoption of this report to all the victims of mafias, organised crime and terrorism, and, in particular, to Melissa Bassi, the young victim of last Saturday’s attack on a school in Brindisi, in which six other girls were also wounded. The motive for the attack is still unknown, but it clearly comes within the context of growing tension and lack of security caused by the crisis, which organisations or individuals may be tempted to exploit for violently subversive ends. My thoughts also go out to the victims of the earthquake in Emilia Romagna, because natural disasters also come within the Union’s internal security remit. The text that we will vote on tomorrow highlights the importance of having a consistent security strategy for the Union, and in that respect I would like to thank the Commission for the major effort it has made in drafting this strategy. As is repeatedly shown in the report, security must always be pursued in accordance with the rule of law and people’s fundamental rights, which form an integral and inseparable part of this strategy. That is also why the role of the EU institutions in defining and implementing the strategy is of particular importance, especially in the post-Lisbon context. The European Parliament also needs to play an appropriate role in this context, both in setting priorities for the strategy and during the evaluation stage. This role derives from the fully-fledged legislative powers that Parliament has acquired in matters of security. It is also essential for ensuring proper democratic control, which the European Parliament should exercise alongside the national parliaments. That is why we will undertake to establish regular links between the European Parliament and the national parliaments, so as to create a parliamentary political round associated with the Commission’s annual report on this subject and ending with an annual parliamentary report on the implementation status of the internal security strategy. We believe the Union needs to have a clear idea of the extent of the threats to internal security, which it currently does not have. We therefore call on Europol, with the support of the other EU institutions and agencies, to conduct a global analysis of the threats facing the Union, on the basis of a more transparent and robust methodology and relying on information contributed by the Member States. In relation to the five key objectives identified by the Commission, we are of the opinion that they are not exhaustive and that the order of priorities could probably have been better structured. The fight against terrorism, organised crime and mafias is, and must remain, a key priority within the internal security strategy. The Union must know not only how to react to whatever happens in Europe, but also how to prevent and interpret it. That has been shown by the events in Utøya and now again in Brindisi. We need to be able to recognise the early signs of violent radicalisation, barbarisation of the social milieu and violent extremism. Judicial cooperation is the main element lacking in the security strategy outlined by the Commission, and this gap needs to be filled. Joint action by judicial systems across Europe is crucial if we are to clamp down on crime and terrorism; strengthening such action must be prioritised, as must fighting corruption and combating environmental, economic and corporate crime. While we agree with the emphasis placed on fighting cybercrime, the Commission’s decision to include the protection of intellectual property rights among our security priorities hardly seems justified. As the issue of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement shows, this topic is not just a security matter but is highly complex and involves people’s rights, and therefore it requires a more thorough debate. I would like to finish by thanking all the shadow rapporteurs who played a part in drafting this report, as well as the staff of the political groups and my personal assistant. Rita Borsellino,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I was part of the European Parliament delegation that visited Sicily in November last year. The head of our delegation, Ms Wikström, wrote to the Italian Minister for the Interior, Ms Cancellieri, and has received a reply that is clear enough. I should like to put on record first of all that since our visit, there has been a change of government in Italy, and there has also been a change of approach to the situation. However, the situation itself in the countries from which the flow of migrants largely originates has also changed. This is why we must not shirk from the need for a close examination of what has happened or of the situation as it is now. The most important fact, still an issue, is Lampedusa’s status as an unsafe port with the closure of the Contrada Imbraciola emergency assistance and reception centre following the fire in September 2011 in which it was damaged. However, the damage was only partial: a dormitory was wrecked and one of the facility’s seven buildings was damaged, followed by the effective termination of the Presidium project. Now, apart from the consideration that the only unsafe port in the Mediterranean was Tripoli in the Gaddafi era – and this analogy does not seem flattering to me – and given that the migration flows have certainly not come to an end, even though they have notably lessened both in numbers and for seasonal reasons, it is important that there should be a functioning emergency assistance and reception facility, and that it should be located at Lampedusa, which is the first landing point for those arriving from the opposite shore after journeys that are certainly not easy or free from risk. This is something the shipwreck victims from Somalia who arrived in April this year know well, after seeing 10 people die on the barge on which they were travelling, or the 20 who were transferred from Linosa because there was no place for them in the other reception centres, or the 18 who are still in Linosa, living in the stadium’s changing-rooms. There is also the tourist residence of Cala Creta, where they are currently housed, which is certainly neither an identification and expulsion centre nor a reception centre for asylum seekers, and especially the fact that in the meantime, both the sanitary arrangements and the possibility of receiving asylum at Lampedusa have been removed. Everything has been entrusted to the goodwill and the kind-heartedness of the police or the citizens and volunteers of Lampedusa. Another thing that must be borne in mind is the role that the centre itself has assumed in the recent past. After having allowed thousands upon thousands of people to gather, against all legal and ethical standards, in a place which, in terms of capacity and function, was only intended to accommodate a few hundred passing through, after having allowed an area of a few square kilometres, already made problematic on account of its location and logistics, to be forced to accommodate a number of people far in excess of the local population itself, we must give thought to who is responsible for an extremely tense situation, which then resulted in the fire itself. I believe that a perusal and examination of the facts is enough to understand that it was precisely the removal from Lampedusa of the great number of people who had gathered there which led to all this. Today, the best relations will surely lead to a better state of affairs. Rita Borsellino  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Member of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to join my colleagues who have welcomed the anti-corruption package approved by the European Commission on 6 June. Corruption is a transnational phenomenon and European-wide measures are needed to fight it. According to estimates from Eurobarometer, the vast majority of our European citizens believe that Europe should do more. How can we fault them? Many Member States have lacked the political will to fight corruption. One only has to consider that some European countries have still not signed the United Nations Convention Against Corruption. If we think of the devastating effect of corruption on democratic processes, citizens’ rights and confidence in the rule of law, it is clear that the national anti-corruption measures adopted by Member States to date are not sufficient to curb what is a growing problem. The European Union has to give a unified, strong response, especially now, in the midst of an unprecedented economic crisis, which is having an impact on people’s lives, on the survival of welfare and pension systems, and on the ability of institutions to guarantee essential services. Each year corruption causes the loss of EUR 120 billion, the equivalent of 1% of the European Union GDP. Every day it siphons off resources belonging to the EU and to Member States that could be used to provide key services – education, children’s services, employment and transport. In other words it siphons off clean resources from services to support people. We therefore need to be more courageous and more firm, both in overseeing the implementation of anti-corruption measures, and in intensifying and strengthening measures to combat corruption at EU level. More specifically, we cannot talk about combating corruption unless we are capable of adopting at least basic standards for defining the crime of corruption, which there is no trace of in the package just launched. The same goes for the definition of standard parameters for measuring the extent of the problem in Member States, which is essential for preparing an adequate response. For example, we are in favour of relaunching the network of EU anti-corruption contact points, as I proposed in the resolution we will be voting on tomorrow. Rita Borsellino  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today’s debate on readmission agreements cannot escape the now thorny issue of the agreement between the European Union and Libya. We know that one part of the agreement centres on the fight against illegal immigration. We are worried because so far, the Commission has said little to us on the issue, despite the fact that the Treaty of Lisbon obliges the Commission to provide Parliament with information promptly. As we know, Libya is not a signatory to the Geneva Convention on Human Rights, nor has it so far shown that it has adopted standards of behaviour in line with international law. I am thinking of the case of the Eritrean immigrants held in inhumane conditions in the Libyan centre of Brak, as well as the closure of the offices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Above all, however, I am thinking about the events of last week, when a Libyan patrol boat opened fire on an Italian fishing boat from the Mazara del Vallo fleet in international waters, claiming that there were illegal immigrants on board. This is an extremely worrying explanation that brings to mind the agreement signed between Libya and Italy. Among other things, this provides for the refoulement of immigrants to Libya without any provisions on the right to request asylum or individual, case-by-case assessments of each situation, whilst it also permits the use of firearms to stop immigrants. Given that part of the agreement is secret in this case too, I wonder if the Commission is aware of its content and whether, in the case in question, it thinks it necessary to request explanations regarding the Libyan authorities’ ability to open fire on boats if they suspect that they are carrying illegal immigrants. Because if this was the case … (The President cut off the speaker) Rita Borsellino  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Chastel, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the French Government’s decision to expel more than one thousand Roma is an extremely serious matter, above all, when we consider that this measure was taken for propagandist and populist reasons at a time when the French Government is far from enjoying favourable public opinion, and this is true political manipulation. This measure undermines the principle of European citizenship first and foremost. Under Directive 2004/38/EC on freedom of movement, this principle must be restricted only in specific cases and the restriction assessed on a case-by-case basis. I do not believe that this is what happened. As guardian of the treaties, the Commission’s job is to intervene quickly and to carefully assess conduct by Member States that is xenophobic and does not comply with EU law. I would also like to remind you that when the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force, the Charter of Fundamental Rights became binding and prohibits any kind of discrimination based on ethnic origin or nationality. Today, this debate gives us the opportunity to find out what the Commission and the Council think about these measures and what action they will take in this regard, not least because, quite sincerely, I believe that the Commission’s response was a little late in coming. I shall conclude by asking the Commission and the Council what became of the action plan for the development of a European strategy for the Roma and their integration, and how France and the other Member States are using the European money earmarked for the integration of ethnic minorities.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is not my intention, nor that of my group – which supported and wanted this debate – to transfer Italian internal political diatribes to the European domain. The issue of freedom of information concerns us all: it concerns the European Union, which can and must regulate the matter at Community level, so as to resist political and economic conditioning and to guarantee true pluralism of information. The Italian anomaly, where the Prime Minister is also the owner of some of the most important private networks, lies precisely in the existence of a dangerous link between the media and political and economic powers. It is precisely for this reason that we are calling for a European legislative measure, a measure that – far from being an anti-Italian act – will help to safeguard pluralism of information, preventing concentrations and conflicts of interest. We therefore call on the Commission today to intervene as quickly as possible – as this Parliament has already requested in the past – in order to equip the European Union with common rules for safeguarding freedom of information for all European citizens.

 Mr President, Mr Barrot, Mr Billström, ladies and gentlemen, in recent days, when setting out the European asylum plan, you yourself, Mr Barrot, talked of steadfastness in the fight against illegal immigration and of humanity when receiving the victims of persecution. Translated into legal terms, this means ensuring protection and the right to asylum for those fleeing starvation, war and persecution, and preventing their expulsion to countries where their lives are in danger or they risk inhumane treatment. This is basically the opposite of what the Italian Government is doing, as demonstrated by the latest worrying refoulement of 75 immigrants from Eritrea and Somalia to Libya, which happened without at least checking whether there were any potential asylum seekers, as required by international law and as denounced yesterday by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. An agreement between Italy and Libya cannot transform that stretch of the sea into a free zone where human rights are violated. I therefore call on the Commission to take action as soon as possible to ensure that the rules of international law are restored and complied with. Furthermore, I would like to know what progress has been made in the negotiations on the bilateral agreement between the EU and Libya, already underway for a number of years. When do you expect to conclude it? Can the Council and the Commission confirm that this agreement would prevail over the Italy-Libya one? Can you explain to Parliament the key points relating to tackling illegal immigration and guaranteeing the right to asylum and the principle of non-refoulement? Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, I would like to move this oral amendment, which is purely technical, to add to paragraph 22 the words: ‘which are eligible for registration and expected to register’.

Madam President, we are having a strange debate. We are discussing two balanced reports, and then the third one, the report by Ms Ferreira, on which the EPP has chosen to follow an ideological and extremist line, sticking to the defence of an integralist version of austerity policy. The members of Berlusconi’s party in this Parliament are performing the miracle of being extremist twice over: extremist in Italy against austerity, and extremist in this Parliament in supporting austerity, but behind the ideologies there is reality, and the reality is that the rate of fiscal consolidation is not only worsening the recession and unemployment, it is not reaching its main goal: the reduction of deficit and debt.  Open your eyes, EPP colleagues in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. With your medicine, public debt is growing in Europe, and if we want to reduce it, fiscal discipline must not be blind. It must be growth-friendly; it must leave room for public investment and have a sustainable space. After the IMF, the Commission and the European Council are recognising this reality, but not the EPP in the ECON Committee, which even went so far as to delete a paragraph which simply welcomed the efforts of the Commission to pursue growth-friendly fiscal consolidation. We hope that in plenary the EPP will isolate its extremists and will return to moderation and a spirit of compromise, but if this does not happen, our ‘no’ will be loud and clear.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the current crisis is not just an economic crisis, it is also a political crisis that has to do with the contradiction between the prevalence of the national political sphere and the need for the euro to have a European government founded on European institutions that have democratic legitimacy at European level. For this reason, the resolution is of great importance. Roberto Gualtieri,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. 
– (IT) 
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I said that the crisis currently affecting the euro is not exclusively economic but is rather a political crisis based on the growing contradiction between the fact that the national dimension prevails in politics yet the policies needed to face the crisis are European. This resolution aims to bring about a reform that does not require changes to the Treaties or secondary legislation. It is an important political and institutional reform because it uses the mechanism of nominating a candidate for Commission Presidency based on the model of parliamentary regimes, although we are obviously not dealing with a direct election. Nomination is by the European parliamentary parties, recognised by and present in the Treaties. We are therefore applying the spirit and the letter of the Treaties, which state that the President of the Commission is elected by Parliament and that the appointment of the President should take into account the result of the EP elections. At the same time, we are introducing a reform allowing the citizens to participate directly in choosing the political government of Europe. This brings genuine democratic legitimacy, based on a real European political sphere for the European institutions, which is a precondition for the effectiveness of their actions of government, as well as for their democratic legitimacy. On the other hand, this reform does not, in my opinion, contradict the independence of the Commission. This is because Article 17 of the Treaty of Lisbon on the independence of the Commission refers both to the fact that the Council should propose a candidate, acting by qualified majority, and that the proposal should take account of the results of the elections to the European Parliament, clearly demonstrating, as is the case in ordinary democratic regimes, that the democratic legitimacy of a governing body does not necessarily conflict with its independence. The question here is one of democratisation and politicisation, in order to strengthen the action of the Commission and, overall, to build a more legitimate, stronger European Union that is closer to its citizens and therefore more capable of providing a response to the extraordinary crisis that we are experiencing. Indeed, with reforms such as this, the crisis might well be the opportunity to take another step on the road to a political Europe. Roberto Gualtieri,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fundamental message of this report is that a single currency cannot simply be a system of rules but requires proper economic governance, with its own resources and full democratic legitimacy. A genuine Economic and Monetary Union should therefore be based on the EU institutions, around which a true European political space should take shape. Consequently, an increased role for Parliament is not a case of empire-building but is an essential condition for giving legitimacy and strength to the governance of the euro. However, we believe that a loose federation, based on a clear definition of roles, resources and powers between the EU and the Member States, would be more effective and democratic and, at the same time, more respectful of the national parliaments’ prerogatives than the model that has taken shape in recent years. Because of this, we support the idea of stronger fiscal powers based on own resources, the embryo of a proper European Treasury, provided that this operates within the EU budget and is based on additional resources. For this reason we believe that the ex ante
 coordination of economic policies can be increased and must involve Parliament on a different basis from the contract-based model indicated in the interim report. Because of this we believe that implementing common debt management mechanisms at EU level is unavoidable. So this means reinforced governance, but also different policies. Budgetary discipline should be accompanied by countercyclical measures that can guarantee a suitable role for public investment, and the protection and revitalisation of the European social model should become an integral part of the governance of the euro, a genuine ‘fifth pillar’ based on a social pact that prioritises youth and employment. With this report, Parliament is therefore promoting an ambitious vision and a clear and realistic roadmap. Firstly, full use should be made of the broad margins for manoeuvre offered by the Treaties; in the next parliamentary term, boosted by enhanced legitimacy from Parliament and the Commission, through the mechanism by which the European parties choose the candidate to be chair, a Convention should be set up that completes the process of building proper economic and democratic governance of the euro, which is essential if the crisis is to be overcome and Europe saved. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the current difficulties facing the European steel industry demand an examination of the role of the industry in EU policies. This not only concerns the limited powers of completion, shall we say, of the industry, but the overall effect of competition, trade, cohesion and fiscal policies. Although the economic crisis has highlighted the central role of manufacturing, we must move away from a system that has in recent decades put consumption before production, services before industry. I believe that the various cases, such as the special steel manufactured at Terni and the Piombino steel plant, are food for thought in this respect. In terms of competition policy, for example, we should maintain a global, and not just a European, outlook when evaluating dominant positions. With regard to this particular question, I believe it is important that we guarantee the integrity of the Terni site during the current sale and hive-off by Outokumpu of its steel pipe business. In terms of fiscal policy, the measures contained in June’s Growth Pact must be implemented swiftly, encouraging fiscal consolidation to bolster growth and thus safeguard the role of public investment in European fiscal policy. Finally, there is the question of rules on State aid, which should be recast to encourage bridging finance aimed at securing the future of manufacturing at sites deemed to be strategic. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a single currency requires genuine economic union; not merely a system of rules and regulations but economic government based on democratic institutions and equipped with adequate resources. Parliament insists that there can be no effective and legitimate ways of achieving this aim unless developed within the Union framework based on the institutions of the Union, and that the European Parliament is the Parliament of the euro because the euro is the currency of the Union. It is right that these principles should be recalled in the European Council’s conclusions, but they need to be stated tangibly and coherently. Greater fiscal capacity is required to absorb the shocks caused by the crisis and to sustain growth and social inclusion, but clearly such fiscal capacity can and must be made a part of the EU budget and must be based on additional own resources; above all it should not distract from the need to have a joint capacity for issuing and managing debt. However, we are opposed to individual contracts: they are ineffective and risk bringing about an asymmetric transfer of sovereignty, which would accentuate the democratic deficit. Parliament proposes a different model: binding and general social and economic objectives defined in ordinary legislative procedure at EU level, with national governments and parliaments competent to decide how these might be achieved. This approach reflects a vision that is at once more ambitious and more realistic of a Europe in which stability, growth, social cohesion and democracy go hand in hand – and for this reason a fifth social pillar is essential – and of a federal transition aimed at building consensus among citizens on the basis of a clear road map. This would involve: 1) correcting a policy based on austerity and the inter-governmental method with swift Decisions that take maximum advantage of the possibilities offered by the Treaties and prioritise growth and employment; 2) rendering the upcoming European elections genuine elections for the government of the EU. Finally, a convention should be called to complete the building of real democratic government for Europe and its currency. Parliament calls on you to act, and Parliament will exercise all of its powers. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with Mr Brok’s statements and with his report, which see progress in the development of the European External Action Service. This, together with your personal action, is starting to give shape and identity to the EU’s common foreign and security policy and external action, along the lines of a global multilateral approach based on plural instruments, which is the only possible way to face the challenges of the world today. In this framework, I believe that the balanced approach you have taken on delicate issues such as those of Syria and Iran, based on a correct awareness of the delicate network of interdependence and on the contradiction between state and national religion that characterises the Middle East, is commendable. That said, there is clearly a long way to go towards a better identification of the priorities, which are to strengthen the unity of intent of the Member States, strengthen European defence and develop the parliamentary dimension of the common foreign and security policy, both in terms of parliamentary control of the spirit and the letter of Article 36, and of strengthening the potential of parliamentary diplomacy. I believe that in these areas, too, we can work together, not least in preparation for the review of the decision establishing the External Action Service, towards which we will work constructively.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the ‘two-pack’ shows that there is a legal basis for EU governance of the euro area, as this Chamber had called for during the revision of Article 136. What we now have to assess is whether these two regulations seem to be capable of dealing with the deterioration of the crisis and the potential of their legal basis. Here, the answer is clear: the Commission’s proposal seems to belong to another epoch. As Commissioner Rehn has said, the Commission proposes an addition to the ‘six-pack’ without taking into account the obvious limits of austerity policies and economic governance that are solely focused on introducing rigid constraints and without attributing any real financial decision-making powers to the EU. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has introduced significant improvements to the Commission’s proposal, especially visible in the report by Ms Ferreira, first and foremost, in the article on the debt redemption fund. However, there remain several limitations. I am struck by the deafness of rapporteur Mr Gauzès who, faced with the proposal to involve Parliament in activating the enhanced surveillance procedure, introduces a procedure similar to that used for delegated acts. Our group, however, has responsibly decided to focus on one point, on which, however, there still appears to be some confusion. Amendment 82 is not a weakening of the Stability and Growth Pact, it is not a classic ‘golden rule’ clause. Quite the opposite: it is a tool to defend the Stability and Growth Pact, to make it effective and to ensure compliance, as well as giving a greater role to the Commission. The amendment is based on the concept of sustainable discipline and gives the Commission the task of prioritising investments for growth and employment when defining medium-term objectives and assessing Member State budgets. For this reason, I call upon fellow Members in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) to read the amendment, to reflect and to prevent this Parliament from appearing to be cut off from a situation that is evolving throughout Europe as well as in the Council.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Martin’s report paves the way to the full implementation of the Treaties’ provision governing the right of inquiry, essential for carrying out one of Parliament’s fundamental duties: political control. The Treaty of Lisbon introduced a special legislative procedure, and we therefore hope that during negotiations, both the institutions – Council and Commission – will uphold the spirit of this rule which explicitly entrusts the power of initiative and regulatory power to Parliament, and limits the role of the Council and Commission to a mere expression of consent. Mr Martin’s report draws on the previous experiences of temporary committees of inquiry which have shown the limitations of this instrument, and proposes significant innovations. Informal talks with the Danish Presidency and with the Commission have resulted in satisfactory compromise proposals which meet some of the requests of the Member States and the Commission, but which do not limit Parliament’s right to hold to account EU and national institutions for the correct implementation of EU legislation, and to identify possible instances of maladministration. Certain wording could be better clarified, but it is vital not to compromise on one point: the committees of inquiry must have access to documents and persons. This has nothing to do with judicial duties but, precisely, it concerns the full implementation of the political right clearly enshrined in the Treaties: the right of political control.

 Mr President, now the figures more than the theories clearly demonstrate that not only has the austerity strategy failed to produce growth and employment, but that it does not even provide stability within the European Union, which was Ms Merkel’s main goal, given that public accounts are getting worse, not better. We therefore need a change, and although the actions on which a consensus seems to be emerging are certainly positive, they are still insufficient. The project bonds pilot project is an important precedent, but its macro-economic impact is just a drop in the ocean. Even strengthening the European Investment Bank, which has greater potential, is not decisive, whilst better spending of Structural Funds is unlikely to have much of an effect since we currently lack even the resources to pay for projects already begun. Two essential elements for emerging from the crisis are missing. The first is a reformulation of the Stability Pact, which would also affect the fiscal compact without it needing to be amended, to separate a portion of investments from calculation of the structural deficit, giving the Commission a specific role in establishing them and activating this separation in recessive phases of the cycle. The second is joint management of a portion of the public debt based on the model of the proposed debt redemption fund. These two elements must go hand in hand and form a ‘growth and stability pack’ which must be EU-wide in order to be effective: so a ‘pack’ and not a ‘compact’. For this we need to make the most of the ‘two-pack’ discussion in order to act quickly and effectively on EU legislation. I believe that the Commission should play a clearly defined role in this process and stop defending an austerity policy now acknowledged by everyone as disastrous. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I join in thanking the Commission and the Presidency of the Council, but this debate is especially timely and important because we are facing two unacceptable violations of the letter and the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon. The violation of the letter – as many speakers have pointed out – is the European Union’s boycott on acceding to the European Convention on Human Rights, which is clearly set out in the Treaty of Lisbon and is a essential complement to the adoption of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The violation of the Treaty’s spirit, meanwhile, relates to the project currently under discussion in Brighton to amend the Convention, reducing citizens’ opportunities to appeal to an unacceptable extent. These are truly paradoxical proposals, not only because Protocol 14 has already significantly reformed the Court’s procedures, but also because, in more general terms, solving the problem of too many pending cases by reducing opportunities to appeal is like combating an epidemic by closing hospitals. The problem is not too many appeals, it is too many violations of rights in Europe and that is what governments should be worrying about. Parliament is therefore very concerned and highly vigilant. We think a reaction that prevents the kind of reforms under discussion in Brighton is of the utmost importance. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have to say that I was disappointed with Mr Barroso’s speech. As many have said – the last of whom was Mr Domenici – a fact evident to all, with the clear exception of the European institutions, has not been acknowledged. That is that we are falling from a recession into the risk of a depression, and in these circumstances, compliance with the objectives of the ‘six-pack’ and the fiscal compact is quite simply impossible. There is only one solution for tackling this recessionary and depressive downward spiral and that is to revitalise demand through investment. The solutions and answers that Mr Barroso proposed cannot work by themselves. Investment is needed, and as it is not realistic to make a substantial increase in the European budget at the moment – although we have been asking for it – public investment is needed, and therefore a reform of the ‘six-pack’ that introduces the golden rule on a group of public investments, which need to be separated from the calculation of the structural deficit. This is what Europe needs today. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the satisfaction of having escaped danger is understandable, but it should not make us forget the mistakes and the delays of recent years, not to mention the decisive role played by the European Central Bank (ECB) and by the new Italian Government. Most importantly, our satisfaction should not stop us facing up to the enormous structural problem that the policies of recent months have not resolved. The strategy of salary deflation brought in by austerity policies as an alternative to devaluation is not economically or socially sustainable, nor is it universally accepted in political terms. We should leave the caricatures behind. Nobody here is proposing deficit spending. We do think, however, that it is possible to combine national fiscal responsibility with a revitalisation of investment and demand; it is possible with a more even distribution of wealth; it is possible if we confront macro-economic imbalances; it is possible through large-scale EU investment; it is possible if we set up shared management of debts through a debt redemption fund. The Community method offers the instruments for realising these objectives, but we need a change in political direction which, between the elections in France and the European elections of 2014, will start a new cycle and see the consolidation of a different strategy and of truly European economic governance. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, by taking part in a critical but constructive capacity in the negotiations for the fiscal compact, this Parliament has reached an important point of unity. Greater budgetary responsibility at national level is necessary but insufficient, and without concrete steps towards growth and solidarity, it could lead to an unsustainable downward spiral towards recession. There is no evidence of Parliament’s approach, which is well thought-out and balanced, in the preparatory documents of the European Council. For the Council and the Commission, the word ‘growth’ seems to mean fiscal consolidation and salary reductions. It is true that there are positive developments taking place on the internal market, but they are not enough. Growth requires a robust internal driver, which involves a two-pronged objective: to reinforce internal demand in countries with a surplus and to promote an extraordinary investment plan financed by project bonds. However, the Commission only interprets the macro-economic imbalances in one direction – ignoring the logic of the Ferreira rule – and there is no trace of project bonds and shared investments in the European Council documents, except for a vacuous game in which the card picked is to use the existing resources of the Structural Funds, a bit like the way Mussolini used to move his tanks around in the Second World War to make it seem as if he had a bigger army than he actually had. It is therefore clear that this ruling class has had its day, and only a major political sea change can save Europe from disaster. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, commenting on the rather forgettable conclusions of the summit on 9 December, we said that this Parliament would watch and work to limit the damage of that unfortunate choice. This has been the case. Parliament’s united commitment in the difficult negotiations that have taken place has definitely helped to prevent even worse developments. There was a real risk that the new treaty would seriously undermine the law and the common European institutions, by establishing standards, mechanisms and procedures external to the Union and in contradiction with its laws. That is no longer the case. Parliament, the Commission and the President of the European Council have averted this danger. Now the treaty will have to be implemented through EU legislation. The parameters for defining deficit and debt levels have been substantially, although not completely, brought back into the context of the current regulatory framework, and the dreadful possibility of having a new parliamentary institution has been averted. But even though we have significantly limited the damage, the fiscal compact is not an adequate response to the crisis. There are still unacceptable and unwise aspects, such as the limitations on the presence of Parliament at Euro summits. From a legal perspective, the Court’s power to impose sanctions seems highly dubious. Only if the proposals that Parliament put forward with one voice in its resolution – financial transactions tax, project bonds, stability bonds – are finally adopted, can Europe overcome a crisis that unidirectional fiscal discipline threatens to aggravate.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Brok reminded us, this Parliament has adopted a critical approach to the new international agreement, which is reflected in the resolution we are about to approve. We have given the reasons for our criticism on several occasions. At an institutional level we believe that the tools provided by the treaties would have made it possible to avoid the damage of an intergovernmental agreement and to strengthen governance and budgetary discipline in the euro area whilst remaining within the legal framework of the EU. It is a paradox that even before the ink on the ‘six-pack’ has dried, some Member States already want to amend it by intergovernmental means, introducing some elements that they had not asked for before, indeed in some cases that they had actually opposed. This is a step backwards and not forwards along the road to fiscal union. On a political level we believe the economic slant of this agreement is dangerously unilateral, because without concrete measures to strengthen growth and solidarity the EU will not emerge from the crisis and the very objective of stability will not be achieved. We nevertheless felt that we had a duty to become active and constructively involved in limiting the damage to the edifice of the EU, defending the primacy of the Community method and Parliament’s prerogatives, and emphasising the necessity and urgency of shared management of sovereign debt. It is extremely significant from a political point of view that the four pro-European groups have defined a shared platform of amendments along these lines. Now we are waiting for the fourth draft of the agreement. It is clear that if not even the smallest points, on which there was agreement, are faithfully carried over into the text, Parliament will have recourse to all the tools at its disposal in order to oppose the agreement. However it is also clear that only a significant correction in approach, on an institutional and economic level, will be able to eliminate the reasons for our criticism and our determination to build a real European economic government based on the Community method and focusing on stability, growth and solidarity. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, the European Union is a Community based on law, and therefore form cannot be separated from substance: form is substance! That means that using an intergovernmental treaty as the basis for a fiscal compact is legally and technically quite a complex operation, or indeed an impossible one in practice. The comparison with Schengen and Prüm is not valid, because those areas were not governed by the Treaties. The fact is that we have reached this point because the premise was wrong; in other words, the Treaties could and should have been overhauled. We now have to find a way out, avoid the risk of renationalising Union competences, preserve the EU’s legal system, avoid duplications and, of course, correct an economic policy that is both wrong and inadequate. This House will watch carefully, ready to play its part in sorting out this incredible mess, by putting the process started at the European Council back on the rails of EU law, which are the only possible foundations on which a true fiscal union can be built.

Mr President, since Ms Koppa has already stated why the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament supports the Lisek report, I would like to focus on the Council’s conclusions, which, to my mind, represent a small but nonetheless significant step forwards. Of course, Parliament expected more, above all, in terms of planning and conduct capability, but the serious risk of a widespread abandonment of the common security and defence policy (CSDP) has been avoided, and for this I would like to thank the High Representative for her work on this front. To return to the subject of new operations, after the uninspiring outcomes of the European Union Force (EUFOR) in Libya, the Horn of Africa, Sudan and the Sahel, we expect to see real results and we are ready to offer our political and financial support. Whilst we already have pooling and sharing projects to be implemented, in terms of planning and conduct capability, the search for unanimity has presented limits, but the will to consider activating an operations centre as only a first step also emerges from the Council’s conclusions. It is important now that we do not lose momentum and instead take further steps forward, because otherwise no Member State will be able to avoid a future of global irrelevance. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation is coming to a head, and it is time to act with the speed and effectiveness that has so far been lacking. Relying on the miraculous effect of a Treaty reform announcement would be pointless and counterproductive. Embarking on the risky road towards an intergovernmental treaty would have a quite devastating effect on the markets. Reforming the Treaties takes too long; an intergovernmental agreement will not result in any kind of fiscal union. The truth is that the problem facing the EU today is a political problem, not an institutional one. It is possible, under the current Treaty, to strengthen economic convergence, enhance fiscal discipline, maintain stability in the euro area and boost growth. The two new proposals for regulations tabled by the Commission demonstrate this, and with that legal basis, Article 136, it is possible to go even further, including with regard to the role of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The flexibility clause would make it possible to increase the powers of the euro area, and Article 122(2) is an appropriate basis for that extraordinary Eurobond-based debt redemption fund proposed by the German Council of Economic Experts. In short, one has the feeling that Treaty reform is being sought so as to avoid codecision, so as to have less rather than more Europe. Hence there are no excuses: immediate action must be taken and the foundations laid for the full creation, with the citizens’ consent, of a fiscal union based on stability, growth, solidarity and democracy, one that ultimately serves as the basis for that reform of the Treaties, which is too important a goal to be compromised by a clumsy, ill-timed reform that would be legally unnecessary, economically insignificant and politically harmful today. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this excellent report can make a very important contribution to the debate under way on economic governance and on the possible reform of the Treaties, because it highlights very successfully the extremely close and obvious connection between the effectiveness of economic governance and the degree of its democratic legitimacy, thereby also emphasising, I wish to say, the absurdity of the idea of a limited Treaty reform. Because, although the objectives that such a limited reform seemingly sets could easily be achieved, as we have already argued, not with a reform but by applying the Treaty, if instead we turn the guidelines and recommendations made on the basis of Articles 121(2) and 148(4) into decisions with legal standing, we are stepping beyond the confines of a limited reform and moving towards a full-blown federal-style fiscal union that cannot be created without full democratic legitimacy and hence without a full codecision role for the European Parliament. In short, this reform, if limited, is useless; if it grants new and unconditional powers in relation to economic policy then it certainly cannot be limited. Therefore, a completely different approach must be adopted; Parliament must be involved straight away in defining the guidelines and recommendations, as the report proposes. This is a prerequisite for subsequently making those guidelines binding in nature. Adopting a completely different approach, following the Community method and striving for greater democratic legitimacy: that is the line that the Berès report convincingly proposes to us.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all allow me to offer my sincerest congratulations to Mario Monti for his good work; his nomination to guide the Italian Government is fantastic news not only for Italy but also for Europe. I believe that from this debate strong messages from all political groups will emerge with clarity, and I hope these will be listened to attentively. The first message is that without instruments for growth and development, and with only an austere approach to fiscal matters, the idea of a stable Union is a chimera. The second is that the government of peers, this peer pressure of which President Van Rompuy has also spoken, cannot function. We need provisions that have a legal basis, and we need institutions legitimated democratically. This is the only way to produce a true European economic government. In all this, to think that reforming three paragraphs of Articles 121 and 126 as decided in Berlin should be a panacea is an illusion not only because of the difficulties and risks of the revision itself but also because, of these three amendments, the first is useless, the second is irrelevant and the third is impossible. Thus, our position is clear. Firstly, before changing the Treaty of Lisbon, apply it and read it, and you will discover that Articles 136 and 352 are founded on strong legal grounds for strong governance of the euro area based on communitarian methods. Secondly, it is obvious that this Parliament is not opposed in principle to strengthening the EU’s jurisdiction by reforming the Treaty, but this mandate can be limited and should be well-balanced, and this Parliament will not accept a reform which, alongside stability, does not create a Union of solidarity, growth and democracy.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, cooperation between the European Union and the United States is certainly going to play an increasingly important role in transatlantic relations. Dialogue with the European Parliament has a crucial and growing part to play in this cooperation, which is something our friends across the Atlantic have grasped perfectly well and often better than many national governments and parliaments. This dialogue is first and foremost legislative in nature, but there is also political and strategic dialogue on major economic and foreign policy issues, areas in which this House intends to strengthen its actions and make the most of its prerogatives. One of the issues that I would like to highlight is a matter of great importance which has been positively taken up in the joint resolution. I am referring to the Middle East question. We are committed to supporting the efforts by the High Representative and the Quartet to resume the negotiations between the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli Government, because we all know that if the parties do not negotiate there will be no peace and no two-state solution. At the same time, however, we believe that recognising the Palestinians’ aspirations to be represented in the United Nations as a state does not negate the need for the talks but instead may strengthen them. We therefore call on the Member States and the United States to come up with pragmatic measures to achieve this recognition. In the context of the budget procedure, we are committed to increasing EU economic support for the Palestinian Authority and believe that the Unesco boycott is a misguided and counterproductive reaction.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Gahler has just explained, cluster munitions are terrible, fiendish instruments of death for the civilian population. Banning them is therefore a battle for civilisation to which this House has been committed for some time. The entry into force of the Oslo Convention was a major success, but now, little more than a year later, we are faced with a dangerous attempt to undermine its outcomes through an additional protocol to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons – the review of which is currently being negotiated in Geneva – which would again allow the use of cluster munitions. This is a protocol that must not and cannot be signed by countries that have already signed up to the Oslo Convention, because, as you said yourself, Commissioner, it is clearly incompatible with the Convention and would open up a dangerous loophole, not least for those other countries that want to continue to produce, stockpile and use these types of munitions. Moreover, it would create a very serious precedent and would be a blow to international law. The argument by those who say that the protocol would in any case improve the situation, because it would be signed by countries that have not signed the Oslo Convention, sounds decidedly specious to us, and on this point we would perhaps have liked to hear a rather clearer and less equivocal statement from Ms Ashton’s representative. Protocol VI would undermine the Convention because it would allow for the use of munitions produced after 1980, which form the great majority of them; it foresees a long transition period; it would allow for the use of types of cluster bomb that are extremely dangerous to civilians; and it would not set out any clear obligation to destroy individual countries’ stockpiles. It is therefore crucial that all the Member States do not support the entry into force of this protocol and that the High Representative commits herself to ensuring that all the countries in the Union adopt a clear, united position in favour of a definitive ban on cluster munitions. The joint resolution that we are about to adopt on this issue is an important political signal, and we are certain that it will be adopted in its entirety by a large majority.

 One of the causes of the current economic and financial crisis is the lack of adequate regulation of financial markets. Through the adoption of the report by Mr Canfin and the first-reading agreement between Parliament and the Council, the EU has taken an important step forwards by bringing in new rules on credit default swaps and short selling. Thanks to the work of Parliament, the slightly timid approach taken by the Council has been corrected in a number of fundamental ways. Indeed, we have brought in a ban on naked short selling – that is, selling securities that you do not actually own – which includes a ban on buying credit default swaps unless you also own the relevant government bonds. Moreover, the information and transparency obligations imposed on operators will allow national supervisory authorities to keep up to date with any pressure on a security, thereby effectively preventing risk. Parliament can therefore only express its satisfaction about the adoption of this regulation: it may be just an initial step and a simple part of a more general project to regulate the financial markets, but this regulation represents significant progress and a robust contribution to better-functioning financial markets, particularly in terms of sovereign debts.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the most recurrent words in these conclusions are ‘urge’ and ‘commitment’, including Mr Berlusconi’s commitment to tackle the North-South divide in four months. It is clear, then, that exhortations and commitments do not add up to any sort of common economic policy; nor do institutions that do not exist, such as Eurosummit, for example. The proposed regulations based on Article 136, announced by Mr Barroso, show that the institutions that do actually exist can, instead of exhortations, make laws. We say: ‘make them; make these laws now’. We would add, furthermore, that we shall not allow any treaty reforms unless all the possibilities of the existing treaty have been exhausted. We shall not accept a limited mandate that has not been devised in part by Parliament and does not include codecision on economic policy and shared responsibility for Eurobonds, because without democracy, growth and solidarity, a stable European Union remains merely a chimera.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Heading 4 is structurally underfunded with respect to the EU’s commitments and strategic interests. This has forced us to make painful choices to protect our priorities and particularly resources for Palestine, which are clearly necessary, especially in the light of the decisions taken by the United States Congress. That is what is behind the cuts to the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) budget, which are not generic, linear cuts but policy-based cuts on specific issues, which do not therefore affect other operations. First of all, Afghanistan: this is a painful cut, but at the same time we must be aware that, despite the good results of our mission, the EU is a bit-part player on this issue, subordinate to the strategies of others which, moreover, are not seeing great success. In terms of emergency measures, the issue of special representatives is coming to the fore, so this is a logical cut to make. In terms of preparatory measures, the Council rejects Article 51(5)(c) of the Financial Regulation, which gives Parliament a limited role in these measures, in line with the Madrid agreement. Hence, this cut is inevitable. It is not Parliament that has chosen this path of austerity: the Council can hardly be taken aback by its consequences. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, even though it is too early for a conclusive assessment, it is difficult to escape the impression that this Semester is producing weak coordination and inadequate democratic legitimacy. The two things are linked because without full democratic legitimacy, the Semester runs the risk of being more a bureaucratic exercise than a coordination of substance. This limitation certainly relates to the crucial issue of the Union’s competences and Parliament’s prerogatives, which should lie at the very heart of any Treaty reform, which would otherwise be pointless or harmful. This limitation also highlights a problem of effective political will to make immediate use of all the instruments offered by the Treaty in order to strengthen coordination and give Parliament a greater role. Then there is a problem of content. A reading of the Council’s recommendations shows an obvious limitation in the line of economic politics that inspired them: deficit reduction and development of the internal market are necessary but not sufficient conditions for tackling the crisis, and unless there is a major investment plan, they are liable to trigger a vicious circle that may bring us to collapse. The political line of the Semester therefore needs to be the subject of a genuine political debate, which can only take place in the context of the discussions between Parliament and the Council. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, President Barroso said some important things today, but several points need to be clarified. I would like to highlight three of them. First, euro area fiscal union. At last, someone has noticed the existence of Article 136; however, the President of the Commission spoke of a Commission-Council procedure. In fact, Article 136 also contemplates the possibility of regulations. It is therefore possible that, under Article 136, 17 Member States will vote in the Council and 27 in Parliament. We would like to know whether – as Parliament has requested – the Commission intends to propose regulations with the ordinary legislative procedure pursuant to Article 136 for the conditionality of the stability mechanism. Secondly, the stability mechanisms themselves. The 21 July agreement is fine, the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) is fine, but the truth is that the quota method does not work. You must tell us if you think that the EFSM, which still exists, can continue to operate, especially after the ruling from the German Court, and if therefore it is possible to think in terms of the communitisation of the stability mechanism. Thirdly, the Secretary General of the German Christian Democratic Union (CDU) today said that he would like to move on from monetary union to stability union. Without growth, development and employment, there can be no stability. You should tell us if the Commission agrees with this. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 In voting against the Wortmann-Kool report, and in fact against the entire ‘governance package’, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is not saying ‘no’ to more robust and stringent European rules on the fiscal policies of the Member States, but is expressing its opposition to a specific line of economic policy: a line focused solely on budgetary discipline, and therefore an inadequate response to the current serious economic and financial crisis. As a condition of its support for the package, the S&amp;D Group had requested the introduction of a golden rule to ‘save’ productive investment from swingeing cuts. The alliance between the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Euro-sceptic conservatives of the European Conservatives and Reformists Group, backed by the Council, has made it inevitable that we would vote against by rejecting this potential compromise, which opposes a line that is destined to exacerbate the sovereign debt crisis and to hit both social cohesion and growth prospects in Europe hard.

Despite the measures taken by the individual Member States, the number of victims of road-traffic accidents in Europe is still too high. By approving the report by Mr Koch – which contains more than 100 suggestions on how to ensure effective road safety – Parliament is adopting a resolution in response to the Commission communication of 2010, which appeals to this House to put forward an even more ambitious action programme. We shall need to improve the deployment of road signs, as well as infrastructure and vehicle safety and information exchange. Above all, however, we shall need to move towards harmonising legislation on the subject, for example, by reducing the speed limit in residential areas to 30 km/h and banning new drivers and those driving with passengers from drinking alcohol. This is the only way that it will be possible to halve the number of victims and reduce the number of injuries by 2020. We therefore expect the Commission to produce a new plan that follows Parliament’s suggestions by the end of the year. Road safety must be a priority for Europe. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

Mr President, would you not agree that the treaties already allow for closer integration in the euro area and that therefore it is not necessary, and indeed would be counter-productive, to achieve it outside the EU institutions, as the current governments of France and Germany seem to be aiming for? In particular, would you not agree that Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union makes it possible to adopt legislative measures for the euro area within the scope of the economic policy competences given to the EU by the treaties? Secondly, would you not agree that Article 352 makes it possible to strengthen the powers of the existing institutions in order to reach the objectives set out by the treaties? Lastly, is it not the case that Protocol No 14 does not forbid the Eurogroup Heads of State or Government from meeting without having to create another institution, and therefore that it would be unreasonable for the President of another institution – the European Council – to preside over this expanded Eurogroup? Therefore, would you not agree that achieving euro area integration within or outside the treaties is a problem of political will and not of legal barriers? Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have reached a crucial moment in the decade-long aspiration of the Palestinian people to have a state of their own and also in the rightful aspiration of the people of Israel to live in safety. This is because the latter is so intimately connected with the former, because there can be no safety without peace and there can be no peace without a democratic Palestinian state that is respectful of international law, as outlined by Mr Abbas to the United Nations. The acceptance of the timeline drawn up by the Quartet is a victory for the European Union and one which we must salute you for, Baroness Ashton, even though some countries did try to steal the European Union’s limelight. However, the news of new settlements warns us that the path ahead will be strewn with difficulties. That is why it is important to increase the pressure on the Israeli Government and clearly express the EU’s support – despite the absence of absolute unanimity – for a possible vote in the UN General Assembly on awarding the status of non-Member State. This House must be united in upholding and increasing this pressure, including putting aside differences of opinion on full membership, giving its unanimous backing through its resolution on the legitimate aspiration of the Palestinian people to be represented as a state at the United Nations.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, after 42 years of dictatorship and six months of conflict Libya is at a turning-point in its history that could open the way to a future of democracy, peace and development. This future is in the hands of the Libyans and no one can expect to impose choices and ready-made solutions on them, but at the same time it is clear that the European Union has a great responsibility, a decisive role to play in supporting the process of stabilisation and transition to democracy in the country. After being marginalised by the divisions among its members in the early stages of the conflict, a conflict the wise management of which can be attributed to NATO, the EU has gradually begun to demonstrate the capacity for action that we all value and which has produced concrete results, with the opening of the office in Benghazi, missions in Tripoli, which we would like to be more coordinated, external service action and ECHO (Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection). This activism must now find its place in the context of a strong and credible political strategy capable of defining a multilateral framework that is both robust and effective, and of ensuring a true unity of purpose within the international community, preventing overlapping and competition and guaranteeing real support for the Libyan transition. The transition will inevitably be long and complex, and will have to focus on national reconciliation while preventing the creation of new divisions within the country. At the same time it will have to ensure progress and democracy, and guarantee the involvement of civil society and the creation of new ruling classes. During this transition the return to normality and restoration of public order means difficult problems such as border control, rebuilding the judicial system and the security forces, and controlling the widespread distribution of weapons, must be addressed as a matter of urgency, while at the same time the transition has to be based on a robust and credible road map that is both democratic and representative. All this requires dialogue, commitment, leadership skills, as well as intensive planning and work to identify resources. It is therefore an important test for the EU, for the European External Action Service, and for its comprehensive approach, and the European Parliament is ready to play its part and to support this commitment.

 Parliament’s vote on the report by Mr Glante opens the way to the development of a European satellite navigation system. The establishment within the Galileo programme of a public regulated service (PRS) – an encrypted, maximum security network to be used by operators authorised by governments, such as the police or the armed forces – will provide an extremely useful service for European citizens by helping to ensure that security forces can respond to crises or emergencies without delay. Other than providing benefits for citizens, the Galileo programme also represents an opportunity for European industry in the new technologies markets by helping to create high-level jobs in the satellite navigation sector. Parliament now awaits the position of the Council, in order to make the PRS service available and operative from 2014 onwards. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 By adopting this own-initiative report, Parliament is proving its commitment to increasing female employment in such a highly significant sector for the economy as entrepreneurship. If it is true that women traditionally encounter greater obstacles than men in entering the labour market, then this is particularly the case in the business sector. It is therefore important to incentivise female entrepreneurship through targeted actions. This can be achieved, in particular, through easier access to credit – in which case the European Microfinance Instrument Progress can be of major help – or by subsidising exchange initiatives, similar to an Erasmus scheme for young female entrepreneurs, which could encourage women to embark on such a professional vocation. The European Union must therefore strive to promote the presence of women in small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe, removing the economic and obstacles that they encounter.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament believes that the construction of a true European political space is a prerequisite for progressing towards a political Europe that can rise to this century’s huge challenges in a strong, determined and appropriate way. The Treaty of Lisbon represents a significant step forward in this respect, especially when it comes to the principle already mentioned by the rapporteur, Mr Duff, which clarifies that the European Parliament directly represents European citizens at EU level. Nevertheless, despite this and other important innovations in the Treaty of Lisbon, and despite the fact that everyday life clearly shows us that a political Europe is necessary, the construction of a true European political space is still a long way off. Debate in our Member States is too focused on national issues, too many of the discussions among political parties are carried out from an exclusively national perspective, and the European elections themselves often appear to the citizens as an extension of national political debate, which is also one of the reasons for the overly low turnout. We believe that a reform of European electoral law that strengthens our common principles can contribute towards this Europeanisation of European political debate. Clearly, it is not the only requirement, but it can help. Therefore, despite being aware of the numerous problems associated with this proposal, the S&amp;D Group supported the proposal for a transnational list in committee. At the same time we supported the request for a referral back to committee, because we realise that broad consensus is needed on this proposal. However, we also believe that we must proceed with determination towards a reform of the European electoral system that strengthens the transnational nature of these elections.

 By adopting the Sommer report, Parliament is showing that it is mindful of the transparency of information about the nutritional value and the provenance of foodstuffs, in line with the requirements of European consumers for greater safety in the products they buy. By confirming the agreement at second reading with the Council, Parliament is introducing the obligation to provide detailed information about the composition and energy value of foodstuffs, as well as extending origin labelling to fresh swine, sheep, goat and poultry meat. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has played a dynamic role in the negotiations, convincing the Council and Commission to consider the subsequent adoption of rules on origin for meat used in packaged foods, as well as on the effects of using hydrogenated fats, which, from today, are subject to legislation. The adopted text signals recognition of the Italian approach, which has already previously shown how to protect and promote Italian and European excellence, and it is therefore a source of satisfaction both for Italy and for operators in the sector. However, although the step taken is important, our commitment to European citizens being able to make ever more independent and informed choices about the products they put on their tables will go on. Roberto Gualtieri,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution that we are preparing to vote on is important and timely because it sets out and unequivocally clarifies the principles that must guide the action of Parliament and its representatives in conducting these difficult negotiations with national parliaments. First and foremost, these principles derive from Treaties that, by getting rid of the pillar structure, on the one hand, and assigning Parliament the role of representing citizens directly at EU level, on the other, make the European Parliament a vital source of democratic legitimacy for the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) and the common security and defence policy (CSDP) as EU policies This double innovation results, as we know, in increased functions and responsibilities, from the vote to approve the High Representative, to the referral powers established by Article 36, to the budget powers that, we must remember, make the European Parliament the budgetary authority for the exceptionally large increase in CSDP missions which, as we are aware, are civil missions. However, the reasons that lead us to take, with determination and readiness for dialogue, the road towards genuine agreement with national parliaments are also political and pragmatic. Interparliamentary cooperation is appropriate and necessary to strengthen support for the CFSP and the CSDP and to increase consistency between them and the choices made by Member States at national level. It is precisely for this reason that this cooperation should represent, in a balanced way, the institutions that express Europe’s democratic legitimacy at a different level, and an imbalance that excessively compromises Parliament’s power would be incongruous with the mission to Europeanise the debate on foreign security and defence policy in Europe, which is at the root of the idea of holding a conference. That is why it is good for tomorrow’s vote to clarify that the readiness for debate is accompanied by the utmost commitment to certain principles, starting with the principle that, as Article 9 of the first protocol clearly states, no regular form of interparliamentary cooperation can be established without Parliament’s consent.

 The single European emergency number 112 is a service that aims to ensure rapid access, free of charge, to emergency services for everyone throughout Europe, thus markedly simplifying access to the service, especially for people who are abroad. Adoption of the Rapti report is Parliament’s response to Europeans’ scant knowledge and awareness of the potential of this service. This lack of information is certainly worrying. Among the aims of the European Parliament resolution is in fact to carry out an effective information and awareness-raising campaign in key locations such as doctors’ surgeries, pharmacies, schools, airports and stations, as well as to call for improvements in the quality, efficiency and accessibility of the single service, thus ensuring easy access even for people with disabilities and vulnerable individuals. By providing the Commission with clear guidelines on how to improve use of the universal service, we have taken a step forwards in protecting people who live and travel in the Union, with particular attention to social and geographical inclusion.

 The vote on the Langen report on over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives further reinforces Parliament’s priority of regulating the financial markets and fighting speculation, the main factor in market instability at a time of crisis. Parliament has defined its position at first reading on the proposal for a regulation in line with what has already been suggested both by the European Commission and by the G20 mandate, which calls for a strengthening of the system within which OTC derivatives work, in order to provide more transparency and greater risk management. It is necessary, in fact, to provide the relevant European and national authorities with all the tools they need to supervise and control the derivatives market, including more information on the nature of derivative transactions and on the contracts entered into by counterparties. We now expect the Council to get over the splits between Member States and offer the opening needed in this area, so that the wholesale reform of European financial markets can come to fruition.

 Urban areas, which are home to 73% of Europe’s population and generate around 80% of the GDP, are the Union’s major centres of innovation, culture and growth. However, the urban dimension has up until now received insufficient recognition. For this reason it is important that Parliament should propose to enhance the European Urban Agenda within the framework of EU policies, reinforcing the contribution of cohesion policy to urban development and encouraging greater involvement on the part of local political stakeholders. It is necessary to direct the urban dimension of political cohesion towards supporting the development of basic physical infrastructure, the modernisation of economic, social and environmental characteristics of cities, urban regeneration and the promotion of social innovation in disadvantaged neighbourhoods. All this requires direct participation on the part of local authorities and civil society, and the involvement of cities’ political representatives in strategic planning and in defining and negotiating partnership contracts. Within this framework the call for the Commission to promote the creation of urban administrators and to establish an Erasmus for local and regional elected representatives is of significance. Let us monitor closely the Commission’s commitment to welcoming the important proposals of this report, in the belief that a full appreciation of the central role of the urban dimension in EU politics constitutes an indispensable condition for its success.

 Europe needs stronger and more Community-based economic governance. However, the package of measures being voted on today wrongly reflects the tendency of the current centre-right majority to view governance as a mere austerity exercise, by strengthening the preventive and corrective dimension of the Stability and Growth Pact without outlining mechanisms and instruments for supporting investment and development. One cannot accept the reverse majority rule and tougher parameters and sanctions without a golden rule to protect Member States’ investments and without Eurobonds to fund European investments and, at the same time, to guarantee sovereign debt. This is not a good enough formula for tackling the crisis and it is destined to make it worse. That is why we will vote against this and the other reports on fiscal surveillance. Moreover, we will fight to take European economic policy in a different direction and, at the same time, to strengthen the Community method and the EU’s instruments and resources.

 The European Parliament has brought an end to the long legislative procedure on the Consumer Rights Directive by adopting the Schwab report, which is a satisfactory compromise with the Council and the Commission. Two important steps have thus been taken. On the one hand, we have adopted a single legislative instrument on consumer rights, which provides harmonisation and takes over from the four previous directives in this area. On the other hand, we have laid down detailed rules for buying and selling online, in order to promote cross-border trade and to guarantee transparency for both businesses and consumers. The new directive lays down aspects that are intended to give greater protection to the European consumer, such as the information to be contained in sale contracts, delivery times, the right of withdrawal, and the right to repair or replacement of a defective product, as well as the cases in which the risk is transferred from the vendor to the consumer. Although yet more detailed rules may be laid down in future, the text that has been adopted represents a positive compromise in the harmonisation of existing regulations, guaranteeing secure purchases and putting a definitive end to typical sharp practices that hide behind electronic purchasing.

 The tragic earthquake in Japan is an incentive for Europe to look more deeply at the consequences of nuclear technology use and its impact on the safety of European citizens. In adopting the report on the proposal for a directive on the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste, Parliament is showing that it is particularly sensitive to this issue and demonstrating a clear desire to find common, definitive solutions to the storage of nuclear waste in Europe. By calling for common minimum standards for all the Member States, we are encouraging their governments to invest in new technologies, with a view to obtaining rapid, concrete results in relation to the disposal of this extremely hazardous waste. I therefore welcome two amendments tabled by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament calling for Parliament and the Council to co-decide on matters relating to nuclear energy use and endorsing the fundamental ban on waste exports to third countries, a ban which demonstrates Parliament’s determination to shoulder its responsibilities. Parliament’s vote is therefore a further step towards the gradual abandonment of nuclear energy, in favour of sustainable energy solutions that are safe for the public. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 The Dess report adopted by this House is entirely consistent with the guidelines already set by the European Commission. It calls for the common agricultural policy for 2014-2020 to be reviewed in order to meet the challenges of environmental sustainability, job creation and guaranteed high-quality, safe food. In adopting this text, the European Parliament is demonstrating its opposition to regressive tendencies and proposing that the future CAP budget remain at least at the same level as the 2013 budget, thereby ensuring that farmers receive the support they need to invest in new technologies, a crucial step if this sector is to remain competitive. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has made a decisive contribution – partly as a result of the numerous amendments tabled both in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and in plenary – to achieving a convincing result, thereby sending a clear message to the European Commission ahead of the legislative proposals scheduled for October.

By approving Mr Klinz’s report appealing for effective regulation of rating agencies, Parliament is taking another step towards greater transparency in the financial markets. It is important to overcome the current problems that characterise the sector: the lack of competition, the regulatory over-dependence on ratings, and the low reliability of notes. In this vein, Parliament’s request for the Commission to consider creating an independent European agency that could also be responsible for sovereign debt ratings is significant. Since the irresponsible behaviour of credit rating agencies (CRAs) has often been the initial cause of speculation that primarily harms European taxpayers, it is hugely important to review their role in sovereign debt ratings as part of the ongoing reform process, which will be completed in the autumn.

 By voting for the Garriga Polledo report, the European Parliament has made its voice heard on the future of the European budget and put forward an ambitious proposal for the next Multiannual Financial Framework. The request to increase the post-2013 EU budget by 5%, and therefore to increase the total European Union GNI from 1.06% to 1.11%, corresponds to a desire to honour commitments made to support growth and development, first and foremost, the Europe 2020 strategy, for which adequate resources are needed. It is important, in fact, to remember the added value of the European budget, which can act as a driver for economic growth, research and development and employment, particularly for young people, alongside national budgets. The report also reinforces Parliament’s position in favour of new financial instruments, such as the tax on financial transactions and Eurobonds, which are an opportunity for the European economy. It is now down to the Commission to take up Parliament’s ambition, presenting its proposals for the next European financial framework and not falling victim to the restrictive budget policies of Member States.

 Parliament’s approval of the directive on the charging of heavy goods vehicles is a step forward in the protection of European citizens’ health, and a commitment to lessen the harmful effects of pollution caused by such vehicles. The ‘polluter pays’ principle has been introduced for the first time in this sector in order to encourage safer and more sustainable transport, and hence to promote alternatives such as rail transport. Under the compromise reached, however, due consideration must also be given to the protection of the haulage industry, which must not be penalised excessively. Member States must therefore strive to make more effective use of the revenues collected under the Eurovignette, for example, by investing in infrastructure improvements and encouraging the use of less polluting haulage vehicles, so as to ensure that the benefits of the directive are enjoyed by all the sectors involved.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the common security and defence policy (CSDP) is going through an extremely difficult time. Just when developments in the international system require the European Union to become a credible actor in security and defence; just when the European approach to crisis management through supporting democracy rather than exporting it appears to be more suited to the challenges of our times; just when the economic crisis makes the option of developing a common defence inevitable; just when the Treaty of Lisbon provides new instruments to develop the CSDP within the framework of an integrated approach; in short, just when a quality leap in the CSDP has become necessary and possible, the European edifice seems to be creaking dangerously and there is a real risk that the ambitions and possibilities of the CSDP will have to be drastically downsized. The report I am presenting seeks to tackle this contradiction and suggests possible answers for the other institutions. With regard to the Libyan crisis, we do not confine ourselves to expressing our disappointment either at the European Union’s inability to define its position and take joint action or at the restrictions placed on the EUFOR Libya mandate. We believe the time has come for a European political initiative, in conjunction with our other partners, to bring about a ceasefire and to hold negotiations that will put an end to the Gaddafi regime and begin a transition to an inclusive democracy. NATO’s military intervention is clearly unlikely to solve anything and it will do well to adhere scrupulously to the mandate of the UN resolution, avoiding any disproportionate use of force. At the same time, we hope that CSDP assets will be used effectively to provide humanitarian assistance to the civilian population under attack and that future operations will be planned in such a way as to support the development of democracy in Libya. The Libyan situation also calls for reflection on a wider scale, and I believe it reinforces the report’s suggestions. Responsibility for the future of Europe and for security and defence, of course, lies primarily with the European Council, its members and also its President, who represents the Union in matters of foreign and security policy at that level. We say to them clearly that bilateral cooperation and coalitions of the willing cannot replace the CSDP as the Union’s policy. We do not find the idea of renationalising this policy convincing, not because we are Treaty purists, but because, if it were renationalised, this policy would not be equal to the challenges that lie ahead. We propose that Parliament should enter into a strategic dialogue with the European Council, which we call on to discuss Parliament’s recommendations, to draw up a proper foreign policy strategy and to devote an extraordinary meeting to European security and defence. We call on you, Baroness Ashton, to intensify your efforts to build a consensus among the Member States and to make use of your multiple functions to improve consistency between the CSDP, the common foreign and security policy and the other facets of the Union’s external action. The European External Action Service is an instrument with enormous potential for this work. The report puts forward several proposals for the role it should play, starting with that of being a crisis management board able to provide a genuinely integrated response to crises, and we are delighted to see that it is taking shape. The Libyan situation also confirms the inadequacy of Europe’s military capability, which is well below the overall high level of national defence budgets. It is quite obvious that strength only lies in unity. This involves pooling, sharing, strengthening of the European Defence Agency, permanent structured cooperation, development of an efficient and competitive European defence market, strengthening of the industrial and technological base, and enhancement of joint command and control capabilities. The inadequacy of these capabilities has been a factor preventing Europe from responding promptly to the Libyan crisis, starting with setting up a permanent operations general headquarters. The report formulates a large number of concrete proposals on this and other issues, such as the integration of external and internal security policies in a way that respects the primacy of the Community method. It is noteworthy that in this respect, the main pro-European political groups are united, and I thank the shadow rapporteurs and coordinators for this fruitful collaboration. Parliament is ready to support the development of a CSDP that is fully integrated with the Union’s external action and is rooted in the values and principles of Europe. Baroness Ashton, we hope you can respond convincingly to us both in words and, above all, in deeds. Roberto Gualtieri,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe Mr Albertini was right because as rapporteur, he had four minutes for his speech and two for his reply. I therefore take the liberty of pointing out that he should have his four minutes. For my part, I think this has been a useful and important debate, which shows how united Parliament is and how ready it is to offer its support for consistent and effective external action by Europe. We have not only heard recriminations for the obvious limitations shown by Europe in recent events, but we have also heard proposals offering a kind of strategic partnership between Parliament and the other institutions in order to make Europe a credible actor in security and defence matters. I believe this partnership would be not only an opportunity but a necessity as well because, if what we have been saying is true, which is that Europe’s integrated approach is its main potential, achieving that integrated approach will require the support of a body endowed with clear legislative and budgetary powers. For that reason as well, I think we should find a balanced solution to the matter of interparliamentary cooperation. It has become clear from the discussion how we must act. We must first of all assess the possibilities offered by the Treaty: by permanent structured cooperation and by Article 44, which makes it possible to delegate the task of carrying out a mission to particular Member States, but within an EU procedural framework, which is not the same thing as renationalisation. We need to make use of existing structures – starting with the European External Action Service – and set ourselves ambitious tasks in the field of capabilities. Of course, we also need to know how to offer leadership ability. We would like to thank Baroness Ashton for her commitment and for the important statements she has made. It is an attractive thought, as she said, that a small group can do great things, but Europe is a great civilised power which cannot shirk its responsibilities. Roberto Gualtieri,  
rapporteur.

 By approving the Hökmark report, Parliament is opting for innovation: the broadband and mobile telephony sector is not only of great interest to Europeans, but it makes it possible to develop new prospects in terms of research and development, areas in which the European Union can and must aspire to play a leading role. In this respect, it is important to ensure that the first European radio spectrum policy programme is in line with the objectives already outlined in the EU 2020 strategy and the Digital Agenda and comes within the priority actions of the Single Market Act. The EU must endeavour to overcome the digital divide that results in huge disparities within Europe – between urban and rural areas in particular – so as to ensure all citizens have equal access to services, especially those involving new technologies. I therefore welcome the ambitious targets proposed, to provide broadband access throughout Europe by 2020, with particular emphasis on wireless networks. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 The approval of a common transparency register, following a broad majority vote in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, is another step towards greater transparency in parliamentary activity. A common register between the European Parliament and the Commission that is public and accessible online will make it easier for citizens to check the various stakeholders with whom MEPs interact. However, the agreement still needs to be improved as registration by actors is still on a voluntary basis, although a pre-requisite for obtaining access to the institutions. The next objective will therefore be to make registration mandatory for all lobbyists. We also expect that, like the other European institutions, the Council will adhere to the indications of Parliament and the Commission and participate in the register. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

The specification of a European forest protection strategy is part of the EU’s overall commitment to the fight against climate change. Particularly positive points in the report that has been approved are the proposal for a specific regulation on the prohibiting of building on land cleared by fires proven to have resulted from arson, and the request for suitable funding for forestry strategies, which is currently at a very low level. Finally, the request for appropriate sustainability criteria for biomass produced for the use of energy is also important. We therefore urge the European Commission to continue along this route, by presenting a White Paper on forest protection to deal with these issues. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

I voted against the joint resolution because of the rejection by the House of two key amendments presented by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament on the development of medium- to long-term strategies for the progressive phasing-out of nuclear power and the definition of binding renewable energy targets. The vote against the entire resolution by the House highlights the fact that the nuclear issue is no longer just one of greater safety. It is now vital that we begin to think seriously about the energy issue and about investment in renewable energies. Japan’s tragic experience has shown us just how necessary it is to discuss nuclear power in depth. In this sense, the European Parliament’s vote is the first step towards a change of direction in energy policy choices on both a European and an international scale. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that the establishment of a permanent stability mechanism is an important achievement that provides the foundations for the political commitment to defend the euro at all costs. Therefore, despite not inconsiderable reservations about the methods and intergovernmental nature of the fund, Parliament supported this watershed moment and has focused on ensuring a solid link between the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and the EU Institutions. In this vein, the reference in the European Council’s conclusions to a regulation establishing the procedures to define the conditional requirements is important and we now expect the Commission to come up with a suitable proposal. Even though this is a positive result, it is difficult to consider it adequate. The problem is the basic direction of European economic governance. We persist in treating the symptoms of the illness instead of its causes. Deficits are the effect and not the cause of the crisis. Thinking that we can cure the illness by limiting ourselves to cutting deficits with one hand and refinancing banks with the other is sheer make-believe: it risks deepening the crisis and making the very task of the permanent stability mechanism unsustainable. If we want to treat the illness and not merely the symptoms, then we need to tackle a number of basic problems. We talk about strengthening European competitiveness. Rightly so, but which model of competitiveness are we pursuing? We cannot bring in a model for recovery driven solely by exports to third countries, because this will accentuate imbalances. In order to be more competitive in external trade, we also need to stimulate high-quality internal demand. We must therefore deal with the issue of the banks and the system for providing credit to the economy in order to direct European savings toward long-term investments. We need to equip ourselves with instruments such as Eurobonds, the tax on financial transactions and a budget worthy of the name, in order to make large-scale public investment at a European level that can provide a kick-start for private investment. Finally, we need to think of the European social model as a resource instead of a burden. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

A European regulatory framework in the fight against violence against women represents one crucial step forward within a comprehensive strategy. Only a combination of legal, social, economic and preventive actions will manage to resolve this problem which is rather close to home, given that over a quarter of women in the European Union have experienced violence during their lifetime. Violence against women makes no distinction by age or ethnic or cultural background, and it remains an invisible problem that has nonetheless very high human, social and economic costs. The European Union must affirm its active role in fighting discrimination against women and that is why the Svensson report supports the European Commission in its attempts to create a clear and homogenous regulatory framework in the context of the Stockholm Programme. I am therefore in favour of the request for an instrument of criminal law which would define violence against women as a crime in itself, through the development of a directive against gender-based violence, to be brought in line with the multiple training, prevention and awareness-raising initiatives in order to fight all forms of abuse against women.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the report that we are about to vote for, we still have reservations over the decision to adopt a revision of the Treaty on the intergovernmental character of the mechanism, but at the same time we are in favour, because – as Mr Brok explained – the negotiations that we conducted allowed us to achieve important objectives that relate mainly to the fact that the conditionalities associated with the assistance will be determined by a regulation, hence by a codecision procedure. It is therefore fair to vote in favour and I would like to thank the many fellow MEPs who have contributed to this result and mention the privilege of working with Mr Brok, Mr Pirillo’s extremely useful advice and also the work of the two rapporteurs from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON): Mr Scicluna and Mr Gauzès, Mr Schade, Mrs Häfner and the group coordinators and of course the chairmen of the groups that have given us such significant political support, thank you.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it would not be an exaggeration to say that this is an historic time in the process of Europe-building. The economic crisis has made it clear that the single currency needs real European economic governance and, for the first time, significant and innovative steps are being taken in this direction. At the same time, we are seeing a dangerous trend of giving this new governance an intergovernmental flavour, which not only risks threatening the institutional structure of the European Union, but also making the new mechanisms ineffective. Hence, the permanent stability mechanism is an issue of symbolic and central importance. Indeed, on the one hand, the establishment of a permanent stability mechanism represents a decisive and important step forwards. Parliament supports this decision, although it is important to stress that it must not rule out the possibility of using extraordinary solidarity mechanisms, such as those based on Article 122, which are currently in use. On the other hand, if the establishment of a permanent mechanism is therefore positive, the European Council has chosen to create a purely intergovernmental mechanism, thereby denying in a unique manner the European institutions any role, including in the procedure leading up to its establishment. Amongst other things, this could stir up disputes during the ratification process about the appropriateness of a simplified procedure, given that it is hardly in doubt that cutting back the competences of the European Union would require an ordinary revision procedure. Furthermore, since the treaty states two clear things; that the monetary policy of the Member States whose currency is the euro is an exclusive competence of the European Union, and that the Member States must coordinate their economic policy within the framework of the Union, as the treaty states, a mechanism that operates completely outside the European Union’s institutional structure would scarcely be compatible with these principles and would therefore result in a reduction of the European Union’s powers, which would not be compatible with a simplified revision procedure. This problem could also be raised by a number of national parliaments during the ratification procedure which, as we know, will be a complicated and risky process. Likewise for this reason, Parliament would have preferred a different, more institutionally appropriate and less politically risky procedure, such as Article 352, either alone or in combination with Article 136. The report sets all this out in black and white, but we preferred to concentrate on the substance rather than on procedures so as to reach a realistic yet determined approach. The central point is that the permanent stability fund will be created by the Member States because that is what they decided, but it may also lay the foundations for a new structure lying outside the EU institutions or it might be an intergovernmental wagon within a European Union train, travelling down the tracks of European law. Parliament wants to make a contribution because we are following the latter of these two paths. Hence, we asked in our report for two conditions to be respected: the proposal for an amendment must be redrafted so that the establishment of the mechanism’s distribution is somehow placed within an EU procedure, or that the EU institutions are heavily involved in the practical implementation of the mechanism and, above all, in defining the conditionality measures. What principles and rules should be established for providing assistance? Who shall establish them and how? For this, we need a regulation with an ordinary legislative procedure and we are waiting to consult with the European Council and the Member States on these issues. Roberto Gualtieri,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this has been an important debate which I think has clearly shown the existence of broad consensus among the political groups over the assessments and general direction of the report. With a few exceptions, Parliament is truly speaking with one voice and that is important. We are saying yes to the permanent stability mechanism though we cannot hide some confusion and concern which, as we have learnt, is also shared by the Commission, even though we would have liked to read of these concerns in the opinion of the Commission on the procedure selected. We are open to showing practicality and a sense of responsibility in noting that the political conditions do not exist to set up a European mechanism today and, nevertheless, we have shown and continue to show determination in our desire to help insert the mechanism into the Union’s legal and procedural framework, whilst also respecting the Treaties. Our proposals are clear, but now I think the crucial issue is another. Is the European Council willing to start up a real discussion with Parliament on its proposals and is the Commission willing to take an active role in this discussion? I should like to underline that Parliament has taken what I would call a customary decision to postpone the vote to 24 March. I think this is an important sign: this is a responsible Parliament, but I think the Council also needs to show this sense of responsibility by taking Parliament’s proposals into consideration.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday evening, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, by a large majority, adopted Parliament’s opinion on the amendment to the Treaty to introduce a stability mechanism. The text proposes a change to the amendment to the Treaty of Lisbon, setting out a procedure which, while safeguarding the intergovernmental nature of the fund, justifies the inclusion of the rule in the Treaty. It also contains some clear proposals regarding the operation of the mechanism, designed to make it compatible with the duties that the Treaty assigns to the European institutions and with the need to have real economic governance, which simply would not work if it were intergovernmental. To use a metaphor which you, Mr Barroso, used in the last debate, Parliament proposes putting this intergovernmental wagon on the rails in a Union train and giving the Commission its due role in running this train. How does the Commission view Parliament’s proposals? Is it willing to help push them in the negotiations over the coming days? (The President cut off the speaker) Roberto Gualtieri,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we stand at a crossroads for the future of the Europe Union. After the many delays that we are guilty of, it has become obvious to everyone that Europe needs real economic governance, which must be particularly stringent for those countries that have adopted the euro. We therefore welcome the creation of a permanent stability mechanism, which we feel is a key point in the construction of genuine economic governance in Europe, even if we continue to nurture legal and political reservations on the procedure adopted, which we think is risky and does not make full use of the instruments provided for by the Treaty. I am delighted to hear that you also share these reservations. In any case, we are now focusing on a different point: how will the new mechanism actually work? Will it contribute to strengthening the economic governance of the European Union or will it be a step towards a new (and inevitably discretional) ‘intergovernmentalism’, which is the direction that was also taken by the unfortunate wording of the Franco-German competitiveness pact? Basically, in what direction is this train setting off? Who will be driving it? Indeed, on the one hand, the proposed amendment to Article 136 sets out an intergovernmental mechanism that is entirely disconnected from the Union and its institutions, while, on the other, we can read in the opinion of the Commission that the mechanism shall have to rely on economic governance exercised by the Union and that the Commission will take all measures to ensure consistency between the stability mechanism and the aforementioned economic governance. We do appreciate these intentions but, since there is no sign of any of this in the proposal to amend Article 136, we think that this is the time to clearly define how this mechanism will work. What procedure will be adopted to put the mechanism in place? What role will the Commission have in its management and in defining the conditions for its application? What will be the composition of the secretariat? What does the Council think about what Mr Barroso has just said on the validity of the current extraordinary solidarity mechanisms? Will there be a role for the European Parliament? I believe that only a rewording of the amendment to Article 136 or, alternatively, a clear declaration from the European Council on these issues, will enable Parliament to adopt an opinion in line with the desired schedule of the European Council.

Mr Present, ladies and gentlemen, I am a keen supporter of regard for the European Union and the competences assigned to it by the Treaties, which I believe also represent the best way to carry out our role as the direct representatives of the citizens of the European Union. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, ladies and gentlemen, I see two major problems with the proposed amendment to Article 136, one of them institutional and the other political. The institutional one is that Article 3 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that monetary policy for the countries whose currency is the euro is the exclusive competence of the Union, but Article 2 provides that exclusive competence may be exercised by the Member States if authorised by the Union. It is difficult to understand why the application of a rule clearly set out in the Treaty should require reform of the Treaty. Then there is also a political problem: choosing the Treaty reform option, rather than using Article 2 or Articles 352 plus 136, places the European Stability Mechanism, and hence the future of the euro, at the mercy of 27 ratification processes. Do people realise that if just one of these 27 ratification processes proved unsuccessful, it would then be difficult to find a plan B for the euro? Does the European Council realise that choosing this path puts the future of the euro at great risk? Roberto Gualtieri,

 Mr President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, there seems to be positive agreement between Mr Danjean’s remarks and what you said in your speech, Baroness Ashton, regarding the analysis of the situation, which is that the situation in the Sahel is critical. We are talking about one of the poorest regions in the world, bordering on some of the countries that have been shaken over the last week by more dangerous instability than ever. It is also a region where terrorist infiltration and drug trafficking are intertwined to a truly worrying extent. All that makes the situation unsustainable and a real threat to Europe. We therefore need to see a qualitative leap in Europe’s initiative. The 2009 initiative for security and development in the Sahel has so far proved ineffective. What is needed is the new strategy for security in the Sahel that the Council of Foreign Ministers have called to adopt, which we are awaiting. I believe there are two important points that have been highlighted: firstly, a regional approach; and secondly, an integrated approach that enables us to make the best possible use of the various instruments available to the EU in a concrete, operational and coordinated way. We must realise, however, that the path for a possible mission must be assessed very carefully, because Common Security and Defence Policy missions are one of the instruments we have available, but they are no replacement for a political strategy. Our group therefore fully endorses Europe’s new, renewed commitment in the Sahel and we are anxious to see the new strategy, discuss it in detail and support its implementation. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, procedure is the stuff of democracy and therefore the implementation of the citizens’ initiative was not merely a technical exercise but imposed crucial choices that made it possible to turn the citizens’ initiative into an instrument effectively capable of helping to build a genuine European political space. Parliament undoubtedly exercised its prerogatives in an exemplary manner, significantly improving the original proposal. The main results have already mentioned and I do not need to remind you of them. I would, however, like to emphasise another one, to which our group made a significant contribution: European political parties will also be able to promote a citizens’ initiative. This is an outcome of great significance because the fate of European democracy lies at its heart, since there can be no genuine international democracy until European political parties take on an effective role in the democratic process. Today we are taking a step forward in this direction and this is another reason why it is a great day for European democracy. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the new strategic concept developed by NATO contains important, positive changes to meet the challenges of the 21st century in a manner consistent with the values of the Atlantic Pact. In particular, we welcome the revival of the strategic partnership with Russia, the explicit formulation of the goal of a world without nuclear weapons, the recognition of the importance of a stronger European defence, the reaffirmation of the principle of collective defence and, at the same time, the statements that NATO does not consider any country to be its adversary. There are still, however, problems and contradictions that this far from new concept does nothing to dispel. Firstly, there is no clear and unambiguous commitment to the elimination of tactical nuclear weapons, which are still deployed in Europe even though they are strategically anachronistic and economically increasingly unsustainable. Secondly, the European Union's role in the strategic concept is still insufficient and the planned civilian crisis management capabilities are at risk of pointlessly duplicating those of the European Union. We are aware of the political problems that hinder more effective EU-NATO cooperation, but this cannot get in the way of developing an operational perspective, complementarity and synergies that are a match for our ambitions. Helicopters, medical support and explosives represent significant progress but are not enough: we need vision and an active commitment and we call on you, Baroness Ashton, to deploy them both with strength and clarity. Roberto Gualtieri,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament approves the establishment of a new section of the budget for the European External Action Service (EEAS) and the provision of additional funds for staff. This position is due to Parliament’s desire to see the EEAS set up, because Europe urgently needs it, but, of course, it does not mean that it will give up its role as budgetary authority in the debate on the nature of the body that will deal with crisis management or on the priorities of staff policy, as shown by the reserve that we established in the 2011 budget. The regulations that we are going to adopt reinforce the outcomes of the Madrid agreement and, in some cases, go further, for which I would like to thank Mr Rapkay, Mrs Gräßle and Mr Rivellini. I must also thank Baroness Ashton and Mr Christophersen for their willingness and openness in our discussions. The Staff Regulations ensure that all EEAS staff will have the same rights and duties irrespective of their origin, and requires the High Representative to ensure a geographical and gender balance. These arrangements will be binding and Parliament will make sure that they are complied with. At the same time, they avoid the use of quotas, which would be not just difficult to implement but also wrong. The Financial Regulation ensures a solid control system and keeps the EEAS closely tied to the Commission. I welcome the success we have achieved with the setting up of specific budget lines for the main common security and defence policy missions, which represents a major leap forward for Parliament’s ability to exercise control over the common foreign and security policy. With tomorrow’s vote, therefore, we will have an EEAS that is stronger, more communautaire
 and subject to greater Parliamentary scrutiny. We will be strict and demanding in performing this scrutiny but, at the same time, we will do it responsibly and in a constructive spirit, since we are determined to help the High Representative in the colossal task of providing Europe with a real foreign policy to serve its values and interests. Roberto Gualtieri,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think the genuine satisfaction that has emerged in this debate shows that Members were aware of just how difficult yet important the task facing us was. How to unify functions associated with different policies and subject to different decision-making procedures in order to make the European Union’s external actions more consistent, without endangering the communautaire
 nature of certain policies, but embracing the contributions of bodies operating in the field of the common security and defence policy, was not merely a problem of European law or administration science or a test of the power relations between institutions. Instead, it was a necessary condition if we were to endow the High Representative with an instrument that could enhance Europe’s potential on the world stage, strengthen its role as a civilised power, and allow us to act more effectively in the Middle East, the Horn of Africa, the Caucasus or the Balkans. Well, I think we have risen to the challenge marvellously, and so our satisfaction is fully justified. The High Representative will, I believe, enjoy Parliament’s exacting support as she performs her duties. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is very important to make a success of this budget procedure, not just because it is the first budget under the Treaty of Lisbon, with a new procedure and new functions for the European Union, but especially because it comes at a crucial time for the future of Europe, affected as it has been by a severe crisis. Faced with the crisis, many governments think of an economic governance model based entirely on stability mechanisms, which means cutting their national budgets and perhaps also the European budget. We, on the other hand, think that a stronger European budget, supported by own resources and also a financial transaction tax, is a precondition for effective European economic governance and for greater discipline in national budgets. We must therefore decide which way to go, and to that end, the amendments that the President-in-Office of the Council has considered inappropriate are, in fact, extremely important. However, the greatest disagreements concern the figures, of course. In this respect, I would urge the Council to make up its mind, because it cannot want to keep strictly to the margins and, at the same time, expect Parliament not to bring its own priorities into play. The Treaty of Lisbon is quite clear on this: the Council is paramount as regards the quantity of spending, whereas Parliament has the last word on the quality of spending. Thinking about heading 4, we are not against increasing funding for the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) or for the Industrialised Countries Instrument (ICI+), but we do not want it to be at the expense of our priorities: first Palestine and then development cooperation. The Council therefore has three options to choose from: it can accept Parliament’s priorities, or it can agree to a revision of the margins, or it can accept greater flexibility of the budget and in the budget, in the knowledge that Parliament will stand united in defence of its prerogatives and priorities. Roberto Gualtieri,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the strengthening of the industrial and technological basis of European defence is an essential part of developing a common defence system. What it needs, however, are common rules and a coordinated approach in order to enhance the development and competitiveness of the European defence industry and, at the same time, to ensure that this development is in line with Europe’s principles and international commitments. To that end, together with the directive on the internal market in defence, the December 2008 common position defining procedures and criteria for military exports to third countries was an important step forward. As we know, these procedures do not include a general consultation mechanism. However, the common position does include a timely reference to the need to enhance cooperation and convergence in this field within the framework of the common foreign and security policy. Until the hoped-for progress on this front, and until such time as the creation of a common defence system makes it possible to adopt even more binding mechanisms, the cooperation and convergence referred to in Article 7 should not remain just on paper and the annual report on military exports should be made available to Parliament. Naturally, the question tabled by the Members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) seems implicitly – although it has now been made explicit – not to confine itself to matters of a general nature. Given that it would have been better to refer to things by their names right from the start, it does not seem that the sale of French ships to Russia contravenes the 2008 common position. On the contrary, such exports could strengthen European-Russian ties and cooperation in the security field and make them more binding. These ties, however, should be removed from the bilateral sphere and be entirely addressed, discussed and managed at a European level. Roberto Gualtieri,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets.

 Mr President, Mrs Ashton, Mr Šefčovič, ladies and gentlemen, clearly, the report on which we are preparing to vote is not a simple opinion, but the result of intense negotiating efforts, for which I would like to thank the High Representative and the Spanish Presidency. These are negotiations in which Parliament played a prominent role in significantly improving the text of the decision that the Council will have to adopt. The compromise reached in Madrid is fully in line with the objectives that guided this highly coordinated work carried out by Mr Brok and Mr Verhofstadt: to provide Europe with a service that has resources and powers sufficient to increase the consistency and effectiveness of the EU’s external action, but which is, at the same time, closely linked to the Community method and the Commission, and subject to the full democratic control of the European Parliament. I, too, would like to say to those who have mentioned so-called red lines that the European Parliament must not cross, that it is precisely because Parliament has been able to exercise its prerogatives fully and dynamically, and even cross some of the red lines outlined by governments, that Europe will have a more effective, more democratic and more European service. I am talking about a service, for instance, that is able to reconcile development cooperation policies with the rest of the EU’s external action, without undermining either the necessary independence of those policies or the Commission’s responsibility. Parliament shall continue to make strong and determined use of its legislative and budget prerogatives, especially over the coming months, in order to define the Staff Regulations and the Financial Regulation in accordance with the basic outline of this report. It will also carefully supervise the actual development of the service and ensure that the letter and spirit of the Madrid Agreement are fully respected, beginning with the proper participation of European officials at the helm of the service and in the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) budget reform. It will also make use of these prerogatives to provide the High Representative of the service’s officials with its full support as the European Parliament, an institution which cares more than any other about the development of a true European foreign policy and about its gradual communitisation, in which the Madrid Agreement is an important stage.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Madam High Representative/Vice-President, I would like to emphasise the fact that we are discussing three excellent documents drawn up by Parliament: ambitious documents that express clear stances, make clear-cut choices and are subject to broad consensus between the groups within this Parliament who care about Europe and its future. It is an important fact, demonstrating Parliament’s will and ability to offer itself as a candidate to play a central role in CFSP/CSDP on the basis of what I would call a dynamic reading of the Treaty of Lisbon. We intend to exercise this role in the process of constructing the External Action Service, not only to guarantee Parliament’s prerogatives, but also to contribute to making the service an organisation capable of ensuring that EU external action is consistent and efficient while, at the same time, strengthening and gradually extending the community method. As regards the Danjean report, I would like to highlight that the concept of strategic autonomy is presented in the context of a multilateral approach, and that it is a condition for strengthening the strategic partnership with the United States. I would also like to highlight the fact that Parliament is united in requesting an Operations Centre, and I am glad that you, High Representative, have declared yourself open to a more exhaustive discussion of this idea. Concerning the non-proliferation resolution, I would like to underline the importance of envisaging a world free from nuclear weapons, the clear judgment on the anachronism of tactical nuclear weapons and the value of the positions recently adopted by some European governments on this front. Thus, Parliament’s message is clear, realistic and ambitious, and we hope that the High Representative is able to grasp and endorse it. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the unprecedented humanitarian disaster in Haiti affects us deeply and the European Union has a duty to contribute as best it can to the efforts by the international community, using all the tools at its disposal. As far as financial resources are concerned, significant progress has been made in recent days and hours. What deserves more thought is the other aspects of Europe’s response to the crisis, but we should avoid worrying about our image and concentrate instead on the substance, as the High Representative rightly said. The central role of the MINUSTAH mission has now emerged clearly, in terms of both civil protection and security, ruling out an autonomous CSDP mission, but the EU’s coordination role in support of the UN mission remains key. On this point, I would like to remind Mr Juvin that this coordination exists, and that the Monitoring and Information Centre is performing it in the area of civil protection, and the Situation Centre is performing it in the area of security, and it is to be hoped that this work will result in deployment of the European Gendarmerie Force, as has been expressly requested by the United Nations. What it is useful to understand from the High Representative and from the Commission is how the MIC and the Situation Centre are responding, in practice, in the face of such onerous tasks and tests, how their coordination is working, and whether their instruments and resources are adequate. This will also help us at a later date when we will have to consider the adequacy of these instruments and the capacity of consular protection, but now is not the time for these debates. Now is the time for action and commitment, and we fully support the action being taken by the High Representative. Roberto Gualtieri,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the developments in the situation in Iran, one cannot help but express serious concern. These concerns relate to the increasing infringements of political and civil rights, which we strongly condemn, and concern over the failure to perform the duties resulting from Iran’s membership of the Non-Proliferation Agreement, upon which even the country itself states it does not want to cast any doubt. We do not question Iran’s right to the peaceful development of nuclear energy, nor do we intend to underestimate the important role that Iran can play on a regional level, its legitimate security requirements, or the need to create a credible system of regional security that involves all the nuclear powers in the area. It is precisely because of this, though, that we do not understand the reasons for the failure to comply with the request by the International Atomic Energy Agency for the uranium to be enriched abroad, and we regret this decision. Faced with this situation, it falls to the Security Council to determine the international community’s response and the possibility of new sanctions, which should be focused on non-proliferation and designed to be an instrument to support the path of difficult but unavoidable dialogue, and not designed and used to beat down the regime. With regard to this course of action, the European Union should play its part by giving thought, at the appropriate time and in the appropriate form, to possible technical measures to complement the UN sanctions and, at the same time, by confirming its readiness for debate and dialogue, which should never be lost, even at difficult times. We will fully support action by the European Union and the High Representative in line with the approach that was set out clearly in the High Representative’s speech. Rosario Crocetta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that today is a great result for Parliament, because when I wrote to President Buzek on 15 July saying that ‘we need to set up an anti-mafia committee’, I remember many Members from different countries saying, ‘But the mafia is only a problem in Sicily and in Italy’. Today, recognition by our fellow Members from the north and from the whole of Europe that there is a problem of ‘organised crime in Europe’, and the desire to fight it together is, I believe, a momentous fact, and I would like to thank you, Mr President, and Parliament as a whole.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if Arab dictators shoot at the crowd the West immediately responds, with no-fly zones, UN intervention, and so on. If, on the other hand, the Israeli air force bombs Gaza there is silence, because it is natural for Israel to bomb the Palestinian people. Yet the lack of a solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict is the main cause of conflict between the Arab world and the West, and it provides strength to extremists. Today the Arab revolutions have brought a fresh wave of democracy to North Africa and the Middle East. This cannot fail to have an effect on the relationship between Palestinians and Israelis, too. The very existence of Israel is in some way linked to an understanding of this cause. Either Israel accepts the existence of a Palestinian state, or Israel will no longer be able to live in the same conditions in that region. Within this framework, I believe that it would be very hypocritical for Europe not to give the Palestinians the same support that it is giving to those who are today fighting for freedom and rights in the Arab world and elsewhere. This is because I believe that the right of people to have their own land, to govern themselves, and to have their own state is an inalienable right, and I believe that Europe should support the Palestinian resolution at the UN.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Commissioner Malmström for having forcefully raised the issue of an anti-corruption package, however I must be honest. Those who, like me, live in a Mafia-controlled area and have also paid and continue to pay a terrible price for it, are not amongst those who are convinced that a magical law is all it takes to finally put a stop to corruption. This seems to be the main problem and cause of the state of emergency we currently find ourselves in. Corruption is an ancient art, much older than the world itself, and has probably now become part and parcel of the way in which politics is done, not only in Italy, but in many other countries too. I strongly support what the Commissioner said: we must ensure that we fully emphasise the importance of this policy. When considering how to combat corruption, we must start by asking ourselves how public procurement procedures are conducted; what the threshold is for cases in which a degree of discretion is allowed; whether or not a monitoring network exists to monitor, for example, whoever wins a contract; how people have accumulated their wealth; whether or not there are any rules for tracing money; and how we check whether politicians who have been found guilty have actually been sentenced and imprisoned, or ascertain whether they are still members of parliament, protected by their parties and the laws of their country. We should start a revolution, so to speak; I personally would make the fight against corruption, the Mafia and organised crime the focus of this second half of the parliamentary term, in order to tell the Spanish ‘Indignados
’ that we want a better Europe, a freer Europe, a more transparent Europe, and to tell the young people participating in the Arab Spring that we too want to change the world, and that we want to enact serious change. So, congratulations, Commissioner, but let us do more. Rosario Crocetta,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Beijing’s justification for the arrest of the artist Ai Weiwei for economic crimes is not convincing, and neither is the need to treat a free, dissident artist so harshly. It is not convincing since this arrest is one of hundreds of arrests of opponents and part of the systematic repression of all signs of dissent. At a time when uprisings are breaking out in the Arab world, we think back to the images of cruel violence in Tiananmen Square against young Chinese who, just like today’s Jasmine revolutionaries, were demanding freedom and democracy. China has opened up to the West in economic terms without, however, linking production to respect for the environment and safety at work, and it is unable to embrace democracy and pluralism in any form whatsoever. This is not interference on our part in Chinese internal affairs, as Beijing maintains, but the appeal of men and women, of movements and parties that intend to build a world free of intolerance on every continent. The Beijing government should watch what is happening in the world to grasp that, if it does not change, it will be historic events and Chinese citizens that will change China.

Then, it was considered one of the most democratic countries of the Gulf and has been considered so even in recent years. So one must say, imagine what happens in other countries given that Saudi Arabia performs a few hundred executions a year, given that terrible massacres take place in Iran, given that throughout the Gulf, killings are commonplace and there is complete denial of the rights of the press. Today, we approved the resolution on Syria, Yemen and Bahrain, but when we will prepare a resolution for Saudi Arabia, for Algeria, for China and for the other countries which violate human rights in the world?

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is sad to note that sometimes, the West can find great solidarity when it comes to bombing, sending companies into third world countries and taking oil, but finds it more of a struggle to make solidarity and migration policies. This evening’s debate touches on these themes. I went to Lampedusa on Monday and saw 4 000 - 5 000 people on the ground, huddling together to sleep under the sun and the rain, doing their business where they ate and not being able to change the wet clothes – which some have said were designer labels, but are, in fact, fake designer labels – they had on during the crossing, in lamentable conditions. Among these were 4 500 children, 12-13 year-old kids, living under the same conditions, conditions of discomfort shared also by the inhabitants of Lampedusa. Tunisia is now home to 150 000 migrants who come from Libya and shows its solidarity. It is a poor country showing solidarity, while wealthy Europe is unable to accommodate 5 000 migrants. Europe should instead show its solidarity to these wonderful kids who have sparked the Jasmine Revolution originating in Sidi Bouzid that is changing North Africa and the world.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Egypt: from the virtual community on Facebook to the real one, with millions of people seeking fairer distribution of wealth and greater justice, and protesting against corruption. We must move on from the transition period of soldiers and tanks to a true democracy: a new constitution, new elections, abolition of the death penalty, more humane prisons, social rights and freedom. It will be difficult. Those who are willing to deploy any means in the name of an idea are lying in wait. We want to believe in the great Egyptian people, who have not, however, ever experienced democracy. We want a secular democracy, with a distinct separation between religious authority and political power, a democracy that integrates minorities and establishes true rights: to public healthcare, social security and work. Europe is supporting this approach by investing resources with the ability to promote real development in Egypt: no more dictatorships, no more misery, no more poverty. Rosario Crocetta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commissioner for having devoted her attention to the issue of Tunisia. To be sincere, I would have liked this debate to be given a different title, namely ‘Debate in support of Tunisia and other countries fighting against dictatorships and for human rights’. Instead, we are making a humanitarian crisis out of the fact that one of the greatest world powers, Italy, is having to tackle the problem of taking in 5 000 people. Of course, for Lampedusa, these refugees are a problem, even though a daily ferry links the island to Sicily and there is also an airport through which these people can be taken away. We have to realise that what is being discussed at the moment is not the problem of Frontex or how to stop the boats, but the fact that we are dealing with peoples whom we have urged to fight for democracy and, now that they are doing so, we must be in a position to receive them. Granting more visas is one policy that Italy can pursue to try to help those countries. Rosario Crocetta  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is time that Europe made efforts to give the Tunisian people and their transitional government concrete support and to re-launch a Euro-Mediterranean dialogue that has been badly neglected in recent years. The explosion of anger among the young people and the poor in the Maghreb and Egypt has been caused by the inequitable distribution of wealth and restrictions on people exercising their fundamental freedoms. North Africa is fired up and is demanding more democracy, better economies, more participation and more employment, while looking in disbelief at the old continent of Europe, which is immobile and unable to grasp the social transformation that has taken place in the region or to develop genuine policies for progress and peace. Europe needs to be pay closer attention to human rights and democracy and must promote more dialogue, more collaboration and more genuine economic assistance. Europe must open its doors and its heart to North Africa, so that the Mediterranean can become a sea of peace. There must be no more rejection of migrants through violent collaboration with countries like Libya. What we need is more investment, more openness, more aid and more of a Euro-Mediterranean policy. History demands it of us. Rosario Crocetta,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by asking for the immediate release of Nasrin Sotoudeh, we are urging the Union and its Member States to do more to liberate Iranian citizens and the world from one of the cruellest and most authoritarian regimes in history. The Islamic Republic of Iran is characterised not only by the threat it poses to world peace with a nuclear project capable of evoking the terror of nuclear war, but also by the illegitimacy of its elections; mass arrests of people requesting free elections; the killing of objectors; the rape and physical abuse of those who do not support the regime; the iniquity of judicial processes, where decisions can be predicted as soon as the accusations have been made; serious discrimination against women and homosexuals; and the absence of freedom of expression and of association. The conditions of Iranian prisoners in Camp Ashraf, where they are subjected to violence and even stoning, are absolutely incredible. Every day, at least two people, including children, are sentenced to death in Iran, and they are guilty of nothing more than of not pleasing the regime. Legal evidence is often created through the cruel and skilful use of brutal methods of torture. These criticisms are certainly not aimed at Islam, which is based on peace, but at the Iranian regime. The arrest and conviction of Nasrin Sotoudeh bring to light a new level of judicial deceit, since in this case, the attack and conviction are against a defender of the people, which means that citizens of Iran cannot even defend themselves.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the purpose of my speech is to point out the severity of the deindustrialisation process affecting a range of Sicilian industrial centres, in particular, the Termini Imerese automotive centre owned by the FIAT group, and the Gela petrochemical centre belonging to the ENI group. Termini Imerese is being damaged by the competition arising from the low salary system within some EU countries, whilst Gela is being damaged by competition from Asia. With regard to the severe deindustrialisation processes that are taking place in widespread areas of the Union, I would argue that the time has come to reconsider the policy of non-intervention that the European Commission has adopted up until now, and to begin to launch a set of important, strategic measures to support European industry. This call is addressed chiefly to the European Commission and to Mr Tajani, the Commissioner for Industry and Entrepreneurship. Rosario Crocetta  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as someone who has visited Tunisia two to three times per year since 1982 and who, as a Catholic, on 6 January attended mass, as I regularly do, I find it truly difficult to think of Tunisia as a country which suppresses religious freedom. There are problems, but for Heaven’s sake let us not to look at these countries, countries which are trying to make progress, through the prism of Western countries, because if we were to use that parameter, a parameter which someone is using this morning with regard to Tunisia, then certain European countries would probably be denied entry into the European Union, because the violence and denial of freedom which exists there is on a greater scale than in Tunisia. Thus, the issue arises as a result of one concrete fact: namely, that we have before us a country which has abolished Islamic fundamentalism, which is making efforts to develop a cooperation and peace policy with Europe, which is trying to evolve. There are problems. I believe that the way to solve these problems is to strengthen dialogue and friendship and to help these countries to achieve more. Rosario Crocetta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we were in Ramallah when we heard the news that Europe had adopted a new decision on the Middle East peace process. We saw the hopeful smiles on the faces of the Palestinian representatives. They were days filled with emotion and suffering, etched on the faces of the children gripping the window bars of their homes on the Hebron road, the deserted road that no Palestinian is allowed to cross. We saw the suffering of an 85-year-old woman, driven out of her occupied home, forced to sleep in the cold in a tent set up in the garden of what used to be her own house, and the suffering on the faces of the Palestinians who had built a farm using European funds, subsequently destroyed by Israeli soldiers. Israel has the right to be an independent state, but the Palestinians also have the right to a homeland, a state and a passport. The decision of the Council of Europe represents a considerable step forward, but we need to act immediately. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is just the tip of the iceberg in a larger conflict. On the final day of our visit, the Israeli authorities prevented us, the European Parliament delegation, from visiting the Gaza Strip. I believe that in this regard, the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, should step in to protest on behalf of democratic Europe. I should like to thank Mr De Rossa who led the delegation and all the other members of the delegation, because during the days we spent in Palestine, the vulnerable were able to see and hear the face and the words of a Europe which upholds rights and wishes to, and must, do more.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, concerning the request from the Council that we approve the proposal for exchanges of information between Europol and partners, including third countries, one can see what this would lead to: the proposal, if approved, would create the absurd situation of regulating, among other things, the exchange of information between Europol and third countries without Parliament having yet approved any such list of countries. This proposal, in its depiction of the handling of personal data, seems to pave the way for the creation of a truly limitless database which could even be made available to third parties that have not yet been specified by Parliament. Article 15(2) of the Council’s proposal states that in cases of absolute necessity, even where there is no suggestion that a crime has been carried out, data may be transmitted that reveal a person’s race, ethnic origin, political stance, religious and philosophical convictions, trade union membership and so on, without it being specified what is meant by ‘absolute necessity’ and, worse still, by endorsing the idea that there is such a thing as racial groups. It would be interesting to hear the Council clarify what a racial group is and which racial groups exist. As far as I am concerned, I believe that there is only one race – the human race. For these reasons, but also to maintain the independence of Parliament, which must work within the necessary time limits, I believe that the Council’s proposal in its present form must be rejected by the requested deadline of 30 November.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank you for asking the Belgian and French authorities to provide me with police protection. To feel the solidarity of the institutions when you are on the frontline fighting a phenomenon such as the mafia in Italy, which has resulted in many victims over many years, is really important in my view, and I offer my heartfelt thanks. However, for some time, Mr President, mafia organisations have been a global phenomenon: not just through money laundering, but also through their permanent presence in various European countries, and also via immigration. When, on 16 July this year, I called for the establishment of a committee of inquiry into mafia organisations in Europe, I did so with the aim not only of serving my country, but also the European Community, in the belief that a lack of vigilance when it comes to organised crime associations such as the mafia could have a negative impact on citizens’ quality of life and safety and on development mechanisms. And it is strange, I have finished, Mr President ... (The President cut off the speaker) Salvatore Caronna  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted for this report and I would like to congratulate Mr Alfonsi once again, because I believe macro-regional strategies can be a tool for creating added value for the whole of Europe. That is why it is important to continue along this path, though subject to certain specific conditions. Macro-regional strategies have to be developed around a well-defined geographical area with specific, uniform characteristics. In addition, strategies must be functional and stakeholders must be willing to push forward the integration process. Essentially, the regional approach should guide local communities towards integration at a higher level in order to address and overcome challenges that they would be unable to tackle otherwise, if they did not cooperate. With regard to the Mediterranean area, I think it is important that the report envisages one strategy for the western Mediterranean and another for the eastern basins, in other words, the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. In particular, it is significant that there is already a very high degree of coordination in the Adriatic and Ionian region. I therefore believe the Commission and the Council should follow up this important report. Salvatore Caronna  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the role of the cooperative movement has always been important for creating a more balanced and just economy. Currently, while we are going through one of the most serious economic and social crises since the war, the function of cooperative societies has become crucial. It is quite clear that where there has been substantial development of the cooperative dimension in the economy, the result has been an increase in employment, more skilled labour and more equitable redistribution of the wealth generated. Therefore, it is good that the European Union has adopted a statute for cooperative societies, but now more than ever, there needs to be a real simplification of the rules. We need to give new incentives for the creation of a common European framework on cooperatives and this must occur by giving assistance and not creating bureaucratic obstacles. This is why I voted in favour of this resolution and I hope that the Commission and the Council will take action to resolve the problems mentioned. Salvatore Caronna  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the creation of a European Higher Education Area is a major goal that the European Union has set for itself. However, despite the progress made with the Bologna Declaration – which, as noted, dates back to 1999 – we have got to recognise the fact that in terms of student mobility and the harmonisation of degrees across the various countries, the results have been far from satisfactory. That is why I voted in favour of this report. We need to move forward with greater speed on this issue and reverse the trend – especially in some countries – of cutting investment in education. Accordingly, the harmonisation put forward under the Bologna Declaration is still essential in order to improve the entire European education system and make the labour market more dynamic. I, too, would like to applaud Mr Berlinguer for his excellent work. Salvatore Caronna  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Parliament’s vote relating to the scheme for distribution of food products to deprived persons for the next two years was, above all, a mandatory step, bearing in mind also the fact that a few weeks ago, we approved a report against food waste that had amongst its targets the fundamental objective of helping the most needy sections of the population. It is unthinkable that at a time of economic crisis and social suffering like the present, we should not be responding, albeit partially, in such a way. In such a perspective, it is to be hoped that we will find a definitive solution for the entire 2014-2020 period. As we are seeing at the moment in the squares of Athens, the image of a European Union capable only of imposing cuts and sacrifices is a devastating one. We need to offer an alternative Europe capable of solidarity and of taking care of those in difficulty, and we need to do it soon. Salvatore Caronna

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first, I would like to thank the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their cooperation during the drafting of this report. This fruitful collaboration meant that we were able, swiftly and almost unanimously, to approve a text on an issue, that of the waste of food, which has, for too long, been underestimated by the institutions and by policy. We can no longer permit ourselves to underestimate it. All the most authoritative specialist sources now say that one of the main problems in the immediate future will be to tackle the new and extremely high demand for food and that therefore, the issue of food security has become one of the most difficult problems to tackle because, in the future, the demand for food will tend to exceed supply. If this is true, we can no longer allow ourselves to remain passive in the face of food waste. When we talk of food, we are talking of food that is still perfectly edible, and so this issue has become a large-scale problem which is no longer sustainable. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) estimates that a third of food produced every year in the world that is intended for human consumption is wasted, and in Europe, the figure is already 50%, with every citizen on average wasting 105 kilograms per year. We have reached such a level, in fact, that we have to say that we are faced not only with an ethical problem, but with a real economic and social issue, with enormous implications for the environment. That is why, through this report, we want combating food waste to become a priority on the European Union’s policy agenda. We are therefore asking for the Commission to lead the 27 Member States in adopting a common strategy that can foster a real step change to reduce food waste significantly by 2025. We therefore ask that all the associations, volunteer groups and initiative-taking centres that have produced specific projects in this area in various countries should be turned to good account. These experiences have generated a virtuous system which has guaranteed significant recovery of products to be sent to those sections of the population that are experiencing financial difficulties. I would like to remind you that in Europe, wealthy Europe, nearly 70 million citizens live under the poverty threshold and suffer from malnutrition. We are therefore asking for precise directives from the Commission. Specifically, it would be important to amend the regulations on public procurement for catering services in canteens and hospitals so that, when they are being considered, priority is given, other terms being equal, to those enterprises that have a management model established on combating food waste. On this aspect, I would like to point out that the important fact is that the first to set an example should be the European institutions, starting with this Parliament. Finally, we are calling for all stakeholders in the agri-food industry to take responsibility. A real awareness-raising campaign needs to be conducted, targeted firstly at the large farmers’ organisations, the world of industry, schools and universities, which can produce a civil and scientific culture oriented towards a more restrained and environmentally sustainable model of consumption. With this report, the European Parliament has done its part. Now we hope that the Commission will address this work by putting an effective strategy in train. Above all, we hope that swift action will be taken to declare 2014 the European Year against Food Waste; this would be a tangible sign of the institution’s true, strong and immediate commitment in this area. This would give an immediate signal to all citizens that the European Union is able to be at the forefront in establishing a fairer and balanced development model. Salvatore Caronna  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are currently living through a period that is decisive for the future of the euro and with it of the whole European project. Being aware of this would mean abandoning a short-sighted logic that subordinates everything to an ideological balance of payments straitjacket. We all want various countries’ books to be in order. We all want to reduce debt. Nevertheless, it is clear that without a sensible policy of investment capable of breathing life into the economy, there will be no possibility of growth. The one clear outcome of this approach is that the greatest price will, as usual, be paid by the least well-off. That is why we in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have voted against this report. In fact, it continues down a one-way street that is one of austerity without growth, a direction that has so far proved to be the wrong one. Salvatore Caronna  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very appreciative of the work done by Ms Ferreira in this report. In fact, this was the only one of the package’s six legislative proposals devoted to economic governance for which my group and I voted. We did so because it includes, among other things, a clause on the protection of social rights, starting with collective bargaining, and because it also strengthens Parliament’s role in the adoption of delegated acts. Therefore, although we cannot change the overall balance of the six-pack, with this report we are definitely making progress towards, among other things, a surveillance system that takes account of fundamental rights. In this context, then, although a vision based solely on a policy of austerity does not, in our view, produce positive results, this positive report certainly bucks that trend. Salvatore Caronna  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I had no hesitation in voting in favour of the report by Ms Zimmer, above all, for one purely political reason: I think we need to bring this major issue of food security right back to the core of all European Union initiatives. It is not only a matter of helping developing countries to tackle this issue more effectively. Rather, since the demand for agricultural products is set to increase by more than 70% between now and 2050, the food crisis is a key issue that must be dealt with quickly and decisively. Otherwise, it may become one of the main threats – if not the main threat - to stability, peace and, as we have seen, even democracy. I think it is therefore incumbent upon the European Union and the Member States to take the required steps to properly tackle this important issue, beginning with adequate investment, as the report proposes. Salvatore Caronna,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that the challenge of the coming years is to ensure that Europe, as has been said, maintains its position as the world’s number one tourist destination and, at the same time, is able to enhance its entire territorial heritage, both in terms of environmental protection and competitiveness. The challenge is a difficult one and not to be taken lightly, having regard not only to the opportunities but also to the aggressiveness of other countries in this sector, of other continents from China to India and Brazil. Against this backdrop, as Commissioner Tajani mentioned, and as noted also in the opinion that we approved on the Committee on Regional Development, having a strong, general, EU-wide strategy on tourism with an enhanced role for the regions and territories becomes fundamental. Accordingly, in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity, it is essential that regions and local authorities are fully involved from the outset. Moreover, I believe that the development of integrated tourist networks and projects should be encouraged through the creation of partnerships for the exchange of best practice. I think that the proposal to identify a ‘Europe brand’ that is capable of defining a high quality of tourist product is also good. Obviously, it will be up to the Commission to define better the priorities, above all from a financial point of view, to guarantee that Europe retains its number one position in future.

Mr President, I voted in favour of the report by Mr Garriga Polledo on the forthcoming financial perspectives of the Union because, at one of the greatest times of crisis for the so-called European spirit, I am convinced that it is vital for us to insist upon and prevail in our belief that it is essential to provide the Union with credible instruments, beginning with adequate funding. The request for a 5% increase in the next budget is therefore just and necessary. Perhaps it will not be enough, but it is essential in order to provide answers to the big questions that lie ahead: these resources are needed to tackle real problems, such as greater cohesion between the regions, a greater capacity for research and innovation, and a greater capacity to generate growth and provide jobs. Without adequate resources, none of these problems will be properly dealt with, beginning with the introduction of the intermediate category in cohesion policy, which only makes sense if it does not harm the other categories already in place. That is why I voted in favour and I hope that the Commission and the Council will follow the recommendations of the report. Salvatore Caronna  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the adoption of the report by Mrs Podimata represents a significant step forward for a more balanced, more progressive and stronger economic and fiscal policy in Europe. It is now clear to everyone that Europe, as the coordinating authority of the 27 countries, urgently needs to equip itself with economic and financial instruments that are capable of controlling the economy and not just submitting to it. For this reason, the proposed taxation of financial transactions has caused quite a stir and generated a large amount of attention and discussion. The fact that the majority of this Parliament has voted for this regulation is important and significant because, for the first time, things were not just left to ride and instead, we have achieved a step forward. I do hope that the Commission and the Council will continue on this path. Salvatore Caronna  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Open Days have been taking place here in Brussels over the last few days. Many municipal and regional representatives have been talking about how to address the serious problems our cities are facing and about the old and new needs affecting workers, families, and small and large production companies alike. The economic crisis that has hit our societies has made it harder and more difficult for all of us to find suitable solutions to a new and serious social issue. In this context, I believe everyone has come to understand that, time and again, cohesion policy has been the only real instrument the regions have had available to them for trying to provide solutions. We can therefore say that over the last few years, cohesion policy has provided a vital fillip to the European integration process for all of the regions. Now we are having to redefine this policy for the period after 2013, and we are therefore at a turning point. That is why it is vitally important to avoid certain risks. The first fundamental risk would be to renationalise it: that would be a serious step backwards. Next, when preparing the financing budget, we must lay down appropriate requirements with regard to the weaker areas without penalising the more competitive and more advanced regions. Lastly, it is essential to simplify the procedures for those who have demonstrated efficiency and to make more legally binding the power to penalise those who have not. We expect the Commission to take action along these lines. Silvia Costa,

 Madam President, I want to remind you that today is the 23rd anniversary of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and I believe the digital world is a new frontier for promoting and protecting the rights of babies and children. I wholeheartedly thank the shadow rapporteurs from the Committee on Culture and Education and the rapporteur from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for the excellent job they have done too and I hope that today we will really send an important signal to everyone awaiting Parliament’s vote. Silvia Costa,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, 23 years after the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the internet is becoming the new frontier at which the rights of minors have to be protected and promoted, given the growing penetration of the internet among children and adolescents in Europe – a kind of symbiotic relationship which helps to form their personalities and the way in which they relate to the outside world. A few years ago, the average age at which children had their first access to the internet was around 9 years old, but today, the first steps on the web, for those born in the digital age, are being taken even before they learn to read or write. Young people under 16 use computers for study, play, watching video clips, downloading videos and music, file sharing, and for visiting chat rooms, blogs and virtual worlds. However, the majority of children between the ages of 9 and 16 have their profile registered on a social network, many using a fictitious identity, and a quarter of adolescents declare an older age than their real one. Twelve per cent of those in the 9 to 16 age group report that they have been harassed, in particular by being bullied (40 %) and by content and approaches of a sexual nature (25 %). Therefore, opportunities and threats coexist on the internet; nowadays the internet is indispensable for the integration of children from a social, educational and work point of view, but the European institutions and the Member States must do their utmost to ensure that minors are guaranteed the conditions they need for their education and to keep themselves informed, the rules required for safe navigation, and that providers, business and educators are made aware of their responsibilities. The report proposes a holistic approach in respect of the promotion and protection of the rights of children online. Exchanges with the various political groups in the Committee on Culture and Education and the shadow rapporteurs – whom I would like to thank – allowed us to arrive at a compromise text which was highly satisfactory even though it deals with a topic about which there are different sensibilities and trends. The work carried out with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and its rapporteur, Ms Hedh, made a significant contribution. The report welcomes and incorporates – with precise recommendations – the recent communication from the Commission for a better internet for children. It was our aim to strike a balance between the fundamental rights of the child in the digital world, the right to access to education, the right to protection and the right to digital citizenship, in a new system of governance which puts at its heart, as paramount, the interests of the child, as a person undergoing education and as a European citizen, on the basis of Article 24 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Treaty. Where governance is concerned, we call on the Commission to mainstream children’s rights across all the policies of the European Union that refer to the internet, to continue to finance specific programmes such as the Safer Internet Programme on the basis of a report and monitoring, and to take appropriate measures, through the internet among other things, which make it possible to coordinate the implementation of codes of conduct and the CEO coalition initiative. In addition, we support the Commission’s proposal to take legislative action if the adoption of the current codes of self-regulation should fail. As regards safe and untroubled access to internet use, we propose taking measures for an educational alliance among families, schools, associations and those involved in media and audiovisual services, to integrate these skills in school curricula and to train trainers and adults; vigilance in respect of the online marketing and publicising of harmful substances; an exchange of good practice in the role of informal education by the dissemination among adolescents of positive and good practices on the internet; the access of minors to safe and high-quality pluralistic digital content in educational programmes and services and, in particular, in the public service media. As regards the right to protection, the report makes a clear distinction between illegal content and unsuitable and dangerous content. For the dangerous and unsuitable material, we call for action to protect identity and privacy; to prevent excessively early contact with sexuality, grooming and improper behaviour – including that towards other minors, such as online bullying and sexting. Furthermore, we call on the Commission to maintain the initiative for classifying unsuitable content and, in general, for all the technical innovations that guide parents and children; we support the proposal from Ms Reding on the protection of personal data, privacy, the right to be forgotten, with specific measures for minors, and with mandatory parental consent for the processing of their data. As regards illegal content, however, there must be tools which are effective in dealing with online crimes such as grooming, and we would repeat that such crimes are of a cross-border nature and so stronger international cooperation is required in dealing with computer crime and in supporting hotlines. Finally, we would encourage – and we call on the Commission to encourage – the Member States to give whatever support they can to digital citizenship, which is crucial for the development of an intelligent and inclusive Union and civic participation, including that on the internet, by minors.

 Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, sending disconcerting, destabilising messages to Europe’s young people is not a great way to celebrate 25 years of Erasmus. The 33 countries involved in the Erasmus programme and the two and a half million students who have so far had the opportunity of studying abroad deserve certainty. It is unthinkable that the reason that this programme is in crisis is its success, including in terms of the funding already used. We need to be aware that the entire lifelong learning programme accounted for just 0.7 % of the EU budget in the last seven-year period, and we are talking about seeking an increase of 65 % or 75 % for the next seven-year period. We would be giving a completely mixed message if we were to say we could not honour our commitments. I hope that the Cypriot Presidency and the Council will make a very real commitment to reconsidering the extra funding requested by the Commission. Parliament should give a strong, united signal to ensure young people do not become eurosceptics too. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I, too, would like to congratulate Ms Jiménez-Becerril Barrio and Ms Parvanova, the Commissioner and the Council for this step forward by the European judicial system represented by this directive, which is also a way of honouring the victims of 9/11. I believe that, after the directives concerning human trafficking, child pornography and the European protection order, it is very important to focus on vulnerable people using a holistic approach with this directive. It is very important for all the countries to decide on a shared basis of inalienable rights, starting with the right to understand and be understood in one’s own language, access to services, information, compensation, and basically to justice for oneself and one’s family. It is also important that, thanks to the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, reference is made in this directive to the specific nature of violence against minors and women. I hope that in this regard, major efforts will be made to inform and update magistrates and lawyers, and I will conclude, Mr President, by saying that it is important to ensure that we prevent the secondary form of victimisation that often takes place via media that is not self-regulated, which broadcasts pictures of minors, exposing them to further violence and violating their privacy.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we must acknowledge that the European Council of 28 June represented an important political step forward, finally bucking the trend of years of repatriation of EU policies and delays in the process of strengthening and completing the Union’s institutional and economic framework to accompany the single currency. It is now irresponsible of certain governments or political groups to question or threaten to veto the decisions that have been taken, which I hope will be confirmed and fleshed out at the next Ecofin Council meeting. Such behaviour also risks negating Parliament’s efforts to push ahead with common objectives, namely boosting own resources, investment, jobs and growth. Thanks above all to the efforts of our political group and the work of the Italian and French Governments – together with the Spanish Government – the ‘golden rule’ and the Tobin Tax are now on the agenda, but a renewed push for greater political and economic integration in the European Union should be there as well.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I very much wish to emphasise the importance of this report on volunteering, and also to congratulate the rapporteur, with whom I had an excellent relationship in the Committee on Culture and Education (CULT), especially to ensure that Parliament’s attention on this issue will not wane now that the European Year of Volunteering is over. We were hoping – as I had asked previously in my role as shadow rapporteur – for a White Paper on volunteering work, which unfortunately has not been forthcoming. That would have provided an overall comparative framework at European level between the various situations, defining a status for European volunteering work and ensuring consistent fiscal treatment. I find that, despite not having had this, this report does fill a void and looks ahead. It is important to want to strengthen cross-border volunteering and remove the barriers that hamper many volunteers from gaining access to this opportunity and also, in particular, for disadvantaged people who need to be able to get help from volunteers. I think it is vital for us to find out how widespread volunteering is in areas such as cultural heritage, the environment and sport, and to make sure that in European tenders, the work of voluntary associations can be considered as a form of cofinancing for the purposes of being eligible for such tenders.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work. Fifty-five years on from Article 119 of the Treaty and after Article 157 of the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, the average pay gap in Europe is still 16.5%, demonstrating that a more comprehensive approach should be attempted, as the report itself advocates. In my view, the nine key issues identified in the report provide a sound basis for amending the 2006 directive, which Parliament is asking the Commission to review by February 2013, with the inclusion of both legislative and non-legislative measures. I would remind the previous speaker that the legal basis is Article 157, which provides that Parliament and the Council can act through the ordinary legislative procedure, in conjunction with the Commission, to introduce measures to ensure that the Member States implement equality measures. In particular, I must stress the need for transparency in defining work of equal value, which should be based on a job classification system that takes into account professionalism, skill and responsibility. Statistics should be made comparable – which is not the case at the moment – and there should be effective monitoring bodies to which appeals can be addressed, as well as more effective sanctions. Additionally, in terms of pay evaluation, greater transparency is needed in the wage or salary component, which is generally equal compared with the other components, such as benefits, allowances or deductions, in which the gap tends to be greater. That is shown by the fact that the higher women climb in their professions, the greater the pay gap becomes. We should therefore focus on that aspect, together, of course, with the need to reconcile work and family life and the need for training opportunities, not to mention raising the profile of part-time work in relation to the ability to pursue a career, a factor that penalises women to this day. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate the words of the Council and Ms Malmström. I think that today we must at long last talk about a proper European strategy on fighting trafficking, on prevention and on protecting victims. I attach huge significance to the role of the European coordinator, whose staff should, I think, be beefed up. We also need strong direction from the Commission so that all the Member States create equivalent organisations that will work with the national rapporteurs through ongoing consultations, with non-governmental organisations – which are often the most involved in this area – and closely with the police, the magistracy and with the cyber police on offences committed online. It is also important to compare the measures against customers and on discouraging demand in the various countries. This will allow us to move forward and connect the measures on children in a more holistic way as we implement this directive and the one on Internet child pornography. I think that training legal professionals is of central importance, as is legislative consistency. In this vein I would note the appalling situation of those in Italy who from 1998 had the humanitarian residence permit while now illegal immigration has been made a crime. I hope the current government will change this, because it is making it impossible to use the humanitarian residence permit for women who are victims of trafficking. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me just clarify this: I think, personally, that I have some concerns over one point in the report but I would not express it in the way Ms Bizzotto did, in the sense that it seems to me that the report goes a bit beyond the remit of the European Union, not so much when it describes various types of cohabitation, of family, and so on, in different forms, but when it says that the EU must somehow enter into what comes under family law which is still subject to subsidiarity. As far as same-sex families are concerned, I would like to make it clear that there are definitely same-sex unions in Italy, there are same-sex unions in situations where children are present, but same-sex union is not treated as being equivalent to the condition and legal status of the family and this is allowed under the various freedoms of Member States. I believe this is the point that should be clarified, it is not denying reality, it is denying legal gender equality in this case in my country. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that to sum up the situation and indicate more advanced goals for equality between men and women – today, in March 2012 – means facing up to the dramatic data from the economic crisis that show a rise in female unemployment, especially among young people, increasing poverty amongst women and I feel we should also acknowledge the rise of violence against women, especially where it is perpetrated in private. There is a situation, therefore, of suffering exacerbated by the cuts being introduced in many States in areas such as welfare, education and social security, which has mainly hit women. I believe there is a connection between this situation and the continued exclusion of women from the decision-making process and that this leads to an underestimation of the impact on women of the crisis and of our policies. Against this backdrop, the two reports focus on some goals that I agree with: a stronger focus when planning 2014-2020 Structural Funds on actions also targeted at women; economic independence, encouraging women entrepreneurs with Guarantee Funds and support tools; abolishing the gender pay gap, by reassessing women’s work and professionalism; prohibiting discriminatory behaviour – for example in my country, forcing women employees to sign blank resignation letters. We also call for standards and measures to recreate a balance in terms of representation, with transparent selection procedures for men and women in politics and in decision-making, and I would welcome it if Commissioner Reding can with the support of Parliament – as she has announced – really get a directive on quotas in enterprises. We also need to act at a symbolic level, not only countering the stereotypes in the media, but by promoting the enhancement and respect even for the dignity of women which is all too often commodified and abused. I am disappointed that the rapporteur Ms In ’t Veld proposes an amendment to delete this reference to the dignity of women, perhaps not fully grasping that the degradation of their image becomes a legitimisation of the violence towards them. Thank you. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, it would be truly strange if, at a time of such difficulties and problems in the lives of millions of people in Europe, the European Union were to impose further restrictions on food distribution. This would have a detrimental effect on basic social citizenship rights, the value of social cohesion and the very perception of the European social model. The signal that Parliament and the Council are both giving is a positive one, but we need to work on giving a definite structure and future to this necessary initiative. I would like to point out that in my country, Caritas, local bodies and other not-for-profit organisations providing free meals have seen an exponential increase in the number of people joining the ranks of the deprived, who can no longer count on being able to feed themselves, and these include not just immigrants, but many elderly and young people as well. I believe that, in the context of our ambitious fight against poverty and efforts to reduce poverty, this scheme is a prerequisite, and if we had not approved it, we would have gone against our own policy objectives.

I voted for this important report on sport, which is a response to the Commission’s communication on the subject and anticipates the proposal to create a sub-programme for sport in the 2014-2020 multiannual programming. As the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, we pushed for the following points: the adoption of sport as a compulsory subject in school curricula, the need to encourage women and girls from disadvantaged backgrounds to take up sport, focusing on sport as a driver of social integration and as a tool with which to combat intolerance, racism and violence, increasing the protection of minors in competitive sport, combating doping, the use of the European flag at all official sports events, the establishment of a European Day of Sports and the extension of the Erasmus programme to sports.

 Madam President, one of the fundamental rights that the European Union must guarantee for its citizens and residents is real freedom of movement under safe conditions throughout the 27 Member States. At the moment this is not guaranteed for those people – most, but not all of whom are women – who have obtained protection orders in their own countries, often with great difficulty, after being persecuted, stalked or repeatedly threatened even with being killed by someone they know, often a spouse, as Ms Reding mentioned, or an ex-husband or a boyfriend, or in any case someone they know. Such people are in fact no longer protected when they travel to another Member State. Parliament and the Council, in conjunction with the Commission, are seeking to fill this legislative gap by means of this directive. I would like to point out that we have applied the codecision procedure for the first time, at the initiative of the Spanish Presidency together with another 12 Member States, including Italy, and with strong support from the Polish Presidency, whom I would like to thank. This is the first legal instrument offering effective prevention and protection for actual or potential victims of crimes against the person or crimes of a moral nature across the European Union. It may be executed by either the civil or the criminal authorities of a country with measures that are the same as or equivalent to those taken in the issuing country. As the shadow rapporteur in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I would like to highlight the excellent cooperation that arose with the two rapporteurs and the invaluable contribution made by Ezio Perillo of Parliament’s Directorate for Legislative Affairs, who is today at the Court in Luxembourg. I also want to say how pleased I am with the key points of our proposal: the expansion of protection to cover physical and psychological integrity, dignity, personal liberty and sexual integrity; the right to information; the guarantees that the perpetrator of threats will also be informed of the consequences of breaching the European Protection Order; and the obligation for Member States to draw up comparable statistics. Of course, I also expect Parliament to adopt a position on the Victims package that Ms Reding has announced, so as to make this focus on victim protection truly horizontal. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that three issues are important in the transition from training to work: the relationship between theory and practice in teaching and learning; the integration of the humanities with technical and scientific subjects; and the structure of higher education and technical training, including non-academic training and continuous development. This is the direction that should be taken in teacher training, the promotion of training partnerships between companies, training centres and research centres and the promotion of high-level training. Today, we have a two-speed market for young people, and the situation is getting worse. We also have a flexibility that has not been matched by welfare provisions, but the new welfare is continuous development and opportunities to return to work and for mentoring. I think this should be presented more as a new social right. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that compromises are made not only by aiming downwards but also by seeking a middle way that aims upwards, and by improving the living and health conditions not only of women but also of children, whom I believe have not received much attention in this debate. I appreciated the intellectual honesty and politeness with which Mr Mleczko described the Council’s difficulty. I truly hope that a balanced compromise can be reached. However, I believe that we have done well to raise the bar compared with the requests contained in the Commission’s project, which were truly modest. I want to say one thing which I believe is really a basic objection. It seems as though Europe has not yet understood that, unless it helps reconcile work and motherhood, millions of European women will be excluded from the labour market or will be unable to remain in it. A different type of compromise would rejuvenate Europe, reduce childhood and family poverty and increase the productivity and community of Member States, unless the only proposal for welfare reform and cost optimisation is to increase women’s pension age, which would lead to a paradox. Under this system, these women will never reach pension age, because they will leave their jobs, as happens in many countries including mine, because it is not possible to reconcile work and family during their productive and childbearing years. I believe that unless European economic thought revises its conceptual base and moves beyond an ‘accountancy’ approach, growth will not be intelligent, inclusive or sustainable, because the women will not be there. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a point I very much welcome in Ms Wallis’s report on alternative dispute resolution is the fact that it calls for a general ‘justice for growth’ agenda across sectors which goes beyond consumer-producer disputes to include civil transactions, and family disputes in particular. I would argue that family mediation and a strong commitment from Europe in this respect are extremely important issues, in view of the growing number of disputes that generally follow separations and divorces in the European Union. In particular, disputes between spouses who are often of different nationalities tend to drag on longer and consequently have a terrible effect on the children. Experience in many countries shows that having a family mediator, as someone neutral that they can freely turn to, helps partners reach a mutually acceptable understanding, with an agreement in writing that can be submitted to a judge to be made official. This goal must therefore be determinedly pursued at a European level, although with due respect for subsidiarity, not least in light of the 2005 EU regulation on parental responsibility. It will also strengthen cross-border protection, particularly with regard to child abduction and the role of the European Parliament Mediator. I hope, therefore, that the Commission also includes this aspect directed to the Member States in its legislative proposal. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her complex, interesting and fertile report. As has been mentioned, single mothers now make up over 5% of the female population in Europe, and I would also point out that 85% of single parents are women. Single-parent families are therefore concentrated on the female side, and this fact should now be increasingly acknowledged by welfare, employment and social security policies. Naturally, as the report shows, this is a highly diverse population in terms of age, legal status and economic situation. In northern Europe, for instance, the vast majority are young unmarried mothers, especially in certain countries in Scandinavia and the United Kingdom, while in the south, most single mothers with children are separated, divorced or widowed. Their conditions are therefore also highly varied. Whereas certain welfare services and systems are probably more advanced in northern Europe, not least because family connections are less extensive, in the south, we are having to face a new, emerging problem of young unmarried mothers as well, but with a welfare system that has not yet been properly focused or thought through. There are therefore different speeds of response. I believe the first thing that should be done, as the report also points out, is to compare welfare systems and best practices in order to work out the right mix of services for employability, for training and for welfare, in order to guard against forms of poverty and exclusion from the job market and to enable these women to achieve a work-life balance, which is much more complicated for them. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Alfano, on this important report. It has become an essential reference for Parliament’s actions in an area in which it has new, enhanced competence based on the Treaty of Lisbon. It is a fundamental reference because of its subject matter – the fight against organised crime and mafias in the European Union – and because it calls for a special committee, the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor’s Office and the harmonisation of the Member States’ legislation. I also appreciate the fact that some of the proposals I made as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality have been accepted, for instance, the proposal to promote the role of associations of victims’ families and the establishment of a European forum, as well as the call for a holistic approach to people trafficking, especially child trafficking, and to illegal adoptions, not least in light of the recent European directive. I would like, however, to place a little more emphasis on the extent to which the text succeeds in showing that women and children make up the majority of direct or indirect victims, especially of crimes against the person, and that there must therefore be a specific, targeted commitment to support and protect women victims of crime and violence, including when they are witnesses or have dissociated themselves, especially from mafia and criminal families, and also to value their role when they commit themselves to a culture of legality. I would also like to mention the growing number of women involved in combating crime as judges, lawyers and police officers, and also as teachers trying to change the culture of our young people in this respect. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as I congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Gardini, and the Commissioner, I must say that I agree with the calls for European legislation, a bottom-up approach and a coordinating centre that draws on the best experience and the models of civil protection intervention used in the various Member States, bringing together expertise and voluntary resources, national coordinators and local bodies. I would like to refer to two points. Regarding the consolidation of 112 as the single emergency number in Europe, I would ask the Commission to carry out an active check, given that my country, for example, is moving towards further fragmentation of emergency numbers and the services that answer emergency calls. There are even two numbers for fires. Secondly, we should increase the part played by new technologies in the field of early warning and warning systems, for example, by supporting the roll-out of prototypes that the EU finances but which are not then taken up by the Member States. Lastly, in terms of the organisation of civil protection, I think it is also important to highlight the social changes that have occurred in the European population, which, to an increasing extent, is elderly, of foreign origin and concentrated in outlying areas where there is little infrastructure. Hence, there is a need to safeguard access and the possibility for this most vulnerable section of the population to be supported. Silvia Costa,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as everyone knows, being a woman is already an undertaking in itself, because it means having to manage and reconcile family, professional and social life, in a context that still does not adequately recognise the high level of education (as Commissioner Reding mentioned earlier), professionalism and expectations of women. I appreciate that in this report Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou has worked extremely hard to collect numerous proposals and objectives that, as a shadow rapporteur and member of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I advanced together with several of my colleagues. In the European Union women are under-represented, as they are in management positions in companies, currently making up only 12% of the membership of boards of directors of listed companies. Against this background we are happy to have heard the serious commitment of Commissioner Reding, and we call on the European Commission to propose legislation including mandatory quotas by 2012, to increase percentages to 30% by 2015 and to 40% by 2020, if the steps taken by companies and the Member States are found to be inadequate. In this regard it is an encouraging sign that six countries, including Italy in the last few days, have approved legislation along these lines with a bipartisan vote. I would like to clarify that these quotas are not just numerical, but also aim to achieve better performance in the corporate system, by sharing the management not just of large enterprises, but also of small and medium-sized enterprises. This is why we are proposing the use of several instruments under corporate social responsibility, including family-friendly services, flexi-time working arrangements, and management training for women. It is also important to recognise the link between the presence of competences and women’s roles in corporate governance with a different approach to process management, optimal use of human resources, anti-discrimination rules and sustainable productivity which they often guarantee. I would like to raise another point also in response to what Mr Bauer rightly said earlier, and that is that we have not merely just included female quotas, but we have also included an important mechanism, which was our own proposal, and that is that the joint presence of men and women is linked to greater transparency in appointments, in the selection of men and women, so that this is a benefit for everyone, not just for women. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Mr President, it is highly significant that Parliament is using this resolution to send a strong message to both the Member States and the younger generations to ask for greater commitment to European cooperation on learning, vocational training and higher education in order to bolster the Europe 2020 strategy. We know that youth unemployment has severe repercussions on poverty and social exclusion, as does the prolonged period of insecurity in which 40% of European young people live. Strong backing should be given to a combination of education policies and a new incentive-based welfare system for enterprises that provide full-time employment for young people and women. Ensuring that the skills being learned are in line with the competences – including for citizenship – required for the new goals of sustainable and intelligent growth is essential, as are policies for the transition from education to the workplace and speeding up the recognition of professional qualifications, titles and academic credits. Those Member States which, like my own, are cutting resources for education and research at a time of crisis must know that they are hurting young people, and hurting the future of Europe. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, in an ageing Europe that is struggling to find answers to the global challenges of the future, the European Union and its Member States must seize this strong stimulus from Parliament to demonstrate that they can be more courageous, investing in future generations, in education and in culture. With these four reports and the Sarajevo proposal, Parliament calls for these issues to be placed at the heart of the Europe 2020 strategy. In particular, the economic advantages, as well as those in employment and innovation, are highlighted by the report on cultural and creative industries, which already account for almost 3% of Europe’s gross product and employ 5 million people – a figure which rises to 7% if ancillary industries are taken into account. As shadow rapporteur for this measure for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists &amp; Democrats in the European Parliament, I am pleased to see that the rapporteur, Mrs Sanchez-Schmid, has welcomed our amendments. What did we propose? First of all, that cultural tourism and fashion should be added to the eight sectors already included. We also hope that the Commission – and I am sure that Mrs Vassiliou will take action to ensure this happens – will submit a White Paper on cultural and creative industries as soon as possible in order to strengthen this cross-sectoral strategy throughout Europe and the Member States. Cutting funds for culture and education at times of crisis – as my country is doing, on the grounds that culture is not essential to survival – means failing to invest in the future and in smart, inclusive growth; it means failing to understand that culture is essential for life. The report states that the European status of artists and of those engaged in creative professions should be officially recognised, and that in cultural industry, small and medium-sized enterprises should be fully recognised as such for the purposes of access to credit and support when starting up, especially for young people under the age of 35. It also promises to protect jobs, and to introduce specific training and innovative financial instruments, bearing in mind that capital in the creative sector often consists of values that are intangible but nonetheless crucial for innovation in all sectors. The Europe-wide cultural sector must be taken into consideration in the legal framework for international trade, certainly in the European dimension and in cultural diplomacy, in the internal market, in mobility … (The President cut off the speaker) Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, naturally, I wish to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur on this report which really signals a significant step forward in EU policies, in its invitation to the Commission to submit a proposal for a directive on the procedures to be adopted by Member States to recognise, and possibly revoke, international protection. I believe that the events of recent days between the African and European coasts indicate that we need the ‘asylum package’ – as it is to be called – to become a binding rule. In particular, I think of the positive amendments that were approved; for example, the whole question of greater safeguards with regard to minors, since I believe that children must not be detained under any circumstance (which is exactly what has been happening in Lampedusa, where children have been treated in exactly the same way as adults, together with adults, often in totally unacceptable conditions). It would have been better to have this directive in place before these dramatic events took place in Europe and Africa. Another very important issue is that of vulnerable people and their issues, especially women, and problems relating to family matters and reunions. Congratulations also to the rapporteur. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as some of my fellow Members have already said, I think that by voting in favour of this report by Mrs Svensson we are making a commitment to ensuring that the Commission fulfils its pledge to adopt a Communication, before the end of 2011, for the implementation of a strategy and a European action plan to combat violence against women, which will take a global view and therefore include all the different cases, from sexual violence to domestic violence and female genital mutilation, and – I hope – all the new forms of violence. I am referring to the actual inducement to violence, which is often carried out by advertising and the media, as well as the forms of blackmail and violations of women’s human rights that occur in the workplace when they decide they want to become mothers or are already working mothers. Following the implementation and adoption of the directive on trafficking in human beings – to which Parliament was very committed – and the directive on the European Protection Order, I think it would be important to have a proper directive on this issue within the new legal framework created by the Treaty of Lisbon and the Stockholm Programme. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Svensson. We know that violence against women and children is increasing across Europe. For this reason, we urge the Commission to submit a proposal, as it has already promised, for a strategy on violence against women by 2011. This should be all-inclusive, in the sense that it should cover domestic violence and genital mutilation, but also some more insidious forms. I am thinking of severe discrimination and bullying in the workplace against women who are pregnant or intend to marry and who are called on to resign beforehand, which is something that happens in my country but is no longer a crime as it was in the past. I am also thinking of what can only be described as the incitement to violence perpetrated by the media and advertising. After the directive on trafficking in human beings and the imminent directive on the victims of violence, announced by Commissioner Malmström, I think that the Treaty of Lisbon has laid the basis for achieving greater legal harmonisation in the way Member States acknowledge the importance of crimes of violence against women and children as specific forms of violence, as well as defining the essential standards of services for consulting, legal assistance and protection for women and children in cooperation with NGOs. It will also lead to consistent and comparable statistics with impact analyses of forms of prevention and enforcement by Member States to ensure a reduction in violence. I think, in this respect, that there is a common will by Parliament – I was one of the signatories to the written declaration – to define a year of reflection across Europe on the theme of violence, and I think that Parliament can add its very strong and very influential voice to this.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to ask my fellow MEP who spoke just now if it can really be considered appropriate to apply the terms ‘freeloaders’ and ‘fortune seekers’ to people who are fleeing from a situation of great political distress – and all the political groups agree on this – such as the one in North Africa. I find this to be an extremely serious allegation and call on the President to somehow highlight what has been said and establish whether this can be considered appropriate in such a sensitive debate that touches on the suffering of human beings, who are clearly not considered to have the right to eat, as it has been said of them ‘they even demand food and are lot of freeloaders’. I find it very serious that this has been said in this House and I hope that European citizens can read this extremely harsh utterance, which only serves to reveal the total political inadequacy of the person who said it. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteurs and I also dedicate this 8 March to the women of North Africa and the Middle East, such as the many women who, at this moment, are demonstrating in Cairo and Iran and fighting for democracy and liberty in their countries. In this respect, I hope that firm measures will be taken, including in the external actions of the European Commission, to establish links with these women. Even in Europe, there is a great reawakening of women’s participation, starting with demands to respect the dignity of women in the media and in the behaviour of men in institutions, as was said in town squares on 13 February by 1 million Italian women and many concerned men. As for the reports under discussion, I would note that there is a strong link between growing insecurity at work and in the lives of young women, even though they are better educated and more skilled, the inadequate protection of atypical female workers – which most young women are – during maternity and parenthood, the shortcomings of current policies for achieving balance and the lower rates of female employment, the more frequent instances of poverty among women and children, and the lower level of their pensions and, hence, their exclusion from decision-making powers. While I agree with Mrs Reding’s initiative concerning boards of directors, I am less supportive of the initiative on insurance which risks penalising women in particular. Without this, there will be no Europe 2020. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, I voted for this resolution because I believe that the compromise reached with such difficulty within our committee is essentially positive, insofar as it is a tool to remind Member States to ensure that pensions are adequate, sustainable and portable throughout Europe, in the context of a significantly ageing population. I would however like to make three criticisms, which I hope the European Commission will implement in the coming White Paper. The first is the lack of recognition of the importance of the third pillar in pension systems. Second, although the difference in retirement income between men and women resulting from the pay gap, breaks for periods of care and greater unemployment among women has been acknowledged, there are no flexibility criteria for women of retirement age who cease to be employed, and there is no adequate recognition of periods of care for the purpose of defining retirement age. This would, however, be desirable. Thirdly, European citizens’ right to a common programme of welfare education and information about their pension and insurance situation should be affirmed, in particular for young people and workers throughout the course of their working lives. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, during a stage in its life in which Europe is undergoing a crisis of identity and prospects, I think that the establishment of a European Heritage Label that identifies those sites – both material and immaterial – of high symbolic and educational value for the history, culture and creation of the European Union, is particularly significant. My sincere thanks go to the rapporteur, Mrs Paliadeli, who efficiently took on board the proposals and additions suggested by many of us in the Committee on Culture and Education, providing, in particular, for procedures that are more certain and more respectful of the Treaty of Lisbon with regard to the subdivision of tasks among Member States, the Commission, the Council and Parliament. As some of my fellow Members have picked up on, we also strove to make sure there was no overlap between the label and other initiatives of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) or the European Council’s historic and cultural itineraries. Indeed, on the basis of well-defined criteria, the Member States will present not more than two actively managed sites every two years. This is an important point: the Member States must show that they believe in the sites and therefore manage them in an educational way, involving the people. The Commission, meanwhile, will be responsible for pre-selection after hearing from a panel of experts, but it will also assume a monitoring role, will assess the effectiveness of the management of the sites every six years, and may also withdraw the label. Parliament comes out of this with a stronger role because not only does it appoint four of the 16 members of the European panel, but also because it has an active relationship with the list of pre-selected sites. I also support the solution provided to the complex problem of the marks already assigned on an intergovernmental basis to many Member States that, in any case, though not suitable for the new system and the new criteria, will retain their earlier mark and will not therefore be downgraded. I also appreciate the priority given to transnational sites, which will be a very interesting challenge for Europe, and the role assigned to the Committee of the Regions as part of an approach of subsidiarity, as well as the emphasis on the necessary involvement of Member States in the selection phase, including municipalities and regions, in order to avoid their being only partially involved. However, I think an extra effort by the Member States would also be useful. It would be very important for them to launch competitions aimed at young people in schools and universities to start a process to identify the sites, which would also become a way to reconstruct a common European history and destiny and mean that they, too, would contribute to the sense of belonging and European citizenship.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if this programme is brought to fruition today, it is thanks to the determination of Mrs Pack and the will of Commissioner Vassiliou. As an Italian-Swiss citizen, I am happy that Switzerland is the first country from outside the European Union to participate in EU education programmes for young people, both in higher education and continuing skills training. Indeed, let us remember that even if Switzerland is not part of the European Union, it has made a major contribution to building the values and freedoms that are a shared heritage of the European continent. It is a symptom of the success of programmes such as ‘Youth in Action’ that Switzerland requests that the mobility of our European programmes be extended to their young people and therefore, it is of significant importance that Switzerland is not only requesting a larger economic area but also a larger educational area. I believe that it will be very interesting for the young people of the European Union and Switzerland to get to know each other better, and I am sure that this will lay foundations that will also have an influence on the future of the European Union.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, through this proposal for a directive – for which I should like to express my great thanks to the rapporteurs, with whom I worked as a shadow – Parliament is supporting and expanding the Council’s proposal, which was designed to protect people across all 27 Member States who suffer forms of persecution or serious and repeated threats from known and previously identified persons – often ex-boyfriends, husbands or partners – who threaten their physical and sexual integrity, dignity and personal freedom. Indeed, the number of attacks and killings – particularly against women – is on the increase. Their complaints are often not taken seriously enough by the police and the judiciary, and protection orders and measures against the aggressor are currently only valid in the country in which they are issued. Commissioner Reding, the measure under approval may not be perfect, but it plugs a legislative vacuum. After all, in creating the European area of freedom, security and justice, we have always acted empirically, at times pushing matters through where necessary. Indeed, we believe that this initiative is important because it will allow all citizens of the European Union – men and women – and all European residents to travel freely across borders, taking their human rights and their rights to protection and security with them, as stated in Article 3 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which we in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament intended as the legal basis, in order to give a more coherent direction to the structure of the proposal. Through the establishment of the European Protection Order, the protected person is guaranteed to be looked after even in other Member States, through a fast and free-of-charge procedure. Each Member State must appoint a competent authority to inform victims of their rights, carry out campaigns, collect statistics and inform the person as soon as their national protection order has been issued. Furthermore, it gives a great boost to the creation of the European legal area and the implementation of freedom of movement, and it also applies the ordinary legislative procedure involving codecision between the Council and Parliament for the first time. I hope that the Council will confirm this commitment and I hope that the Commission – though showing particular attention to the coming ‘Security for Victims’ package of measures – does not miss this particular chance to respond right now to this extremely serious situation, which is also demonstrated by European and national statistics. Amongst other things, this could lead to important legal convergence among Member States. I would therefore suggest that we avoid any delays and make a specific commitment to this particular type of victim protection. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur, I should like to thank the rapporteurs and say that I think this directive is extraordinarily important because it is the first time that the European Union has taken legally binding action in the fight against the trafficking of human beings. Fifty years after the United Nations convention, there are still hundreds of thousands of people in our civilised Europe – mainly women and children – who are reduced to slavery. For the first time, the EU is equipped with a single instrument to fight against the trafficking of human beings, whether for reasons of sexual or labour exploitation, including forced begging. Our group had three priorities: to hit traffickers with uniform, more severe sanctions, including confiscating assets and using them to support the victims of trafficking; to ensure a high level of protection and social rehabilitation for victims, with free legal representation and immunity from prosecution for crimes committed in connection with being trafficked; and to promote the crucial role of the non-governmental organisations, both secular and religious, that work to support the victims. However, I am hoping for a revision of the 2004 directive on the resident permit for victims. I would also underline that in the proposal, we provide for the safeguarding of children through strengthened measures and I support Commissioner Malmström’s call for further measures against sex tourism and child pornography. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, I believe that Parliament has a great opportunity today to reiterate that motherhood is a social value, that the protection of a mother’s health and that of her child must be strengthened, that a female worker must not be discriminated against for being a mother in finding and keeping a job, and that childcare should be better shared with fathers. Notwithstanding the current crisis – as has already been highlighted – we must make the same observation which has already been made by the most advanced economists: the impact assessment which has been carried out shows the need for a more far-sighted and holistic approach. Today’s costs, which can potentially be staggered, are a social and economic investment in the greater well-being of children, fewer diseases and the greater participation of women in the labour market. Many claim that there will not be an increased and appropriately trained and qualified female workforce without a new welfare system and new opportunities to achieve a work-life balance: I fully agree with and thank the rapporteurs, Mrs Estrela and Mrs Plumb, for the complex work they have carried out, as I do all Members who have strived to find common ground. I also agree with the facility which, I believe, many of us wanted, and which will provide mothers of disabled children, and in the case of adoptions and multiple births, with greater opportunities to have flexible working hours, the reversal of the burden of proof against breaches of the law and greater protection from dismissal. Furthermore, I proposed, together with other Members, that with respect to the compulsory six weeks’ leave following childbirth, a safeguard clause be provided for those countries where legislation provides this compulsory period prior to childbirth too. In conclusion, I hope that now, over these two days, we will be willing to find common ground so that we do not miss the important opportunity to adopt this directive in this parliamentary term as well.

 Mr President, I should like to express my support for maintaining the European Social Fund’s own budget and rules, albeit with a view to its greater integration with all the other Structural Funds. However, the rules need to be revised in at least five areas: we need more simplification and more monitoring of results and not just of procedures; we need to really make the most of experience such as that gained in the Italian regions over the last two years, to offer integrated packages of guidance, training, retraining and support to help integrate workers who have been made redundant or who are unemployed into SMEs; we need to promote training partnerships between educational training institutions, universities and businesses in order to provide opportunities for continuous training that take into account the need for new skills; we need more transnational projects, which, until now, have only been experimental; and we need more national and transnational work-study initiatives for young people. I believe that it is on the basis of these points, among others, that we need to reconsider the prospect of introducing new rules for the European Social Fund. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, through this debate – which frankly I was hoping would be rather better attended, because it deserves far greater participation – Parliament is seeking to add its voice to that of so many others around the world who have come out in recent days against the tragic death sentence by stoning for Sakineh Mohammadi-Ashtiani, after the appeal by her son Sajad, and to save all the other women sentenced to death or unjustly imprisoned, like Zahra Bahrami, in summary trials in Iran. In this age of globalisation, it is even more obvious that human rights and women’s rights are inseparable. If a woman dies after being tortured by stoning, our consciences and our freedoms will be stoned with her. In our resolution, we urge both the European Union’s High Representative, Catherine Ashton, and the Commissioner for Human Rights, Viviane Reding – two powerful women – without further delay, to take all necessary steps with the Iranian Government and in international forums for the death sentence for Sakineh to be rescinded, for Zahra to be released, for the barbaric practice of stoning to be abandoned, and for renewed efforts to be made in the battle to achieve a moratorium on the death sentence and also to support the democratic opposition in Iran. We, the Italian female Members in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, together with all our fellow Members, are holding a candlelight vigil tomorrow evening here in the courtyard of the European Parliament in Strasbourg. We are calling it ‘A light for Sakineh’s life’, and we ask all Members to take part so that darkness does not fall over this tragic, highly symbolic affair and so that the Iranian people and the Iranian opposition are not abandoned. We are calling for more robust intervention from the Union because we believe that the defence of human rights, here and around the world, is an area where the European Union’s credibility and identity are at stake.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteurs – whom I thank – have raised a key issue, which Commissioner Reding has also addressed in part. We must ensure that policies for women and for equal opportunities are incorporated and integrated more effectively into general policies at European and national level alike. I am thinking of the crisis, poverty, development, cooperation, employment and welfare. I believe, however, that there are three issues that should be emphasised by the Commission, by us in our work and by the Member States. Firstly, I would like Commissioner Reding to emphasise the role of women in the European Union’s external action. A new policy of which women must be made more aware is contained in Mrs Figueiredo’s report. The second issue is that of the Commission’s support for the draft directive on the European Protection Order, which is a tool of fundamental importance for guaranteeing the … (The President cut off the speaker) Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 10 years since the introduction of the Lisbon Strategy and on the eve of the Europe 2020 strategy, in the middle of a full economic, social and employment crisis, we know that we cannot come out of this crisis, nor lay the foundations for new and sustainable growth and a new social cohesion, as you have said, unless we strengthen the mechanisms and instruments that the European Union has at its disposal to sustain investment in the knowledge triangle: education, training and research. Just now, Commissioner, you confirmed that as regards this objective, some European governments are performing well, others a little less so. In order not to fall within the limits revealed by the Lisbon Strategy, I believe that in this area, the Commission has to strengthen the open method of coordination with Member States, provide incentives and penalties in the European Social Fund and monitor the results. I do not consider it to be consistent for governments, as the Italian Government has done, to cut EUR 8 billion in three years from education and the universities, without reinvesting the savings in these areas, especially as we have a 19% early school leaving rate and 25% youth unemployment. In conclusion, do you not consider it opportune to strengthen the legal powers in Directive 2005/36/EC to facilitate the mutual recognition of professional qualifications among Member States? According to Professor Monti’s report, currently, less than 3% of European workers in fact work in another Member State, and one of the reasons seems to be precisely this difficult issue of mutual recognition of qualifications.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Beijing +15 is confronted this year with a financial, economic and employment crisis that is having a negative impact on the living and working conditions of millions of women throughout Europe and the world, but which may represent an opportunity to review development models, the organisation of the labour market and social policies. In strengthening the Beijing +15 objectives, the European Union must prioritise, on behalf of women, policies for providing access to environmental resources and credit, including by means of micro-finance; the balance between family life and work life, including by means of the adoption of the directive on parental leave; training policies and incentives for businesses that employ young people and women; and the fight against trafficking in human beings with a new directive, which we hope will be based on the resolution approved during the last part-session in Strasbourg. Above all, we must focus development cooperation support on the empowerment of women in the poorest countries, and in African countries in particular, building a possible Euro-African alliance with the women. It would be good – I am addressing the Commissioner and the President here – if the European delegation in New York promoted and gained support for the campaign to award the Nobel Peace Prize to the women of Africa, symbolically represented by the leaders of associations active in those countries worst affected by conflicts and poverty.

Madam President, Commissioner Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is very important for the European Parliament to take the opportunity offered by this debate with a view to the March elections in Iraq. The Iraqi political process has shown itself to be important – even if, as you were saying, interesting – but still very fragile. It is thus even more important to do everything possible to consolidate and strengthen the country’s new institutions and the political equilibrium which sustains them. We believe this to be a vital objective if we wish the first substantial withdrawal of US troops to occur in August without it having serious consequences on the country’s internal situation. The coexistence of Shi’ites, Sunnis and Kurds which is today embodied in the federal structures should be guaranteed by new laws, as well as by a political consensus involving all these parties. On this point, concerns are being aroused – and we would also like your view on this – by the electoral commission’s recent decision to bar many candidates and parties with close links to Sunnis or Christians, thus running the risk of weakening the already fragile democratic process in Iraq. Through the measures undertaken, the European Union must follow this electoral process, as you have said, but also be more ambitious in the development of relations with Iraq. The Union’s EUJUST LEX programme directly involves us in the process of improving Iraqi legislation and democratic institutions, and we, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, consider it a positive sign that the Council has decided to extend the mission until 30 August 2010. The EU should continue to maintain strong support for Iraq through its cooperation programmes, with the aim of participating in the process to stabilise and develop the country, and after the elections, it should strengthen relations between the parliaments. It should be remembered that many Member States are working with Iraq, including Italy, with the important cultural cooperation programme. Iraq’s political equilibrium is essential not only for the country but also in terms of the role that Iraq can play in the region strategically, with the aim of overcoming existing conflicts and securing peace. In this sense, the improvement of relations with Turkey by the regional government of Kurdistan constitutes a positive step in that direction. However, as we know, Iraq remains a country with very serious problems in relation to security, respect for democracy and human rights, as well as economic insecurity. It is the most vulnerable groups, such as refugees – forming 10% of the population – ethnic minorities, women, religious minorities and children who are suffering the negative impact of this situation. We must therefore play a still more incisive role in this area – I am just finishing – partly through support for local and European NGOs working in Iraq and, in this regard, women can also be involved as strategic figures to overcome some of the population’s difficulties.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my great satisfaction that today we are tackling a subject like this with an important question, for which I warmly thank the authors, and I would also like to express my gratitude for the high level of cooperation that we have seen between all the political parties and the two committees. I am also very happy to have heard very serious commitments voiced by the Commission and also by the Spanish Presidency, and I truly hope that the new directive will soon be drafted along the lines that essentially seem to enjoy a large consensus. I think we know that the numbers in this field are very complex to analyse, but in brief, we are talking about almost 300 000 people, 79% of them women, many of them minors, being trafficked every year in our civilised Europe. Unfortunately, numbers have been rising in recent years. For this reason, too, we need to make very strong progress in the light of the new areas of responsibility that the European Union has and also in the light of what we have already approved in the Stockholm Programme to bring in some innovations. It was a great step forward when we approved, at EU level, the provision – which, for example, had already been in force in Italy since 1998 – allowing humanitarian residence permits to be issued to victims. However, we must also make progress on safeguarding victims in relation to protection, social and employment reintegration, the possibility of preventing there being customers – which we must think very seriously about – and more serious and effective measures on sanctions which must, as you said, Commissioner, be harmonised at EU level. In particular, we ask that the consent of victims to their exploitation be considered irrelevant, in view of the high level of blackmail involved in these circumstances. I will conclude very shortly, just adding this: we need not only special protection for minors but, above all, also forms of support for persons arriving in Europe who have already previously suffered forms of trafficking along the journeys, ever longer and ever more tragic, that they complete before reaching our coasts and our territories.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it would be very important for 2010, the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, to mark the birth of a new Community financial instrument, dedicated to microfinance, aimed at those who are disadvantaged in accessing the banking system but who have micro-enterprise plans. As we are aware, micro-credit has proved to be an extraordinary tool for creating self-entrepreneurship opportunities and widespread social value in developing countries, particularly for women. It has become a new strategy of the United Nations and of the World Bank, but it has also been trialled with positive results in many countries, in many European Member States, including Italy, particularly for immigrants, women and young people. By adopting this report, Parliament is providing, in the midst of a serious economic and financial crisis, not only a strategic opportunity for social inclusion but also a positive challenge to the banking system, since it is developing a new approach and new powers, in collaboration with non-profit bodies and local and national institutions. I welcome the adoption of many amendments, which I will not go over again, but I would like to say that today we are asking not just for micro-credit resources, but we are also asking that micro-credit … (The President cut off the speaker) Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to dedicate this International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women to the memory of Anna Politkovskaya, a journalist and a woman who paid for her love of truth with her life, to the African women in conflicts, and to the many forms of suffering of women in Europe that often go unobserved. These examples are at odds with the degraded and consumerist image that the media often attaches to female identity, helping to create a culture where women are oppressed and humiliated. This is also a serious form of violence against which Europe must speak out and intervene in. We must urgently set up a consistent European system for statistical recording – it has been said more than once – with particular reference to minors, trafficking, physical and sexual violence, and women in vulnerable categories, such as immigrants. Yet we would also like to see tangible results from the European Union guidelines on women in armed conflict, which the Commissioner also mentioned previously, at least through the provision of financial and other support for projects, often organised by small associations, local NGOs, including in countries concerned with reintegrating and assisting women who are victims of violence. We are aware that today, we have a new possibility, as offered by the Treaty of Lisbon and the Stockholm Programme, to enshrine this preventive action within the Community. However, we must also denounce another aspect of violence: the context in which violence takes place. Alcohol- and drug-related violence is growing among young people and minors, and perhaps we do not mention this often enough when we discuss violence against women.Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me first thank Mr Leichtfried for this document. It is important because it provides better definition of the interinstitutional relations between Parliament and the Commission on an extremely sensitive question: Parliament’s powers have been extended in the area of trade, which was not part its competences under the ordinary legislative procedure. There is therefore a fundamental problem, not with the Regulations we are amending today, which are being adapted to a new regime, but in terms of the relations between the European Parliament and the Commission. In this regard, although I welcome Mr Leichtfried’s report, I am not at all pleased with the views expressed by the Commissioner in this House. The relationship between Parliament and the Commission is still overly technical. There is an evident and continuous effort by the Commission and the Council to reduce relations with the European Parliament to their pre-Lisbon level and we cannot allow this to happen. Limiting the powers of the Commission is an important step that should result in more parliamentary control and make the Commission act in a more focused manner. Only in this way can we respond to the problems raised by Mr Salvini: I completely agree that the EU’s exclusive competence in the area of trade policy should be maintained, and that the EU’s power should be increased over that of the individual Member States. However, we must also be stronger within the World Trade Organisation, in the knowledge that unless we pay more attention to the real economy, we will never emerge from the current crisis. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that on your travels around Europe in this difficult period – especially given your competencies in some key areas at this time of crisis – you will have had a chance to ‘see for yourself’ the situation in which Europe finds itself. I say this because the last thing I would like in the present case is to find myself agreeing with Mr Salvini. We must be aware of the situation we face: we know that China represents a great opportunity, and not simply great problem. It represents an opportunity for those enterprises that export EUR 170 billion worth of goods to China each year, although we also import EUR 250 billion and are only too aware that this represents a trade deficit. However, if we do not introduce strict and exact rules on fair trade, we will end up by fuelling and increasing the wave of anti-European sentiment against the EU institutions. What else do we need to say or do to make you understand in that ivory tower that is the European Commission what kind of situation we are facing? These continuous sermons on innovation and development mean very little to the sector we are dealing with here, which is at the cutting edge in terms of innovation and development! So all of you, and all of the gnomes that live inside the offices of the Commission, cannot but be aware that the timetables that you are proposing do not do justice to Europe and the problems we are facing! I think that you should make an effort to understand that for the largest economic power in the world to impose the rules of fair trade simply means enhancing its own dignity, showing that it understands how to live within the great global village of the present with a sense of dignity. Currently Europe is not managing to do this in a way that benefits its citizens. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, nobody in this Parliament is in any doubt that the importance of the measure that we will be voting this evening goes well beyond the specific issue we are discussing. I have always considered myself to be a friend of Israel and I personally have no doubt that the conflict that has pitted a large part of the Arab world against Israel for decades is due mainly – if not exclusively – to the fact that too many in the Arab world do not want to recognise the right of the State of Israel to exist. Having said that, however, we must also strongly condemn the repeated violations of international law and of the agreements signed by the Israeli Government, which have led to a downward spiral that Israel should – precisely because it claims to be the only democracy in the Middle East – make a definite effort to end. We therefore request that this report be referred back to the Committee on International Trade and be shelved until Israel takes decisive steps towards dismantling its settlements in illegally occupied Palestinian territory and until it shows more respect for the Palestinian people’s right to exist. Such signals can be encouraged by a more effective European Foreign policy in the area, which today is altogether lacking. Despite the fact that I am not voting in favour of the measure, I believe that Parliament should at least support the amendments by Mr Moreira, Ms De Keyser and Ms Schaake, aimed at preventing the extension of the advantages for Israel under this measure to products originating from the unlawfully Occupied Territories. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I voted in favour of this proposal on trade and economic relations between the EU and the United States, in part because of the important, balanced and complete report drawn up by Mr Moreira, for which I thank him. The proposal offers us a complete framework of the commercial and economic prospects and of the difficulties and challenges involved in the meeting of the two main world economies that together account for about half of global economic output and nearly a third of world trade flows. After many years of deadlock, we are now approaching a possible turnaround in bilateral relations, with the prospect of a far-reaching agreement between Europe and the United States that could open up positive scenarios for transatlantic relations. Naturally there are questions relating to tariff barriers, and an agreement of this scope would have to aim to remove the many trade and technical barriers that unfortunately persist. It would also deal with other important issues, such as the protection of indications of origin, the opening up of the public procurement markets and harmonisation of rules of origin and regulatory standards, including health and plant protection standards, where there is still too much divergence. However, this in no way detracts from the steps being taken. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution before Parliament is an important policy document taking account of the ambitions and concerns that European manufacturers have for some time held with regard to a country that is both a great opportunity for our economy and a great problem. The EU and Japan together represent more than a third of world GDP and more than 20 % of world trade. These figures alone give us an idea of the importance of the upcoming negotiations. I would have preferred Japan to send out stronger signals than it has done, in my opinion. The most important question remains the removal of the numerous non-tariff barriers (NTBs) by the Japanese as well as regulatory barriers that cannot merely be ascribed to cultural differences. Such removal should be seen as a precondition for reaching a mutually balanced and mutually advantageous agreement. The outcomes on public procurement and the automotive sector seem particularly decisive for a successful conclusion to negotiations. Japan should open up its market to the same extent as the EU in a spirit of real reciprocity, in particular with regard to NTBs in the automotive sector such as the ‘zoning regulations’ and special fiscal treatment for ‘key cars’.
 The question of indications of origin for agro-food products including wines and spirits is also important. Parliament should also ensure that it is continuously informed on the progress of negotiations and that the Commission carry out a second assessment of the impact of a possible free trade agreement with Japan, in particular with regard to more sensitive sectors such as the automotive and electronics industries. This is the only manner in which to provide proper protection to European manufacturing sectors at a time of crisis without compromising our commitment to free, sustainable and fair trade.

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Leichtfried, the negotiations on the trade agreement with Colombia, Peru and Central America and the corresponding stabilisation mechanisms and safeguard clauses have kept many of us and the Committee on International Trade very busy. We are in favour of the proposed regulations because they secure a balance between various demands, all of them referring back to the principles of free trade, attending to Union interests, and international trade as a tool for growth and development based on environmental sustainability and respect for human rights. In particular, these regulations are designed to protect European companies and consequently the workers they employ – our farmers – especially those in the outermost regions of the European Union. The safeguards and stabilisation mechanisms are effective for a limited time only, and we believe that the time period suggested is long enough for us to adapt our production system to the liberalisation measures included in the agreements and also for the countries in question to increase their exports considerably. That is why we voted in favour. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D
).  
– (IT) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on this issue, there should have been a more respectful approach towards the prerogatives of Parliament, towards the need to avoid a confused agreement which tends to regulate matters that are, in themselves, too diverse. I will be voting against the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) not because I am convinced that the fundamental rights of the Union are truly being violated to the core, but because counterfeiting and online piracy cannot be fought with the same weapons, almost as if counterfeiting a handbag or a drug is similar to downloading a song or a film from the Internet. I am against ACTA because the Commission and the Council hitherto have not yet regulated in a credible way an issue that is so very much in the limelight in the digital age, such as the protection of intellectual property on the web. I am opposed because current legislation would already enable action to be taken against those countries that make a living out of counterfeiting. I conclude by reiterating my opposition to an agreement that touches on highly sensitive issues, but does so in an inefficient, confused way, lacking a legal framework that is the only thing which would allow me to do anything other than vote against, as I shall be doing tomorrow. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, while we appreciate the care with which they were formulated, your answers only partly give us peace of mind. We are facing a highly political issue, not just a commercial one: formal consistency between this agreement and the more general association agreement with Israel cannot justify the sort of subterfuge that facilitates infringing the prohibition that international law has imposed on Israel regarding products made in the occupied territories. I understand our economic interests, I also understand the technical scope of this protocol, but I believe the European Union should undertake a careful review of the origin of the products, because no protocol or agreement can ignore the more general context which prevails today. The repeated violations on this point by Israel do not help the process of détente which we all feel is required and which needs the European Union to be an active part of the solution.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to explain my vote also in relation to Ms Ferreira’s report, because it seems to me that it is the right time to overcome the contradiction between growth and austerity, which is at risk of becoming outdated. Today, we have spoken in favour of growth and, at the same time, in favour of recovery. There is a contradiction when we say that we do not want to adopt a report like Mr Gauzès’s, on which I abstained for reasons I will explain, and then at the same time we call for a consolidated European budget and fiscal union. We need fiscal union, we need to monitor the budgets of Member States and, at the same time, encourage growth with the amendments we have presented and voted for in Ms Ferreira’s report. I therefore believe that we have done something important. We have done it even though Mr Gauzès’s report contains an article – Article 10 – which sends a negative message to the markets, as it concerns controlled default procedures, which we should not even talk about at the moment because we have to show the European public that we want to move forward with the euro and with greater integration.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the prudence with which the Commission is looking at the new system of relations between the first and the fourth largest economies in the world is a comfort to us. Deep underlying reasons, based on the history of our times, push for relations between the democracies of Europe and of the Rising Sun, based on the desire for friendship, development and the opening up of new opportunities. We cannot, however, overlook the fact that, amid all the distrust caused by long-term antagonism and by resentments that have not yet fully died down, the history of a system of relations in the name of multipolarity, overcoming the hegemony of the United States, is pushing us into new partnerships with the Far East. This has led to new forms of cooperation between China and Japan, shifting the balance that has become established since the Second World War and which must not be used against the European Union. The new set-ups which are being introduced at global level and in the major regions of the world thus require the European Union to be an enterprising key player, both by strengthening the multilateral approach and through bilateral relationships that will help Europe strengthen its competitiveness. For these political and economic reasons, we fully support your efforts to create conditions that will improve the system of relations between ourselves and Japan. However, we are not willing to begin negotiations unless the Council first involves Parliament in drafting the negotiating mandate. Although, formally, Parliament has the power to conclude the negotiation process by ratifying, or otherwise, any treaties that have been signed, it is equally true that parliaments throughout the world, due to their democratic legitimacy, have always been involved in drawing up the policies that underlie negotiating mandates. Europe needs to follow not only the letter but also the spirit of the treaties, so we call upon the Council, in this as in other cases, to duly take this into account. Finally, acknowledging the words of the Commissioner, we stress that it is imperative that Japan prove it wishes to break down tariff and especially non-tariff barriers that still dominate its domestic market. It is not therefore our intention to impede negotiations, but to assume responsibility for the growing demand within European public opinion, which fears that bringing together an open internal market such as ours with the increasingly closed markets of our main competitors will, in the end, damage our competitiveness and, with it, growth and employment. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are duty bound to acknowledge the positive elements in the Commission proposal on which, following the improvements proposed by the Committee on International Trade (INTA), we will be asked to vote. However, from a methodological point of view, I honestly do not agree with concluding at first reading a matter that will only become effective from 2014 onwards, and which divests Parliament of the power to exert its full potential on such an important issue. Looking at the substance, I believe that the positive elements in the new regulation are not fully compensated by the persistence of negative issues that adversely affect the interests of industrial sectors that have already been severely tested in Europe by a globalisation governed neither by multilateral rules nor by reciprocity. One positive aspect, however, is the new geographical coverage owing to the principle of differentiation, which provides a boost for the poorest nations. Equally useful is the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance, known as ‘GSP+’, linked to the implementation of the main international conventions on social, human and environmental rights. Also positive is the safeguard clause for the entire textile and clothing sector, as well as the general clause. However, the loosening of the financial criteria for the beneficiaries of the GSP+ regime and the exclusion from the graduation mechanism of nations that come under this scheme actually opens the door to unfair competition in relation to already heavily affected sectors, as I said, and gives priority to countries such as Pakistan, whose violations in the field of human rights must not be approved. In short, there is no doubt that this is a positive regulation, but the issues I mention cast a shadow over other aspects that we wished to consider. Gianluca Susta,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we speak of trade relations between China and the European Union, we evoke relationships which, on many occasions, have affected the course of history, as the pendulum has swung between East and West. The pendulum appears now to be firmly in the East. Europe seems to be labouring in China’s wake, as our second trading partner has seen its exports rise by 39.5% in just under two years. It is our loss if we view China only as a source of problems, as certain nationalist and protectionist elements on the political right have been trying to portray it for years, and not also as an opportunity. In the 21st century, however, the greatest world economies can work together only in an atmosphere of reciprocity, compliance with the rules, and intolerance of illegality, of unfair practices and of discrimination, to which we have grown accustomed after a great many absolutely unacceptable episodes. It is understandable that the pendulum of history is now swinging in favour of emerging countries. It is right that we open our markets. However, the Chinese Government has a number of unacceptable policies: protecting its country’s businesses while leaving our companies’ intellectual property inadequately safeguarded; the proliferation of technical barriers, sometimes much more burdensome than tariff barriers; keeping a closed procurement market; and an almost total disregard for the most basic social and human rights, as the oppression in Tibet shows. In the European Union, terms like ‘reciprocity’ and ‘traceability’ – which recall others, now long forgotten, like ‘transparency’ and ‘quality’ – must become a precondition for every trade agreement and every legislative initiative within the framework of a renewed multilateral policy. It is our duty, therefore, to keep our market open while protecting the Union’s interest from outside protectionism – from China and elsewhere – by demanding adequate quality standards for the goods and services available in the European Union market. This report addresses these matters with clarity, describes important solutions, and is heading in the right direction. It will therefore have our support. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I thank Mr Rinaldi for his broad-ranging report, which is worthy of support in political terms, and packed with ideal aims and practical proposals that will undoubtedly be looked upon with renewed hope by the people living on the shores of the Mediterranean after the revolutions that have taken place in their countries. We need a change of pace and a return to the spirit of the Barcelona Declaration in order to overcome the fragmentation characterising trade relations between the European Union and the Mediterranean countries. Only a short-sighted view of the EU’s strategic role could consider that a policy of greater integration with the countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean contradicts the EU’s western vocation. Trade governed by a balanced new free trade agreement could also represent an instrument of stability in a region criss-crossed by uprisings that have not yet perfected an approach to democracy, which also involves reducing inequality, strengthening production, better protection for civil and social rights, and commitment to avoiding Islamic fundamentalist tendencies. Of course, this does not just depend on us, on the European Union. It also depends on the tremendous difficulties of cooperation and integration experienced by the countries on the southern shores. However, to paraphrase a great writer, if the Mediterranean becomes a project once again rather than a state of affairs, together we can overcome the current political and economic obstacles that have prevented a good agreement being reached in the past. We need an EU initiative towards the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, to hold more in-depth talks about legislation with all countries in order to eliminate the excessive number of tariff and non-tariff barriers, and to open their markets up towards reciprocity, which means that a larger amount of aid must be tied to greater commitment on the part of our partners. In conclusion, I can only repeat my appreciation of this report and trust that the Commission will make it a priority objective of its political and administrative agenda. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the goals of the agreement are all highly commendable and it should therefore be adopted. However, we cannot forget the big social question that cuts across this sector: a trade that improves the quality of its product, offers fair prices and develops the industry cannot fail to bring about an improvement in the economic status and living conditions of 5.5 million smallholders and the 14 million workers who depend on cocoa production. Since the European cocoa industry is the biggest in the world, we must urge our processing companies to commit to fighting the exploitation of children and for a sustainable and fair cocoa supply chain. That is what this resolution sets out to achieve and that is why it deserves our support. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Mr President, the political importance of the convention under discussion today will be clear to everyone. The European Union is well consolidated, but a further process of integration within the confines of Europe and between Europe and the rest of the world on its borders is a prerequisite for strengthening this region in the new global balance of power. Once again, a modern framework for trade relations may be a useful point of compromise between those who believe that Europe should primarily have an Atlantic vocation and those who believe that a new balance of power in the Mediterranean is essential for building a democratic future for Europe. This convention brings together in an improved multilateral, if interregional, logic, all the different positions currently in force concerning the origin of goods traded with the participants in the Barcelona Process, the EFTA States, the Faroe Islands and all of the Balkan States participating in the Stabilisation and Association Process. By adopting a legal instrument of this kind, it will be easier in the future to have recourse to the pan-Euro-Mediterranean system of cumulation of origin, and therefore agree on preferential tariff treatment for Mediterranean goods, although the absence of a review clause and uniform provisions for the settlement of disputes must be lamented. Precisely for this reason, the convention may be an important element to help revive a process which began in Barcelona almost 20 years ago and to which various initiatives refer, some more convincing and effective than others, but all of them important, such as the Union for the Mediterranean, the trade road map agreed under the framework of that process. Ours is an ambitious goal, but a slow-moving one due to the imbalances that are still too strong between the two shores of the Mediterranean, the political instability that is still crossing the Middle East – which requires greater effort from the European Union to push Israel to respect the international agreements on the Occupied Territories – and on account of the uncertainties linked to the evolution of the Arab Spring in North Africa. These are all major outstanding issues, which require a strong political and diplomatic initiative from the European Union. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, the relevance to the EU of this agreement is more than just that of farmers in the south, although this is of course important. The southern shore of the Mediterranean will not develop peacefully or democratically if we retreat into autarchical nostalgia which could encourage the spread of anti-European sentiment on the African continent. Of course it would have been preferable to pursue a multilateral approach with the countries of North Africa, in order to avoid future inequalities. Nevertheless this agreement appears to be balanced. It does not threaten many of our traditional products. Quota restrictions on six out of the fifteen most sensitive products exported by Morocco will remain. New opportunities are opening up for some of our products and for those to which total liberalisation will apply. Finally, the safeguarding clause offers an additional protective mechanism in the event of serious damage. It is true, ladies and gentlemen, that this agreement does not resolve the ancestral issue of the Saharawi people. Every trade agreement needs to be accompanied by a courageous political initiative on the part of the EU to promote the values of liberty and justice in the world. However we cannot use the tragedy of the Saharawi people to safeguard a few individual sectoral economic interests. We can and must have the farsightedness of a trade policy vision that looks beyond its own immediate requirements – a vision that this agreement allows us to catch a glimpse of, and therefore I will vote for it.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of this report because, in these difficult times, a free and fair trading system based on principles of reciprocity and harmonisation within an enhanced multilateral framework is a fundamental prerequisite for development. We need to bring down customs duties, non-tariff barriers and protectionism, which is still too widespread, and not only in emerging countries. These are the most serious obstacles to creating an effective international trading system. Europe should be more aware of its role and should use its democratic, social, open model of political union to achieve stronger multilateral cooperation and bilateral agreements that are balanced, sustainable and respectful of civil and social rights. Europe, ladies and gentlemen, should play its role with authority, so as to eliminate distortions of competition by the main global players, and it should maintain the Generalised System of Preferences only to help lift the least-developed countries out of poverty. Such an approach will benefit our producers, workers and entrepreneurs, as well as those who look to Europe as a model for greater freedom and social justice in the world. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Mr President, as well as seeking to remedy its mistakes, Europe must also start investing in its future again. We have set ourselves an ambitious target: 75% employment for the 20-64 age group by 2020. However, just as it is inconceivable that only public expenditure will drive new investment for growth, there will be no new jobs if we do not stimulate private investment in innovative sectors and youth hiring; if more training - better training - is not carried out; if budget, fiscal, pensions and welfare policies are not harmonised across the EU; and if the labour market is not made to be more flexible, making contract negotiations more in tune with and proximate to the needs of businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, while also respecting fundamental rights. My vote in favour of the report by Ms Bastos is an act of faith in the EU institutions and in their ability – albeit late in the day – to pull the leading world economy out of the crisis without distorting the European social model. At the same time, however, the institutions must succeed in releasing the hidden energy reserves in Europe’s economy, which are hindered from reaching their potential and contributing to the much-needed growth of the European economy and the resolution of the sovereign debt crisis by bureaucratic inflexibility, the labour market and dumping within Europe.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we could sum up our debate by saying that, while Athens is weeping, Sparta is not rejoicing, in the sense that both Europe and the United States are going through a serious crisis, and both are struggling to come up with the solutions needed to overcome the crisis. The world is certainly sending some undesirable signals with regard to the approach we must take in order to relaunch the economy, with our focus being mainly on regulating the financial markets and, to a lesser extent, on the possibilities of developing the global economy. We have to move away from the debate between those in favour of economic rigour and those who support growth, because Europe and the rest of the world need rigour in the management of their public debt and public resources, but they also need to grow, and we need to be seriously concerned about the protectionist signals coming from the United States, from Argentina, from Brazil, with the introduction of new taxes, and from parts of the world such as the Mercosur countries, which are facing difficulties today. We must therefore pay a great deal of attention and understand that the world markets have to be extended, safeguarded and broadened, and that we have to eliminate barriers in order to encourage growth. Mr Caspary’s proposal was very interesting, and I think that as part of the logic of opening up world markets, we should have a far-reaching Marshall Plan, a new Marshall Plan for developing countries, so that they can compete with the major players that compete with us. On the same day that the House rejected President Obama’s plan containing the ‘Buy American’ provisions – which we oppose – the United States Senate passed a law on the issue of the yuan and the strengthening of the yuan against the dollar. These are also measures which must be seen in the context of a new way of managing world monetary policy. Alongside an open global trading policy, we need to safeguard EU interests, and we also need a new Bretton Woods agreement to define the world’s monetary framework. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of this package, despite the instructions of my group. I believe that in a seriously critical moment like this, the most important thing that Europe can do is to react with urgency to a demand that comes from its citizens. I therefore believe that this package does not go far enough, but it is absolutely necessary to continue down this road, strengthening the instruments of growth but bringing budgets under control and increasing regulation in order to enable development to be managed. Consequently, I think tomorrow is an important day for focusing on what has made the European Union the most important democratic institution at this time. Certainly, much remains to be done, but this is an important initial response, and we could not miss the opportunity, after years of discussion in which we failed to tackle the greatest crisis in our lifetime with the necessary urgency and firmness.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the future of our trade policy coincides with the future of European competitiveness itself. For years, we have justifiably pursued a policy of opening up our market – and perhaps we have been more generous to others than to ourselves – but the slowdown in the Doha Round, the resurgence of protectionist measures by several partners, including strategic ones, and the enterprise shown by emerging countries must lead us to reconsider the way in which we Europeans want to relate to the world. In this context, words like ‘reciprocity’ and ‘protecting European interests’ must become the litmus test to show whether what we are doing is right. We have to play a leading role and not a supporting one in seeking to conclude the Doha Round with a well-balanced global agreement, which is an essential condition for arriving at a free-trade agreement that really opens up the markets and, above all, creates equal opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises. Trade policy and economic governance go hand in hand in this world, and we are therefore calling for a new financial system and a new monetary and exchange rate policy, as well as a redefinition of trade protection measures.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, no one can deny the importance of closer trade relations between the European Union and Taiwan. Yet, surely they must be aware of the well-known and delicate question, which the Commissioner also mentioned, of institutional relations between the countries officially known as the Republic of China and the People’s Republic of China, with whom the European Union and all the Member States maintain steady diplomatic relations. Furthermore there is no doubt that the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement signed in 2010 between Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China will help to overcome the consequences of the territorial and political separation of ‘One China’ and will facilitate better trade discipline between the European Union and Taiwan. Trade relations between us and the fourteenth largest global trade partner, the European Union’s seventh largest trade partner, can only improve, even though they require new regulations to eliminate the current barriers, in particular non-tariff and linguistic barriers, of a market that is still locked in the multilateral framework of the World Trade Organisation, which Taiwan has been a member of since 2002. As I have already mentioned, however, the principle difficulties concern relations with the People’s Republic of China. While we must address the issue of maintaining a dialogue with all parties, yet politically recognise a ‘One China’, we must ensure that the two Chinas do not turn the current triangular trade into veritable triangulation which could put the European Union at a trade disadvantage, as has already happened with other East Asian trade partners such as Korea.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, almost 10 years have passed since the Doha Round began. In two months’ time we will be marking its 10-year anniversary, but it has still not achieved any results. The global setting has changed profoundly. Countries which were considered to be developing countries have now become emerging countries, and today those countries are emerging even to the point where they are able to put themselves forward as saviours of the European Union or of certain Member States. The rules of global trade need to be rewritten. Trade still has extraordinary potential to promote growth, better distribute wealth around the world and rebalance the North and South of the world. Within the multilateral framework, all of this has remained unchanged, but we need the chance to renew reciprocity between countries too, and we also need to launch and contribute a new process to strengthen democracy within the World Trade Organisation which is unable to function properly in its current form.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, any initiative that aims to promote our real economy at a time of serious crisis like the present must be thoroughly welcomed, especially when its goal is to make our businesses more competitive on the global market. I am grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Jadot, and to the other shadow rapporteurs for having delivered a report that singles out support for investment and makes it more transparent without increasing the already substantial number of administrative requirements imposed on SMEs. I hope that this agreement that we are adopting today, and which was concluded within the OECD, will be signed by other countries that are trade partners of ours in order to guarantee a genuinely level playing field for operators and to ensure that Europe does not suffer competitive disadvantages in a sector that accounts for 10% of world trade and which is therefore crucial to the overall growth of the European Union.

 Madam President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is at a turning point and this crisis could lead to situations that would imply the dissolution of the biggest political and institutional project of the tragic century that was the 20th century or, alternatively. a decisive step forward in the process of integration. It is worrying, therefore, to see governments asking to reduce Europe’s financial perspective or acting against the idea of amending the Treaty to strengthen the euro; it is worrying to see all these initiatives that do not aim to help the real economy but the financial economy – the dream of so many irresponsible people who continue to travel back and forth across Europe. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) also have to play their part in tackling new markets, offering new products, adapting to the whims of the global market, bolstering their capitalisation, investing in research and innovation and showing – as they already are – that in this changing world, nobody can reserve the role of bank of the world for themselves while making others function as their workshop. We are heading towards a world in which today’s emerging big players are capable of being both bank and workshop and will have to face the challenges – including social and environmental challenges – that this world will deliver to them and will also affect us. Our competitiveness, our ability to grow and simultaneously ring-fence employment and security largely depends on our SMEs’ ability to adapt. SMEs have much to gain from a new commercial policy, but to do so they must be strengthened, they must present themselves as consortia on world markets, and they must know how to work together to crack open new markets and meet growing demand, including in sectors that require the huge volumes which we have not been able to provide in the past. They must be supported when they have to defend themselves before the courts of third countries because their patents and trademarks are being violated. Europe and its Member States have certainly done a great deal, but the fragmentation of skills and the random distribution of resources in many countries has so far prevented SMEs from working effectively on an international scale, in particular – I would reiterate – when faced with the enterprise shown by our big global competitors. This is what we need to focus our attention and commitment on. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted for the reports, with the exception of Mrs Wortmann-Kool’s report, on which I abstained despite supporting my group’s amendments. Therefore I did not vote following the overall indications of my group, because I believe that we are facing such serious problems that we must at this point demonstrate the cohesion of European institutions and our ability to deal with the problems we are confronting. Despite a certain timidity and arrogance on the part of the Council with regard to this crisis, I believe we need to show this cohesion. I did not agree with the postponement either, because we are in a position in which we need to give our citizens urgent responses to the economic crisis, which is not just the result of financial speculation, but also of our inability to deal with the problems of recovery and growth. We have a duty to heal Europe’s public finances and we have a duty to set out responses, which have to begin with the involvement of businesses and the world of work, and have different and more open rules in order to complete the single market and be in a better position to compete on the global market. That is why I voted for the reports with the exception of Mrs Wortmann-Kool’s report. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I feel bound to note that a sense of fear and a need to defend European interests still prevail among some Members in this Chamber: in other words, they are on the defensive. As far as I am concerned, I believe that this agreement with a country with which we have a long-standing bond of friendship is important as long as it is entered into on the right basis, that of true reciprocity, and is a balanced and ambitious agreement. It should not be limited to the elimination of tariff or non-tariff barriers but should represent an opportunity to take a qualitative leap in the elimination of environmental and health policy differences, and I refer, in particular, to the farming sector, the protection of animal species at risk of extinction and particular economic extractive activities that have a significant environmental impact, such as asbestos mining and oil sands drilling, or that restrict access to medicines for the poorest countries. However, we must be positive in our attitude, not defensive like we were with Japan. I would therefore emphasise the need to improve reciprocity in terms of the protection of intellectual property, including trademarks, geographical indications and policies for the reciprocal promotion of bilateral investment, aimed principally at innovation and technology and inspired by the positions already taken in this field by the European Parliament. Madam President, I believe that the numerous bilateral agreements between Canada and the Member States are the best foundation on which to build a robust free trade agreement in the commercial arena, thanks to a friendship that we have already experienced in the UN, the G8, NATO and the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, a friendship based on the ideals of democracy and freedom that characterise Canada and the European Union.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this proposal for a regulation is worthy of support because it helps to simplify and harmonise the different laws in the Member States. The proposal sends out a signal that is in line with the Commission’s proposals on small and medium-sized enterprises and the strategies to stimulate European competitiveness in the manufacturing sector. The regulation also implicitly rewards product innovation and contributes to greater transparency in the process. However, I would point out that the compromise reached with the insertion of the review clause and the joint statement by Parliament and the Council on origin marking – the political significance of which is not lost on me – could set a precedent and compromise the outcome of the difficult negotiations between the Commission, Parliament and the Council on the complex issue of origin marking for non-EU products, which Parliament approved at first reading last October and which concerns non-textile products also. It is high time that the Council acknowledged once and for all the democratic will expressed here by the majority of MEPs. However, despite these concerns, we will vote in favour of the proposal for a regulation. Gianluca Susta,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, quite honestly, we do not understand why the majority of the Committee on International Trade were so adamant in wanting to put this matter forward for debate, only to then ask for it to be referred back to committee, a request that we reject. Both decisions are wrong; however, because of the time constraints, among other reasons, I intend to focus solely on the issue of merit, but only after voicing my full support for Mr Moreira’s speech. In this complicated world in which natural and man-made disasters are occurring all the time and in large numbers, we would be setting a dangerous precedent if we were to turn every humanitarian emergency into a review of trade policy. That is a slippery slope that could result in serious imbalances and, hence, unfair treatment of the poorest countries. Yet it is only through balanced, permanent and objective rules that those countries can reap the benefits of trade policy, which must not replace development cooperation. We know that any aid earmarked for Pakistan would not be used to help the people hit by the floods almost a year ago. We know with just as much certainty that it will be the European textile sector that mainly, if not exclusively, pays the price for this humanitarian aid. We cannot accept this unfair departure from trade policy rules because we are aware of the need to consider other factors, too, in our discussions. We all know that, as well as showing solidarity with Pakistan’s flood-hit populations, another fundamental reason for granting aid lies in the decision to support Pakistan’s counterterrorism efforts. The grey areas that have emerged in recent days between the Pakistani authorities and al-Qaeda, and the Bin Laden affair itself, show how unreliable that country is. I believe that we must focus attention on this, just as we must focus attention on the major human rights issues that have emerged lately. Gianluca Susta,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council’s request to open negotiations with Japan on the conclusion of a free trade agreement must be assessed very carefully. We therefore welcome the Commissioner’s cautious approach to this issue and we call on Parliament as a whole to follow that approach, which inspired our group’s motion for a resolution. The new Japanese Government has demonstrated – at least verbally – its willingness to open up its market, one of the most closed markets in the developed world. This positive attitude must be verified in practice, especially with regard to the 27 non-tariff barriers identified by the European Union, which must be lowered so that we can open negotiations with Japan and make them one of the priorities of our trade policy. We believe that improving these relations can help make Europe more competitive, since Japan accounts for 9% of world GDP, or over 35% when its GDP is added to our own. Today, however, we cannot adopt resolutions unless they make the opening of free trade agreement negotiations subject to specific, binding and verifiable conditions; namely, that there will be genuine reciprocity and a proper impact assessment. Firstly, Japan’s protectionist policy in the automotive sector concerns us, because there is an imbalance between exports and imports. Secondly, we wish to raise the issue of non-tariff barriers. I am talking about a whole range of standards, from health and plant health measures to technical standards – especially in the agricultural and automotive sectors – export subsidy rules, customs checks and factors allowing for counterfeiting and also triangular trade with China and Korea. To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, we ask that before Europe declares itself willing to open negotiations on the conclusion of a free trade agreement, it resolutely defines the Community interest that it intends to protect and specifies the areas in which it will request reciprocity from Japan. We hope that the Commission will take these comments of ours on board. Gianluca Susta,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on International Trade.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the economic and financial crisis has led many people to rediscover the central importance of industry. Despite your efforts, Mr Vice-President, the Commission has still not always realised that. A great many acts, of which the documents on the Europe 2020 strategy or certain free-trade agreements that have recently been approved or are under discussion will not be the last, are still biased towards the service economy and the strengthening and development of services, particularly in the financial, banking and insurance sectors. In contrast, the real economy is giving us opposite signals, as you have said. Production and exports are rising and we are witnessing a reversal of the trend for relocations. We must encourage these signals, since no great economy in the world can escape the central importance of industry. Hence, we need to complete the internal market and to speed up the implementation of strong initiatives in support of innovation and research, technology transfer, product traceability, protection of intellectual property and promotion of European production, not to mention effective rules against dumping and for true reciprocity in bilateral negotiations. This report is a step in that direction, and I am very grateful to Mr Lange and all those who have worked on it. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is wrong to have turned the debate on the Free Trade Agreement with Korea into a stand-off between supposed neo-protectionists and die-hard free-traders. I also think it is wrong for the Commission to have acted more like a service economy development agency than the political government of 500 million Europeans, which should strike a balance between considerations relating to growth on the one hand, and to employment and distribution of wealth on the other. What differentiates us from the United States, which has not yet ratified this agreement – and we know why – and this also applies to relations with Korea, is the very fact that no world economic power exposes its quality – and I stress the word ‘quality’ – manufacturing industry to inevitable dismantling processes, sacrificing it on the altar of financial interests, setting white-collar workers from the City of London against the white-coated workers of modern European factories, which is exactly what Europe does not need in the wake of the crisis. All this, Mr Sturdy, Commissioner, has nothing whatsoever to do with neo-protectionism. Otherwise we would have to include in this category the Spanish, German, Polish, Portuguese, French and Italian Industry Ministers who, in the 10 February edition of Le Monde
, reiterated the need to make Community interest central to the work of the European institutions, stating that in this case it definitely could not be protected by the safeguard clause, however worthy it may be. An excellent academic exercise in the field of international trade relations has taken place, but we have failed to act in Europe’s interests. For that reason ...

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it happens all too often that intellectuals or high-powered institutions in some countries refuse to understand the phenomenon of Italian terrorism, raising doubts about the trustworthiness of our judicial system. Since this is the legal basis for the refusal to extradite Cesare Battisti, we cannot but reject it. Cesare Battisti, an individual with something of an ambiguous past, is the product of a time in which thousands of young people – many of whom were desperately lonely – chose armed struggle as a means of political struggle and ended up turning the alienating utopian dream they believed in into a crime. Other countries have experienced similar tragedies but none have so far offered the protagonists of these any chances to reform, unlike Italy, which, in fighting terrorism, really cemented its sense of national unity. Taking up the appeal of the victims’ relatives, we therefore ask for Cesare Battisti to be brought before the Italian judicial system, which will know how to show – as it has done in hundreds of other cases of former terrorists who are now reintegrated into social and civil life – that to be punished is also to make amends, as the Italian, Cesare Beccaria, taught Western legal civilisation, and not just intimidation or brutalisation, as the Brazilian authorities fear.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I totally disagree with the last speakers. Personally, I find that this measure is harmful to the priorities of Parliament and is against the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon. We are about to conclude 70% of the agreements at first reading with the Council, but I fail to understand the rush to conclude such a sensitive measure as this at first reading since it concerns the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon, which has extended our powers, particularly on commercial policy. At the very opening of the anti-dumping procedures, we are changing from the objectivity of legal certainty to an intervention by Member States, which threatens to become the outcome of bargaining between the Commission and Member States. I therefore think it is a step backwards, as is automatic alignment without any time limits from the old comitology system to the present system in the agricultural field, which strengthens the role of Parliament. Therefore, I do not believe it is wise to rush into an agreement with the Council at first reading, because we also run the risk of disputes before the Court of Justice. Gianluca Susta,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Scholz for drafting this report, which establishes a financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised countries. It is right that this instrument is managed by the Committee on International Trade because, above all, it relates to cooperation with industrialised countries and emerging countries, so there is a certain difference compared to other instruments. First and foremost, I think it is necessary to emphasise the role of Parliament. We have lost too much time in a tug of war with the Council and the Commission on an obvious issue after the Treaty of Lisbon. We must defend the centrality of Parliament, in regard to both delegated acts and executive acts. Secondly, I think it important to underline the strategic importance of this whole game and, thirdly, the need to intensify collaboration with developing countries and emerging countries, without taking money away from the poorest countries. We must make an effort, within the budget of the European Union, to divert more resources to the poorest countries, bearing in mind that the problems with emerging countries are mostly to do with rules, rather than financing. In any case, innovation must also be supported, but with additional resources that have not been taken away from the poorest countries. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we have to be mindful of the crisis that the European Union and its Member States are experiencing on a global level. With a crisis that is hitting work, employment and growth, I wonder about the logic inspiring some European countries but, above all, the European Commission, in terms of international relations. The Commission proposal under discussion today will heavily penalise some industrial sectors, particularly textiles and, in a situation like the present one, we must ask ourselves whether it is reasonable. Some people fear that these decisions are borne from the desire for Europe to take a leading role on the world stage. In reality, we know that this is not so and that the attempt to reduce the pressure, including terrorist pressure, within or related to some political and institutional systems, has even less to do with it. The truth is that not even the recent flood has anything to do with this proposal, since the main concentration of the Pakistani textiles industry is not based in the regions hit by the disaster. The actual reason is that once more, the aim is to penalise a sector in favour of financing the European economy and to favour large-scale retail, rather than the interests of the manufacturing industry located in some European countries. This is profoundly mistaken in terms of growth, work and employment in a time of serious economic crisis and the need for real EU growth on global markets, in terms of its exports and its capacity for innovation and quality.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Muscardini, and all the shadow rapporteurs with whom I have worked on this issue, which is extremely important for us. I hope that tomorrow, the European Parliament gives the same strong backing to the legislative resolution that it gave in July 2006, with the written declaration of 2008, and the favourable vote on the resolution of 2009. We are preparing to adopt a measure that should protect the consumer, informing him or her of the origin of products for a more general purpose, which renews equality of opportunity in international trade and reciprocity between the European Union and its main competitors. It does not add costs for businesses in third countries, which are already obligated to mark their products in all our competitor countries in the world and in many others. Nor does it create any burdens for the European distribution system which, indirectly, without costing the public finances anything, favours the return to Europe of significant production, slows business relocation and also contributes to the fight against counterfeiting. It is a combination of very obvious advantages, which cannot be halted by calling perhaps for further measures because here, it really is the case that the best is the enemy of the good. We must come to the end of a process that began seven years ago, showing our concern for the interests of our businesses – above all, in this time of crisis and unemployment – but also for the potential for a trade system regulated so as to provide reciprocity, consumer protection and correct information which could be further developed in terms of traceability. If this measure is not voted through by Parliament, there will be trouble. I should like to thank the European Commission once again and all those who wish to support this measure, because it is helpful for European citizens and for world trade. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I think we must ask ourselves what we want as Europe, what we are calling for as Europe, and what commitments we intend to adopt in relation to this serious economic and financial crisis, the depression we have experienced around the world, and the difficult recovery that we are facing. In my view, a Free Trade Agreement at a time of such great difficulty for multilateral relations, when the Doha negotiations are at a standstill, should fulfil at least two major requirements. On the one hand, it should establish a truly level international playing field between us and the other competitors in world trade and, on the other, it should show the world the direction in which Europe wants its economy and development to go. This agreement is divorced from all that. It takes no account at all of the global context. It is on one side or on the other. It is simply a very cleverly produced Free Trade Agreement. It is an important conceptual document, and it would certainly be able to open up useful scenarios in a totally regulated world, a world in which reciprocity, common rules and common qualitative standards are the order of the day. The world is not like that, however. What we see, in fact, is that Europe’s manufacturing industry, on which it should build in order to create more development, more employment and more jobs, is being penalised, while once again, the financial services sector is being rewarded. In its positive aspects, this agreement has hardly any effect on increasing GDP; in the best case scenario, it will raise it by 0.03%. I do not see the need for it. After President Obama’s cautious overtures, even the United States is putting the brakes on now under pressure from at least 100 congressmen from the majority party, who have described this kind of agreement – similar to the one we are about to sign – as ‘job killing’. The ratification process in Korea is extremely slow and neither the ecological standards nor the social standards are guaranteed. Even so, we want to move towards ratification very fast. We must ask for one thing, however. We asked for it before in the preliminary stages through the vote that we cast then. There can be no provisional implementation of this Free Trade Agreement unless the safeguard regulation is adopted, and in this Parliament, we have introduced some important amendments that will enable us to address the subsequent stages more effectively.

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, ladies and gentlemen, as I am one of the last people to speak, I would like to offer you some words of comfort. In my opinion, you were right to point out here that you do not represent the governments, but Europe and the European Union itself: an affirmation that is obvious, though not for some, evidently. We therefore urge you to persevere in your role to ensure that the stable Presidency of the Union provides that encouragement, that backing, and forces the governments to turn their words into action. We welcome what has been achieved over recent months, the idea of the task force and also the fact that the Heads of State or Government were forced to draw up a significant document because, Mr President, the content of that document, if put into effect – although we are not really sure whether all of the Member States do wish to put it into effect – is certainly significant. For example, we do not know whether the statements in the final document on the taxation of financial transactions or on the tax on banks will actually become reality. We are waiting for the task force’s conclusions in order to see whether these effective instruments, in conjunction with the statements on economic governance, together with the statements on growth, are really an essential premise of our political action. We wanted the constituent process, which ended with the Treaty of Lisbon, in order to signal a change: we hope that the stable Presidency of the Union will insist – as Mr Van Rompuy underlined in his reply – that these words become reality.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you to the rapporteur, and also to the shadow rapporteurs, and to Commissioner Tajani, or should I say Vice-President Tajani, for the precise and accurate answers you have given us on key points. Eighteen years ago, the University of Barcelona carried out a study that concluded that the textile industry would have disappeared from Europe by the year 2000. It is now 2010 and this gloomy prophecy has not come true, and it has not come true for one simple reason: namely that the research and innovation developed in Europe and in countries that have maintained their manufacturing base – because they have not just acted as research centres, but as centres of applied research and industry – have ensured the production of new innovative fibres. Hence, the need for these regulations instead of a directive, to guarantee flexibility, protect consumers where labelling is concerned, and also to vouch for the country of origin. I believe, Vice-President Tajani, that it is worth imagining a future where we also have a European Monitoring Unit to protect health and safety, in other words, an authority to safeguard this originality. I believe that we must all agree on this positive aspect that has emerged from this report. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I listened with interest to the introduction by the President of the Council and the Vice-President of the Commission, and I have to say that I am not convinced by the conclusions. I am not convinced by the conclusions of the March European Council, because we are witnessing a decline, among some leading figures of European contemporary history, of the Community ideal and method. It is this that concerns us given what is happening in the world; rather, certain aspects concern us. The Greek affair is merely an illustration of what Europe ought to be, but is in reality not yet. Therefore, we call on the European Commission, on the Vice-President, who is standing in here for the President, and on the President of the Council, to adopt a strong political initiative, a legislative initiative: the Commission must set the agenda, and the Council must ensure that we do not trail in the wake of governments whose power and incisiveness is too often curbed by imminent electoral issues – yesterday in France and Italy, tomorrow in the United Kingdom and Germany – which paralyse the action of governments. Your role must be not only that of a facilitator, Mr Van Rompuy, but of a driving force behind this Europe, and we appeal to your democratic and pro-European sensibility to ensure that this new impetus will bring benefits for this Europe. It is no longer enough to set objectives; we need to define instruments. We agree on the objectives, just as we agreed on the Lisbon Strategy. What are the instruments, though? Do we want to end up with a federal budget – and to call it that – which equates to at least 2% of GDP? Do we want to bring into play Eurobonds, European investments and treasury bonds so that we can politically enhance this Europe, without which we will go nowhere? In essence, we need to know whether we are succeeding in defining the new Europe and whether we are succeeding in defining – through a new relationship between the European political forces within and outside this Parliament – the real distinction, the real boundary that exists within today’s Europe between conservatives and progressives, between those who want a more politically integrated Europe and those who, instead, want only an enlarged single market.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe’s ambition to remain the world’s largest economy must increasingly be linked to the revival of its competitiveness, to the quality of its manufacturing system and to its ability to conquer new markets. The fight against counterfeiting and commercial infringement plays an essential role in this context. However, the protection of trademarks, patents and intellectual property are not only non­financial instruments that make the system more competitive, they are also a tangible example of the application to the industrial economy of principles of a democratic legal culture founded on respect for the rules, for those rules which have been violated in past years under the force of international financial speculation. The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) is a fundamental instrument with which to combat counterfeiting, a phenomenon which yields incredible revenues of USD 500 billion per year, which has links with organised crime and which affects – indeed threatens – fundamental human rights such as health, if we only think of the counterfeiting of medicines. If we are to assess the need for ACTA, we must bear this international context in mind. On the other hand, we must call for this treaty to also respect certain basic, fundamental principles of coexistence inspired by respect for the rules. We cannot hide the fact that we are concerned about the legal basis of the treaty, about the negotiating mandate and its transparency. Those who represent, as this Parliament does, 500 million citizens, must be informed officially, not confidentially. The negotiators from the Commission must report back to this House on the state of progress of the work, and access to the documents and information must be provided so that a detailed opinion can be expressed. The difficult yet fruitful cooperation between Parliament and the Commission can help the European Union to realise its potential in the best possible way. The resolution is along these lines and, as such, it is worthy of our vote. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important opportunity to reaffirm, above all, the importance of the Generalised System of Preferences. Both the basic GSP system and the GSP+ system, which are both linked to the ‘Everything But Arms’ initiative, contribute to reducing poverty, in strict accordance with the primary obligation of ensuring respect for human rights. It is the violation of these basic principles of coexistence that recently led the European Union to withdraw Sri Lanka’s preferential tariff benefits following a detailed investigation by the Commission. The new institutional framework must, however, fully include Parliament in the legislative process aimed at modifying the legislation in force. We therefore hope that it will include a complete review of the regulation, in accordance with the ordinary procedures, since it has several shortcomings, including on the very subject of investigations. The next step will be the joint resolution. The effectiveness of the regulation depends on its credibility, the objectiveness of the criteria upon which it is based and the strictness with which it is applied. In a Europe in which the vast majority of citizens do not agree with exporting democracy at gunpoint, trade and trade­related aid are essential vehicles for disseminating principles of coexistence based on respect for fundamental human rights. It is our duty not to lapse into indifference – which would be wrong – but also to avoid making hasty judgments about certain parties, judgments which sound like irrevocable sentences, as is the case with Colombia. This is why I do not feel able to support what are almost one-sided inflexible attitudes to one country or another, but I do strongly support the need for enhanced monitoring of all of the problematic situations, in the spirit of the legislation in force and according to the principles of the rules on which we want to base the legislative review that we are demanding.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, new players have emerged out of the wings onto the world stage, some of which were actually considered developing countries not long ago. This must change our approach, cultural and otherwise, towards free trade and the tangible manifestations of the relationship between the European Union and its major competitors. This relationship is currently mediated by certain magic terms that have not yet entered into the vocabulary of the European Commission. These terms are reciprocity, European interest, the fight against dumping and the fight against tariff barriers. This is the background to the free trade agreement with Korea, which incidentally confused two Commissioners – the Commissioner for Internal Market and Services and the Commissioner for Employment – and some governments. What are the real advantages of this bilateral agreement, when 50% of the trade between the European Union and Korea concerns the automotive sector, when the disparity between the 700 000 Korean cars exported to us as opposed to the 27 000 European cars imported by Korea is glaringly evident? What is the sense in providing indirect aid of approximately EUR 1 600 for each Korean car sold in Europe when some European governments find it difficult to provide incentives for buying and selling cars to stimulate consumption? How can we also fail to take into account the serious doubts over the textile and electronics industries? We will not settle with hearing for the umpteenth time, Commissioner, as Mrs Ashton said before you, that there are advantages for our chemical, pharmaceutical or agrifood industries because these pale scandalously into insignificance compared to the consequences for textiles, electronics and, above all, for cars, or financial services. Could it be that Europe, even with the crisis we are in today, is yet again choosing the financial option for its development? We all welcomed the birth of the new Europe in Lisbon with hope. Europe cannot however, fail to take responsibility for European interests in the world, particularly today. The United States is jumping through hoops to defend Boeing against Airbus and the Argentinean Government is threatening to expropriate Telecom. The agreement with Korea actually legitimises pass-through financing with China which, until now, was illegal. This is the scenario in which our major businesses are forced to operate. Behind them are hundreds of thousands of workers, of families who can see their future going up in smoke, not because they are producing poor quality services or goods but because poorly defined interests are allowed to prevail over more evident and objective interests. We trust in your sensitivity, Commissioner, in the hope that you will avoid over-hasty ratifications, which could go hand in hand with unacceptable decisions over the provisional application of the commercial side of the agreement pending ratification, or at least decisions that will be unacceptable until the regulation on the bilateral safeguard clause has been clearly defined. The adoption of this clause is subject to the ordinary legislative procedure that should be considered a first step to any appraisal of the advisability … (The President cut off the speaker) Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

President of the Commission, the progressives among us are giving you a vote of confidence today so as not to leave you open to the blackmail of those who have little faith in this community of Europe and so as not to subordinate you to the governments of the Twenty-Seven. Believing in a community of Europe means breaking your deafening silence and taking up a central role in the major international issues; defending European interests in the industrial and economic arena; reinforcing social policy and investing more towards conquering world poverty; consolidating our alliance with the United States but on equal terms; reinforcing the position of the European Union in international bodies, beginning with the UN Security Council; relaunching multilateralism in world trade; and setting the agenda in the fight against global pollution. Our vote today will be a conditional vote of confidence, with no exceptions, in the Commission and in the individual Commissioners, in order fully to achieve the new Europe born in Lisbon, a political player among the major world powers, and so that it can be, above all, a community of destiny dedicated to its own economic and civil progress, and which sets itself a mission of peace, justice and freedom in the world; one that is not solely a community of memory, living in the present off its own wealth and off a past glory that is now faded.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Zapatero, thank you for the great commitment you are making during this parliamentary term regarding the items you have announced, even though this is no longer the time to list all the useful items, but to make practical efforts to revive Europe. We need to end this period of defining institutional structures and to face the major issues which still prevent Europe from being able to compete on an equal footing with its international partners. We need to know whether the European Union will be able, one day very soon, to have a seat in the United Nations, whether it will be able to have a seat, as the European Union, at the G20, whether it wants greater fiscal and social harmonisation, and what resources it wants to put into the European economic circuit so that it can truly do what its other international competitors have done. We need to come here – and I say this also to President Barroso – with concrete measures to revive Europe, because, in six months’ time, we will not see the same results as we have seen previously with other previous experiences. We would also like to know whether the time has finally come when, as Kissinger would say 30 years ago, the major world leaders know which telephone number to call when they need to speak to someone in Europe, and do not just contact the Member States. At stake is Europe’s dignity as it emerges from the Treaty of Lisbon, but also the European social model, that fundamental democracy which we Members of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament strongly demand and on which we want the future well-being of our citizens to be based.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I certainly do not intend at this time – even with the time available to me – to go back over all of the reasons behind the repeated request that we, as Parliament, are making. I would point out – and you yourself have already made this point, Commissioner – that Mrs Muscardini and I are the only two veterans of 2006, of the signing of the resolution with which this Parliament endorsed the initiative of the then Commissioner Mandelson in December 2006. We hoped that the initiative that you undertook a few weeks ago to make small changes in order to achieve a compromise could have been supported more strongly, including within the Article 133 Committee. Among other things we regret that, within that committee, many countries reiterated their opposition or misgivings, including the United Kingdom, via its representative. All that we want to do today is to remind you that this request is not about protectionism; it is not industries that are no longer able to compete on the international market that we want to defend, but consumers: we want to draw attention to the theme of health, the environment and genuine reciprocity on the world market, which is lacking today. Moreover, it is not only lacking with regard to the weakest subjects in the world: no, it is also lacking with regard to Japan, to the United States, to Australia, to Canada, to Brazil, to India, to the main competitors of the European Union, which has a duty, in these economically difficult times, to defend the Community interest, which is also behind this request. We therefore hope that Parliament will throw its full weight behind the initiatives that the Commission provides and we also hope that the commitments made a few weeks ago will be fully honoured, even if this procedure cannot be wound up by Christmas but under the new procedure introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the time has come for this House to stop the endless debate on the Treaty of Lisbon, which we have still heard going on today. I believe that we must respect the wishes of this Parliament, of the great European countries, of the 27 and of the 26 that have ratified this treaty in various forms, but democratically, and thus the offences to the treaty and its democratic content must also be rejected. I also believe that the Council meeting at the end of the month will be an important opportunity to reaffirm the need to revive the idea of Europe beyond Lisbon and to revive the economy, as well as to ensure that Europe does not back down over the major issue of climate change. From that perspective, I believe that what we have heard lately from the President-in-Office, but also what we have heard today, is insufficient. Europe beyond Lisbon is failing to interpret the strong content of the new treaty and is failing to comply with the terms of the Lisbon Agenda. Therefore, if we 500 million Europeans want to remain the world’s biggest economic power, a power that is preparing to become a major political player on the international stage, I urge the Commission to fully carry out its mandate of proposing European legislation on the major issues relating to the economy, the economic recovery and the labour market recovery, and I urge the Council to turn a long list of headings into an actual policy to help resolve the economic difficulties. This is what I believe we are lacking. We are lacking a major economic recovery plan, we are lacking in major areas such as the revival of the infrastructure policy with Eurobonds, and we are lacking a high-profile European approach. This is what we expect from the European Council at the end of the month. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, people who seek to label as anti-Italian, subversive and communist anyone who calls for a set of rules on communication and freedom of information that respects pluralism, and which is characterised by a clear separation between the fortunes of those who assume important institutional responsibilities and the wealth they derive from entrepreneurial activities in the publishing and information fields, are making a serious mistake, which must not be forgiven, justified or allowed here in Europe. Not once in our speeches have we mentioned the Italian Prime Minister. We could have referred to the number of newspapers he owns: 150 in Italy; and around 40 television channels. That is not the problem, however. The problem is that pluralism of information – and in information – is a cornerstone of every free democracy and must be used as a defence against every monopolistic and oligopolistic philosophy and against conflicts of interest. The sovereignty of each State, the reaffirmation that the European Union is not a superstate, Commissioner Reding, must not make us forget that the European Union also has a Charter of Fundamental Rights from which stems a legislative system that the Member States cannot ignore. You know that, on these very issues, many times the Court of Justice – in the case of Italy, not on issues to do with the system, Mr Speroni – has passed sentences that are still to be carried out. Globalisation of the markets and the ever-increasing use of the airwaves now require more targeted European legislation to regulate this sensitive matter, which has such a strong influence on public opinion and therefore also on the principle of popular sovereignty – which underpins the European Union and not just the Italian Republic – and on the ways in which this principle is exercised. It should no longer be possible for anyone to invoke the sacrosanct rights of the popular majority to justify threats to freedom of the press in what was, until recently, a situation of disparity between the plaintiff and the defendant – whether in Italy or in Portugal, as we were reminded earlier – because this undermines the foundations of the rules of coexistence on which the Union is based. This is why there is an urgent need for a directive against concentrations in the field of information that will regulate the dealings of those who are involved in politics and, at the same time, control very important media.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have welcomed the work done during this period in which Mrs Ashton has been carrying out her role as Commissioner. I must say that we have had a better relationship with her than we had with her predecessor, despite their common political affiliation, which we too share, and their common nationality. However, this time I do not share the Commissioner’s enthusiasm on this issue, because too often in recent years, the Commission has taken the floor here and talked up certain initiatives, only to then pursue a different path. We are going through a particular moment in time, a major economic and financial crisis, which is also the result of a lack of reciprocity in the world, not only with developing countries – which has its own logic, its own explanation – but with the new global players and the traditional global players. Too often I seem to sense a lack of awareness within the Commission, by its President and its Commissioners, of which initiatives should be implemented to aid the recovery of European industry, the recovery of the European manufacturing industry. It seems to me that this agreement – which, admittedly, is a positive agreement and has extremely positive content – has more of an academic value; it is almost a textbook treaty, but one that is not in touch with reality. We export USD 30 billion to Korea, only USD 20 billion come back in the form of cars exported from Korea to Europe, and USD 1.5 billion will be the indirect aid that accrues to Korean cars in Europe, without mentioning the textile and other sectors. That is a definite imbalance, which I believe must be highlighted and must be corrected, before the green light is given to a free trade agreement that penalises European industry. Ours is a quality industry that has committed itself to the new requirements that innovation calls for, certainly not a bankrupt industry that cannot get to grips with the need for innovation that exists within the economy.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, like many of my colleagues, I would like to ask the Council what its real intentions are in the light of this proposal. Do you want to reduce everything to a minimum and freeze the future? And is this the same Europe that will supposedly be relaunched with Mr Van Rompuy’s document on integration? Where is the consistency between Mr Van Rompuy’s two policy documents? Where is the consistency, from the point of view of ordinary citizens, between the measures announced in July on employment and growth, those great calls for hope and for the future of the EU that we heard from the Council, and this sudden violence done in the name of realism, aiming for mere survival? With these figures and these cuts how can we implement cohesion and the agricultural reforms in terms of concrete actions? These are sincere questions that require a clear and honest answer, because there is evidence here of a type of institutional schizophrenia that Parliament and the citizens can no longer tolerate. Parliament wants consistency and credibility. The very first criticism that can be levelled is that the budget just does not add up. So much for growth and investment: this is the 2008 budget over again! Of course it must be conceded that Mr Van Rompuy, in heading 1a, overturns the quite scandalous suggestion by Cyprus. He also recognises the essential role of the budget in offering support to growth in some sectors, additional to the support offered by the national budgets. But growth and innovation – clearly – should not be achieved at the expense of other sectors that also contribute to ‘growth’ and ‘employment’, such as cohesion policy, but also agricultural policy, which has created jobs and is ever more focused on innovation and protection of rural areas. ‘Growth’ and ‘employment’ also mean culture, training, the transnational networks, the Connecting Europe Facility, as well as solidarity and international development, human rights in the world and our contribution to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. What we are seeing however is the usual Council spectacle: no vision, no leadership, a Babel of conflicting and competing national interests, an inextricable tangle of vetoes, aspirations and general discontent. Unfortunately what is mainly missing is Europe! Patrizia Toia,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today Europe is being asked to perform a new task of industrial policy coordination, and even the most ardent supporters of the freedom of private initiative are calling for this role to be carried out. Without more Europeanisation of national strategies, particularly in terms of job protection, the current crisis will not be resolved and there will be no economic recovery. The automotive crisis is not just about overcapacity: it is about widespread job losses. The crisis now seems to be structural and concerns the very future of the automotive sector as we know it today. We want to have an automotive industry in Europe and do not want to squander the skills, know-how and professional expertise that exist. We are therefore calling for a major restructuring and regeneration project to be launched swiftly so that the costs do not escalate disproportionately. Restructuring cannot only derive from fragmented decisions by national governments and individual companies. We at least need to try to join forces and guide this painful process at EU level, making the interested parties sit down at the table for a dialogue between the social partners, manufacturers, trade unions and governments in each country, offering support for research, innovation, training, upskilling and the necessary funding. I know that this will be an arduous task, because the national interests of individual companies are not the same. However, since competition within the European Union is highly ambiguous and at times risks being unfair, I believe that ultimately it is in the interests of all countries to have effective EU guidance and stimulus, so that together we can face the increasingly aggressive global market.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the energy crisis has taken and is continuing to take its toll on employment, on the thousands of short-term, temporary and permanent workers in this sector. The major steel conglomerates are increasingly pivoting towards the Far East or the American continent, which raises a question over the direction of our development model. I believe that Europe should resurrect the idea that a manufacturing sector such as ours needs a solid production base, able to supply the European internal market. We must therefore defend this sector and the role of a stable steel industry, and we must support it, Commissioner, if we want to halt the industrial decline. I think we need to move away from the dualism – which has not emerged here this evening, but which is often heard in discussions about this sector – between those who campaign to protect the environment and workers, which is misguided because it does not show us the way forward. An industry in which steel is considered to be an integral part needs the latest production systems, concrete and balanced solutions, which safeguard the various interests, the various requirements. Therefore, we need a strong European plan focusing on sustainability – on which we should never turn our backs, in my opinion – as a source of real added value, with which we can compete in the world, supporting investments, as several parties have already said, new technologies, new processes and upgrading our plants; a European economy that makes efficient use of its resources, including energy, indeed starting with energy and the search for new materials.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a budget is the programme and charter of an institution since it shows what it is, what it does and above all what it intends to do in the future. We are faced with a crucial choice between a budget for mere survival or subsistence – with a little less for everyone – or a courageous budget with selective decisions, with investment in job creation, innovation, youth, in other words in the future of the European Union and its development role. It must be emphasised that, as has been stated very clearly by Mr Kalfin among others, today Europe can do what the individual Member States cannot do for the economy, for regional development and for the regions – where social cohesion will either be strengthened or die – in other words, for the lives of the very citizens we mentioned. The great European choices are today in danger of being suffocated by accounting-based disputes – within the Council and elsewhere – between net beneficiary countries and net contributors. It should be underlined that this as a false problem, because it is easy, taking account of what happened in the past, to demonstrate with figures and numbers, rather than with words, that the contributor countries actually gained, often more than the others, from the convergence of economies and growth. The Council is currently working to add figures to the various headings. The war of positions has started: statements, stances taken by certain countries that view the budget as a mere expense item to be cut mercilessly, and even used to appease anti-European sentiment, easy to fuel at a time of crisis. This is a mistaken position that does not help the integration that we are struggling to achieve in other areas. As many of us have pointed out, our Europe is still incomplete and imperfect. We adopted a stability plan that was supposed to include development, but we have stabilised so much that we are in recession. Let us at least take the opportunity offered by this budget and this multiannual financial framework to make choices that go in the right direction. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I just wanted to add my voice to the plaudits this report has garnered from the House in relation to the need to strengthen the European Union’s standing as a place where it is possible to invest, produce, and produce in line with our conception of an economy that is inclusive as well as socially and environmentally sustainable. I think a number of parts of this measure are really helpful, while others could be added. I do think it is important to grasp this opportunity and work even harder to enhance our attractiveness through regional marketing policies and openness, which represent the region’s proposition for a productive, industrial, manufacturing and services economy that, as it originates in the region, is respectful of the environment. This regional approach together with EU policies along the same lines are what we need to attract investment and growth. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the initial comments on the European Council, now the time for simplistic interpretation has begun, which is a mistake because important progress was made. For example, the destructive link between banks and public debts has been broken and we have a plan – albeit a weak one – on employment and jobs. The European institutions seem once again to be infused with a spirit of resurgence and renewed progress towards political unity, after so much slowness and dragging of feet, and a desire for real progress towards greater integration. In this vein, yesterday saw a display of real unity between Parliament and the Commission. There were no winners or losers, but an undeniable, new institutional and political vitality compared to the diarchy of the past, which was the negation – the very antithesis – of the European spirit. Many countries showed initiative and a desire to act, not to create new, exclusive alliances, but to build a shared consensus that is respectful of all Member States. This is the path towards political unity, without which any form of banking, fiscal or monetary unity will be totally inadequate. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, water is increasingly being seen as a public asset, a precious resource for the whole of humankind. It is vital, therefore, to develop an integrated, efficient strategy for the wise use of this finite resource. Measures at EU level must address our continent’s current and future water challenges, and therefore the ‘Blueprint to safeguard Europe’s water resources’ to be published in November is more important than ever to ensure – as has been said – sufficient availability of good-quality water for sustainable and equitable use. I regard this as an important aspect of the EU 2020 strategy. Water is linked to food or, rather, water is part of food, and a small amount of food contains a huge amount of water, so a water strategy is also a strategy to ensure food security for Europe and the world. Water can lead to wars, but it can also be a factor for development and peace; I therefore strongly support the proposal contained in the report to devote 1%, for example, of water tariffs to decentralised cooperation measures and growth projects around the world. I hope this legislation, which already exists in some Member States, will spread like good practice to other countries to become law in all the Member States of the European Union.

 I support this report because it is essential to attract new investors to the EU market. This is only possible through measures such as project bonds and far-reaching reforms such as the cohesion policy reform that we will adopt in 2013. Ambitious territorial development policies will allow the EU to maintain its high-quality human capital and foster an open and fair business environment as well as investment in research and innovation for successful products and business models, for the benefit of Europe’s economy and society. The promotion of a strong industrial base needs to be put at the centre of reforms, particularly in those areas where the EU has traditionally been strong, as well as in high-tech sectors where a strong industrial base is essential to develop innovation in products, processes and services and to create new jobs. In a context of economic recovery, it is necessary to adopt ambitious legislation for SMEs by simplifying regulations and strengthening access to finance, promoting effective capital systems (venture and angel), and enhancing the role of private and public equity investments in financing long-term corporate growth. Parliament’s commitment will be maximal. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even though our budget is limited, a year’s budget adds up to a figure that can be wasted by the markets in a single day. The multiannual financial framework (MFF) is very important but only if the Member States do not see the budget as a source of expenditure to be cut like all public expenditure, but rather as a resource which can help the economy to grow – an investment – and not as a cost for citizens but as the way to produce tangible results. The figures represent programmes, projects, things to be achieved. Therefore, I say ‘no’ to short-sighted cuts and ‘no’ to infighting between countries, because growth is an opportunity for all European citizens. In addition, the European budget should not be seen as separate, but as complementary to national budgets. A new approach is needed to strengthen links between the European budget and national budgets. In some ways, our budget is the 28th budget of the Member States. This is the only way we can create the global assets that can develop effective policies. We are asking for a more coordinated approach. The European Semester can also help with this. Finally, as regards Parliament’s role, I say this to the Council: we will accept neither a fait accompli 
nor a ‘take it or leave it’ approach. We want a preliminary consultation before the formal proposal is presented for approval. Citizens, worried about the future of Europe, express themselves through us and we, as their representatives, want to play a part in taking decisions. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say a big thank you to Ms Podimata and to all those Members who have worked hard so that we could hold today’s vote. This proposal has an inescapable logic and its basis is clear, robust and fair, if it is possible to use this latter adjective in relation to the economy. Not even the objections raised today undermine this logic, and the understandable concerns voiced over the possible counterproductive or undesirable effects – if made in good faith – can potentially be answered and resolved, as shown by the debate over the last few months. Of course, solutions to avoid undesirable effects exist, as long as there really is the will to establish this tax, because sometimes one has the feeling that caution is called for just to slow or block the approval process, with predictions of economic catastrophes. On this point, I would address Ms Ford: have we not already experienced these catastrophes thanks to harmful and reckless speculation? Mention has also been made of difficulties, but today, Europeans are calling on the institutions to recover the ability to carry out their general role and to equip the world of finance with precise rules, since this is our duty and this is our sovereignty as a body with a general nature. Therefore, let us make the right choice today, one which the citizens will welcome. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, development is not a luxury but a duty. Today, growth is a universally acknowledged priority. Yet this was not the case until recently, and my group can be rightly proud of having consistently pressed on this matter, in calling for some significant changes to the focus of European policy. As has already been mentioned, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) – which are the productive backbone of the economy – need not only the urgent interventions that will be discussed later but also long-term measures to cultivate the human capital of the young men and women of Europe. These measures must send them the message that a business-oriented outlook and a spirit of enterprise mean more than a career or a question of personal success or adventure. Indeed, these attitudes are also useful to society, because they help to create – through a model of development based on widespread enterprise – the conditions for fairer and more sustainable growth, as Ms Krehl has already said. For we want to see development that is innovative, and that is both able to seize all the new opportunities and sustainable in environmental and social terms. As regards the long-term efforts, in terms of training, I would also advocate revisiting technical colleges, which are a real asset in Europe, one that we have neglected for too long. These are a great resource and a great way of learning about science and technology, and therefore of getting a taste for creating something new through your own ingenuity. As for resources, while still on the subject of urgent action – and I address these remarks especially to the Commission but also to the Council, which together with Parliament, must make a decision on the Structural Funds Regulation – it will be essential to coordinate resources. Shall we be able to use the Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs (COSME) funds (the financial instruments for SMEs), the research funds and the Structural Funds in a complementary approach? If we use these resources wisely, in a complementary fashion, then we shall be able to get the most from them; otherwise, we shall risk spreading them too thinly. The Structural Funds are indispensable, and they are intrinsically focused on this priority. Nevertheless, Commissioner, while recognising the importance of thematic concentration, I believe that it is also important that the regional authorities should be able to contribute to the planning and decision-making process, because while it is true that many regions need guidance, many others are quite capable of planning and setting priorities. The regions are key, for they are the engine room of progress, of business growth, of the spirit of new employment, and of the desire to participate, including on the part of all the economic, social and community bodies. Hence, the regions are the main resource where EU policies and the policies of the local authorities must come together. I must emphasise, then, the importance of coordinating resources. And finally, as regards the definition of SMEs – a subject on which the Member States will have their say, and therefore the Council will need to as well – in my view, what counts is not only the structural elements – employment and turnover – but also the quality of the small and medium-sized enterprises, which operate locally but think globally. I therefore ask that special consideration be given to the fundamental nature of small businesses and their support network. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, when we speak about good examples for our citizens, when we speak about the internal market and the possibility of creating genuine, concrete opportunities for changes in everyday life through the working of the internal market, we can truly use this example – and we obviously have need of many others – as a fruit of our labours. It is a good example because, as was said, it has an impact on citizens’ real lives, on their daily lives. It also helps businesses to expand their market, not because charges are high and services reduced, but because they can increase their service offering and, in substance, it also helps the economy as a whole. That is why I believe that it is, without doubt, a positive example, a good example. Yet you will have realised, Commissioner, that there is a widespread desire in this House; in particular, let us recall the speeches of two of my colleagues, Ms Riera Madurell and Mr Goebbels, not to mention many others, who would like this good example to become the best possible example, and would like us to move towards a zero-cost roaming outcome. Such an outcome is possible, and this measure partly anticipates that. Are we wishing for utopia? No. We are not, because an internal European market implies that domestic and non-domestic tariffs should be similar. There is no longer differentiation if we speak of the single market and, above all, because there is no technical justification for an increase in charges. I remember when, in 2007, we began to discuss voice roaming charges, the first of the trio that we have now tackled. There was a certain incredulity and also certain difficulties; not, however, on the part of the Commission, and here I must give the credit to your predecessor, Ms Reding. The difficulties were quite wide-ranging. They came from those who said that a true market did not allow for tariffs to be regulated, that there were political prices to pay, that they belonged to an old idea of the left, et cetera, et cetera. There were those who said it would not work and so on, that it would put a brake on the market. In the end, however, we have done it. The interests of citizens and establishing that these were not justifications for increased charges have made it possible. That is how the world moves on, and things are becoming, let us say, ever more possible. That is why I think an even more courageous outcome is achievable. A concluding remark on why it is not possible to do otherwise. Today, we had a visit from a delegation of Tunisian citizens; I do not know if they are still here. Perhaps one of its many benefits is that this extension to outside the EU will make us understand that the opportunity of using phones without the bugbear of charges will also aid democracy.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I want, first and foremost, to express my very sincere appreciation for Mr Giegold’s work on this own-initiative report. I also recall that we share with him and with others an active presence in Parliament’s Social Economy Intergroup. My political group, as you know, believes that the social model is one of the fundamental characteristics of the European integration project. Therefore, this is not just a simple policy, or one of many; it is a policy that characterises our entire project. In this day and age, with the attacks relating to the need for public spending cuts as well, we still firmly support this priority. We know that it may be as a revised or modified social model, but we believe that it should be retained, defended and reaffirmed as a priority. Therefore, I believe that, in this same vision, we must also promote business entities, such as cooperatives, which produce goods and services and have a very special role in the so-called European social economy. These businesses reassert the fact that it is possible to be productive, to do good things, to be efficient even if the goal is not profit but rather, for example, employment, welfare, labour development and contributing to the life of the local community. This is why it is important – I am finishing here, Madam President – for Europe to make the appropriate instruments available for an active policy and make a good statute – not the one that exists now, which is unusable, but a good statute for cooperatives which can be a way to help this very important sector.

 Mr President, I too applaud the positive outcome of the transitional period, and hope that a definitive solution will be found in the financial programming that will deliver a stable, definitive and rapid response to a real need, which is unfortunately growing, because the number of poor people, the new poor, in Europe is continuing to rise. New areas of the population that were formerly self-sufficient now do not have enough food to live on, and food is a primary basic right. These are poor workers, single mothers with children, and people suffering from invalidating illnesses. The spectre of hunger has once again raised its head in civilised Europe. I believe that we cannot remain indifferent, just as we cannot support the reasons of those – including many of our colleagues, unfortunately – who think the responsibility should lie first and foremost with the Member States, that we should focus on nutritional education, and so on. In my view we should first of all take this action and then abolish food subsidies, not the other way round. Luckily, however, outside Parliament, Europe is made up of young people, volunteers, associations and political groups that want this House to deliver more fairness and solidarity in Europe. This is what we are working towards. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Internet applications and services still have great potential both for the economy and for a more informed and inclusive society. Now that the telecoms package is being transposed into national legislation, there is a risk that the European framework may become fragmented. The Commission’s monitoring role will therefore be important. I would also say that the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) will have an important part to play, and some of us would have liked it to have been stronger during the drafting of the telecoms package as well. The priorities that we want to emphasise in this debate are: a guarantee of net neutrality, development of broadband infrastructure and of more open software, security of access and interoperability of systems, promotion of the use of digital technologies throughout industry and the services sector, production of digital content and new services, inclusion of people who are currently excluded – I am thinking of people with disabilities, amongst others – and support for pluralism in information provision and culture. It should also be laid down and guaranteed that operators cannot adopt blocking or throttling practices or discriminate against users and that they should ensure the utmost transparency in their commercial offers and in all their business activities. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this year and the next are crucial to the future and unity of Europe. The work programme should therefore be included more fully in this framework of exceptionality, which certainly means focusing on key objectives, giving more concrete efficacy to our actions, concentrating investments towards those bodies which can, in turn, put into action other private resources, but also, as my colleague has said, seeing the Commission – President Barroso, if I could just have your attention for a moment – playing a more active role, which is better directed towards the reality of certain countries and of the entire euro area and of the whole of Europe. We hope that the Commission will take on this role, and I say this even as a representative of a country which, at this moment, is changing its government; which is not a technocratic government but rather a technical government that demonstrates not the rejection of political forces and politics but, if anything, the generosity – and I say this as a force that was in opposition in my country – of parties that are ready to do what is useful for the country even without direct representation. I believe that the theme of stable and equal growth should regard the theme of supporting businesses in two ways: access to credit and innovation. The Commission and Europe are capable of achieving this in a concrete way. When we recapitalise and help to recapitalise banks, even, perhaps, with public support, we should demand that this credit go to the real economy – first and foremost to the real economy. When Horizon 2020 becomes one of the main dossiers, we should initiate wide-scale research on innovation for enterprises, whether these be large or small. The chapter on the digital agenda is also very important because the creation of this unique market will be of great help to society. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D
),

The favourable outcome of the vote concerning the resolution on the situation in Egypt and Syria, with particular regard for Christian communities, is confirmation of the fact that Europe continues to look after ethnic and religious minorities. Unfortunately, the situation has now become even more worrying due to a trail of blood and death, in Egypt above all, but also elsewhere in the world, which the European institutions cannot ignore. Parliament is alive to this and intends to take action to ensure that such episodes are not repeated. There is no use in denying that tension exists between Muslims and Christians, but stopping there would only afford a partial view of the situation. History teaches us that religions can coexist, as long as the climate is right. The current difficulties are worsened by hidden troublemakers, who fan the flames to deepen the conflict and impede the transition to democracy. We need to clarify the role of the armed forces in this phase, as they have all too frequently turned into the agents of repression, rather than guarantors of transition. We appeal to the representatives of all religions, philosophies and schools of thought to contribute to civil and peaceful coexistence. Europe – the home of fundamental rights and freedoms – will do its part to ensure that these principles are respected. Patrizia Toia,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis in Europe is interlinking the problems of public budgets and private capital with those of the productivity of our businesses in a vicious circle, and the spectre of recession is looming. Therefore, if small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are our top priority, I would call on the Commission, alongside Parliament, to make absolutely sure that our good principles are put into practice and that the Member States turn the legislative initiatives of the Small Business Act (SBA) into highly effective, high-quality, concrete measures. Just think, Commissioner, what would happen if the Late Payment Directive were implemented early in all the Member States, and what a great benefit to SMEs it would be! The SME tests are important, but we are still at the method stage. Of course, it is only right to check that the laws we make really are suited to SMEs and further their interests, but we would urge you to persevere and examine the issues very thoroughly when setting up this framework of opportunity that you have sketched out. We also appreciate what the Commission has been doing and we are ready with the budget and the other options that we have to support it. I would just like to say a word about credit. We have to make our position clear to the banks – I am saying this to you, Commissioner – because SMEs need help … (The President cut off the speaker) Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the preparation of the common strategic framework for research and innovation funding represents a huge opportunity for the development and economy of Europe. It is a matter of pulling the lever that can truly usher in a period of growth and also of new skilled employment, such as that done by researchers and young people who devote themselves precisely to the new opportunities in innovation and technology and associated professions. One observation in particular emerges from this work, which is that we in Europe must put increasing emphasis on the kinds of research and innovation that find practical application, originate new companies, result in new patents and do not remain pure basic research or pure knowledge, which is certainly important, but not to the extent that it actually triggers development. The second observation is the relationship with local bodies, regions and territories, which are an important tool for territorial planning and for bringing together research, universities, centres of excellence and businesses.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report looks at global food security. This means that what is at stake here is not only hunger in the world or in the very poorest countries, but that the subject of food supply affects all communities, including those in the most developed countries. I would like to pick out a few key points of consistency between European policies and this target of global food security, because we in Parliament are quite accomplished at preaching, but often we are not consistent in our decisions. I only wish to highlight three innovative areas, which I think we ought to develop further. Firstly: food supply is currently jeopardised by price volatility, caused by speculation in food markets – through derivatives and so forth – that must be contained, if not banned outright. Secondly: the subject of land grabbing, which I think needs to be addressed in some form of treaty or negotiation, because democracy and the survival of many populations are at risk. Thirdly: consistency between food supply and energy policies. In our efforts to produce new energy, we must not make it impossible to produce food for the people of the world. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, hidden behind the widespread prosperity of our continent is an often invisible Europe that we refer to in numerical, statistical and sociological terms and not as real people. These people are often women and children or the elderly – the most vulnerable population groups in other words. However, Europe will have no credibility in the eyes of the public unless it learns to be consistent, and we want to be consistent, in this Parliament and at this stage in Europe’s existence. Therefore, if we say that the Union is based upon values and human rights, I do not think we can suspend or cut so drastically a programme for people who suffer from food poverty – in other words, for those who lack the right to food or the right to access food and hence lack fundamental rights – on account of an unresolved legal issue. We are talking about an agricultural fund, a social fund – and if it is a social fund, Commissioner, it should not impinge on other social programmes, but be a new ad hoc fund with appropriate resources. We say that we want to guarantee food security for Europeans, but the most important right with regard to food security is the right to food itself, followed by the right to healthy food. We need, therefore, to be consistent. With that in mind, we must find a legal solution that provides continuity and that, with the help of non-governmental organisations in the voluntary sector, guarantees the most fundamental human right: the right to food.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is time to take some bold decisions in this Europe if we want to do more than just survive. The crisis has severely disrupted normal life for European citizens and businesses and, if we do not react, it could mean that the quality of the social and cultural life, the welfare and the future of young people and Europeans, are irreversibly affected. As well as creating valuable cohesion and prosperity, overcoming the crisis means finding solutions to the causes identified: solutions for tackling speculation, which should also be restricted where necessary through the introduction of strict rules for the financial markets; solutions for combating the recession; solutions for combating the imbalanced development model that has put individuals below profit; and solutions for combating the resurgence of nationalism, which is today preventing Europe from making the choices that it has to make. Above all, it is time to provide tools and resources – new and old – so that we can forge ahead and start the engine of growth, with research, innovation, training and support for productive investment, infrastructure and jobs, because without jobs, people have no dignity or rights. Thanks to Mrs Berès and other Members, this report outlines a possible strategy for a Europe that is proud and aware of its role. It is now up to Europe’s leaders, if they exist, to implement it.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that one point that we all agree on and have established is that this programme for frequency harmonisation and coordinated spectrum use can serve a dual purpose. I believe that this is a key point to be remembered at all times; in other words, through the programme, we can develop the great potential for economic exploitation of this field by the telecommunications sector, the audiovisual sector and new services, while, at the same time, giving a boost to economic development and to other sectors linked to the telecommunications sector. We can also develop the potential for cultural and social development that this dual purpose permits and requires. Commissioner, in my opinion this programme should also be seen as an opportunity, so that we respect and uphold certain fundamental principles through the choices we make. Firstly, the principle of media pluralism. The review of the system for managing radio frequencies at European level is very important, and I believe that we must clearly prevent the accumulation of frequency rights and the creation of monopolies and oligopolies, which unfortunately exist in some European countries and which are becoming stronger and gaining a foothold in the broadcasting sector. Secondly, the principle of balance between the liberalisation and opening up of the market to new operators, and fairness, so that the commitments entered into with those operators who have provided substantial investment can also be promoted, supported and maintained on the market. Lastly, transparency and the guarantee of well-managed and well-administered frequency allocations. We are talking about auctions not only to focus on an aspect of the market that should be reconciled with all the possible social uses for spectrum, but also to say that discretion should not be used and unfair advantages should not be given with regard to radio frequencies. This point also deserves close attention. To conclude, unfortunately I do not have the time to expand on the social aspects, but they have been discussed at great length by all the members of my group. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteurs and Mr Barnier for their generous contribution to Parliament. We support the idea of an internal market which is able to understand and meet the social expectations and the implications that the social dimension requires. It is not a pipe dream; it is realistic and also modern. It is this vision that makes the market stronger, because focusing only on the economic element, essentially reducing the market to a question of economics, has shown that it will solve neither problems of growth nor of cohesion. This means, in short, that we must now fully realise the ideal of a European social market economy. In today’s texts, we have this. There is recognition of the social enterprises, cooperatives and their role, of mutual insurance companies and of foundations, which represent 10% of European companies and many of our jobs. These are a reality with real businesses demonstrating economic pluralism and the pluralism of business. They work with capital but not for capital and want to create work, welfare, quality of life and innovation, and to demonstrate that these values should and can be part of the internal market in Europe.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I join all my fellow Members who have spoken in noting that we are at last talking about a common industrial policy again, and I hope action and also specific decisions will be forthcoming again soon. I am grateful for the Lange report, the excellent work done by our fellow Member, and Vice-President Tajani’s communication. This decision means some important things, the first of which is that the revitalisation and recovery of Europe’s economy and the resilience of employment, as has been said, depend partly, and perhaps especially, on the recovery of the whole manufacturing sector, both the more advanced and the more traditional parts of it, and on the support it is given. That is because it is still possible to push the boundaries in manufacturing, something that was not so obvious until a short time ago. Secondly, the recovery of industry in Europe also means that our competitiveness is not only in play in the financial or tertiary sector, but here as well, and it is not too late for us to take up the challenge to make Europe competitive in industry vis-à-vis
 the rest of the world. The third point, as has been said, is that the new industrial policy focuses on factors rather than sectors; it focuses on factors and instruments that can genuinely promote new companies and a new capacity for resilience and modernisation. I feel it is important to highlight once again these new factors on which we need to act: credit – we are calling for new initiatives in addition to those already announced by the Commissioner on the subject of credit – raw materials, energy prices, innovation, research, the need to enhance the capacity for the technological transfer of the results of research and innovation within companies in Europe, in new products and new ways of organising production. We must make good use of a highly unique industrial fabric in Europe, particularly in certain countries, which is that of small and medium-sized enterprises, the quality of enterprises and of their products, and the unique nature of European industry. I think we should rediscover these manufacturing traditions and manufacturing roots in many countries in order to innovate and change them. Lastly, there is the question of location, which is very important. European policies are successful if they find a region able to tackle them. We therefore thank Mr Lange and look forward to an excellent collaboration with the Commission in order to arrive at concrete results very soon. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is not easy to find so much unanimity in Parliament This means that the work was really outstanding and Mrs Van Brempt and all the other shadow rapporteurs should be made aware of this. It has been said that the resulting instrument is very positive for several reasons. It is positive because its procedures and timeframes are fast; positive because it is aimed at highly qualified project categories; positive because it is aimed at urban contexts, in other words, at local authorities which, by making specific decisions, are able to bring about real change in the state of affairs and improve air quality, housing quality and urban transport quality; positive because it is aimed at profitable projects and can therefore yield a return of resources; and positive, lastly, because the strategy will bring many more resources into play. In the face of all this, however, picking up on an objection raised by many Members, including Mr Geier, Mr Turmes and Mr Cancian, I wish to say to the Commissioner that the sticking point will be the implementation, the choice of financial intermediaries, the relationship with local authorities and how their financial difficulties are dealt with. Commissioner, this instrument raises the possibility of opening the way to other projects, to a stabilisation of this instrument and its extension to other sectors. The topic is crucial. The same thing must not happen that happened with the Recovery Plan and with the small and medium-sized enterprises that are still waiting for the EUR 30 billion approved by Parliament and the Commission at the end of 2008.

 I just wanted to inform you that my voting machine was not working for the Hoang Ngoc report. I was voting against it. Patrizia Toia,  
rapporteur. 
− (IT) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report which we are debating this evening and on which we shall vote tomorrow is part of a major effort to implement the 20/20/20 package, which I believe is still one of the most far-sighted and significant things to have come out of the last European parliamentary term. If asked what I would save from the last five years, I would definitely place the 20/20/20 package at the top of the list. I believe that it is important to add that some very intense work went into this report, on the part of both the European Commission – a communication and a recommendation preceded this report – and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and others. They enriched the initial report and our work with many suggestions, additions and amendments. I believe that there is still a slight difference of opinion within Parliament over one point, and I hope that it can be overcome with tomorrow’s vote. It concerns the more or less binding nature that we wish to attribute to the contents of this report, which I would like to make a point of saying was drafted in a context of great understanding and great unanimity. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) represent an important sector, not least, in fact, because of the weight they carry in the European economy: they account for 7% of the labour force – of the European labour force – and 6% of GDP, thus a significant share of the European economy and of the European productive and labour force too. They are also very important not only, precisely, for what they represent, but also for the contribution they can make and for the essential, significant role that they can play in terms of trying to achieve this transition from our economy to a situation in which the economy, though still developed, produces fewer emissions and has a lower carbon content and will thus pollute less for our future and for that of the generations to come. In short, they can represent – not in words, but in concrete actions – changes that can lead to a way of producing, living, travelling and consuming in our society, and to that industrial revolution that, for many, will actually characterise the future of social and economic life, not only on our continent but throughout the entire world. How can ICTs make this major contribution to transforming our economy? Firstly, by changing the sector itself: the report is intended to demonstrate how this sector can, first and foremost, look within itself to see how it can produce communication, microelectronic and other instruments that consume less energy, and are thus inherently more efficient. Next, they can make an enormous contribution in the major sectors, in the housing and transport sectors. The latter two – I am quoting data from the Commission – are sectors in which greater efficiency, according to the European rules and the targets also laid down by the 20/20/20 package, can lead to a very substantial reduction in these emissions – since, today, the transport sector consumes 26% of the energy in Europe, and 40% is consumed in homes for heating and cooling, depending on the season – and can achieve very high levels of efficiency. This is without mentioning that the scope, in the case of the major sectors, affects our lives in very significant areas. I am thinking of the entire banking sector, of the relationships within public administration, of the entire e
-government sector and of all the services, in short, which, with the application of these technologies, will be able not only to reduce their carbon emissions but also to save time, with a consequent improvement in the quality of life of Europeans and in the quality of social life. This is, therefore, highly significant. However, I believe that this report will be all the more significant if Parliament approves its binding character tomorrow. I would like to offer just two examples, Mr President, if I may: smart meters and the smart grid, and smart cities. 
Only yesterday, 700 European mayors concluded a new agreement in this House, before our President and the European Commissioner, aimed precisely at improving the efficiency of cities, which are home to more than 70% of European citizens and which can thus make a major contribution to increasing efficiency and economic and social development.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is not just a routine debate but it is supposed to be very specific and to ask clear and precise questions – what resources are there and where to get them – and I hope that Parliament is expecting equally clear and precise answers, today and at the forthcoming Councils on 12 and 25 March. We want to tell the Commission and the Council firmly that the European Union, which has flown the flag for the fight against atmospheric emissions and climate change in front of the world, now has to be consistent if it does not want to lose credibility. It must do everything it can to achieve these goals. We must be well aware that talking about a low-emission economy means a kind of Copernican revolution for the production system; it means changing many things, having clear priorities and political will but, above all, sufficient resources and instruments. We also know that this Copernican revolution is vital for our production system, European industry, to remain competitive. In many countries, in many research centres and in many universities, the intellectual resources are ready, the capabilities are there and the will is there: it is now time to set things in motion. Everyone has to do it, as the Commissioner and the Council have said: the Member States, entrepreneurs and the private sector have to do it. I believe, however, that the vital task of putting this complex partnership together belongs to the European Union. Patrizia Toia,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the initiative that we are about to launch is very important for two reasons: the first is the subject of the research, which concerns the fight against neurodegenerative diseases, and the second is the joint programming methods for the research. Clearly, we would have preferred Parliament to have been more directly involved in the pilot project – this has been said and it is the subject of our question. While we must press on now and not bring matters to a halt, we are nonetheless asking for guarantees that our opinion will be taken into account in the Competitiveness Council’s deliberations, and that a more certain legal basis will be defined in future so that Parliament can be fully involved and there can be a greater sense of ownership in this field of research. We must now intervene with adequate means and resources to prevent and eradicate the widespread scourge of Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and the other diseases, which are destined to become more common as our population ages. We call for efforts to be focused on extensive, large-scale studies, aimed both at diagnosis and at identifying cures. Research into biomarkers, into early diagnosis methods based on a multidisciplinary approach, the compilation of vast databases, and the search for curative medicines and appropriate treatment and service models would appear crucial. I wish to make just one request in this House: that we ignore neither the individual circumstances of patients, which are too often excluded in the context of these types of disease, nor the involvement of patients’ and relatives’ associations. From a methodological point of view, we believe that joint research projects are very important because they fulfil an essential requirement: that of pooling efforts and resources and overcoming these divisions, these duplications, and therefore being able to create a critical mass that is sufficient to produce satisfactory results from this type of research. If we consider that, in other parts of the world, joint public and private efforts manage to invest tens of millions of euros, we realise how much there remains for us to do and how much we still have to do, by directing our efforts towards joint projects, towards strategic lines of action and joint programmes between the Member States and Europe and towards common programmes between public and private operators, without disregarding that international framework that puts us in contact with major scientific developments at international level.

 I voted in favour of the draft European Parliament legislative resolution on EU accession to the Protocol for the Protection of the Mediterranean Sea against pollution resulting from exploration and exploitation of the continental shelf and the seabed and its subsoil. The Protocol entered into force on 24 March 2011, following its ratification by six contracting parties (Albania, Tunisia, Morocco, Libya, Cyprus and Syria), and so far has neither been signed nor ratified by the Union. Given that, following the discovery of new reserves of fossil fuels in the Mediterranean, offshore activities are likely to increase, a potential accident could have immediate large-scale effects. For this reason I think that the EU’s ratification of the Offshore Protocol would constitute important leverage to ensure a good level of cooperation and the continued concrete commitment of all Mediterranean countries to the achievement of the maximum possible safety of offshore activities.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the legislative procedure began in November 2010 and has been a demanding task from a technical and political point of view, lasting a good two years and involving three Presidencies. It is therefore appropriate to thank all those who have been involved: the shadow rapporteurs, Parliament’s Secretariat and the political group secretariats and MEPs’ assistants – and, of course, the Commission and the Council. Agreement was reached at first reading, a fact that I consider highly significant. The objective of this regulation is to lay down harmonised rules on the manufacture of agricultural and forestry vehicles with a view to ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market and, in particular, the application of a large number of important criteria to improve operational, road and occupational safety for users, that is to say workers, and standards of environmental protection. In this context, the introduction in Articles 7 and 8 of new operational and occupational requirements may be considered a real success for the whole of the European Parliament, which has succeeded in covering risks which, at present, affect numerous operators, often with fatal consequences: one need only think of protection from electrical discharge or indeed from overturning. In addition, we must not underestimate the importance of worker health and safety, and so we have made provisions for the market surveillance of vehicles, systems and components, in order to ensure that all the provisions are implemented properly and carried out effectively. To sum up, the regulation helps to make industry more competitive, since it simplifies current legislation on the approval of vehicles, making it more transparent and reducing red tape. In fact, 24 base directives and around 25 related amending directives on technical requirements are being repealed and replaced by a single regulation. These aspects are important, because this regulation seeks to achieve other objectives, beyond helping to create a regulated internal market and to provide a framework enabling a competitive, balanced and transparent system. In addition, I believe we are also contributing to strengthening the sector, and in short we are putting in place the conditions for both widening the productive base and increasing employment. The work that has been done is therefore highly important and extremely useful: the compromises found between the political groups are the result of a major collaborative effort undertaken in the right spirit, with the desire to present Parliament with a consensus regulation.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the Vice-President for his contribution. I would not know where to put a tractor, so it is just as well that it is staying where it belongs. I do not think there is anything more to add: the debate has shown the degree of consensus surrounding the proposed regulation on agricultural and forestry vehicles. Now I hope that this consensus will be completely confirmed in the vote in the Chamber. This is what we have worked for, and so I really hope this result can be achieved.

 I voted in favour of the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2008/106/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the minimum level of training of seafarers. Training of a seafarers is an essential element of maritime safety and it is therefore of the utmost importance that crews trained in different countries in accordance with different systems have the necessary skills to carry out their onboard duties safely. The present proposal is aimed at bringing relevant EU legislation on training and certification of seafarers into line with current international standards, improving the wording of the legislative text for the sake of clarity. I therefore consider the proposal to be essential for avoiding conflict between international obligations and the EU obligations of the Member States. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 I voted for the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime. The new directive proposes to establish minimum standards on the rights, support, recognition and the widest protection within the territory of the EU of victims of crime, regardless of their legal status, whether in terms of content or implementation. Since confidence in justice is a priority for all citizens, especially for victims who feel their rights are unheard and out of reach, I think this proposal for a directive is an appropriate means of closing the many gaps and overcoming the many obstacles that currently exist in the single market and in the European area of freedom, security and justice.

 I am voting in favour of the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on administrative cooperation through the Internal Market Information System (‘the IMI Regulation’). The proposal aims to establish a set of common rules which will allow them to further exploit the IMI system’s full potential and encourage a smooth cross-border exchange of information between different authorities in the Member States, guaranteeing, at the same time, a higher level of protection than traditional communication channels. On these grounds, I believe the proposal for a regulation is an essential element to complete the single market and is clearly in the interest of citizens. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is increasingly being called upon to play an important role in the geopolitical changes that are affecting vast areas of the world. I believe that it is ever more urgent to raise the profile and quality of foreign policy, especially because many of these changes are taking place not far from Europe. To achieve this, we need to convince the Member States to invest in European common foreign policy, thereby reinforcing the choices made in the Treaty of Lisbon. Baroness Ashton, we need to move from the current activism – which cannot be denied and is manifest in the many trips you have made to every corner of the world – towards a more central role that will not only leave its mark, but will also adjust the existing equilibrium in favour of European foreign policy. It is to be hoped that it will be possible to dedicate a special session within Parliament to debate the foreign policy and the strategies to be put in place. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in reality, this debate is merely recording our powerlessness in the face of the tragedy that is unfolding in Syria, and I would like to know whether we are simply acknowledging this state of affairs or whether we intend to implement an appropriate, strong political initiative to try and restart diplomatic activity and adopt the necessary choices in the field, starting with the humanitarian corridor. Europe cannot be a passive bystander to the events taking place. Those who think that this situation should be prolonged must be aware that they are taking on a major political and moral responsibility. Is it true, Baroness Ashton, that you feel conditioned by the divisions and inconclusiveness of the Member State chancelleries? If so, this must be said. We need to call loudly upon all the European governments to support your work and your European action consistently, and I would like to hear this call clearly from yourself, Baroness Ashton, here today in the European Parliament.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the choice made by the Council on 7 June does not just concern European internal policy; as you can imagine, it also has an impact outside Europe. Everyone here has said that the free movement of people is one of the greatest European achievements in a Europe that is defined by it. However, restricting that free movement actually implies and portrays a feeling of mistrust that the Council is trying to distil among European countries and into European public opinion, which risks destroying the European project. For some time we have been calling for innovative and modern European governance on the migration issue. What you are doing, though, renationalises immigration policy. You are making rights and freedoms take a backward step, but these choices are likely to have a negative impact on another front, in that they reveal a certain schizophrenia in the action taken by Europe in its various policies. Together we have decided that one of the pillars of the new neighbourhood policy is mobility, a core element of the new European approach, for example towards a changing area such as the Mediterranean. What message are we sending out to these countries, apart from a message of distrust and lack of credibility? Pier Antonio Panzeri,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at long last we can say that the official announcement of the appointment of Mr Morsi, leader of the Justice and Freedom Party, has brought this first phase of the Egyptian political saga to a close; it was never a given, with two highly controversial judgments of the Constitutional Court sending out shockwaves in the days before the results were announced. The first judgment saw the supreme court declare the political isolation law under which Mr Shafiq was made ineligible to stand in the presidential elections as unconstitutional. The second judgment ruled that the electoral law used for the general elections was unconstitutional, thereby dissolving parliament, which could also have consequences for the constituent assembly. Just to complicate matters, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces also issued amendments to the constitution, severely weakening the president’s powers and abolishing autonomous legislative power until a new constitution has been approved. In his first speech as president, Mr Morsi sent what was, for us, a cheering message of unity and conciliation, as he sought to mollify the various sections of Egyptian society. In terms of foreign policy, he affirmed that he would make good on existing international obligations. Now we will have to see whether he is as good as his word. In any case, after a period of extreme uncertainty and instability, the election of a new president could finally open the way to a new phase that might, on the one hand, spur Egypt on to quickly consolidate democracy and rights and, on the other hand, enable efforts to be made to revive the economy and put an end to the ongoing financial crisis. We need, in this area, to make the role of the European Union clearer and more visible, including via the EU-Egypt task force. The EU must be ready to work with the new president to strengthen bilateral relations, to support and see through the transition to democracy, and to overcome the economic and financial problems that could jeopardise the country’s stability.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, it cannot be enough for political and institutional leaders to show their rightful indignation at the horrors unfolding in Syria, and I think you, Baroness Ashton, are aware of that. What is happening beyond our borders requires an appropriate response capacity, and frankly I do not think even the European Union as a whole has sufficient response capacity to meet the challenges facing us. How long must we stand and watch the massacre in Syria? We can understand all the current difficulties resulting from the fragile balance of power in the region; we can understand, yet not agree with, the positions of Russia and China, who will not allow the United Nations to take more incisive action; and we can also understand the mistrust in certain spheres in Europe towards the forces opposing Bashar al-Assad, not least because of their sources of funding. However, we cannot tolerate what is happening any longer. The European Union should go beyond its current activism and take a stronger lead. We have to disprove the idea that the Assad regime can do what it likes because the international community has shown itself to be impotent and that the European Union is too tied up in the economic and financial crisis to allow itself the luxury of intervening in the events in Syria. The decision to create a humanitarian corridor has not been put into practice. I think, though, we should make a fresh start on that and back up that decision with all the means at our disposal, bar none – and I stress, bar none – because that is a vital prerequisite for initiating the transition process and the transfer of power. We now need to turn our words into actions, and that is a task that is clearly yours to shoulder. Pier Antonio Panzeri,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Ms Lunacek has done a great job. I think that the process of consolidation of democracy in Kosovo is a very important factor. Our goal now is to encourage the government authorities in Priština and all the political forces represented in Parliament to persevere in the area of democratic reforms, reforms that are capable of modernising the country and opening a new phase in the political, civil, and economic life of Kosovo. There are still many shortcomings to address – earlier, the Council mentioned them – and they must be addressed with vigour and determination, and first and foremost they must be addressed by the Kosovo authorities with the consistency required. Admittedly, the situation is evolving. We can only welcome the historic agreement reached between Belgrade and Priština on inclusive regional cooperation and on the representation of Kosovo in regional forums. This may seriously promote stability throughout the Western Balkan region and is therefore of great importance for the European Union as well. It is in this context – as Commissioner Füle reminded us – that we welcome the fact that the Commission has initiated a feasibility study for a Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and Kosovo. We must now persevere on this path, because this path may not only bring peace and make the relationship between Serbia and Kosovo more profitable, and may bring these countries even closer to the EU, but also because it may help overcome the prejudices towards Kosovo on the part of those countries that have still not recognised the existence of Kosovo itself. There is thus a task that must be performed by Europe, but first and foremost a task that the Kosovar authorities must fully carry out in order to achieve these goals. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, there is one point on which Parliament has found a broad consensus over the last few weeks. This concerns the need to change the neighbourhood policy towards southern Mediterranean countries, particularly in view of the changes taking place which are producing significant improvements in the spread of democracy, and opening a whole new chapter in the EU’s approach to these countries. Now we need to be consistent and not oscillate between extremes when implementing this neighbourhood policy. It would be absurd and inexcusably incomplete if this policy merely called for more rights and democracy in these countries, and resolutely ignored everything else, starting with economic and trade issues. We have often stated that rights and democracy are established above all also through new economic and financial policies capable of stimulating growth in these countries. Democracy and social and economic growth are inextricably linked. The agreement with Morocco is part of this context. It aims at and must encourage mutual convenience in terms of free trade and the process of integrating the Mediterranean area. I am concerned about Mr Bové’s style of protectionism because, instead of helping the democratic process and rights in these countries, it in fact becomes an objective obstacle to them. For all these reasons it is important that Parliament should approve this agreement, and I hope that tomorrow this will happen. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, a huge effort has been made by the two rapporteurs to redefine European Neighbourhood Policy, which is necessary considering the great changes which are under way, particularly in the Mediterranean region, which is being affected by a new wind transforming a large number of its countries. The huge leap forwards which this new phase has brought about must be achieved with strength and determination, to build the conditions for our support for the transition processes taking place. However, we must be careful because the movements that have begun in these North African countries are not linear: there are and there may be increasing numbers of counter-trends and we cannot be sure or confident of how things will end. Nevertheless, we have to remain involved and not turn our backs on the situation. We should instead monitor these changes, paying closer attention and increasing our involvement. Of course, we should focus our attention on economic and financial issues, on the opening up of markets, on a process of regulated mobility, but now we also need to be more rigorous in demanding that the new laws uphold human rights, equality between men and women, and political and religious plurality. These should be the cornerstones of a new neighbourhood policy if it is to be effective and not run into the mistakes of the past. I hope that the good work carried out by Commissioner Füle continues in this direction. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, despite there still being some pockets of resistance by supporters of the old Libyan regime and even if, while Colonel Gaddafi is still around, the National Transitional Council still fears possible backlashes, it is right and proper to focus our attention on the post-war challenges. The European Union’s role in the process of reconstruction and stabilisation of Libya is extremely important. Aside from the immediate priorities of food, medicine, a plan for security, public order, border control and the highly sensitive issue of withdrawing arms, it is important to prepare for medium- to long-term action. This begins with the contribution necessary for the election process that will open up to institutional capacity building in the transitional phase, and to economic and social development. After the aggressive stage of the crisis which saw the European Union isolated, it is right to think that this is the time to strengthen Europe’s role with the right amount of determination. We do not just have a humanitarian duty, however important that may be, when thinking of the many migrants in Libya. We cannot fail to be present at the table that will redesign the geopolitical structure of the region, which now has another important protagonist in the shape of Turkey, as we are seeing at the moment with Prime Minister Erdogan’s triumphant visits to various Arab countries, just as we cannot delegate management of the post-war phase solely to the group of countries that took part in the NATO mission. There are already signs of competition on the Libyan stage between some Member States which is not subtle and will not have a beneficial outcome. In fact, in the race towards the new Libya it is not difficult to see economic and energy-related interests. The plans for building a democratic Libya are not so clear, and this is what requires hard work and dedication. This is where the importance of the role of the European Union comes in, not least because the road before us is not an easy or a short one, and above all we must bear in mind that a democratic outcome is by no means guaranteed.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow we will vote on an important and compelling resolution that shows Parliament’s will, despite many difficulties, to adopt a clear position on the events that are affecting countries such as Syria, Bahrain and Yemen, together with all the associated problems. It is true that what is happening in other countries, like Tunisia and Morocco, shows that the route to democracy is viable; it may follow a different path, but it is possible. This observation, however, does not dispel the public perception of the policies pursued by the international community and by Europe itself on these events involving the Mediterranean region. This perception questions the idea that foreign policy can apply double standards as it unfolds. In essence, we wonder why things are done one way in Libya and another way in Syria. Certainly, it is clear that different standards apply in foreign policy: from political realism, to the strategic nature of certain areas, to the reluctance of large countries to adopt more definite positions. In any case, this is a contradiction that continues to dog us and which we must be able to tackle. How? In two ways: there is a need for European policy to take more of a leading role, for greater consistency to give credibility to our presence throughout this area; there is a need to give political weight to the idea of a Euro-Mediterranean operating structure that can provide a genuine and lasting reference point for both the north and south sides and that can deal with existing problems. This work needs to be done immediately with the necessary effort and determination. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the turbulent events laden with uncertainties and hopes that are changing the political geography of the southern shores of the Mediterranean are increasingly posing a challenge to Europe and its external policy. In view of what is happening, it should be increasingly important for the European Union to be able to rely on a sound, consistent external policy capable of dealing with a difficult present and planning for a problematic future, in which international relations will be altered and the world will be profoundly changed. In view of the strategic repositioning of countries such as the United States, China and Russia, and growing shortages of raw materials and energy resources, Europe should develop a crucial, decisive role, but it is quite clearly showing itself to be unprepared for such challenges. For some time now, it has been moving too slowly towards coordination of the external and domestic policies of its Member States. There has been no substantial progress. Evidence of this is, on the one hand, the lacklustre action deriving from its external policy and, on the other, the obstinacy of certain countries that are nostalgic for a colonial period that can no longer return and insist on believing that they protect their interests better by doing things alone and not delegating anything to European authority. We need to turn over a new leaf. Baroness Ashton, you have an important role; please fulfil it to the utmost, in the knowledge that the time available is quickly running out. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the criticisms that we have heard here this morning in connection with the petition presented are understandable. I think there is still a long way to go before we can ensure that a possible general agreement on agricultural products with Morocco receives consensus approval. On the one hand, the agreement must respect the need for balance, and not cause serious difficulties for European agricultural producers. On the other, it must respect the need for clear and transparent rules of competition on agricultural markets. This is the path to follow in order to ensure that the relationship between the European Union and Morocco is a positive one. I therefore invite the Commission to look for suitable solutions that do not lose sight of the producers’ interests, but which also do not lose sight of a renewed policy of generosity towards Morocco, particularly in view of the events taking place in the Maghreb. It would be very useful to understand, and I do not want us to end up effectively importing tomato pickers, instead of agricultural products and tomatoes. It is therefore important to carry out a thorough investigation in order to create a new European policy. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, with this review of the EU’s neighbourhood policies, we are setting forth on a journey that will not end any time soon. The events in the Mediterranean signal a process of profound change and they will have lasting consequences, not only for the countries of the region, but also for Europe. We must be aware that the transition to full democracy will not be easy and that these transitions are accompanied by many risks and uncertainties. For this reason, there are numerous things we must do and these will take time. Europe’s response must be characterised by a strategy based on immediate and long-term actions. We must facilitate access to European markets and allow greater mobility. We should organise a conference to explore the possibility of cancelling or renegotiating the debt of these countries which have chosen the road to democracy; we must make adequate financial resources available and provide assistance to the democratic process by strengthening parliamentary institutions and political parties, ensuring the full participation of all citizens. This should all happen within the framework of a revitalised Euro-Mediterranean dialogue. At stake is the strategic, political future of Europe. I believe that Europe must understand that we have to work to the east and the south, but right now, there is a special priority to the south. These policies need fundamental change; we must finally open a new chapter. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, beyond the measures that have been announced, I wonder if European policy is doing enough. It naturally takes time for the European Union to establish leadership, especially in foreign policy, but as we know, certain situations arise and unfortunately do not allow us all the time we would like and actually call for fast action and far-sightedness. Now it is clear that we are still falling short of requirements as far as affairs in the Mediterranean region and particularly Libya are concerned: we need to reflect a little more to recognise that perhaps we will need stronger action to understand what has been happing and also to deploy concerted action towards the Mediterranean. It is in fact clear to everyone that if we look at Libya, there is a substantial difference between the whole of Europe taking joint action and action only being taken by willing countries, as is the case at present. No, my message to the representatives of the Council and Commission is that we are not there yet. The Council has not answered certain questions, and now must do so quickly. I wonder if beyond the humanitarian effort, we really know what to do if the application of Resolution 1973 is not enough and if some countries go beyond their mandate. Secondly, I would like to know the Council's view on the issue of operational command: NATO told us that it is performing a technical role, but not providing political guidance. Do we think we can get along like that, without seeking a stronger and more united European Union voice instead of fobbing the job off onto the few who are willing? Finally, within the framework of ongoing operations and the relationship with the Arab League and the African Union, it is essential to prevent our intervention from ultimately being seen negatively, with the risk of creating uncertainty and dangerous shifts. Are we aware? Perhaps not altogether: these are questions that do not deserve bureaucratic answers but need appropriate policy responses, starting with tomorrow's Council meeting.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the spirit of this debate enables me, Baroness Ashton, to remind you that the Union for the Mediterranean’s Parliamentary Assembly concluded its meeting last week in Rome. It set out several paths that the Commission would do well to return to, in particular, in terms of its suggestions on how to support the democratic transition processes in progress. Hence, I urge you and I urge the Commission to follow the developments in Tunisia intently. This country is objectively a driving force for democracy and is setting a benchmark for the entire region. Regarding Libya, we need to be fully aware that having decreed it part of the international community, the severance of relations with Mr Gaddafi’s regime will have consequences, particularly given that his regime is showing greater resistance than those of Mr Ben Alì and Mr Mubarak. This means that we must act on four fronts right now – and political timescales are decisive – with credibility, sincerity and consistency. We must come up with a suitable European financial plan. I understand the evocative note struck by many, but we need an Ashton Plan rather than a Marshall Plan. We also need a European immigration and asylum policy, a deterrent policy including the closure of airspace, and full support for the opponents of Mr Gaddafi’s regime. Baroness Ashton, it is up to you and your foreign policy ties with the Council to make these points count in the coming days, but also to avoid Europe’s foreign policy being caught unawares again by the events that are changing the Mediterranean.

Mr President, I voted for the motion for a resolution on the progress of Croatia’s accession to the European Union within the framework of the enlargement process, because I attach great importance to starting this process and to the progress made by Croatia. In essence, we hope that the enlargement will extend beyond Croatia and end up encompassing the whole of the Western Balkans. This is one of the key points of Europe’s neighbourhood and enlargement policies. My vote is therefore, without doubt, in favour of the Swoboda report. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the current flood of migrants is a serious problem, and it is a European one. What is needed is not complaints, however, but effective cooperation to tackle the current crisis in a constructive and far-sighted manner. We must take action at two levels, and we will need broad shoulders to bear our responsibilities. The first level concerns the immediate situation. Additional funds must be made available to deal with the crisis; we need at last to prepare a European round table, putting on the agenda the possibility of sharing out the immigrants fairly among the various countries; and, lastly, we have to meet with the provisional Tunisian Government to demand that resources and instruments be put in place to stem the current exodus. The second level is more strictly political in nature. It is absolutely vital to radically review our neighbourhood policies. Action is needed based on a renewed policy of economic, financial and social cooperation, an intelligent immigration policy, and effective support for the economic reforms and the democratic transition process under way in Tunisia. It is only by taking such action that we will be able to tackle and solve the problems now facing Italy and Europe. Commissioner, I am sure you will agree with us all that it really is time now to stop talking and start acting. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Baroness Ashton, I get the impression that you are not yet sufficiently aware of what is going on in the Mediterranean region. I have to say that the slowness of the EU institutions in addressing the Mediterranean question can only be explained by a lack of awareness of the situation and an inability to sense the changes that are afoot. We are coming to the end of a political and historical era in which Europe’s policy towards the South has been muddled and counterproductive. The economic crisis, difficulties faced in migrating and the lack of changeover among the ruling classes have created an explosive combination that is affecting Tunisia and Egypt now, but is likely to spread to other countries. To address some of my fellow Members also, I would say that we will not get away with thinking that all we need to do is to simply give our support to the demonstrations that are currently taking place. Europe needs to show greater political maturity. To do this, we need to retune Europe’s political antennae. Europe’s foreign policy needs to come out of its semi-secretive mode and take a leading role on the international stage in supporting the democratic transition processes currently underway. In particular, we need clear policies in a number of areas: a new partnership and neighbourhood policy, and a new security policy for the Mediterranean region; greater willingness from the whole of Europe to address the Mediterranean issue; and a policy of joint action so that Europe will be acting in the region alongside other players, such as the United States and Turkey. We need a major change of course and this calls for an act of considerable humility on the Commission’s part in reopening the debate on foreign policy towards the Mediterranean and taking a fresh look at the Union for the Mediterranean, whilst at the same time ensuring that Europe has a role within it. This is crucial for Europe, and we need to be fully aware of this. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, requests to debate this topic have been made several times, and commitments have been adopted each time to put the required initiatives into practice in the Sahel region, whether to stabilise the region or to ensure greater security. As we know, given the lack of borders and the huge size of the region, the Sahel is an ideal area of transit for drug traffickers and terrorist groups, specifically al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. The weakness and instability of the states in this region are the main problem and, as has been pointed out, the threats directly affect the peoples and countries in the region, particularly Mauritania, Mali and Niger. The main task the European Union has to address is to draw up a credible security strategy based on the various facets of possible European action: cooperation and development policy, regional programmes, coordination strategies for highway security, and security training policies. Hence, the European Union not just should, but must intervene as quickly as possible, and therefore we are looking forward to the Commission drawing up a complete strategy, as you announced, Baroness Ashton, as well as strong intervention on the ground. To conclude, my request is clear: we need to pay far greater attention to what is happening south of Europe, because many things are about to change and we had better not be caught unprepared. It could only do the EU good to be more far-sighted. Pier Antonio Panzeri,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the work done by Mrs Gomes in my view makes a serious contribution to what the Commission should do in defining the framework agreement. Libya undoubtedly plays a decisive role in the fight against terrorism, in peace and security in Africa, in the fight against illegal immigration in the Mediterranean, and in the energy sector. Our aim in the context of the European Union’s strategy must therefore be to consolidate Libya’s integration into an international political and economic system based on shared rules. To achieve that, a number of conditions need to be imposed on Libya, and that is what the recommendation is calling for. First of all, in the matter of immigration, Libya is clearly a transit country. This is an extremely important subject, but it cannot be seen simply in terms of security, stopping immigration and refoulement. The subject involves the need for a government ruled by the streams of economic and social policies equal to the challenge of migration, the issues of the recognition of political refugees and the ratification by Libya of the Geneva Convention and, lastly, the problem of the readmission of immigrants based on concrete guarantees to safeguard the immigrants’ living conditions. Then there is the question of launching economic and democratic reforms to make decidedly more room for democracy in this important country. We shall have to take this issue into ever greater account, as the events in neighbouring Tunisia are showing. Lastly, this recommendation calls for reflection on the issue of bilateral agreements. Such agreements can certainly make a valid contribution to defining and solving problems, but they are not the final answer. For example, the problem we have with Italian fishing boats shows that the bilateral agreement option does not address these problems. Now, however, the review of the partnership and neighbourhood policies also involves the call to rethink the Libya question in a new framework, which means including Parliament. Many of us have called for the Council’s mandate for the framework agreement to be made known. In this respect, Commissioner, there is a real need to break step and involve the European Parliament more and more in defining new policies for the countries to the south of Europe.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we share the concerns about what is happening in Tunisia and express our sadness about the many people who have lost their lives during the protests. The new and confused situation that began after the flight of former president, Mr Ben Ali, must now lead to the objective that many have asked for: the start of economic and social reforms to match the expectations of the vast majority of the population and the opening up of democratic forums, to ensure that civil society and the various opposition forces are increasingly involved in public life and in government. Obviously, all countries have the right to determine their own path, but we are keen for these reforms to be carried out and for the changes to be real and not merely window dressing. What is happening in Tunisia at the moment poses questions for all of us and poses questions for Europe, with all its delays and mistakes. In 1995, the European Union launched the partnership programme with the Mediterranean in Barcelona. This was supposed to include economic, political, military and even social and human cooperation, but not even in the two key objectives has this been achieved. In terms of the economy, there has been a drastic reduction in regional and infrastructural projects because the funds never arrived from Member States and those from the Commission remain in standby. The promised free trade zone does not exist, but the most obvious failure is on the political level, and we need to be fully aware of this, Commissioner. The Union for the Mediterranean was launched in 2008, but remains a façade. The summit that was supposed to be held in November 2010 has been postponed indefinitely. The problem is that the various European governments are not interested and do not see any interest in real cooperation. They prefer to maintain relationships with questionable regimes that are wedded to the defence of their undemocratically managed national resources, whilst millions of young people live without any future prospects but emigration, which is increasingly difficult. It is no great surprise then that, spurred on by the economic and social crisis, the protests in Tunisia have turned into a tidal wave capable of having a heavy impact on the existing power structure. European political realism is no longer useful as a result of the fear of Islamic fundamentalism, and perhaps the time has come to finally shelve that post-colonial attitude that tends to re-emerge every now and then in relations with north African countries. Indeed, taking Barcelona as a starting point, Europe needs a new vision of its southern reaches and the Mediterranean, which must be more credible than in the past. This implies a complete overhaul of the partnership and neighbourhood policies that have been followed thus far, and I would insist that you attend to this, Commissioner. We cannot hide the fact that both the Commission and the Council were even ready to start discussions with Tunisia for an advanced status agreement. On the basis of what criteria it was thought that all this was possible is still to be explained. We need to change tack – change gear – and we are telling the Commission and the Council that this can be achieved by showing more conviction in giving Parliament a role in the elaboration and application of a new idea of partnership with the countries of the Mediterranean. All of this is not solely in the interest of these countries but is, above all, in the interest of Europe. Many of the problems that Europe appears to have can only be tackled and resolved by a productive and virtuous relationship with all the Maghreb countries. Supporting economic and democratic reforms, as well as simultaneously deploying all the necessary antidotes to fundamentalism and terrorism, is a difficult road but is the only one to take. There is reason to hope that the tragic and bitter lesson being imparted by Tunisia can serve to give all of us a better understanding of what is worth doing and what is worth changing in terms of Europe’s actions.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to say to Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra that, ahead of resolving the conflict between Plato and the truth, perhaps we needed a little more time before coming up with this resolution, for at least two reasons. Firstly, we could have collected all the information to help guarantee that Parliament would take a more solid stance and, secondly, a series of meetings and hearings had got under way in the relevant committees Parliament took the legitimate decision to move ahead immediately, In any case, this does not diminish the requirement for these hearings and the need to keep the negotiations with Morocco open. I therefore believe that, after the vote, it is a good idea to apply our efforts in three specific directions: establishing a new leading role for Europe, with its diplomacy and neighbourhood policies; contributing to a positive outcome to the negotiations opened by the United Nations; and, finally, using all parliamentary instruments – beginning with the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the mixed committee – to ensure that the meeting goes ahead and helps find solutions. I think it would be helpful to work determinedly towards these specific objectives. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, someone might surely object to the reasons that have led the European Parliament to debate and pass judgment on a legislative act that a democratically elected parliament like the Israeli Knesset is adopting. Such objections are understandable, but there are at least two basic reasons why this debate is necessary. The first is the unique nature of the situation in the Middle East, resulting from a conflict that has lasted too long and does not only involve Israel. The second is the important role played by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in that area, both on the humanitarian aid side and in connection with development cooperation policies. Besides, the Israeli authorities themselves should assess that role carefully, because without the work done by all the NGOs, the tensions in the region would be greater and much more serious. For that reason, it will be perfectly natural to suggest to the Knesset, when it intends to legislate on this subject, that it should set out two clear objectives in addition to the changes already made: to ensure transparency for funding, applying without bias to everyone, including organisations like the settlers’ NGOs, for example; and to make it possible in practical terms for all the NGOs to work, since their work is important, not least for the future of the peace negotiations themselves.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I call for the words ‘all the people’ to be deleted when reference is essentially being made to the dialogue. Therefore, the final sentence should be: ‘considers that both parties should take a pragmatic approach to the dialogue for the benefit of Kosovo and Serbia’. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it has already been said that tomorrow, we will vote on the motion for a resolution on Kosovo drafted by Mrs Lunacek. Today’s discussion and tomorrow’s vote are very important and are a useful contribution to the process of stabilising Kosovo and the Western Balkans as a whole. If it is to honour the commitments it has made, Europe must work to ensure that three primary objectives are fully met in Kosovo: a stronger and more complete integration of the Albanian and Serbian communities, full implementation of the rule of law and the strengthening of Kosovo’s democratic institutions. Moreover, these are essential conditions if Kosovo is to move more decisively towards the European integration process. In this context, the European Union must be very demanding with itself and with the authorities in Kosovo, through its presence there, so that the democratisation process can move forward in the country and can embark on the road to European integration. We need to be aware that there are still many things to be done. The European Union must play an active role, which means also following the guidelines provided by the European Parliament. I therefore believe that this much hoped for process – and I do hope that this motion is adopted by the European Parliament and that all of the groups come together in some way – has a very important role, which I believe is negotiation, dialogue and opening an honest relationship between Serbia and Kosovo for two reasons: to stabilise the relationship between the two countries and to prepare the entire region in the best possible way for a European future; and we hope that this will happen in the not too distant future. We as Parliament and the European Union must assume this responsibility with the necessary determination. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, nothing can justify what happened and I am sorry to say that we are faced with an act of rank amateurism by the Israelis. Perhaps the Israeli leadership is not yet properly aware that Israeli security will be achieved only if the peace process goes ahead and not by raising the tension. Against this background, the resolution tabled to Parliament is an important response by this institution to the difficult question of Gaza. This affair, with all its dramatic overtones, nevertheless forces Europe to step up the quality of its dealings with the Middle Eastern question. Mrs Ashton, I think you are aware that today, we need new leadership within Europe; stronger action with the aim of setting the indirect negotiations on the right path. Stop this senseless settlement policy and lift the blockade on Gaza. By adopting this resolution, the European Parliament offers an important benchmark. Make use of it so that European action can make a serious contribution to overcoming the conflict and winning over all extremist positions, while also achieving the goals of the two states.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we are taking an extremely significant step forwards by adopting this report, and it will be very useful with a view to the Barcelona Summit of 7 June, a summit which, as we know, is set to be difficult given the deadlock in negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians, and also owing to various uncertainties and difficulties regarding the definition of the administrative set-up of the new secretariat structure. Faced with these problems, the Peillon report has been drafted in the only way possible, highlighting, on the one hand, that the conflicts must not hinder tangible progress towards multilateral cooperation in specific sectors, while acknowledging, on the other, that the Union for the Mediterranean will not be fully successful unless these conflicts are settled. Therefore, the real challenge now involves a clear, robust political commitment which must come out of the Barcelona Summit, finally enabling the structures of the new institution to function and commit to providing the funds necessary for the major projects that are its main objective. Europe must realise that it needs to turn its political and economic efforts and its own interests southwards, because it is here that it can find the solutions to many of the problems currently plaguing it.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are aware of the differences that exist between the various regulatory frameworks of the individual countries, and we also know that various interpretations of European and national case law are currently leading to a large number of infringements and disputes within the Member States. The lack of a European Union policy is no longer sustainable in the light of the challenges posed by the cross-border nature of online gambling services. Moreover, the rapid spread of the Internet and of electronic trade in recent years has given rise to an increase in the supply of online games and to the consequent emergence of cross-border issues, which remain unresolved. For this reason, I am convinced that the European institutions should rise to the common challenges, such as the protection of consumers – and more specifically of children – and the prevention of crime and fraud, but also to the challenges concerning the fight against the illegal and unauthorised supply of services, which the national governments alone cannot cope with. The Commission must therefore respond to Parliament’s requests and strive to obtain a European regulatory framework. It must do so by showing the necessary determination. Commissioner, your good will is not in question, and that is why I say to you that the consultation is a good idea and that the green paper is also a good idea, provided that it is used to identify the correct legislative framework and is not just an end in itself. The old Commission very often drafted too many green papers and white papers without any decisions being taken. However, I believe that you realise, Commissioner, that we need decisions and not just words. Pier Antonio Panzeri,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we had to give an opinion on the existing relations between the European Union and Tunisia, it could only be a positive one, including as regards the stabilisation of the region. It is true that important progress has been made in economic terms, and there are also encouraging signs from a social point of view. However, in political terms, following the presidential elections on 25 October, we are faced with the problem of supporting the journey towards democratic reforms with greater concrete action. As we know, the European Union’s objective, in pursuing its foreign policy, is to develop and consolidate democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Tunisia has made some important commitments in the context of the Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan on democracy, governance and human rights. The action plan lays down a series of priorities and, amongst these, particular attention must be paid to implementing and consolidating reforms, and to strengthening political dialogue and cooperation, particularly in relation to democracy and human rights, foreign policy and security. It is within this framework that the institutions must be strengthened. The latter allow the increased participation in political life of the various members of Tunisian society, greater development of the role of civil society, continued support for political parties to broaden their participation in the democratic process, and greater respect for freedom of association, freedom of expression and media pluralism. We are convinced that these objectives can be achieved, and it is reasonable to expect tangible progress to be made. Our commitment is to safeguard the friendship which binds the European Union and Tunisia while consolidating the existing relationship, including in view of the conflict which could arise concerning the idea of an advanced status for that country. However, concrete steps really must be taken by Tunisia itself. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I consider the resolution that we are discussing today in Parliament to be genuinely positive. To dwell on part of this, I consider that the topic of European enlargement to the western Balkans is, and must remain, one of the linchpins of European action in the coming months. I would like to compliment the Swedish Presidency and, above all, Commissioner Rehn on their work. We must nevertheless feel more involved in the process of enlargement. Some countries must undoubtedly step up their action on the legal front in terms of the fight against crime and reforms. Yet we must not lose sight of the political aim, which is to consolidate democracy in those countries and have them follow the European path in economic, social and infrastructural terms. I am thinking, for example, of countries such as Kosovo – and in this regard I agree with the amendment tabled by Mrs Lunacek with regard to the Roma issue – because this is a country we cannot sideline merely because five European countries have not yet recognised its independence. To sum up, we need the right amount of courage and a far-sighted policy that is up to the challenge that the process of enlargement sets all of us. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, believe that this cooperation agreement with Tajikistan really is very positive and can help to achieve what I believe are some important and precise objectives. The first objective concerns the strategic position of that country, which can genuinely be of use in promoting an area of peace, security and stability. The second objective, I believe, is and must be to encourage the growth of that country from an economic and social point of view, because we know that it is one of the poorest countries in the region. Lastly, we must ensure that freedom, democracy and rights are the fundamental elements that govern the application of this agreement. Leaving aside any limitations that may be found, I believe we should welcome the report on which we are voting in this House. Pier Antonio Panzeri (S&amp;D).

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when debating foreign policy issues, such as today’s issue involving Iran, there is always the risk, as we know, of lagging slightly behind the events taking place. However, there is no doubt that the European Parliament, if it wants to, can play an important role in urging Europe and the international community to take the current events seriously and to implement all of the initiatives needed to ensure that the process of introducing a democratic system in Iran can actually take place. Following the close attention paid by the international public to the post-election period in Iran and the street demonstrations that the Iranian regime sought to repress with the use of violence, it is important to ensure that silence does not descend on the situation in the country. Being realistic about things does not mean taking the Iran issue off the agenda. It is also up to us to keep this level of attention high, and it is also up to the Swedish Presidency – which I thank for the points it has made today – to promote a strong initiative, together with the United States, Russia and other countries, in order to change the way in which issues in Iran, from democratic rights to the nuclear issue itself, develop.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry that I do not agree with your optimism; based on what I know, I would call it Rio -20, because we have gone back about 20 years. No binding document, no definition of the future we want, but of course, without Mr Obama, Mr Cameron and Ms Merkel – who alone represent more than 30% of the entire gross domestic product and who were, in fact, in Mexico at the G20 summit – what could have been decided? Only safe ideas for those who want business as usual, such as the green economy, masterfully represented as one of the instruments available in order to achieve sustainable growth, and for the adoption of policies, which should not, however, be subject to rigid rules. The divisions, inconsistencies and injustices will therefore remain and the separation of economic, social and environmental spheres will continue to cause disasters. Yes to recognising climate change, reducing natural disasters, energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions, and yet nothing concrete – as if to say, the house is burning and we are not doing anything to put out the fire. Other evident sticking points: that the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) did not become a real environment body and that no High Commissioner was appointed for future generations. What can we do now? Only be aware that interdependence can help us cope with the crisis we are experiencing and therefore that a new governance is absolutely necessary in order to move forward. The Commission could set an example: get the financial institutions responsible for a large part of this crisis around a table and ask them to commit to a plan of growth, inclusion, fairness and development, which respects and protects the environment and people. For its part, Parliament can come up with a universal statement of interdependence and democracy, which also guarantees right of access to natural resources and then ask the biggest States in the world to join in. For once, it would not be up to the young people or banks or large corporations, but the democratically elected representatives to decide the future we want. Vittorio Prodi  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, I have been defending the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) programme since I arrived in Parliament and I now feel the need – after letters, oral and written questions, resolutions, meetings, debates, hearings and newspaper articles – to remind those who seem to have forgotten what the benefits of this programme are, as listed in a publication written, among others, by the NEREUS Network of European Regions Using Space Technologies. Here are just some of the areas that the EU will put at risk without GMES: air quality, monitoring of climate change adaptation, EU water policy, the INSPIRE programme for geospatial information, civil protection and emergency services, agriculture and forests, services to the marine environment, monitoring of illegal activities, energy management and urban mapping. To these I would like to add the support, in particular to African countries, for all the technology currently needed to manage the environment. Given this non-exhaustive list of the merits of GMES, could Commissioner Barnier – who I am sure is an advocate of the benefits of GMES – explain who it is that does not wish for the GMES programme to operate as it has done so far, and why? Why is the Commission hiding behind Council decisions, when we have evidence that at least eight major countries have asked to put GMES back into the multiannual financial framework? Who is insisting (and why?) on adopting an intergovernmental approach with an agreement that would make Parliament’s control of one of the most important space programmes much more difficult, rather than facilitating it as required by the Treaty of Lisbon? Let it be known that we are friends of GMES: the Commission seems to agree, and claims simply to be following the orders of the Council, the Council itself substantially agrees, and the regions are clamouring for GMES to be fully implemented. It must also be noted that, at this time of crisis, GMES is one of the few sectors where jobs are not being slashed and in which European companies can still boast a competitive edge. Parliament has repeatedly expressed its full support for GMES. Commissioner Barnier, please tell those in the Commission and its services who are against GMES that it is time to stop. We have to work for Europe and for its young people, so as to make their future less hopeless. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Vittorio Prodi  (S&amp;D

Mr President, it is clear that this is possible and is also one of the types of data that Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) can consistently deliver.

 Mr President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, these are truly European items of infrastructure that are vital for implementing European policies. Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) is specifically for security, the environment and the management of mitigation policies, of global warming and the review of extreme meteorological events. It must be included in the European Union’s multiannual budget. If that is not possible, this may be the time to make use of project bonds, which also have an anti-recession function. I am convinced that this is an investment in our future and that it will pay dividends in a very few years’ time. Commissioner, let us go forward along this path. Vittorio Prodi,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution on the Rio+20 summit highlights the crucial principle of fairness. Fairness on an international scale that guarantees developing countries their right to development; intergenerational fairness that does not make those who come after us pay the price for our decisions; fairness that thus develops into genuine solidarity and a vehicle for a new kind of sustainable development. We must reject the old concept of the three independent pillars – economic, social and environmental – and instead recognise the interdependent nature of these elements, because they are indivisible. Determining the conditions for genuinely sustainable development requires us not only to develop new standards, such as the Beyond GDP project, but also to guarantee the active involvement of all parties at all levels of governance. It is precisely by focusing on the indivisible nature of fairness, solidarity and global governance that we can break out from behind the barrier of false freedoms and return to social models based on the individual and the common good. Rio+20 is therefore an appeal for a noble ethics and it is in such a context that both the financial and the technological proposals made by the European Parliament gain value. These span the tax on international financial transactions, support for environmental conservation projects, a broader horizon of comprehensive fiscal reform replacing taxes on labour by taxes on resource use and assessment of the impact that production of biofuels can have on food supply and biodiversity, with the focus on global assessment of impact of technology on the environment and society. Our proposals are intended to prepare the ground for an international conference that would mark a true political turning point in planning the development of our planet. Vittorio Prodi  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, overall the report by Mrs Andrikienė report is an excellent report, which the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists &amp; Democrats in the European Parliament have worked hard on to provide ideas of the utmost value. Human rights have constituted one of the fundamental pillars of the European Union since its creation and respect for them is an essential point that the European Parliament must encourage every day. Wider acceptance of human and fundamental rights, globalisation and changes in our society require a new and different outlook that does not fit any of our existing canons. It therefore becomes essential to guarantee equal access to natural resources, as one of the fundamental rights of each individual. In the coming years, climate change will lead to an enormous number of refugees fleeing the poorest areas of the Earth and it is our duty to begin to take note of these potential migratory flows so that we can establish appropriate policies that will enable respect for the dignity of these people to be guaranteed. The expression ‘climate refugee’ has not yet entered the vocabulary of current international law. Naturally, we remain committed to the fight against desertification, just as we do to adjusting to climate change. These are the topics I have attempted to add to the text of the report, so that a serious debate can be opened on the issues. Vittorio Prodi  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to the Commissioner and to the entire EU delegation, who have helped to keep the process alive. However, we have not solved the real problems: firstly, we need to give political expression to the Bali Declaration – in particular, with regard to what we in Parliament have already called climate justice – and we need to generalise and simplify the emissions trading system, because it is inconceivable to have a market mechanism where half of the emissions quota is given away free. Secondly, I would like to stress the need to promote instruments for monitoring, reporting and verifying, in particular, those of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) range of services, of the satellites that will provide absolutely vital data in this area.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Vice-President Ashton, the defenders of human rights play a crucial role throughout the world, often putting their lives on the line. Respect for human rights is one of the basic values of the European Union and has always underpinned its construction. This is why it is now important to keep focusing attention on compliance with these rights as a whole. The work done in Parliament on this subject is crucial in ensuring this and I therefore thank the rapporteur Mrs Hautala for her excellent report to which the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament made a crucial and constructive contribution. We must, in fact, seek to look beyond. I believe the time has come to take clear responsibility, in other words, to begin to treat respect for human rights as a complex phenomenon; we must now seek to achieve a higher and more comprehensive acceptance of these rights. I am firmly convinced, Mr President, that fundamental rights should include the right of equal access to natural resources, to water and also to food, the right to health care, the right to education and the right of access to information. With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, I also feel we are bound to make the most of the new External Action Service by making sure it encompasses organisations and figures distinguished by their respect for human rights. This morning, in fact, Mrs Ashton mentioned the Russian Federation and our dealings with the Federation in this context. Such challenges, which we face a daily basis, are often underestimated. The European Union can and must continue to play a leading role on the international stage in taking up such challenges. Vittorio Prodi,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, climate change is a real threat that we must be ready to face despite the varying impact it will have on our countries. The degradation of ecosystems will cause a severe blow to the health of our economies and of European citizens. We have already in the past called for climate diplomacy and justice: now we have to build it, speaking with a single voice. I am convinced that the European Union must maintain the lead in the battle against climate change and that any delay in implementing that action will increase environmental, social and economic costs out of all proportion. We must first of all recognise the central role of local and regional authorities and the need to work with them to coordinate environmental and economic innovation facilitated by technological progress. By adopting the White Paper, we call on the Commission and Member States to promote public-private partnerships to help finance all of the initiatives tied to the adaptation policies. Each square metre of our territory has to be cared for to preserve the soil and retain water so as to prevent erosion and to supply the aquifers, including through direct reinjection of surface waters. In order for adaptation to be possible, a systemic approach which includes renewable energies will be necessary. I would like to warmly thank all of my colleagues who contributed to the success of this report. (Applause

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the 13th session of the UN Human Rights Council is an extremely important occasion. I would simply like to mention one or two cases that are not addressed very often. Specifically on the subject of prisons, but not those for terrorists, I would like to point out the truly inhumane conditions of the prisons in Rwanda and in Libya, where totally innocent people held in detention are sentenced to death. Furthermore, I would like to mention the issue of the Sahrawi people, which has remained unresolved for so long now, and I would also like to mention the rights of climate refugees who are driven from their countries by dramatic forms of climate change.

Madam President, Mr Carlgren, Mr Dimas, ladies and gentlemen, this morning I would like to talk about an 84-year-old missionary, Father Ettore Turrini, who has spent 59 years in the north-west of the Amazon. He has always fought to protect the indigenous people and their forest from anyone seeking to destroy them in the name of short-term interests. In travelling round the forest, Father Ettore has had seven air accidents, but he has carried on and has obtained tens of thousands of signatures through his activities, which he will submit to President Lula, to many ministers and to the Italian President, Mr Napolitano. He has been indefatigable. We met last Sunday and I told him that I fully shared his position, but that perhaps the world is coming to its senses and reaching the conclusion that these forests are essential as the world’s lung, for the local climate and also for carbon capture and storage. I told him that in Copenhagen, we will also find resources to compensate those countries that keep the forests intact. I told him that we are setting up monitoring instruments – GPS and INSPIRE – to measure how governments behave and that by 2030, we will put a stop to deforestation. In Copenhagen, we will be able to do all this and I will participate in the summit on behalf of Father Turrini as well.Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 As it stands, the management of intergovernmental agreements between individual Member States and third countries is more complex than ever before. Not only do we not know their exact number, but since there is no obligation to inform the Commission and the other Member States, we find ourselves faced with agreements that contradict or are incompatible with EU legislation on the energy market. Consequently, a set of regulations that brings about a clear break with the past seems equally urgent. Hence, legislation should require final agreements to be notified to the Commission and made subject to its approval. Moreover, it would be a good idea if the Commission were to be granted an ex ante
 compliance check, thus avoiding any time and resources being wasted. Unfortunately, however, this approach – which is the only option that is really compatible with the very idea of the EU – is once again being steamrollered by the interests of the Member States and their desire to act freely in delicate areas like the energy sector. It is nevertheless regrettable to note that the moderate and conservative forces of this House have also taken the same position, while they should always seek to ensure that EU interests take precedence.

 The quality package proposed by the Commission aims to establish a coherent legal framework for the EU’s policy on agricultural product quality. The proposal is, overall, worthy of support, thanks especially to the changes and amendments made by this House. Specifically, it is of the utmost importance to recognise the role, importance and responsibilities of producer groups, which can and must play a crucial role in product protection and marketing according to the established standards, thereby limiting the risks of abuse or, even worse, counterfeiting, as far as possible. I feel compelled, in particular, to highlight the changes made regarding the traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) scheme. In this case, the Commission’s proposal seemed incongruous and detrimental, especially the idea to abolish TSGs without reservation of the name, forcing associations to repeat the whole bureaucratic process to get new recognition. Thanks to Parliament, good sense prevailed instead. We believe that the introduction of a simplified procedure for TSGs registered without reservation of the name can ensure their survival and, above all, extend safeguards and reduce counterfeiting, benefiting producers and consumers alike.

 The management of highly migratory fish stocks calls for the constant cooperation and direct consultation among the countries whose fleets exploit such stocks, avoiding the risk of unilateral action that could be potentially harmful to long-term resource sustainability. Moreover, the EU has the responsibility to ensure that this cooperation requirement is respected and that Member States do not take unilateral action in disregard of the general interest in the conservation of the marine ecosystem. However, beside effective measures, in order to fulfil this task it is necessary to endow the EU with appropriate monitoring tools. As with other sectors, unbridled competition among the Member States may have adverse consequences. I have thus chosen to support the measures in the directive, in particular those designed to impose quantitative restrictions on EU fish imports, in cases where the fish is caught from stocks of common interest under the supervision of a third country. Similarly, I welcome the introduction of tools that can ensure that such measures are effective, proportionate and compatible with international legislation, as well as meeting environmental, commercial, economic and social standards.

 The report is one of the cornerstones of the reform of the common fisheries policy in that it increases the sector’s competitiveness, particularly for producers. It also includes aspects of prime importance for the health and confidence of consumers in the sector. In this respect, safeguarding the interests of consumers and satisfying their demands for clarity and transparency should be the goal of our common policies, because they can become a way of encouraging people to spend. This is all the more important during a slump in sales, when all the indicators show that people tend to purchase goods in a more conscious and informed way, which means they look for quality. That is why we are firmly convinced that the product packaging should show not the date when the fish were landed but the date on which they were actually caught. The landing date, however, which is supported by the moderates and conservatives, is not only misleading for the consumer but also unduly favours large fleets that are able to stay at sea for several days over smaller vessels that can only stay at sea for a few hours. Once again, we would have expected a more rational attitude from the moderates, who seem to have given in to the interests of the larger groups. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 Negotiations on energy efficiency measures are proving increasingly difficult and complex, particularly because of some large Member States which are not always fully prepared to support ambitious agreements and perspectives which, in the short term, may give rise to costs and negative effects on their competitiveness. In this case too, despite some improvements, we are faced with a directive which, although it contributes to achieving the 20% energy efficiency target by 2020, will not be sufficient in itself (a result between 15 and 17% is estimated). In our view, there will thus have to be an increased commitment to ensuring that long-term perspectives and requirements find a way to establish themselves in the face of the selfish interests which, in the short-term, can have a strong influence on Member States’ governments and, in particular, at a time of acute economic crisis. A structural and lasting solution to this crisis must instead be sought in measures that address and solve the roots of the serious issue of energy poverty. We need to think afresh about the way out of this situation. It is not possible to return to the production and consumption models that preceded the crisis and therefore we need to be ambitious and courageous in order to create new opportunities and new jobs.

 I chose to defend and strongly support Mr Färm’s report because – in addition to its content as a whole – I would argue that it represents an extraordinary turning point both in the relationship between institutions and for the future of EU economic policy. For the first time, the European institutions have paved the way for testing project bonds, or rather for one of the instruments for which Parliament has often expressed its support. While noting that unfortunately, the conditions needed to actually start implementing European bonds in a fuller and more forceful way still do not seem to be in place, today’s report opens up the possibility of testing the will of other European institutions to following the declarations. Implementing connecting trans-European infrastructure is of key importance strategically and therefore lends itself extremely well to testing the issuance of bonds intended to finance infrastructure projects. I fully support this report, and I hope that other European institutions agree that we need to find new ways to finance strategic investments in order to relaunch the European economy.

 The entire Mediterranean basin shares the same natural environment, and its shores are connected by the same history and culture. Significant opportunities exist in southern Europe, which cannot be seized without coordination or vision. The ‘Mediterranean climate’ results in similar ecotypes: the same types of agricultural product are produced and form a single, albeit diverse, range of products. Likewise, environmental problems are the same all over. Mediterranean biodiversity is particularly abundant, but also under serious threat. Appropriate, synergistic responses are called for. Within the EU, the Mediterranean area is unstructured and its performance in terms of cooperation and interconnection is very poor. Moreover, outside the gates of the EU, those populations living in the Mediterranean region have very low standards of living, despite last year’s events. The development of these societies is an essential requirement for them, and an opportunity for Europe as it could capitalise on greater security, more ‘sustainable’ control of immigration flows and direct participation in this growth area. This would positively impact on the performance of its own economy. For these and many other reasons, it is important to support the establishment of a Mediterranean macro-region.

The adoption of this regulation sends a clear signal of support for the safety of the millions of European workers and citizens who travel every day on Europe’s roads. Thanks to Parliament’s hard work, significant amendments have been made to meet the demands voiced on many occasions by trade unions, workers and many small enterprises: the introduction of tachographs for all heavy goods vehicles weighing in excess of 2.8 tonnes and the introduction of weight sensors are two clear examples of the good work done during recent months within the committee and then in the Chamber. Too often, the needs of the market and strong competition between operators adversely affect working and health conditions for lorry drivers, and also seriously jeopardise the safety of the millions of European citizens on the EU’s roads and motorways. The balance that has been achieved in this regulation between the needs for security and control and the flexibility to be given to self-employed workers and small enterprises is an excellent outcome, and has therefore been broadly supported by the majority of MEPs.

 It is evident that it will be difficult to achieve the Europe 2020 goals on employment rates, and yet, in the serious crisis we are going through, the strong and effective effort needed to reverse this trend is missing from national reform programmes. Commitment to younger generations has shown no sign of a turnaround, and yet in the discussion on future cohesion policy the Union has the opportunity to specify and introduce performance mechanisms into the regulations being examined by Parliament so that every euro spent under the new multiannual financial framework (MFF) is aimed at creating new, good-quality youth employment. A European investment strategy should be launched, centred on infrastructure modernisation, human capital and laying the foundations for a sustainable economy. To finance this initiative, the Union must add additional resources to its budget: these exist and mechanisms must be found to make them available. It is therefore necessary to introduce a tax on financial transactions, to set up an EU-wide strategy to reduce fraud and tax evasion and to allow Eurobonds to be issued. Without these tools, the risk of an irreversible decline and marginalisation of Europe’s economy and policy on the world stage will become more and more real. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 I decided to vote against the report by Mr Gauzès because, once again and for the umpteenth time, it employs a rationale that I did not and do not think is valid and that, as time has gone on, has played a crucial part in the worsening of Europe’s economic and social situation. I have fought and I contest the theory that the underlying cause of the crisis is to be found in the high number of countries that have been unable to put their budgets in order. On the contrary, the facts demonstrate that this is a crisis of growth and of a lack of investment. Confronted with this reality, the recipe put to us once again is mistaken and will once again prove to be counterproductive. In the past, we have fought hard against this outlook, opposing and voting against the ‘six-pack’. Since then, faced with a deterioration in the economic and, above all, social situation, rather than championing a change of direction and a radical change of gear, we have been going backwards, casting out the economic analyses which, in reality and in contrast to those from the right which have put us in this situation, we know to be right and potentially capable of putting a stop to what is becoming an irresistibly slippery slope.

 I decided, albeit reluctantly, to vote against the report because I think it is totally insufficient and inadequate for dealing with the pressing and mounting problems that this social and economic crisis has forced upon us. I decided to vote against because I think the growth measures that the report introduces are completely insufficient. Without even considering that the golden rule, albeit in a minimalist and even innocuous form, was rejected, the other growth measures also do not seem much compared with the straitjacket of austerity and the blind respect of budgetary restraints. The redemption fund, the groundwork for eurobonds and Heading 3 have been approved by a very narrow majority, due to the staunch opposition of conservatives, who, having obtained approval for austerity measures, have done everything to boycott all references to investment. That says a lot about what the Council’s attitude will be. We must find the courage to relaunch our ideas and initiatives with fresh vigour. If not, we will be complicit in the vacuity of the conservatives and their inability to improve Europe’s future prospects. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

Madam President, that the situation is dramatic is there for all to see. Add to this drama the fact that there is a clear gap between what we say, denounce and debate in this House and in the other European institutions and what we tangibly do for the younger generations in Europe. It is this gap that we have to close; this is the effort we have to make. In this regard, I propose two questions and two corresponding suggestions. The first is this. Can we bring in a constraint, even a legally binding one, such that in the coming years or months, every euro spent must be on policies for youth employment, thus creating the conditions for a true European platform/plan for youth employment? Let us not forget that the resources at our disposal are very limited. The second is that in the coming weeks, project bonds worth EUR 230 million are due to be issued. Can we give priority to projects which are able to increase youth employment in the short term? Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 The report proposes to help the Member States most affected by the financial crisis and unable to guarantee the necessary private funding for completing revenue-generating infrastructures. Private partners are not in a position to invest due to liquidity problems and the difficulties in accessing loans, so part of individual Member States’ financial allocations to the Commission is to be transferred in order to create a fund to cover the risks linked to the loans. This means that, in order to allow the completion of ongoing works, some Member States will in fact deprive themselves of part of their allocated funds. As far as we are concerned, while we support the instrument, we should have preferred intervention of a more structural nature for dealing with the endemic lack of liquidity in many Member States, in order to improve expenditure performance and avoid having to resort to drastic measures that could reduce resources. In this regard we are convinced that these difficulties could be overcome by introducing a derogation from the Stability and Growth Pact, in order to allow the national cofinancing of projects considered particularly important for economic recovery and job creation.

 The resolution retraces the link between effective measures to stimulate growth and defining a clear and united EU strategy for halving tax evasion by 2020. Lost revenues caused by the underground economy has pernicious effects on the European economy and a negative impact on the amounts invested in growth and employment. By recovering these lost revenues (20% of public spending and some 105.8% of total health spending), governments could wipe out their public debt in eight or nine years. At the same time, they would be able to increase public investment, helping towards the achievement of the goals of the EU 2020 strategy. We therefore welcome EU-wide initiatives and strategies that will cut back bilateral agreements and bring an end to banking secrecy, accelerating the exchange of information. Combating tax evasion must become an absolute priority for the EU. So far, much has been said but little has been done; now is the time to take incisive action. Paying taxes is a basic civic duty and a matter of social justice that can generate the funds required for leaving the crisis behind and reviving the real economy, without once again heaping further burdens on workers and the most vulnerable sections of society.

 The updating of Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 and Regulation (EC) No 987/2009, which we are approving at first reading today, thanks to the agreement already reached with the Danish Presidency – needed to reflect the changes in the legislation of Member States on social security and coordination of social security systems – is a text that is widely supported by this House as it has succeeded in accommodating the positive needs of the sector trade unions.

 The report deserves to be supported, especially because it underlines the fact that cohesion policy – by its very nature – has to take into account the specific characteristics of regions and of outermost regions, but, more generally, that it has to take into account all specific features. The very existence of funding for the ‘cohesion’ of regions with different levels of development in fact presupposes the need to operate in situations that are structurally diverse, in terms of their geographic features or socio-economic gap. To deny this basic fact would be to deny the very aims of cohesion policy, and the report also needs to represent a reminder when the regulations for the future 2014-2020 cohesion policy are being defined. Alongside the need to focus efforts on objectives that are considered to be fundamental, it is important to remember that, in order to achieve these very objectives, the different starting conditions of the areas in which the instruments are actually operating have to be borne in mind. If this is not done, efforts could be not only in vain, but even counter-productive. In addition, the report is also an opportunity to reiterate that future funding must absolutely not be less than at present. We can only get through the crisis by revitalising investment and, even more so in disadvantaged areas, the EU institutions have a duty to prepare the ground in order to make this possible.

 The necessity for the international economy to orient itself increasingly towards a system of production based on the reduction of carbon emissions is one that is being imposed on us by the ever more imminent risk of irreparable climate change, as well as by the need to move our system of production gradually away from the consumption of finite resources. Given all that, the obstinacy with which the forces of the right have wanted to put forward the nuclear option again seems simply incomprehensible, and in many ways also outside time and history. It is outside time and history, as are all recommendations on the safety of nuclear power stations, which have several times been served up to us and promptly been refuted by the facts. It is still more unthinkable in a country such as Italy, where almost 30 years after power stations were decommissioned, we still have waste heaps that have not been disposed of and where, not long ago, a new referendum firmly rejected the reintroduction of nuclear power. We therefore demand that a correct objective, the reduction of emissions and the transition to an economy based on renewable sources, should not become the pretext for allowing a means that has proved to be unsafe and dangerous, and one which Europeans have for this reason chosen to replace, creep in again by the back door.

 Since it marks only the first step in the long and tortuous route to the adoption of the 2013 EU Budget, the adoption of the ‘general guidelines’ has to be the occasion for strongly emphasising the role of Parliament in future negotiations, especially with the Council, with the powerful aim of influencing the guidelines to be adopted by the Commission in its draft budget. It must be clear here and now that the budget approach cannot avoid the urgency of restarting sustainable growth and quality employment, in line with the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. The European Commission and the Council cannot continue down the path of austerity that leaves no margin for the requirements of economic growth capable of generating new jobs. We have the duty to identify measures supportive of growth and employment and finally go beyond the mere requirement of balancing investment and austerity. For our part, moreover, there is a pressing need to draw attention to the worrying payment situation: we must not allow a repetition of what happened in 2011 and 2012, and the Council can no longer purport to decide a priori
 the level of payments based on political considerations, without taking into account the repercussions on past commitments. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 The vote on this own-initiative report gives us the chance to emphasise the need to plan and open a Commission initiative to re-launch the Statute for a European cooperative society as soon as possible. We have to see the adoption of this report as an incentive to take action in the shortest possible timeframe and not fail to grasp the important opportunity provided by the UN having declared 2012 to be the International Year of Cooperatives. The fact that only 17 cooperatives out of around 160 000 in Europe have signed up to the Statute shows the urgency of intervening to make the Statute more attractive, though without losing sight of its most important and positive aspects. The value of cooperatives in the European economy is common knowledge and, during our debate, it became clear just why cooperatives have managed to withstand the economic crisis better than other business types. It is therefore our duty to support them and to work vigorously and consistently to promote the European cooperative society as a positive framework for the development of European cooperatives.

 It is universally accepted that, during this prolonged economic crisis, the EU institutions should lead by example in implementing austerity and rigour, starting by freezing their administrative budgets. This should be done in a manner that is both effective and tangible, so as to be credible as regards the sacrifices that we are asking our fellow citizens to make day after day. Making savings, strengthening interinstitutional cooperation, sharing best practices between institutions and modernising policies on human resources, technology and environmental policy can, and must, become strategic objectives for the European Union institutions. This vote allows us to stress once again and with greater clout the fact that we must counter the need for drastic cuts in unproductive spending by multiplying our efforts to free up and make as many more resources available as possible so that we can get the global economy back on track as soon as possible and return hope to those who now easily succumb to the sirens of populist, anti-European sentiment. Citizens’ opinions of the institutions that govern them depend on the institutions’ ability to come across as sensitive to their needs and to the current difficulties, and, most importantly, the ability to put together suitable policies in order to ensure that we recover from this crisis as soon as possible.

 Parliament’s confirmation of the guidelines for the employment policies of Member States adopted by the Council in 2010 is an act that is not completed by a mere formality, even if the committee responsible voted to follow the simplified procedure. We have had the opportunity to hold another debate on the initiatives Member States will have to adopt in order to achieve the Europe 2020 strategy objectives, and to respond, in particular, to the by now unsustainable unemployment situation that young Europeans, more than anyone else, are facing. Opportunities such as this, and the Annual Growth Survey and its transformation into ‘annual guidelines for sustainable growth’, on which we are being asked to vote, allow us to make the future of the young generations of Europeans the focus of our debate and to play an active and immediate role in the interaction between Member States and the European Commission.

 The report follows the controversial confirmation of the European programme for providing aid to the needy. The text is a compromise between those who were in favour of the programme’s continuation and those who wished to see it come to an end. Therefore, the compromise reached avoids the risk of a sudden end to the programme which would have threatened the survival of that sector of the population which is dependent on this food aid. Recent statistics have shown that the crisis is affecting increasingly large and central areas of the continent. This means that increasingly wide sections of the population in rich countries risk finding themselves in poverty. In this context, the attitude of those who, in the name of futile austerity, insist on rejecting such important interventions which have such a limited impact on the EU budget seems increasingly short-sighted and counterproductive. This compromise is very welcome and a new agreement to guarantee the programme’s funding for the future would be especially welcome. In any case, the hope is to investigate the possibility of strengthening the campaign against food wastage, with a programme capable of using recovered food through distribution and rational use, and redistributing it to the weakest and most at-risk sectors.

 The crisis has highlighted the lack of direction in the dairy product market, making regulations to stabilise farmers’ incomes and improve transparency in the trade a matter of urgency. The long period of fixed quotas and high institutional prices, which created guaranteed outlets, has paralysed the market. The participants in the production chain have not been forced to respond to market indicators and had no incentive to innovate and increase productivity. However, we need to do the best we can to secure a smooth transition to the complete abolition of quotas, avoiding an overly inflexible and abrupt effect that could increase the risks faced by the sector and producers. Accordingly, the switch to advance contracts for the delivery of raw milk between producers and dairies looks to be capable of re-balancing bargaining power, particularly because it allows for joint negotiation of conditions through producer organisations. In the same vein, we welcome the possibility of planning and managing the volumes of certified quality (protected designation of origin – PDO) dairy products, as requested by Parliament. Consequently, it is essential that the urgent reform of the system does not cause problems for producers of the very best of the EU exports. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 I should like to point out the most positive aspects of this report, which offer a good rendering of Parliament’s position on the growth and employment survey. It is very important that the Commission, the Council and the Member States take all necessary steps to ensure that the headline targets of the Europe 2020 strategy are met on employment, education and poverty reduction. In particular, the level of youth unemployment in Europe means that specific measures need to be taken as a matter of urgency and the report puts forward a helpful method to support young people, ensuring that every young person in the EU is offered a job, an apprenticeship or additional training after a maximum period of four months’ unemployment. In terms of instruments capable of providing for financial cover, the report also calls for the introduction of a tax on financial transactions, which the report claims is one issue where the EU cannot remain inactive and to which Parliament must offer robust support. Lastly, it is important to strengthen Parliament’s role in identifying instruments for growth, which is the reason for the clear request to the Commission to transform the Annual Growth Survey into Annual Sustainable Growth Guidelines in future years, thereby allowing us to propose amendments.

 By adopting this report and the corresponding report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs (EMPL), Parliament has taken up very clear positions vis-à-vis the Commission and the Council with regard to the policies that must be in place as soon as possible in order to boost growth and employment. Too many Member States have lost sight of the headline targets of the Europe 2020 objectives on employment, education and reducing poverty. They have focused solely on the sovereign debt crisis and remained blind to the fact that only medium- and long-term measures capable of fuelling growth – namely, education, research, innovation and energy – can provide the answers to the tough period that the Union has been going through for too long. The call for the introduction of project bonds to finance key infrastructure projects, as well as the call in EMPL’s report for the introduction of a tax on financial transactions are useful proposals that can no longer be delayed, and Parliament is ready to get behind them. Lastly, the proposal on making the Annual Growth Survey subject to a codecision procedure does justice to the fundamental role that Parliament could have in the debate on the future of European growth and identifying development policies.

 The directive is certainly progressing towards better management of humanitarian funds, starting with improved transparency and more vigorous checks to prevent fraud and corruption. Above all, it is essential to take action to remedy the general character of the reports submitted, from which it is particularly difficult to obtain sufficient information on the results, output and outcome of projects. Furthermore, I welcome the report’s strong emphasis on the need to create continuity between emergency interventions and development programmes. In particular, it might be worthwhile considering a period of cooperation between emergency bodies and development bodies by implementing some form of transfer of deliveries. It is only with difficulty that those who effectively manage emergencies then also prove ready to deal with the problems associated with development projects. It is vital to go beyond the current system which risks creating discontinuity, cancelling out or undermining the potential long-term results. Lastly, the call for greater visibility for actions, not for ‘publicity’ purposes, but to enable better streamlining of interventions, is valuable and should be supported. This is why I voted in favour, and we must hope that account is taken of the recommendations contained in the report during the process of reform of the framework partnership agreement (FPA).

 A regulation defining collective redress is not only desirable but it is also urgent and cannot be delayed, especially when we consider that, in the majority of cases, the ‘collective’ victims come from the weakest sections of the population, both in terms of education and from an economic perspective. This implies that, in the majority of cases, the infringements perpetrated against these groups go unpunished due to economic barriers (the cost of an individual case being disproportionate to the possible compensation) and psychological ones (fears about the length of procedures) and difficulties in accessing the necessary information. Vice versa, bundling the claims would not only strengthen their legal position but would also make it possible to simplify the processes and reduce their costs. On the other hand, there remain quite a few problems, both with regard to the different jurisdictions in individual Member States and to the need to curb misuse of the instrument. In any event, it is advisable for the EU to have a common horizontal approach to the issue, without following the US class action model and without amending national laws, and to establish a horizontal reference framework instrument that enables citizens and companies to enforce their rights under EU legislation.

 First of all, I must point out that I intend to vote in favour of the resolution, even if only in order to maintain the unity of Parliament and to strengthen the position of its President within the European institutions. In this sense, I appreciate the reference to the failure to involve the President of Parliament in the informal meetings held as part of the European summits, an infringement of rights that should be quite rightly condemned and deplored. The problem is also one of defending and reinforcing the positions of political groups fighting for a united Europe, which are confident that the crisis can only be satisfactorily resolved if tackled in a unified manner and if the risk of nationalistic, egotistical breakaway tendencies is prevented. Every day, these groups, particularly in some areas of continental Europe, have to deal with demagogical and populist propaganda that denigrates the EU and its institutions. Our vote is also one of support for these forces. However, it is also important to emphasise that Europe cannot be bound up and represented only by the austerity measures in the ‘six-pack’, a measure we opposed because we felt it was wrong, and which we still believe to be both incomplete and inadequate. We are therefore voting for a strong and united Europe that will once more combine growth and social equity. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 The report results from complaints submitted by European citizens and shows how weak the role of the European institutions and their directives can be if they are not adequately backed up by a comprehensive monitoring network. Accordingly, the report primarily represents an extraordinary demonstration of how a democratic process originating from the grassroots can work and bring results. In particular, the report highlights the serious delays in implementing the Waste Directive in some areas of Europe, as well as numerous violations of it, including: excessive dependence on landfills, in breach of waste disposal policies; a lack of transparency in procedures for assessing the impact on the environment; and the inaccessibility of information for citizens. In any case, the recent issues affecting Campania – one of the regions discussed in the report – have shown that tangible results can be achieved if the EU method is pursued to fruition, using all the available – and perhaps coercive – tools, making it possible to overcome flaws and structural shortcomings. The role of citizens and their petitions is to be welcomed, but even more so the ability of the European institutions to fully comprehend their strength and their role. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 The growing number of countries with which the EU has reached an agreement on the protection of geographical indications (GIs) must be welcomed. The results of this go well beyond economic figures and reflect on the prestige and good name of the outstanding products of European agriculture and foodstuff production. All too often, instances of vacatio legis
 enable the international distribution of brands that fraudulently imitate the packaging of GI products, even though they do not match their characteristics. This is misleading for consumers and hurts both the profits and the image of businesses that strive every day to keep up the quality standards of protected goods. Recently, a striking case involved the exportation to the United States of fake San Marziano tomatoes. Even faced with the evidence of this abuse, the Commission admitted it could not step in because there is no bilateral agreement in place with the US for the protection of registered trademarks; for the right to protection to be granted, we would have had to appeal under the relevant US regulations. This is a paradoxical situation, which needs to be sorted out in short order. By voting in favour of this recommendation, we want to take the opportunity to ask that the time required to manage these agreements be cut down. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

The exponential growth in waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) means that hard-hitting changes to the legislation governing its recycling and production cannot be put off. The growth in the sector is directly proportional to the effect on the Europe 2020 objectives for a resource-efficient economy: to achieve this, national legislation is no longer sufficient; what is needed is systematic European legislation. In line with these objectives, in addition to avoiding further damage to the environment and in order to hold on to precious resources, what we need are high collection rates, appropriate recycling standards, targeted action against illegal exports and a fairer distribution of responsibilities and costs between producers, consumers and public authorities. Parliament’s amended text seems to be in line with these requirements and, in addition, puts forward two particularly sensitive aspects that deserve attention and support. Firstly, it includes eco-design, not only with regard to energy consumption standards, but also with regard to a simplification of the procedures for dismantling or recovery of raw materials. Equally important is the requirement for the costs incurred in the recovery and treatment of raw materials to become an integral part of the product’s price, so as to form an incentive for the purchase of products with lower impacts. I voted for this recommendation for these reasons. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 The report is part of the debate on the CAP 2020 reform, seeking to guide its content, in order to better adapt it to the significant challenges that farmers will face, and seeking to turn those challenges from potential risk factors into opportunities to advance the process to transform agriculture in an environmentally sustainable and energy-efficient way. To achieve these results, without jeopardising the survival of a large portion of small operators, especially those located in the outermost areas of the continent, it is necessary to take action on those levers that make running farms economically sustainable. The report sets out actions to eliminate distortions which, upstream, limit farms’ profitability. All Eurostat findings come together to show the disparity between the increase in input costs and that of farm gate prices. The report, which I voted in favour of, has the merit of precisely indicating the sectors for action, both hoping for an enhanced and more constant commitment to tackling the formation of cartels among suppliers of the main inputs (seeds and fertilisers), and setting out an environmentally sustainable and economically beneficial transformation of resource supply systems.

 That the level reached by the data on food waste has an ethical significance, as well as a social, economic and environmental one, is no longer surprising. Yet, despite the ever increasing amounts – according to Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) estimates, it may even reach 50% of the total produced – of goods lost along the entire food chain, in Europe, there is still no clear, unambiguous and uniform definition of the concept of ‘food waste’. As if that were not enough, just a few months ago, we had to fight a fierce battle to refinance the fund for the distribution of food to the needy. In contrast to this is the data, deplorable in many ways, according to which Europeans and North Americans waste up to 115 kilograms of food per capita. This situation is no longer acceptable but, at the same time, it is hard to resolve. One of the main virtues of this report is that it does not reduce the problem to its most obvious manifestation – waste generated by the end consumer – which, however deplorable, is but one part of a broader and more complex problem. Conversely, we need to identify intervention strategies tailored to the specific causes of waste for each of the five sectors (production, storage, processing, distribution, consumption) that make up the food supply chain.

 The work carried out at the conciliation table by the European Parliament delegation is both praiseworthy and positive. The financial conditions of Member States meant that no more could have been achieved. Yet difficult times like these require the will and the courage to make innovative political choices that in some ways represent a break with the past. The conservatism of some Member States (especially, but not only Germany) is dangerously slowing down the process leading to the introduction of measures which, conversely, increasingly appear to be both urgent and unavoidable. At the same time as the budget lines were being approved, not without difficulty, the Commission was beginning consultations about the eurobonds, which were met with a negative reaction by some national governments. However, eurobonds are just part of the possible solution. In the 2012 budget, the evident widening of the gap between commitments for appropriations and payments is symptomatic of how the current system of delivering EU resources is inefficient and inadequate, and that it is therefore time it was changed to reflect an actual system of own resources based not only on the tax on financial transactions (TFT) and a new value-added tax (VAT), but also on a new way of taxing energy sources.

 The need to introduce a framework of legal certainty that would oversee a common practice, in other words, the use of a financial instrument which was included in the previous general regulation and not in Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 and which has continued to play an important part in the management of unit trusts, is in response to clear evidence of its functionality. It is no coincidence that Member States have continued to use them, even in the absence of clear indications. It was therefore certainly urgent to clarify and increase the transparency of procedures. However, we wish to express particular support for the provision for re-use of the reimbursed assistance, which would be managed in a separate account and used for the same purposes. This instrument would guarantee suitable and effective reinvestment of the funds, and could also be a way to alleviate pressure on cofinancing by Member States. Overall, the granting of repayable funds and the setting up of a special credit line for individual beneficiaries to use both seem to be moving towards an expansion of the range of funding possibilities, which is all the more important at a time of serious financial difficulty for many Member States. For this reason, I have to support this report. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 There can be no disagreement with support for a measure which represents a real and substantial breath of fresh air for Member States with the greatest economic and financial difficulties. In the same way, there can be no opposition to backing a measure which represents an attempt to maximise the use of European funding, avoiding the risk of funds not being spent due to a lack of available funds on the part of Member States, and of a consequent further deterioration and weakening of economic and social conditions. Although limited to Member States that have had access to financial stability mechanisms, the measure should therefore be supported and approved without further ado. However, this does not mean that we should not draw attention to the fact that it is a demonstration of the failure of the stability pact and ‘six-pack’ as wished for and approved by the right-wing majority in the Commission and Parliament. More specifically, this ‘contingent’ action restricts itself to mitigating the effects, which are, by their nature, ‘structural’, of the vicious cycle created, in particular, by the failure to exclude appropriations for investments from the rigid criteria of the stability pact, also because of the failure to introduce a golden rule on investments. Stop-gap measures are welcome, provided we are aware that the strategy pursued was wrong and that corrective structural measures are urgently required. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 In the European collective mentality, the image of literacy as a goal to achieve suggests areas outside the continent or, at the most, limited, peripheral areas. However, it is also a problem in ‘western’ and ‘industrialised’ areas. It is no coincidence that recent studies have shown that in Italy, 71% of the population is below the minimum comprehension threshold of an average difficulty text. Despite these statistics, no coordinated policies to tackle the problem have been found in the individual Member States, which will make it difficult to achieve the target set for 2020. It is important, in line with the European platform for tackling poverty, to underline that there is a need to coordinate the two areas of action, creating a synergy able to reverse the rate at which ‘poverty’ affects the percentages of early school leaving and, more generally, of poor school attendance. National governments, in the grip of the financial crisis, have almost all reduced educational funding. This risks boosting the vicious cycle of ‘low school attendance-unemployment’. This is why it has become so much more important for the European institutions to take action and provide support, through the targeted use of Structural Funds and implementation of alternative financial instruments.

 It would be unthinkable, including in terms of the developments under the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), not to support the association agreement with Ukraine, which, moreover, has a fundamental strategic role in such an essential sector as energy resources. However, the well-known political and judicial issues cannot be considered of secondary import. Hence, as Ms Tymoshenko herself said recently, we need to strengthen the political significance, which must go hand in hand with the economic and commercial aspects of the agreement. As the document under scrutiny suggests, this must become the mechanism for incentivising development and the onward march of reform. This is by no means an easy path, as the rejection of the amendment decriminalising the abuse of power and the continued imprisonment of Ms Tymoshenko and other opposition figures show. This is not a matter of meddling in the domestic affairs of a sovereign state, but of shrewd and active supervision of the personal and political freedoms that are basic conditions for rapprochement with the EU. Support for the agreement must therefore be understood in this light, without losing any respect for the rights of minorities and democratic principles, which are, in any case, well expressed in the document itself.

rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, policies to tackle new and old forms of poverty, which, unfortunately, are on the rise in today’s Europe and in the Europe of the crisis of recent times, along with one-sided austerity policies, above all, on the part of the Member States, require new financial commitments and new resources not only with regard to the European budget, including within the framework of financial prospects, but also with regard to European policies – as just mentioned – from the European Social Fund to the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), as well as to the budgets of individual Member States. Above all, as regards individual states, we should utilise the European Semester to monitor year after year, in practical terms, the policies they dedicate to this fundamental challenge. In order to give credibility to the objective to reduce poverty and social exclusion for around 20 million European citizens, it is necessary to have coherence between the enormous resources that Europe and the States should make available and the concrete policies that we can put into practice. It is calculated that around EUR 2 billion are needed between now and 2020 in order to realise the objectives that we are proposing. The challenge that we as the Committee on Budgets are identifying and focusing on is this: coherence between the financial resources that we make available and the policies that we put into practice. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D
),  
in writing.

In the context of the very broadest aims of the Europe 2020 strategy, the European platform against poverty and social exclusion should be thought of in view of the unique characteristics of what is an intrinsically complex, multifaceted and multiform phenomenon which, as the economic crisis has made itself felt, has taken on even more striking and worrying dimensions. The gradual increase in the number of areas affected, or at risk of being dragged into a state of poverty or ‘severe material deprivation’ as a result of the financial crisis, means that we have to strengthen and differentiate our responses. Vice-versa, we are watching with concern at the distortive effects which, in this sector too, may be caused by the reckless decision not to exclude investment from Stability Pact funds. Even in a context of scarce financial resources, the platform offers a positive message that is in line with the need to develop specific, Europe-wide, socio-economic initiatives, moving beyond mere emergency action or temporary support and thus heralding a genuine reversal of this trend. Specifically, it highlights the importance of launching a much sought-after global initiative to bring in a guaranteed minimum income rule, which – if it can be adjusted to and made compatible with economic development – will help reduce and prevent poverty and social exclusion.

 Demographic change, as underlined in the Fifth Report on cohesion, poses one of the central challenges for the future of the European socio-economic system, and it is a challenge with a wide territorial context that cuts deeply into the management of services and infrastructures. Without in any way detracting from the task of individual Member States, this challenge, which could also become an opportunity, directly implicates European institutions and, in particular, regional development policies. These policies are characterised by different strategies that are adapted to guaranteeing the demands and needs, respectively, of areas with populations on the rise and in decline, as well as the varying needs of urban and rural areas. In response to these challenges, European Funds (both the ERDF and the ESF) can be used comprehensively to ensure that equilibrium is restored to demands and, to this end, we should welcome the prospect of also making use of specific demographic indicators to assign European funds as well as to redistribute finances at the level of individual States. I express my vote in favour in the hope for policies capable of correlating the effects of demographic change with the fight against old and new poverty. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

The exhaust emission limits for agricultural and forestry tractors were changed in 2005. When that change was introduced, the requirements were also applied in full to agricultural tractor engines without any specific impact assessment concerning the technical feasibility of doing so. However, there have clearly been difficulties in applying the measure to tractors – generically called ‘narrow-track tractors’ – used for automated cultivation procedures on terrain which presents certain distinctive features, such as orchards and vineyards. The technical impossibility of installing compliant engines, whilst maintaining the tractors’ operational functionality and manoeuvrability, if not corrected, would cause serious difficulties to some of the most advanced and productive agricultural sectors, further exacerbating the effects of the ongoing economic crisis. In complete compliance with the European policy to fight for emission reduction, which needs to be developed, the current unusual situation in the economy in general, and the sector in particular, fully justifies the decision to postpone the application of the standards for three years. This will allow the parallel development of the essential design and technology necessary for the application, also to narrow-track tractors, of after-treatment systems able to guarantee compliance with emission restrictions, without compromising operational requirements.

 The procedure which began with the publication of the Green Paper on the future of value-added tax (VAT) has to be supported. The need to restructure the system rules out any further delays, as the mechanism introduced on a provisional basis has proved to have numerous shortcomings, particularly with regard to the risk of fraud. The hope for the future is that a new VAT system, together with the taxation of financial transactions, will, as the Commission claims, become an important own resource for the European budget. In the meantime, we invite the Commission to act quickly and to continue along its chosen path to the end, actively encouraging Member States to put in place all the necessary preliminary conditions in order to avoid multiple and overlapping elements and to allow for smoother bureaucratic procedures and reduced administration costs. In times of trouble, it is important to devote significant energies to fighting the waste of resources caused by evasion and fraud. Therefore, I support the report by Mr Casa, and hope that in its proposal, the Commission will take due account, above all, of the call to adopt mechanisms to make cross-border fraud control less random, by making optimal use of mechanisms that have already been tried and tested in individual Member States, or by using all the resources made available by the latest technology.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the structure of the cohesion policy we are debating today is very commendable. I would like to focus these few comments on three issues. Firstly, I consider cohesion policy to be one of the fundamental tools for reducing imbalances between and within Member States. It is therefore also one of the fundamental policies for combating the long economic and financial crisis that we have been experiencing for some years now. Secondly, I think the idea of involving new regions and citizens in cohesion policy is a sound one. However, we would do well to discuss these issues with a clearer idea of how much this new policy will cost, what effects it will have on general cohesion policy, and how we are going to distribute the resources in the context of the reform of the financial perspective from here to 2020. Finally, I think the central role of the urban issue in cohesion policy is decisive. It is important to have made some progress in this direction with Mr Vlasák’s report, with which I strongly agree, and I believe that this report will allow us to better define the legal framework of the urban issue and also to introduce tools such as the municipal operational programmes as operational programmes capable of giving a new quality to cohesion policy. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are about to vote on a highly important strategic document that provides a solid framework of reference for financial perspectives after 2013. It begins with the request for coherence between objectives and instruments, and between the new role that the European institutions must perform – in the light of the Treaty of Lisbon and the recession – and the resources that, together, we decide to invest. Such coherence also implies a serious response to the demand for innovation from the public, from the recipients of EU policies, and from Europe’s social groups and industries. We did the same for cohesion, which is a crucial issue for deciding what we want the European Union to be in the coming years. Experience shows that cohesion is now a vital nexus of the European project, and an important asset for everyone to safeguard, protect and renew. On this front, the effort made on the idea of introducing an intermediate category of regions is particularly important, above all, because in a number of cases, the years of recession that we are emerging from have intensified internal divisions, further increasing the importance of effective and adequate support for less developed regions in Europe, combating wastage and bringing development policy sharply into focus. However, I maintain that the challenge of intermediate categories and the safeguard clause is one that we must take on in order to begin a new phase in Europe’s cohesion policy and also to realise, within the cohesion policy, the more balanced and sustainable development that we want to assure for Europe over the coming years. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Ivan. The report lists the innovations introduced in the changes to control and reporting systems. These too bring out a greatly varied picture, especially in terms of Member States’ reporting of irregularities and fraud. The report repeatedly highlights the unusually low levels of fraud and irregularity reported by various countries in relation to agricultural expenditure, structural funds and pre-accession funds. It is here that we really must have some clarification on the statistics which have been submitted. The context is made more complicated by the unresolved inefficiencies in recovering losses. In any case, one figure seems clear and confirms a long-running trend. The struggle for legality and transparency in the expenditure of European resources, in comparison to tax avoidance and evasion, cannot yet count on the full collaboration of Member States and governments with the European institutions. In this light, it seems that the calls for reform of the EU’s public procurement rules and the need for what I would call a public European register for the beneficiaries of EU funds are timely. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the economic, social and financial crisis of the last few months and years, the new Treaty of Lisbon with its new powers, and the challenge we have set ourselves with Europe 2020, require the mobilisation of massive new financial resources. The paradox we are witnessing, including in this debate, is that right now, both the Commission and the Council appear to be silent and incapable of deciding and making choices. However, we know that if we want to come out of this difficult economic and social phase, if we want to address the major issues of the environment, the development of cohesion policy and agriculture in the coming years, then we need to invest more heavily in Europe and Europe’s function, and hence its essential function, which is to say, its budget. To do so, we must not be afraid to discuss, even at a time of budgetary restrictions, the idea of investing more heavily in resources and to have the strength and ability to develop debate and discussion that tackle the issue of increasing resources and that of more effective and flexible use of resources. This is the challenge we face. Andrea Cozzolino,  
rapporteur. 
− (IT) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when the Treaty of Lisbon is giving Europe a more incisive role in the lives of millions of Europeans, the challenge of transparency and legality is crucial. Hence the report that we are presenting is the result of a highly coordinated effort. The work was confined, first and foremost, to the scenario outlined by the Court of Auditors, whereby the financial impact of irregularities fell from more than EUR 1 billion in 2007 to EUR 783 million in 2008. The fall concerns all spending areas except direct expenditure and pre-accession funds. Areas of major concern still exist in relation to the Structural Funds too. However, absolute amounts and values alone do not tell us where the urgent problems are hidden and where the situation is under control. Our analyses and meetings over recent months have led us to prioritise two requirements. Firstly, the urgent need to make the Member States more responsible for identifying fraud and irregularities, and for sharing the information needed to combat fraud, waste and distortions in expenditure and in the collection of taxes. Secondly, the importance of presenting proposals and working hypotheses in order to make it easier to implement measures in the Member States, with administrative procedures and management strategies that give priority to the quality of the projects and to their impact on the living and working conditions of European citizens. In order to achieve these objectives, we propose that Parliament insist on certain priorities: firstly, we propose that OLAF draw up 27 profiles, analysing with due care and attention the strategies followed by each individual Member State in combating fraud and irregularities in the use of European resources, with a precise map of the authorities responsible for performing checks in each individual country and data on the quantity and quality of the checks performed and on their effects. Secondly, reducing the number of irregularities and significantly improving the regulations. We are embarking on a legislative and regulatory simplification programme, intended in particular for the Structural Funds. Moreover, the fight against corruption, financial crime and breaches of public procurement rules must be stepped up. In this year’s report we have made progress on this point with the support of the entire committee. Thanks to an intense, concerted effort, proposals have been drafted on the main problems in this area. From the relationship between the EU and tax havens, to the databases on beneficiaries of European funds, the report makes a practical contribution to increasing the transparency of expenditure and to strengthening the anti-fraud and anti-corruption strategies. Lastly, with regard to OLAF, it is crucially important to guarantee its full operational independence, the full cooperation of the Member States and an appropriate human resources strategy, which it most definitely needs. We must keep the debate alive and kicking in Europe so as to establish the role of a single European Prosecutor. To conclude, I believe it is vitally important to fight together for the transparent and efficient management of European resources. In this regard we must ensure that the problems that do exist are not exploited in any way in order to call into question instruments of fundamental importance to the European project, such as cohesion policy and development aid. Rather, we must look clearly at the problems, at the distortions that still exist in the various European spending areas and use these data to take new, determined steps forward, thereby making the management of our finances more efficient and transparent. I believe that, by making this effort, the various European institutions really will make progress in the construction of a Europe that is stronger, more integrated and able to better satisfy the needs of Europeans. Andrea Cozzolino  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been stated, the European Court of Auditors 2008 report first and foremost gives us some positive news: the percentage of EU expenditure, characterised by high levels of irregularities, has gone down from 60% in 2005 to 31% in 2008. This is a significant result; it signals a positive approach that we must continue to follow. As far as the Structural Funds, and more specifically cohesion policies, are concerned, there continue to be problems and difficulties. I believe that we should focus our attention on these areas in the coming months and years. With regard to the Structural Funds, when compared with the Court’s analysis of the period 2000-2006, the management and monitoring systems for the period 2007-2013 are giving rise to stricter regulations and greater reliability and transparency in terms of expenditure, as well as to greater accountability on the part of the Member States. The Court of Auditors strongly emphasises the need for greater simplification. Therefore, much work needs to be done in order to further simplify the rules. Quality of economic growth and transparency in the use of Community resources are two objectives of the same battle which we need to wage. I believe we need to do this by also making our debates concerning ourselves and, above all, concerning the citizens, more public. Cohesion policies, the Structural Funds and regional policies are, and will, remain a crucial element of the European project. They have given substance to the European Union’s fundamental values. We must work together to guarantee efficiency and transparency in the coming years. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the focus is usually on the pre-summits when the summits themselves count for nothing, but in this case, we are forced to focus on the post-summit because we had understood that something important had happened. Mr Van Rompuy, if you had gone into a national parliament in any country in Europe and made the speech that you made here today, I think people throughout Europe would have understood precisely the opposite of what they had read in the newspapers three days ago, that you had made Europe take a giant step forwards. I think it is essential to come here to this House not only to tell us what happened at the summit, but also to say what the Council intends to do after this summit. If you do not tell us that, you will be throwing away the chance to tell the European public that we are working towards a united Europe and to getting a step closer to rescuing the countries in difficulty. In your reply, Mr Van Rompuy, I would also like you to tell us exactly what you think of the position taken by the Dutch and Finnish Governments. It is your duty to say what your thoughts are on that, because otherwise we will have the impression that the Council ended with a statement that does not correspond to any genuine political will. You should be very careful about this, as I hope not too many journalists heard it, because you know how much influence the media has these days on the fate of countries and the evolution of their spreads.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, you were quite right to say that this is not a perfect agreement, Ms Malmström. If we at the EU had done it ourselves we would have done it differently, but this is not a directive, it is an agreement between parties. An agreement is always better than no agreement though, and this one does help us to move forward. It will also enable further improvements, because each year a European agreement – not secret agreements like those made with all Member States – will return to Parliament and be verified by this House. Therefore, we have to acknowledge a political fact: through this agreement, Europe is negotiating with the US and comes directly under US jurisdiction. I would like to thank my group for allowing free voting and for allowing the delegation from the Italian Partito Democratico
 to vote in favour of the agreement. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, the conclusions of the European Council were not what we were expecting, given that the Treaty of Lisbon does, in fact, provide the elements and possible coverage to put forward credible solutions. We had called for Eurobonds and a financial transaction tax, an increase in the bail-out fund and a review of the role of the European Central Bank. As you yourselves have said this morning, however, nothing was decided on any of those points. The Council’s response was budget discipline to curb the erosion of financial resources, but without investing in growth. This was a meagre outcome based on an agreement among 26 countries, reached after a tortuous procedure, which we have always rejected. Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, by excluding the Commission and the European Parliament, the Council chose to add a democracy deficit to the budget deficit. We have a two-speed Europe, Mr President: the Europe of the Member States and the Europe of the people. Parliament supports the Europe of the people, and I call on President Barroso to have the Commission side with us. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have understood that there are countries in the Arab world and in North Africa that need us. Public opinion demands that Europe be in touch with this wind of liberty, this eagerness for dignity, and it is a demand that is made of us and when I say ‘us’, I mean Europe. It is right for Europe to ensure that the international community is present, but that demand, the demand from these countries, is to ‘us’ directly. We can rightly undertake every diplomatic effort so that the international community intervenes, but it cannot intervene if Europe does not have a policy for the Mediterranean. We must strengthen this will to have a policy for the Mediterranean. It is said, and has been said very well, during the debate on the Syrian issue: ‘let us meet Turkey’. However, Baroness Ashton, we must have a clear idea of our relationship with Turkey, and it cannot be an intermittent relationship. One day, we want it to be close to us and the next, we do not want it close to us; this is not feasible. Europe needs to be clear on its relationship with Turkey and today, we understand how important it would have been in the past to bet on Turkey … (The President cut off the speaker) David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, to question Schengen is, in our view, to question Europe. If Europe is going to be even weaker, as right-wing governments desire, it will be increasingly tempting to ask ourselves whether remaining in Europe still makes sense, as the Italian Interior Minister, Mr Maroni, has done. The answer, however, is greater involvement of EU mechanisms. In essence, we need more Europe, not less Europe, and the Commission needs to say so more forcefully. The best of Europe was shown on Sunday night when, in an extraordinary chain of human solidarity, the people of Lampedusa saved 500 shipwrecked people who were heading towards certain death. The worst of Europe, if the news carried by The Guardian
 is confirmed, would be NATO military forces who do not intervene to save men, women and children adrift. If we are sure about which of these we prefer, Mrs Malmström, then during the European Council in June the Commission will have to convince Member States to formulate a European policy on immigration, because Europe à la carte
 would be tantamount to the collapse of the European dream. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last night, there was another tragedy in the Mediterranean. Immigrants from north Africa died trying to reach Italy and Europe. There are 130 missing and 20 bodies have already been found. When it comes to immigration, we must never forget that we are talking about men, women and children, not just numbers. There must be no more reticence; the Council and governments must act. Civil and democratic Europe must show its sorrow and, for this reason, Mr President, I ask you to invite the House to observe a minute’s silence in memory of the victims of immigration.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow’s vote is one of the steps which will soon lead to the accession of Iceland to the European Union. Iceland has made significant progress, as Mr Preda said. I will mention a few examples: the strengthening of judicial independence, a special commission of inquiry to investigate and analyse the processes that led to the collapse of the Icelandic banking system, the creation of a joint Parliamentary Committee between the European Union and Iceland, the situation regarding entry into the euro area, increased experience in the renewable energy sector. The very thorny issue of ‘Icesave remains open, and on Saturday there will be a referendum which will bring Icelanders to the polls. Although the outcome of the referendum is a matter of debate, I think it has very strong democratic value because it gives the people of Iceland a sense of responsibility and involves them even more in this delicate stage of negotiations. Although the first referendum did not bring a positive result, the Icelandic Government has worked hard to create a broad coalition capable of explaining to citizens the reason for Iceland’s commitment to reimbursing the UK and the Netherlands for the damage they suffered. Europe’s role at this time should be one of patience and respect, without exerting excessive pressure which might cause some sort of self-defence and closure in Icelandic society. With regard to fisheries and agriculture, I believe that Europe and Iceland must find the best solution to meet the criteria established in the Treaty and to preserve the Icelandic economy, ecosystems and the country’s specific characteristics. The accession of Iceland to the European Union will mean that Europe moves towards the North Pole, with significant positive effects in the political, economic, environmental and scientific fields. It is clear that belonging to Europe, sixty years on, is still an attractive possibility. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, you must have realised that this House enjoys plenty of solidarity, but this is not enough. To introduce and empower a European immigration policy, we must do together what others cannot do, in other words, achieve the consensus of governments. Take your proposals and put them before the Council. We shall support you, because you must have realised, apart from some xenophobic remarks, that you enjoy great respect and great solidarity in this House. Parliament will reaffirm this tomorrow, saying no to the refoulements
, yes to the implementation of Directive 2001/55/EC and yes to the implementation of Article 25 of that directive. Tomorrow, we will do our bit in Parliament. However we need others to do their bit; for governments to be much less selfish; for us to be seen sponsoring the solidarity needed to implement a European policy. Your work is naturally central to this effort, because without the governments, Europe will be weaker. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Mediterranean has made a dramatic return to the global political agenda and Europe has found out that it is very weak indeed. We failed to invest in a neighbourhood policy with the Middle East and the Maghreb, we did not give our backing to an area of free trade or a common immigration policy and what is happening in North Africa is having an effect on the Middle East, where the peace process has stalled. Baroness Ashton, Europe must help Israel and the Palestinians to restart negotiations on the basis of proposals that are now supported by both the Council and Parliament. The changes under way also affect Israel and, by investing in change, we can bring together security and peace. Europe must exert pressure on Israel to weaken its grip on the occupied territories and to halt the settlement policy, which is a necessary condition to restart negotiations. As we are currently seeing, these days, nobody is impervious when the desire for freedom explodes like this. Any further delay in resolving the conflict risks compromising Israeli and Palestinian hopes of reaching a fair solution and compromises the future of such a fragile area of the Mediterranean and the Middle East.

Madam President, once again, we have witnessed the inability of the Italian Government to protect the pro-European reputation of Italy and the interests of its businesses on a crucial point such as the adoption of the European patent. Twenty-five countries out of 27 and the overwhelming majority of Parliament support a proposal that regulates the field of patents and that has a real effect on the most innovative enterprises and those that are most orientated to international markets. By ruling ourselves out of this decision, we in Italy will expose our enterprises to the risk of not being suitably protected in Europe and across the world. It is quite incredible that a government that does nothing to spread Italian culture throughout the world, that cuts funds to cultural institutes and fails to value the language of the country that is host to the largest number of World Heritage Sites, can ride roughshod over the language issue while our enterprises have actually always asked for patents to be drafted only in English, which is now the lingua franca of the global economy. However, we have reached a result that allows anyone submitting patents to do so in their own language. Madam President, there was nothing that made it compulsory for Mr Barnier to force this through with such a hasty vote before the opinion of the Court of Justice which, as we know, will be expressed during the first week of March and will deal mainly with two crucial points: the use of one’s national language to defend oneself before the European Union Patent Court and the very legitimacy of creating a patent court. As we well know, these are important issues to resolve before taking any decision. Hence, the Italian delegation of the Democratic Party (PD) decided to abstain. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are pleased to have this debate with the Commission on the North African migration crisis. We have seen these people arrive in Lampedusa only to find no facilities able to receive and identify them. In fact, the Italian Government dismantled the existing reception centre and reduced the facilities there some time ago, under the banner of ‘Zero immigration’, thus preventing Italy from being able to tackle illegal immigration. We know that this problem concerns Italy, but it also concerns Europe. Considerable financial investment is needed to solve it within a coordinated policy framework, while complying with international treaties and ensuring that refugees are protected. In your response, Commissioner, I would like to know precisely when the Italian Government asked the European Commission to intervene, because there have been certain controversies, of which you are well aware.

In the resolution we have tabled and are shortly to vote upon, we point out that relations between Brazil and the European Union are based on mutual recognition and respect of the rule of law and of fundamental rights. There are therefore no question marks over our friendly relationship with Brazil. I should like to point out that, in Italy, the defendant, Cesare Battisti, has been found guilty of four murders. Although a fugitive, Mr Battisti had the legal assurances in his trials – which were all conducted in the presence of his defence lawyer – that the Italian justice system had run its course, with all levels of justice exhausted, and that they sentenced him to two life sentences. Mr President, even France – where Cesare Battisti had previously fled – decided back in 2004 to accept Italy’s extradition request, recognising his crimes and the corresponding sentences, because Cesare Battisti is a criminal who must be brought to justice. Brazil’s contradictory behaviour is difficult to understand, not least because the Brazilian authorities have not officially recognised him as a political refugee, which is one of the reasons to suspend the bilateral agreement between Italy and Brazil regarding extradition. This is why the decision of the Supreme Court seemed incomprehensible to the victims’ families and the wider public. Mr President, we are representing a Europe of rights and of rights for all. The victims have the right to know that those guilty of such heinous crimes will serve their sentence in the prisons of their own countries. David-Maria Sassoli,

Mr President, the situation is very serious. We think that this issue – which is also being trailed by Europe’s media – ought to be dealt with by the European Union and by Parliament, as well as urging the Commission to look into it, since it is a real humanitarian emergency. In this case, the Member States must do everything to try and help these refugees to leave that territory and we think that they could be accepted in European states. We call on the Commission to do everything possible to carry out this action, including using the funds available through the European Fund for Refugees. David-Maria Sassoli,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to add a paragraph to the resolution, which we feel is important and will not affect the structure of it too much. It concerns paragraph 9 of the joint resolution. I shall read it: ‘invites Member States to tackle this humanitarian emergency through the voluntary resettlement in the European Union of all the asylum seekers involved in this crisis; asks the European Commission to coordinate this operation and use available funding through the European Refugees Fund’.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last week we witnessed a disconcerting spectacle in the new body over which you preside: Mr Sarkozy and Mr Berlusconi called into question the treaties signed by their countries. We realised that the French President and Italian Prime Minister, in serious difficulty in their countries, wish to have a Commission that bends to their will. The former refuses to accept criticism, and the latter even wants to deny Commissioners the right to speak. We must remember, as Parliament has reminded us, that the Roma are European citizens on European soil. The treaties must be upheld. We have the instruments to do this, and we must not be afraid to open infringement procedures too. Moreover, if we do not defend the principles of European integration, how will we be able to agree on strategies to emerge from the economic crisis? The forces on the ground, Mr President, have had their say. Parliament, its Presidency and the Commission must respond to the populism advocating a fear-driven Europe with an enhanced social Europe and enhanced citizenship, and we believe this to be the challenge that this political generation must meet. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, for the second time during this parliamentary term and in this House, we find ourselves discussing the problem of press freedom. This shows, Commissioner, that it is a keenly-felt problem; it is a major problem in the eyes of the European public. I would remind you that, in May 2004, Parliament issued a resolution calling upon the Commission to take action to protect media pluralism and press freedom, but we have not heard the Commission speak up in all these years. As you know, the problem is now growing. The issues concerning Italy, Romania and Hungary are different but their background is the same. As you are well aware, Italy continues to experience a serious conflict of interest that is exacerbated by government occupation of the public broadcasting service. In Romania, the press is actually considered a threat to the nation. In Hungary, the government wishes to put journalism under scrutiny. The European institutions naturally cannot condone any government influence over the media. Freedom of information is not a commodity that can be evaluated only in accordance with market criteria. Rather, it is the public’s right to form its own opinions about politics, the quality of governments, and public life. There can be no more excuses for the European institutions; the Commission must take decisive action to reinforce common European standards. Your intervention, Commissioner, could offer European citizens the certainty that Europe is an area of rights and freedom. David-Maria Sassoli,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, members of the Council and of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, clearly, the start of accession negotiations with Iceland represents another step forward in the European integration process. We are talking about a country which has signed European partnership agreements for years, which has been a signatory to the Schengen Agreement since 1996, and which is one of the founding members of the World Trade Organisation. So far, Iceland has demonstrated that it meets many of the accession criteria, though there are some aspects that still need to be improved. I refer to the judicial system, mentioned by Mr Preda: it is important for Iceland to adopt clear mechanisms in order to ensure the independence of the judiciary and to resolve the problem of appointments of judges, prosecutors and supreme judicial authorities. The Icelandic Government must work harder: it is the Icelandic people who must be convinced about wanting to participate in the European challenge. There are, of course, some issues that still need to be defined, and one of those is whaling. The conference in Agadir on 25 June confirmed the moratorium on whaling, and Iceland must act in accordance with this decision and stop whaling even for scientific purposes, since it is often a cover for commercial whaling. Lastly, there is one point on which I think greater conviction is needed by Parliament and that is the Icesave issue, which has highlighted the need for a solid law on conflicts of interest in that country. Madam President, the negotiation stage can begin in order to reaffirm that Europe is not a geographical area or a closed system, and that, if they so desire and if they conform, the countries neighbouring Europe can participate in the development and the construction of the European project. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis is deep and Europeans are asking us for one thing: to put politics back in charge of the economy. This is the responsibility that we must take on by revitalising the Community method, safeguarding our currency and promoting measures to protect our citizens and provide employment. Making the financial markets accountable is a moral, but also a political duty for us, and Europe must speak with one voice at the forthcoming G20 summit. This is a problem that you, Mr Barroso, must address. Your Commission must endeavour to keep the governments at arm’s length and convince them that no one will emerge from the crisis on their own. United, Europe will win, or divided, it will fall. You must be like an orchestra conductor, Mr Barroso, making all the musicians play the same tune. What should the music score contain though? Firstly, regulation of the financial markets and the rating agencies, economic governance of the euro area, taxation of all financial transactions and investments for growth, and not just budget cuts. A striking example was your Commission’s positive opinion, according to the Italian Government, of Italy’s financial package, a package that will bring the local authorities to their knees. No one has ever achieved growth on the basis of budget cuts alone and today, what we need is growth. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteur, Mr Cashman, for the work he has carried out, and for reminding us of the importance of the New York summit. Europe has a great opportunity: that of presenting itself as a world partner for development. The information we have is still alarming: in 2009, a billion people suffered chronic hunger, and this figure has risen today with the economic crisis. We must add to this the damage caused by climate change, a factor that continues to magnify the problems that we have been trying to keep under control. We must recognise that the targets we set ourselves in 2000 were certainly ambitious and could only have been met by donor countries. In the light of these commitments toward developing countries, it is sad to see that some European countries are falling so far short of their agreed commitments. It is disappointing, for example, that my country – Italy – is now contributing a distressingly low 0.16% of GDP. We must introduce a binding commitment for all countries to reach 0.7 % of GDP by 2015, as established by the European Commission. All countries must feel it is their moral duty and political obligation to uphold this commitment. The outstanding work by the rapporteur, Mr Cashman, enables the European Parliament to play a key role in defending people’s dignity. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a Europe of the people and not a Europe of the States. The crisis we are experiencing is the crisis of European policy’s inability to govern the market. In order to save the euro, political institutions need to be strengthened and intergovernmental logic needs to be left behind to allow for European governance. This is not rhetoric because a few minutes ago in Berlin, German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, sounded the alarm stating that the euro is in danger. Voicing alarm without indicating strong and convincing measures risks further weakening the single currency for investors and the market and making all of Europe weaker. Imagine the response of the markets in the coming hours, considering that just minutes ago, the euro collapsed again. When we exit the House, Mr President, we may find ourselves poorer and more insecure. New European governance alone will allow us to defend the single currency, promote growth, employment and social inclusion. We must discard the old approach of coordinating national policies and equip ourselves with strong decision-making instruments. New European governance must assure three levels of intervention: a policy for growth, suitable financial instruments and emergency management. The EUR 750 billion rescue package was important but we have realised that it is not enough. Today, we need a strong political initiative that can guide the market to allow for greater mobility of the resources. The monetary and budget policies have proven inadequate in assuring productivity and competitiveness. We must not be afraid to invest, above all, in Community interest projects such as infrastructure, energy, the environment, knowledge and human capital. Mr President, Parliament has a great responsibility: to reinforce the capacity of Member States to leave intergovernmental policy behind and launch European spirit anew through its own independence.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a moment ago, a disgraceful speech was speciously made in this House against the President of the Italian Republic. I believe that the Bureau of this House should not allow people to bring national political issues into it, particularly when dealing with institutional and political matters of great importance. I would remind you – and remind all fellow Members – that the Italian Republic is not for sale, and that the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, is the guardian of the Italian Constitution. On behalf of the Italian delegation of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I call on the Bureau of this House to be more vigilant with regard to the topics debated and the speeches that are made. I am sorry that President Buzek did not intervene to stop a speech that attacked the President of the Republic, who, just one week ago, visited the European Parliament.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Italian police force last night arrested five people who were planning a mafia attack on one of our colleagues, Mr Crocetta, a Member of this Parliament and a former mayor of the Sicilian town of Gela. According to the magistrates, the attack could have taken place on any given day, starting from today, 20 January. I would remind you that the Belgian authorities have yet to provide a suitable escort for Mr Crocetta, who has been under protection in Italy for some time now, as Parliament’s Presidency is aware. I would ask the Presidency to show solidarity with our colleague on behalf of this House and of the European Parliament and to take action to ensure that Mr Crocetta receives adequate protection in his role as an MEP.

 Mr President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, the enormous tragedy that has struck Haiti requires an immediate response and many aid and rescue activities are under way, carried out by individual Member States, even if there is a good deal of competition between European countries. The new Europe with its High Representative ought to be capable of providing its own aid to the people who are suffering. The earthquake, moreover, has struck the poorest country in the western hemisphere, where 80% of the population live below the poverty line and 54% live in absolute poverty. Within this emergency, however, there is another: the emergency involving the children, the weakest sector of the population, who have been left with no family, no protection and no State. I would therefore like to call upon the High Representative for Foreign Affairs to examine actions intended to allow Haitian children up to the age of 10 to be taken in and looked after by European countries. Lady Ashton, Europe can take them in and offer them adequate living conditions; I mean for a limited period, until the conditions are adequate for them to return to their own country. All this could be organised, all this could be easy for the European countries, and it would be a fair way to respond to the need for solidarity, but also to avoid speculative and illegal actions being taken at the expense of children. We are talking about children, the most precious resource that we should protect in Haiti. David-Maria Sassoli,

Madam President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, our group is very worried by the situation in Yemen because there is a global threat there: the failed attempt to blow up a US aircraft, the threats directed towards foreign embassies and the intensification of attacks by al-Qaeda, the most recent being in Afghanistan, must be taken very seriously. Unfortunately, Yemen’s domestic situation does not help, and we should bear in mind the fact that it is one of the poorest countries in the world, with serious water shortages, high unemployment and an economy heavily dependent on revenue from oil and gas, which it is estimated will be exhausted within the next 10 years. I therefore believe action by the European Union is vital, in the shape of close collaboration between the European Commission, on humanitarian aid and development aspects, and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs, in relation to common security, collaboration with police forces and border control. I must also mention our concern over the clamp-down on representatives of the political opposition in that country, journalists and human rights defenders, which the humanitarian organisations operating in Yemen have been speaking about for a long time. Baroness Ashton, I therefore consider it a priority to ensure that humanitarian organisations can enter Yemeni territory and work in complete security. I also hope for an effort by the European Union to ensure that Yemen abides by the commitments made in 2006 at the international donors’ conference, namely to step up the process of political and economic reforms, to increase democracy and people’s living standards. Since the September 11 attack, we have realised that making at-risk areas secure depends on how much we are prepared to gamble on better living conditions. Baroness Ashton, democracy starts from here, from the ability to close the gaps between the rich countries and the poorest countries. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are preparing for the Copenhagen conference with a resolution showing our awareness that in order to tackle policies to combat climate change, it is necessary for all the geographical areas of the world to be involved. Also, it is the responsibility of the industrialised countries to establish with developing countries not only targets to be reached, but also the resources to be used to reach them. On this aspect, good work has been done in Parliament. The resolution sets out specific instruments and it is important that we have quantified the actions. The figure of EUR 30 billion proposed by us between now and 2020 can be viewed as an important figure, although it is a minimum, for supporting the initiatives of developing countries. Yesterday Mr De Boer, the United Nations negotiator, asked for USD 10 billion between now and 2012. After the choices made by the United States and China, it falls to Europe to take on new responsibilities and lead the fight against climate change. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to thank the Swedish Presidency for the work it has done and for having succeeded in putting in place the conditions for the final ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon. We sorely need the new treaty because it offers us the possibility of strengthening, of extending powers, for example, the powers of this Parliament, and of two new figures, who can represent political and institutional union. We therefore hope that the Council will be able to interpret the requests of the great European political families wisely, so that at the next meeting, an authoritative and strongly supported decision can be taken on the appointment of the persons called upon to occupy the new institutional positions envisaged by the treaty. What do we need? We need a President of the Council who is capable of guaranteeing consistency and continuity. We need a High Representative who, on the strength of his or her experience and authority, is capable of guaranteeing Europe a leading role in a multipolar world, and who, at the same time, will act as a link between the intergovernmental and the Community dimension of the Union. And then we also need a college of commissioners that is strong, united and balanced in terms of politics, geography and gender. It is particularly significant that this is happening 20 years after the fall of the Wall, the wall that divided Europe, and all this can rekindle hope in a united, strong Europe that will continue to drive the demands for solidarity and justice.

Mr President, in accordance with Rule 147 of the Rules of Procedure, I should like to remind you that, in the debate on human rights in the world in 2007, this House decided not to do as the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) proposed and make reference to persons who represent high civil or religious institutions for the purposes of strengthening political arguments. We therefore ask you to adopt the same measure with regard to the amendments to our resolution tabled by the PPE Group, which make explicit reference to the President of the Italian Republic, Giorgio Napolitano.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, every one of us is influenced by the circumstances in which we live, and you too will have been told before coming here to Brussels: ‘remember that you have a big responsibility, that we have a big responsibility’, that of making your country better. We know that our countries will be better if Europe is stronger and is able to respond with a sense of fairness to its citizens’ expectations. We are obviously aware that this is possible if we all act together; if we are able to pool our most precious resources, our Constitutions, that set of values and of legal rules, of rights, that are Europe’s true assets. So many controversies plague my country, but I would like straight away to reassure everyone that we are talking about a great democratic country, which has a great Constitution. Yesterday was a very important day for we Italians, because the Constitutional Court, faced with confusion and requests for impunity, reaffirmed a simple and time-honoured principle – that all citizens are equal before the law. However, we know that even great countries can go off course, can mix up public property with private interests. Nonetheless, we cannot allow the Member States to become weak. The right to independent information, without pressures or conditions on the part of government authorities, must be guaranteed, and this is a public good, a good for everyone, in every country. This good must be protected without hesitation by the Union. We must endeavour to provide common rules, to set limits beyond which information is no longer considered to be independent. There is an urgent need for the Union to intervene, to adopt a directive that lays down guidelines on pluralism and on the protection of a good that must be available to all. Mrs Reding, never forget that we are a Parliament and not a museum where things are left to moulder away. David-Maria Sassoli,

Thank you for your question, because it gives me the opportunity to explain myself. I did not have this opportunity in the time that was allocated to me. (The President asked the Members to allow the speaker to continue)
 As I was saying, I am glad you asked me the question because it gives me the opportunity to say that the directive that we are requesting from the Commission must be for all Member States. This is not an Italian issue: this is a European issue. I would also say that we want the question that we are to submit at Strasbourg to be amended. We want it to cover the debate on pluralism in Italy and in Europe. Thank you very much for your question. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Barrot, Mr Billström, ladies and gentlemen, we called for this debate to draw the EU’s attention to the grave violations of fundamental human rights taking place in Italy. Since May, over 1 000 migrants have been picked up at sea by the Italian authorities and handed over to Libya in the course of informal and indiscriminate refoulements without identifying the people, giving them the right to appeal or access to asylum procedures, with the danger that they will be subjected to inhumane and degrading treatment in Libya. As Commissioner Barrot confirmed when he asked Italy for details, we believe that these practices violate the fundamental principles which underpin Europe. This kind of action is compatible neither with the European Convention on Human Rights nor with Community law, particularly the Schengen Borders Code and the Repatriation Directive, nor with Italian law. Yesterday, the United Nations called on Italy to comply with international law and, also yesterday, 24 Somali and Eritrean refugees turned away by Italy lodged an appeal against Italy at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg for violating the European Convention on Human Rights. Moreover, ladies and gentlemen, illegal immigration in Italy has become a criminal offence, an aggravating circumstance. The mere fact of being a migrant entails discrimination and inequality, and gives rise to harsher punishments for the same crime. The fact of being an illegal migrant, as were the families of our Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Greek and Italian communities, blocks access to fundamental rights and to the most basic care, including health services, for fear of being reported. This is happening in Italy, Mr President, and has also been denounced by legal and constitutional experts and secular and Catholic associations. What does the Commission intend to do to end these violations? Parliament has always supported the fight against illegal immigration, but only in compliance with fundamental rights. We would like to know, Mr President, whether the Commission intends to take action on Italian legislation and examine the Italy-Libya agreement. Twenty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, we cannot allow certain governments to build new ones. David-Maria Sassoli  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, your speech today, Mr Barroso, has not changed our opinion. Our view remains strongly negative. Throughout the years of your presidency, the Commission has shown itself to be incapable and lacking in autonomy. This was the case for the financial crisis and the same holds true for immigration policy: the safeguarding of fundamental rights and compliance with Community law must represent two sides of the same policy. You said in this Chamber that you intend to appoint a commissioner for justice and rights and a commissioner for internal affairs and immigration. Do not do that, Mr Barroso: immigration and rights must stay together so as not to endorse xenophobic policies. You have a majority here in Parliament, a right-wing majority, and clearly we are unable to identify with this majority. I understand the difficulties of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and the Democrats for Europe but, Mr Verhofstadt, do not tell us that the coherent approach that you called for in order to emerge from the crisis consists of the speed with which the Barroso Commission will be formed. It is obvious that we cannot identify with this majority. Our positions cannot be reconciled with those who do not resolutely fight for full and steadfast freedom of information, with those who do not fight to safeguard rights, and with those who view Parliament as a mere forum to represent national governments.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we have recalled in this chamber, next December the United Nations agency responsible for communications technology and information will meet in Dubai for the ITU World Conference on International Telecommunications. The aim is to renegotiate the International Telecommunication Regulations (ITRs). We cannot forget – I am pleased at the words used by Commissioner Tajani – the work that has been done so far, which cannot be up for debate, nor can we allow the authority of the European Union to be bypassed by a supranational organisation such as the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), to which, as we know, hundreds of States around the world belong, many of which are renowned for having problems linked to democracy, transparency and freedom of expression. We are not mistaken therefore in thinking that the pillars of the internet – in other words, freedom, participation, openness and innovation – are under threat. I believe it is necessary to safeguard the role of the internet and, more importantly, the role that the internet can have in reviving economic growth, as well as guaranteeing opportunities for all. Therefore, I hope the Commission will endeavour to ensure that in Dubai, Europe presents a united front and speaks with one voice. There are many controversial proposals on the table for the World Conference on International Telecommunications, particularly those that propose changes to internet governance that call into question the neutrality of the internet, with negative repercussions for consumers. The freedom of the internet or, more specifically, the freedom of expression and data protection, are therefore at risk. What some States have proposed would entitle a government to monitor not only the communications of its citizens, but even the data exchanged over its networks. It is a very small step from here to the curtailment of freedom of expression and censure, therefore I believe it is contrary to the fundamental principles of the European Union.

 I welcome this regulation, which aims to establish a series of harmonised standards on the production of agricultural and forestry vehicles. It is an excellent legislative text, in which there is the proper balance between the need to guarantee a high level of safety on the road and at work and to protect the environment. Adapting to safety standards is not just an obligation; it is an absolute necessity. This regulation moves things in the right direction, since it covers every aspect of operational safety in tractors, both as regards their movement on the road and in the performance of agricultural work. The proposed regulation significantly simplifies current legislation on approvals, replacing 24 base directives and approximately another 35 amending directives. The regulation was needed in order finally to harmonise the market for the agricultural and construction machinery sector too. I am delighted that the proposed approval at European level for all categories of vehicle takes account of cost-benefit considerations, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises.

 I voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a directive on consular protection for citizens of the Union because I believe that citizens who are abroad but whose own country is not represented should receive assistance from the diplomatic services of all Member States. Not only that, but the level of protection should be equivalent to that guaranteed by the Member State in question for its own nationals. Facilitating cooperation between diplomatic services locally, coordinating emergencies, giving out information to citizens including on the websites of the Commission and the Member States, should be objectives that the European Union should soon be able to guarantee for its own citizens.

 I warmly welcome the excellent report on passenger rights in all transport modes, which provides for clear and accurate information, transparency in ticket prices, assurance in the event of airline bankruptcy, the creation of a centre for claims and an EU-wide free direct line. Particular attention is paid to the needs of persons with reduced mobility who may, at times, be forced to pay in cases where there are inadequate facilities, and to the development of intermodal transport. I am also pleased by the inclusion of the request that the Commission should address the proliferation of unfair clauses in air carrier contracts, such as the unfair requirement that passengers must use both parts of a return air ticket in order. When the rights of passengers using coach/bus transport, dating from 2011 and not yet entered into force, are adopted, the European Union will have an integrated set of fundamental passenger rights in all transport modes. Even though the Commission takes the view that it is too soon, at this stage, to provide a single regulation covering passengers in all transport modes, I hope that Parliament’s requests will be heard by the Commission, since unfortunately we still see cases in which the rights of European travellers are inadequate.

 I voted in favour of the Sehnalová report on the establishment of the security system known as eCall, as I believe it is an excellent means of preventing road accidents and more. Thanks to this system, it will also be possible from now on to reduce the congestion caused by accidents, thus preventing more accidents from occurring. I regret the delays and the lack of progress in the voluntary deployment of eCall to date and I hope that all parties involved will act simultaneously in order to establish this service. I also believe there must be coordinated awareness-raising campaigns concerning the eCall system and its benefits for European citizens, with the aim of increasing both the understanding of, and the demand for, the service.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs who worked with me to draft this important recommendation, the secretariat of the Committee on Transport and Tourism and the secretariat of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament. After almost two years of lengthy and difficult negotiations with the shadow rapporteurs, the Council and the Commission, Parliament has managed to make considerable progress, in particular, by guaranteeing greater competition between rail operators, oversight by a strong, independent national regulatory body that ensures fair competition, the requirement, for the first time, to handle complaints within a set time ranging from six to a maximum of 16 weeks, the creation of a European network of national regulatory bodies and a rendezvous clause for the establishment of a European regulatory body. Moreover, the new rules – which should also lay a solid foundation for the financing of infrastructure thanks to contracts of a minimum of five years – and the agreement that we secured to strengthen the current rules and to create a single European railway area should offer all railway undertakings fair access to a wider range of services, such as maintenance and station services, including ticket sales, in addition to providing equal access to the rail network. In particular, with regard to the regulatory body, a key element of the railway recast, the new rules lay down more stringent requirements for the appointment of its staff and in order to guarantee its full independence: cooling-on and cooling-off periods and a declaration of interest that the regulatory body’s members must submit. The recast also provides for the regulatory body to make recommendations to licensing and safety authorities to prevent, for example, safety rules being used to limit access to the market. The recast will extend the regulatory bodies’ powers to ancillary rail services and to overseeing the separation of accounts. It will be made clear that regulatory bodies must review both the draft and final versions of network statements, which are an essential instrument to ensure that all the operators are aware of the market access conditions. Furthermore, in addition to acting in a limited timeframe in the event of a complaint, regulatory bodies will be able to intervene with regard to the introduction of mark-ups on the direct costs of infrastructure managers, control the criteria for the introduction of booking charges and regularly consult railway users. Thanks to Parliament’s involvement, we have also managed to obtain a network of regulatory bodies: the content of the information will be exchanged in a clear manner and will be guaranteed by the Commission, which will be required to evaluate how efficiently the regulatory bodies are cooperating with the new network and to propose supplementary measures to ensure a more integrated oversight of the European rail market, with the hope that in the future, a European regulatory body can be established. With regard to financing infrastructure, the multiannual contractual agreement no longer has a minimum duration of three years but five, and there is a provision requiring Member States to make good the deficit in the infrastructure manager’s accounts every five years at the most. A requirement has also been included … (The speaker interrupted her speech
) In order to have a single rail market, we need to provide non-discriminatory access to the market. Therefore, even if the separation requirements for service facilities have not been imposed on all kinds of infrastructure, the opening up of the services market is far-reaching, with an extensive list of essential services and non-discriminatory access to infrastructure and services. A ‘use it or lease it’ clause has also been included for services that have not been used for at least two years instead of three. With regard to charges, in particular, noise charges, we have reached a compromise that is optional for Member States – although it will be mandatory to comply with the applicable EU rules – that envisages a bonus system to facilitate the retrofitting of trains. As for the European Train Control System (ETCS), a compulsory system is planned for all Member States that must be implemented on European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) lines: the introduction of a bonus-malus system for trains equipped with ETCS systems in accordance with common criteria set out by the Commission. The differentiation of charges will be completely revenue neutral for the infrastructure manager. Despite my firm belief that there needs to be separation between infrastructure managers and railway undertakings, we have reached a good compromise on separation that provides for transparency of financial flows between infrastructure managers and railway undertakings in integrated companies, as well as a rendezvous clause for the presentation of a legislative proposal on separation and on the opening of the domestic passenger market by the end of 2012. I would like to remind Members that tomorrow, during the vote, amendments could be tabled. Should any of these amendments that are not part of this document receive majority support and be accepted by Parliament, the document would end up in conciliation. This would delay further still the opening of the debate on the fourth railway package. I therefore appeal to my fellow Members to understand the importance of adopting the railway recast tomorrow, so that we may then continue to work on the fourth railway package.

 I congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Ţicău, on her work. Certainly, the installation and use of a tachograph, if used correctly, can be an excellent tool to improve road safety and the working conditions of hauliers, while at the same time satisfying their legitimate needs for privacy. To protect drivers, more stringent rules on driving times and rest times are, of course, necessary. I therefore welcome the new rules that aim to improve tachograph functions, such as the use of wireless communications for roadside checks in order to lower the number of vehicles stopped, as well as the provisions on the training of control officers. With a view to ensuring road safety in the European Union at all possible levels, it is of prime importance to affirm a clear and full principle of co-responsibility, and I therefore consider positive the compromise obtained by the rapporteur whereby the parties concerned must carry out regular checks in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(4) of Regulation (EC) No 561/2006. With regard to the installation of tachographs in all vehicles which are not exempted, I would ask that we bear in mind that the obligations arising from compliance with the procedure must not overwhelm small and medium-sized enterprises with financial burdens and red tape.

 The recasting of Directive 2006/54/EC on the implementation of the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation has led to changes in the sector, but much remains to be done to reduce the gender pay gap. That is why I voted for the report on equal pay for male and female workers for equal work or work of equal value. I believe it is right for the European Commission to put pressure on the national governments to adopt measures aimed at reducing the gender gap and also to provide for sanctions in cases of infringements of the principle of equal pay.

 All consumers are susceptible to becoming vulnerable over the course of their lives, whether as a result of endogenous causes inherent in the person and the person’s cultural, psychological and physical situation, or due to exogenous causes inherent in the objective difficulty of accessing information. Hence, there is a need for greater special protection for vulnerable consumers that takes their individual requirements into account. Disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility require particular attention, especially as regards transport, and passengers’ rights must be improved by ensuring that information and fares are transparent when a ticket is purchased.

 Today’s vote on the progress made by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia takes into account the difficult challenges that the country has faced. Even if much remains to be done, I am pleased with the progress achieved in the social sphere and in the fight against corruption, when you consider that the country has moved up 40 places in the Transparency International anti-corruption index over the last five years. However, the recent serious episodes of violence are a matter for concern, and are the worst since 2001 when the country was on the brink of civil war between the Albanian Muslim minority and the Macedonian Orthodox Christian majority. In accordance with the 2011 progress report, I deplore the risk that the forms of power sharing could institutionalise the ethnic minorities and transform the country into a two-nation state, putting democratic principles at risk. I hope that the freedoms and fundamental rights established under the rule of law will be respected. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of piracy is not a new one here, and was dealt with by this Parliament in the 2009 resolution. Everyone is aware of the events involving two Italian soldiers, who were arrested for causing the death of two Indian fishermen. In this regard, I welcome the assurances of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Baroness Ashton, who has said she has been monitoring the case closely in order to bring it to a positive conclusion, and that the incident should be put, to quote her words, ‘into the broader context of international cooperation on counter-piracy and, more specifically, on the issue of regulating the protection aboard ships’. However, the episode forces us to reflect on the fact that the phenomenon of piracy in the Indian Ocean or off the Somali coastline is still an extremely serious problem. As part of its defence and security policy, the EU launched the Atalanta mission in December 2008 and, in the last few days, its extension to 2014 was approved, but the number of ships involved has fallen dramatically, from 35 in 2009 to 10 in 2011. As we know, the EU intends to exercise greater coordination over the naval forces and military personnel on board civilian ships belonging to Member States patrolling the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean. Do we therefore feel that it is useful to establish common rules of engagement? Generally speaking, what other coordinated initiatives does the EU plan to adopt to protect merchant ships from attacks by pirates? In addition, what measures does it intend to take against third countries that fail to safeguard merchant ships crossing between the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean?

 I voted in favour of Mr Schmidt’s annual tax report, which calls on the Commission to make proposals that will contribute to European competitiveness by eliminating distortions of competition which arise from the various taxation systems still in place. In terms of cross-border issues, the differences in the tax ‘excises’ on a number of products, such as fuel, drinks and cigarettes, can easily create cross-border competition distortions. The current economic and financial crisis has led to a significant rise in public debt in Europe, the reduction of which requires both expenditure restraint and tax increases, as well as streamlining of tax systems. Accordingly, we need to adopt measures that can make the national tax systems more favourable to common growth, ensuring that tax differences do not give business in one country an undue advantage over competitors in other countries.

The White Paper on Transport aims to improve the quality of transport in Europe. Mobility plays a key role in the internal market as it is a prerequisite for development and economic growth. While, on the one hand, the challenge is to develop sustainable transport, on the other, we must aim to build an efficient intermodal transportation network. Much remains to be done to ensure that the transport system is truly competitive in all areas and there are many issues and difficulties, especially in the road transport sector, which, in some countries, is one of the cornerstones of production and the economy. In this regard, I would like to see the creation of an authority responsible for road transport, which would be able to promote the harmonisation of Member States in this regard: for example, with respect to environmental sustainability, safety, training and professional certification, and which would supervise the process of liberalisation and resolve the challenges of the sector, in a manner similar to what is to be done in the railway sector.

 I voted in favour of the report on modernising customs because I think we need to simplify customs legislation in order to improve and influence competitiveness. Customs play an essential role in ensuring efficient safety checks and contributing, above all, to the fight against fraud. This, however, requires efficient IT systems so as to ensure product safety and to block the sale of less safe products. However, I did vote against the parts referring to non-preferential origin of goods, not because I do not support the principle, but because I think the reference to the definition of the product origin should not be in this report, which aims to establish criteria for improving customs competitiveness.

 I have voted in favour of this report which seeks to lay the groundwork for future debate on the reform proposal that the Commission is due to present in December, and that aims to simplify the process of working abroad for doctors, engineers, dentists and other professionals. If, on the one hand, professional qualifications should be recognised quickly by other Member States, on the other hand, the reliability and safety of their services should not be compromised. To this end, one notes that the professional qualifications of tour guides could cease to be recognised as, following the revision of Directive 2005/36/EC, their profession would be confused with that of travel couriers or tour representatives who would be able to conduct guided tours in all 27 Member States.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before beginning with a brief description of my report, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs who worked with me on the revision of the railway recast. I would particularly like to thank Mr Kuhn, Mr Tremosa i Balcells, Mr Zīle, Mr Cramer and Ms Wils. I would also like to thank the Chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Brian Simpson, the parliamentary group coordinators and all of my colleagues for the extensive debate we have had on a report that was particularly complex but also, I believe, important for the implementation of the railway system. It is a recast of the first railway package, which has not been correctly applied since its entry into force, and, in fact, 13 infringement procedures against Member States relating to implementation of the first railway package are currently under way. The objective of the railway recast is to achieve a single European railway market. It is an ambitious objective because the rail system is the most outdated transport system, which has not managed to catch up with other modes of transport. For example, the average percentage for rail freight in European countries is stationary at around 6-7%, while only 11-12% of passengers travel by rail. Therefore, it is clear that rules need to be harmonised, and that new systems and new elements need to be added and strengthened to ensure that railways can develop properly, particularly where they cross borders, which is the most problematic part for European integration. The creation of a single European market is therefore necessary, just as it was for the air transport sector. The creation of a single market will mean that citizens can use trains that can run throughout Europe, with better fares and a service on a par with that of other modes of transport. Currently, few trains can travel outside national borders. Now the aim is that they can compete with each other throughout the whole of Europe, something which – as I have said – is not the case today. The objectives which the first railway package attempted to deliver are therefore the aim of this recast and of all the measures for unification of the rail system that will follow. This means that, starting with the railway recast, some rules need to be revised. One of the most important points that we have discussed at length, and which I believe is also the key product of the railway recast, is the provision of a national regulatory body, a network of national regulatory bodies with clear responsibilities, a strong national regulatory body with resources like the energy regulator, which could – as many hope – allow us to have a single European regulatory body in the future. We have tried to provide clear rules for transparency and separation of the accounts of the infrastructure manager and the services manager, by prohibiting cross transfers between the network and the services manager as happens in the case of many holding companies, for example. We have tried to maintain the separation of accounts that has been in force since 1991, according to which public funds for infrastructures must be used solely to improve infrastructure and not to finance the business of transport companies, also because these subsidies prevent fair competition between all the service operators. As rapporteur I would have liked the railway package to be more ambitious. I would also have liked there to be a total separation between infrastructure and service operators. However, we have been given a commitment by the Commission that this will be put in place by 31 December 2012. Other important provisions concern ease of access to infrastructures, which is essential in order to guarantee that all new operators can use network services, and in addition to total separation, the Commission has made a commitment to present a proposal for national market liberalisation by 31 December 2012. We have also included benefits for operators that introduce significant technological innovations to reduce environmental impact, and we have included the possibility of an improvement in the sector by allowing 7-year instead of 5-year strategic plans as previously. Finally, we wanted to guarantee compliance with laws governing employment rights and safety in the workplace, and to maintain the right to strike. Debora Serracchiani,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is true, as my colleagues who have already spoken have said, that this proposal for a directive has been a very complex task, involving 724 amendments leading to 18 compromise texts. These compromise texts include Article 7, mentioned by the Commissioner, in which Parliament invites the Commission to make a proposal for national market separation and liberalisation by 31 December 2012. None of the proposals are in any way premature – instead, there is a clear invitation with an equally clear and precise direction. If this direction had been present from the start, it would probably have helped with the management of this extremely long railway recast. In the meantime, my assistant has had a baby, so this really has been a long and complicated gestation period, but I am sure that we understand the importance of expanding the railway system. We have said that we need a competitive railway system. In that case, we need to have rules. We do not necessarily need many rules, but they have to be clear, and to be complied with by everyone. We know that there is a problem of free competition on the railway market, particularly with regard to freight transport. The ambition of the railway recast is to create the single European market. Therefore, we are issuing a strong invitation to the Commission to make a clear proposal before the end of next year and, given that next year is so close, we propose that work should begin so that Parliament can fulfil its own legislative role, also because the text very recently issued by the Council is extremely cautious, including with regard to the proposals. Therefore, we hope that Parliament will give us a clear and full mandate to carry out a complete negotiation process that will truly open up the single European market to all the expectations to which – I am picking up on the shout of pain from Mr Cancian – we must provide a response.

I voted in favour of the report by Mr Kósa, which highlighted the physical and social obstacles that unfortunately still exist in many Member States and that restrict the lives of 80 million disabled people living all over Europe. To date, however, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has not yet been ratified by all the EU countries. Out of 27 Member States, 11 still have to sign, and even where ratified, implementation is still deficient precisely in accessibility to spaces and buildings. According to the EU 2020 strategy, one of the most important objectives is to increase the rate of employment. This requires removing all the barriers that hinder the access of disabled people to the labour market and developing national policies in line with the European Commission’s European Disability Strategy, including simple access to public and private transport. Social inclusion and employment must also play a bigger part in strategies and in European funding. Finally, I agree with the rapporteur on the need for a European mobility card for reciprocal recognition of care for people with disabilities, which would guarantee travel on any means of transport for all.

I voted in favour of the report on road safety by Mr Koch because I think that this issue has an important role to play considering that around 55% of fatal accidents happen on rural roads, 36% in urban areas and 6% on motorways. Over the last three years, road accidents in the capital cities of the European Union have caused an average of 1 845 deaths each year. Many of these victims are pedestrians, cyclists, elderly people and children. In order to reduce the number of deaths caused by road accidents, common and harmonised restrictive measures are needed across Europe, including the creation of safe road-traffic infrastructure, respect for driving and rest periods, and the establishment of safe parking areas for lorry drivers which are in line with the minimum social standards. I support the creation of the office of the European road safety coordinator by 2014, with particular responsibility for opening an investigation on the effectiveness of road safety policies in large and medium-sized urban areas and on the necessary elements for once again making travel safe for all citizens.

 I would like to thank Mr Fidanza for his constructive work. Tourism has enormous potential for achieving certain important EU objectives, such as sustainable development, economic growth and employment, as well as socio-economic cohesion. In recent years, growth in employment in the tourism industry has been considerably higher than in other areas. Indeed, the EU tourism sector generates more than 4% of GDP, with around 2 million businesses providing work for approximately 4% of the total workforce: around 8 million jobs. Therefore there is a clear need to support the sector, including by improving training and recognition of professional qualifications. At European level, the Union must put in place an integrated strategy with clear, high-level objectives, with effective, targeted measures that promote innovation and improve the quality of tourist services, providing, for example, ever greater accessibility for persons with reduced mobility. I support the creation of a European quality label and the idea of diversifying tourism through the promotion of culture, history and religion, and I would stress the importance of promoting tourism by giving due importance to Europeans who have spread European culture beyond this continent.

 In recent years, many businesses have been encouraged to invest in Libya. The serious instability and the political and institutional crisis that has affected several countries in North Africa, especially Egypt, Libya and Tunisia, have forced many European businesses to abandon Libya, leaving behind moneys owed to them, equipment, and so on. Council Regulation (EU) No 204/2011 of 2 March 2011 concerning restrictive measures in view of the situation in Libya, establishes that funds may only be used for humanitarian purposes and not to pay monies owed or damages suffered by businesses/companies that had been operating in Libya. As a result many European enterprises, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, are struggling to collect monies owed for the provision of goods and services in Libya. While on the one hand Europe must guarantee support to the Libyan people and contribute to the country’s reconstruction, on the other I believe that it must ensure that European companies do not suffer serious, irreversible damage due to a loss of liquidity resulting from uncollected moneys, and therefore it must guarantee their survival.

 Madam President, the new Hungarian constitution limits the possibility of intervention by supervisory bodies such as the constitutional court, and increases the powers of the executive, thereby bringing into question the normal system of checks and balances. Social rights have been negated, the state only providing subsidies to the needy if they agree to do community work. Finally, the right to self-defence has been sanctioned and weapons may be kept in the home even without a licence. The right to abortion has been banned and highly discriminatory laws against homosexuals have been introduced. All of this goes against Directive 2000/78/EC, which establishes a general framework for the fight against discrimination. I therefore ask the Commissioner what action she intends to take, in view of the fact that the fundamental rights in the new Hungarian constitution are hardly compatible with those of the European Union and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.

I thank the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, for his excellent report, which fits in with the recent debate on the implementation of the Schengen Agreement. The existence of effective controls along our external borders must be an important factor inasmuch as the security of the Schengen area depends on the efficiency with which each Member State controls its external borders. Although some problems remain unresolved, Romania and Bulgaria have proved to be sufficiently prepared to apply all the requirements of the Schengen acquis. We have discussed at length the practical efficacy of the state machinery of these two countries, as well as their levels of corruption; nevertheless, I believe that the application of Schengen should leave this out of consideration, given that – just as happened with the other Member States – it is sufficient to base a decision only on the efficiency of border controls and the preparation of police forces. Adding further requirements would create a precedent of discrimination which has not existed before, not even after the great enlargement in 2007. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 The arrival of streams of immigrants to Lampedusa in recent days shows that the immigration crisis is an ongoing issue that requires immediate action. We clearly need improved governance within the Schengen area, as established by the Commission Communication of 4 May. To this end, the solidarity mechanims must be strengthened in terms of redistribution of asylum seekers, organised mobility and new partnerships with third countries. Revising the mechanisms for applying the Schengen acquis
 must not be seen as an excuse to limit at will the right to free movement, but rather as a stimulus for new opportunities. I hope that concrete proposals will be made very soon to combat prejudice and discrimination, to combat lawlessness and to promote human rights, human dignity and peace. Governing immigration effectively and encouraging peaceful coexistence must be the daily commitment of a good policy that aims to promote development and security. Returning the massive flows of people to their countries of origin does not help maintain the distance between Europeans and immigrants. If anything, it risks increasing illegality, insecurity and economic costs. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 The nuclear accident at the Fukushima power station has caused an enormous disaster, with the radioactive contamination also affecting many people who were in the vicinity of the power station and who suffered injuries. Many hospitals are refusing to admit and treat them due to the risk of contamination. Although the Japanese Prime Minister has announced that the Fukushima power station will be decommissioned, the situation remains unresolved: the cooling system for one of the reactors is out of use and a considerable amount of radioactivity is being released into the environment. In the light of this, it is important to ensure that all the necessary humanitarian and financial aid is provided and to lay down international safety rules that are as reliable as possible, in order to prevent other disasters like that in Japan in the future. For this reason, I voted against the resolution, because it omitted the amendments calling upon the Member States to draw up possible strategies for abandoning nuclear power and immediately to inform regional and local cross-border authorities of their national programmes if their implementation could have a cross-border effect.

 Following the earthquake on 11 March, the consequences of the crisis in Japan for nuclear safety and the global economy have shaken the European Union, which is already grappling with instability in North Africa. I welcome the decisions taken at the special meeting of energy ministers, held in order to examine the implications of the accident at the plant in Fukushima, and trust in the determination of Member States to carry out stress testing of nuclear power plants in the European Union to be extended to non-European countries, and especially neighbouring countries. In this context, and giving due importance to the nuclear moratorium decision taken by some Member States, and the fact that public consultations on energy development are imminent, it is important that the Commission should report on the safety situation in European nuclear power plants that could affect neighbouring regions of Member States if an incident occurred.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the resolution on Turkey because the constitutional reform that took place 12 September last was unanimously recognised as an important step forward made by Turkey in relation to Europe. Naturally, there are still many more steps to be taken and in this vein, I would express my concern over the numerous arrests of journalists. I would like to underline that Turkey is the seventh largest commercial partner of the European Union, that the European Union is Turkey’s main commercial partner, and that trade – which has been carried out correctly for centuries – has favoured interpenetration and the peaceful acquaintance of one people with another. I therefore applaud the notable progress made in terms of getting started on connections between the European Union and Turkey, in particular, through the motorways of the sea that cross the northern Adriatic and the northern Tyrrhenian seas, which now see a flow of more than 250 000 truckloads per year in both directions, together with an important heavy-goods railway freight link from ports to destinations within Europe. In this way, it was possible to get rid of a significant amount of heavy goods vehicles on the road and I hope that this continues. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the reports on equality between women and men and female poverty in Europe and I am delighted that this has been debated on the very day that we celebrate the hundredth anniversary of International Women’s Day. Notwithstanding Directive 2002/73/EC on equal treatment between men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training, promotion and working conditions, further efforts still need to be made to achieve proper transposition. Suffice it to say that, although the level of female education has increased significantly in recent years and the number of female graduates is now higher than that of male graduates, women remain concentrated in traditionally female sectors and are frequently paid less and occupy fewer positions of responsibility in all spheres of society. The lack of access to support services for their dependents, such as children, the disabled and the elderly, to adequate leave schemes and to flexible working arrangements, all impede women from working. I would like to close by remembering the women of the world who are fighting for the most basic of rights and I would like this House to express its solidarity with the Iranian feminist associations that are today taking to the streets, inviting women to demonstrate without the hijab

 We hope that Croatia makes fast progress in the negotiations for EU membership. Speeding up Croatia’s accession is crucial if one considers its strategic geopolitical position as a gateway to markets in Central Europe. Hence the need for an integrated development of ports and connections to the European corridors, especially in view of the fact that Croatia will enjoy a significant flow of EU funding, of which 60% will be allocated to infrastructure. For this to happen, Croatia should continue to adopt the necessary reforms. In particular, it should strengthen public administration and the judiciary, fight corruption and ensure full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. I welcome the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Croatia on the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction. I am disappointed about the situation of the Croatian shipbuilding industry, a sector that was once the pearl of Yugoslav industrial exports, but which is now in almost total ruin. I hope that the Croatian Government is able conclude the restructuring process as soon as possible so that it can also close the chapter on competition. In particular, I emphasise the importance of the accession of Croatia in relation to the integrated maritime policy in the Adriatic, which will soon officially be an almost completely European sea.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, should like to thank Mr Cancian for his efforts in obtaining this difficult compromise. Thanks to this regulation, bus and coach passengers can enjoy rights similar to those of passengers on other modes of transport, such as trains and boats. The regulation, which applies to all national and international services wherever the distance to be covered is equal to or greater than 250 km, also protects passengers using regular services over shorter distances. I am referring, in particular, to disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility, who have been guaranteed non-discriminatory access to transport, the right to compensation in the event of loss of or damage to wheelchairs, as well as training on disabilities for bus and coach employees. I am also delighted that an agreement has been reached on compensation for death, including reasonable funeral expenses, or personal injury, and loss of or damage to luggage due to accidents. I also consider it a positive step that passengers can choose between continuing the journey at no additional cost or reimbursement of the ticket price in case of cancellation, a delay of more than two hours, or overbooking. In terms of information for passengers, I think it would have been useful to provide them with information on connections with other means of transport, thereby also ensuring dialogue between bus and rail passenger transport services. Lastly, I am very pleased that during negotiations, we managed to research and guarantee the maximum level of assistance for disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility, giving them the option of being accompanied at no extra cost.

Today’s vote on the EU-Libya Framework Agreement is the result of some tough negotiations, particularly on the issue of migrants. In Libya, the situation regarding human rights for refugees and asylum seekers is extremely dangerous. They have no legal recognition and there is no system in place to protect them. I hope that their fundamental human rights will be safeguarded, along with their right to asylum. Libya has not ratified the Geneva Convention of 28 July 1951 or the Protocol of 1967 relating to the Status of Refugees, and at the moment, does not intend to do so. However, in 1981, it did ratify the 1969 Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa. It is therefore bound to comply with the principle of non-refoulement of migrants requiring international protection, who must be identified in accordance with criteria that are no less strict than those established by the Geneva Convention itself. Under international law, people from countries such as Somalia, Sudan, Eritrea and Ethiopia have the right to humanitarian protection and political asylum, and I hope that the Libyan authorities will agree to cooperate with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

 We should not be shy or reticent about the European Union’s duty to uphold the freedom to profess one’s religion. In view of the undeniable exacerbation of violence against Christians in various parts of the world, the EU urgently needs to take a clear stance against any violation of the right to the freedom to profess one’s religious faith. The subject of religious freedom must be integrated in European policies, not least by including a binding clause on respect for religious freedom in our agreements with other countries. These principles are Europe’s banner, and we cannot make exceptions to them under any circumstances. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

When we speak about trafficking in human beings, we must think about not only sexual exploitation, forced labour and illegal adoptions, but also the problem of trafficking in organs, which is becoming an increasingly widespread crime. The European legal structure is not effective enough and the European Union and Member States must do more. We need an established structure for coordination between the institutions and the agencies of the EU, as well as those of the Member States and international partners. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, to date, access to employment has been regulated only for a few specific categories of third-country nationals. Indeed, not everyone benefits from the general principle of equality of treatment in access to employment. As a result, the European Union must take steps to guarantee equal treatment both for third-country nationals legally residing in a Member State and for those who qualify for refugee status or who require international protection, pursuant to Council Directive 2004/83 of 29 April 2004. We need to prevent a growth in demand, for example, for seasonal workers, just because they can be paid less and because they have different – lower – costs with respect to European citizens employed to do the same job. We must also avoid, for example, the risk of many multinational companies transferring their headquarters to countries such as Morocco or Turkey and sending their employees to work in European branches because it is cheaper. For reasons of social justice, we must ensure that European citizens are treated equally in terms of remuneration, working conditions and social security. For this reason, I believe that it is right to include seasonal workers, posted workers, refugees and self-employed workers in this directive. It would be extremely dangerous to make distinctions.

The latest violent events linked to the dispute between Morocco and the Polisario Front over the Western Sahara require greater attention due to the negative effects they could have on stability in the region. The clearing of the camp at Laâyoune seems to have resulted in about a dozen deaths, more than 700 wounded, 150 missing and 160 arrested by the Moroccan authorities and is believed to have led to the killing of a Spanish citizen of Sahrawi origins, Baby Hamday Buyema. We must not leave the Sahrawi people all alone, but we need to finish off the negotiations conducted under the aegis of the United Nations, in accordance with the principles of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, particularly Article 2. The European Union must intervene and urge the Moroccan Government to avoid further bloodshed and release those Sahrawi who have been detained illegally. The resumption of informal talks between the parties, which took place on 7 and 8 November 2010, must represent the first sign that a fair solution can been peacefully accepted by the parties.

I would like to express my satisfaction over the importance attributed to matters concerning civil law, such as the legislative proposal on reinforced cooperation in the divorce law sector and the recognition and creation of official public documents on inheritance. I am particularly pleased to see the emphasis placed on the need to introduce specific actions and programmes to promote an effective European judicial culture, based on the supply of training measures, to be held under Erasmus schemes for judges and all legal operators. The actions identified in the plan are very important for improving the guarantees of European citizens in respect of the law, but it is necessary to adopt a more strategic and less fragmentary approach based on the real needs of citizens and enterprises in the exercising of their rights. While, on the one hand, we must consider the difficulties of legislating in a harmonised manner within an area of shared responsibility, on the other, we need to extend EU regulations in the sector of justice and internal affairs. In this way, the parameters of legal certainty will be increasingly clear and supported and we will pave the way for a genuinely common legal theory and practice with a European Union.

 As the exchange of data between the European Union and the United States is increasingly necessary and frequent in the context of the fight against terrorism and organised crime, a general and common legal framework must also be drawn up to protect personal data. This framework must provide for protection equivalent to that enjoyed by European citizens within the Union. The Commission’s negotiating mandate is therefore heading in the right direction. With regard to the sphere of application, this legal framework must also apply to existing bilateral agreements. I hope that the Council adopts the mandate as presented and that Parliament is kept fully and promptly informed of all developments in the negotiations, bearing in mind that Parliament will have the final word on the future agreement.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Mrs Meissner for her report on integrated maritime policy, and I agree with her on the need to strengthen maritime transport and the shipbuilding industry, to safeguard coastal regions and to promote innovation and research activities. Today, maritime transport plays a fundamental role in trade. As a result, we must encourage cooperation between small and large ports that face one another in the same sea basin and which can facilitate more fluid trade. Furthermore, in order to ensure intermodality, we must invest in port and dry port infrastructure, especially in ports that can be connected via European corridors. Lastly, I believe it is important not to overlook another issue, namely port security. All the measures relating to safety within all European ports must be harmonised so as to better protect maritime transport and prevent unfair competition from harming those ports which actually have to incur greater expense in order to guarantee a higher level of safety.

I voted in favour on the indication of the country of origin of certain products imported from third countries. With this vote I wished to emphasise the European Parliament’s commitment to promoting European industry, the competitiveness of which must today be safeguarded and supported. Furthermore, the right for European citizens to know the origin of the products they buy will be guaranteed. However, I do not believe that excluding specialised and recognised production sectors with a long history and tradition, such as the optical industry, is in keeping with EU policy.

 I welcome the proposal for a directive, which represents a decisive step forward in relation to the directive currently in force. Once transposed nationally, regionally and locally, it will appreciably improve payment, particularly by public authorities, to companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, which will be able to count on having a more secure cash flow. In many countries in Europe, when the public authorities are in a difficult situation, they are known to generally pay late and very often cause some companies to go bankrupt. A glaring example is Italy where, by the end of 2009, the public authorities were in debt to companies to the tune of approximately EUR 60 billion, and the payment delay averaged 186 days, with extremes of 800 days. One need only think of the amounts owed to the hotels that took in the survivors of the severe earthquake that hit the Abruzzo region in April 2009. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of this resolution because I believe it is necessary at EU level to have a specific European strategy for the development of mountain and island regions: a strategy that takes account of aspects such as promoting the economy and structures, employment policy, the protection of natural resources, civil defence, and environmental and energy policy. The principle of territorial cohesion is one of the European Union’s key objectives introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon with the aim of reducing regional disparities and removing natural or geographical obstacles. Concrete actions and specific development strategies are needed to do this. It is necessary to create equal opportunities between these regions and the rest of the European Union. One such opportunity might be to promote sustainable tourism in the mountain regions, thus creating an important subsistence base for the inhabitants of these areas. Also, that very Madrid declaration by European ministers on 15 April 2010 stresses a more effective coordination of the measures implemented with regard to tourism policy, and on promotion aimed at more innovative, sustainable and social tourism in Europe.

Unfortunately, due to the constant increase in air traffic, the number of victims of civil aviation accidents has increased notably. Suffice it to say that in 2005, there were 1 454, an increase of some 90% compared to 2004. We therefore need new legislation which reduces discrepancies in the investigation abilities of the Member States and which creates a ‘network’ between the various national investigation authorities, with the aim of rationalising skills, personnel and resources. Therefore, I am in favour of this proposal for a regulation which, on the one hand, will ensure the absolute independence of investigations into accidents and, on the other, will oblige airline companies to guarantee the rights of victims and their relatives in the event of an accident.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the completion of the internal market in postal services by the end of this year is an important step, but the Commission should carry out an impact assessment – as some of the previous speakers pointed out – on the postal market liberalisation in order to better understand citizens’ requirements. Indeed, how does the Commission intend to safeguard the rights of European citizens who live in hard-to-reach areas, such as mountain or rural areas, so that they may receive post regularly, and what instruments does the Commission intend to adopt to ensure this occurs? Moreover, I do not think that we should use this directive, which already exists, to justify social dumping. It is the Member States which must apply the directive and which possess all the means to do so. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 I voted against the agreement reached at second reading by Parliament with the Council on the draft directive on the use of animals in scientific experiments. I am not saying ‘No’ to the advance of research but I am calling for a reduction in animal suffering, since the revised directive proposes some practices that go against that aim, such as the possibility of experimenting more than once on the same animal. Moreover, I believe the use of other satisfactory scientific methods that do not require the use of animals should be developed further. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 The legal framework on same-sex couples within the European Union is very diverse and radical differences exist between different Member States. Episodes of discrimination against same-sex couples occur virtually on a daily basis, hence the need to ensure respect for Directives 2000/43/EC and 2000/78/EC on combating discrimination based on religion, disability and sexual orientation. The European Union must make more effort to guarantee same-sex couples the same rights granted to heterosexual couples when they move to another Member State in the European Union to study or work, by virtue of the directive on the free movement of European citizens.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal on the rights of passengers travelling by bus and coach aims to aid and protect passengers, in particular, persons with disabilities or reduced mobility. It is the first regulation on the rights of bus and coach passengers and should form a guarantee for such passengers, as in the rail and air transport sectors. The position at second reading aims to establish a series of rights for passengers deciding to travel by bus or coach. I agree with the argument of the rapporteur, Mr Cancian, whom I thank for the excellent work accomplished and I believe that the scope of application of the regulation must be amended, excluding regional services when they are integrated with urban and suburban services. It would be fair and proper to guarantee the rights of passengers in case of accidents, cancellations or delayed departures, as was decided at Parliament’s first reading. Equally important is the question of information on passengers’ rights. Indeed, it would be useful to supply passengers with information on connections with other modes of transport, thereby also ensuring dialogue between bus and rail passenger transport services. Regarding persons with disabilities or reduced mobility, it is necessary to guarantee maximum protection and I would propose a 24-hour advance notice period for requesting assistance as opposed to 48 hours. I would also propose greater guarantees for compensation for and replacement of mobility equipment for people with disabilities in case of loss or damage. Furthermore, bearing in mind the needs of passengers with reduced mobility, all architectural barriers ought to be removed and existing infrastructure improved to render them accessible. This regulation aims to improve the competitiveness of the bus and coach sector and facilitate connections between modes of transport but, above all, it aims to improve the travel conditions of passengers.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteur, Mr Sterckx, who has done excellent work on this report which deals with how to increase free movement in the maritime sector, for shipping within the European Union. I agree with Mr Sterckx on the aim of this directive, which is to exempt all intra-European maritime goods transport from unnecessary administrative formalities. Indeed, in order to have a maritime transport space without barriers, it is not only important for the various competent authorities to work together well, but also for the various simplification systems to be implemented in parallel. This is in order to ensure the effective operation of the European maritime transport space without barriers, to make maritime goods transport more attractive, and to ensure it is used to the optimum extent. Harmonisation of administrative procedures between the Member States will ensure the smoother running of maritime traffic between the various EU ports and will revive maritime goods transport, which today represents only 10% of the total. Maritime transport is, at present, still hampered by the administrative formalities imposed on it. Electronic systems should therefore come into operation as quickly as possible in order to allow a faster data exchange system. Furthermore, interoperability is important for genuine simplification of administration. In fact, sending information by e-mail does no good and is of no use if the information systems are not technically interoperable. With regards to language, I believe that the use of a common language would certainly benefit European maritime transport. This would enable communication to take place more smoothly, and thus cause less confusion and fewer administrative delays. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 The report on the future of transport aims to support and develop an efficient and sustainable transport system in Europe. In order for this to come about, it is necessary that the internal transport market is fully completed and that all obstacles resulting from the late, or lack of, transposition of EU legislation in the Member States are removed. A transport fund will also be necessary in order to guarantee financing of the trans-European transport network projects and the systems to support the network. The TEN-T projects are a priority for transport policy, but the problem of missing infrastructure must be removed, as well as the geographical and historical obstacles of cross-border routes. Lastly, the issue of road safety – among other things – is one of the key points upon which the transport policy should be based in future. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 The development of an efficient and sustainable European transport system requires the revitalisation of rail freight, by means of coordinated action between Member States and cooperation between railway infrastructure managers to develop intermodality, market opening and the management of freight and passenger traffic. The proposal for a regulation aims to improve the rail freight service by means of a procedure for identifying the European corridors that must ensure a high-quality freight service. Freight corridor 5 has already been drafted at ministerial level in 2006, according to the Baltic-Adriatic corridor, pan-European corridor VI and Priority Project 23. It is therefore right to proceed with the commitments we have undertaken and pursue our established objectives; a point returned to several times during the TEN-T conference in Zaragoza.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteur for his excellent work on the European Union membership of the Human Rights Convention, which benefits European citizens: due to this convention, there will be a new court, external to the European Union, to ensure that the rights of European citizens are always respected by the European Union and Member States. Under the principle of democracy, the European Union and its Member States should always have the right to be able to defend themselves. I therefore believe it is crucial that every nation belonging to the convention should have a judge to explain the context of every appeal, just as I think it important that the European Parliament should have an informal body to coordinate information exchanges between Parliament and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council, and that Parliament should also be consulted during the negotiation process. I would also like to add that European citizens have the right to understand the mechanisms governing this membership, just as they have the right to know what their rights are. Therefore, I believe it is essential for the Council of Europe and the European Union to consider establishing guidelines, with a clear explanation of all the effects and implications that membership will entail.

 The affair of the Icelandic volcano and its current consequences lead us to reflect that the European Union must not be unprepared for an emergency or unexpected occurrences, but must protect passengers above all else using existing or new management instruments or measures.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr Leichtfried for his excellent work on the report on aviation security charges, which considers, among its various aspects, one important point: consumer protection and passengers’ rights. There have to be clear and transparent rules because, if airlines charge passengers extra for security measures, this information should be made available, in my view, to ensure that passengers are not out of pocket. I believe that it is only right that consumer protection organisations should take part in the consultations and thus gain an insight into the pricing of security measures, which they can then check against the ticket price. Only in this way will it be possible to guarantee greater transparency and information for passengers. Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the recent rail accident in Brussels, which many Members have mentioned, the spotlight has once again been on the safety of the railways. Directive 2004/49/EC on safety of the railways in general stipulates that railway undertakings and infrastructure managers should bear the full responsibility for the safety of the system, each for their own part. In the specific case of the accident that occurred in Belgium, human error seems to have been the cause. We shall, of course, await the investigations. It would appear, however, that the train was not fitted with an automatic braking system. Is the Commission aware of which networks and which trains within the Member States are not fitted with this safety device? Moreover, does it intend to draft a legislative proposal so as to ensure that the Union’s entire network is fitted with this system? Debora Serracchiani  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Croatia’s membership of the European Union accentuates the gelling of a European identity that is able to express the common values of our new Europe while incorporating, rather than glossing over, the individualities of its many occupants. The Republic of Croatia has made appreciable efforts to come up to the required standards, particularly in combating organised crime through new anti-mafia measures, but it needs to make further efforts, particularly in the judicial field, before the 2010 negotiations can conclude. The institutions of the Republic of Croatia can make further steps forward to come into line with the requirements of the first protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights, signed in Paris in 1952, by considering the return of nationalised assets to their rightful owners.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is committed to combating all forms of terrorism. When we speak of tackling terrorist offences, we need to ensure that fundamental rights are fully upheld and that the measures adopted to fight terrorism are suitable and effective. The rights of defence and fundamental procedural safeguards must therefore be fully complied with by the EU institutions, including when they draw up lists of individuals and bodies, in this case linked to al-Qaeda, that are subject to restrictive measures. It is equally essential that these measures are subject to proper democratic and parliamentary scrutiny, as rightly required by the Treaty of Lisbon. It is therefore clear, as also affirmed by Parliament’s legal service, that each measure of this kind must follow the ordinary legislative procedure, enabling the representatives of Europe’s citizens to fully perform their roles as legislators and guarantors.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur of one of the dossiers on Europol, I can only reassert what has already been said by the Members who have spoken before me. Thanks to its role in the collection, analysis and exchange of information, Europol facilitates investigations in Member States and has thus become an important tool in the fight against crime. We need to be more effective in tackling crime, but at the same time, we must resolutely assert the authority of this Parliament. The Council has decided that it will, in any case, adopt the texts of the Europol package on 30 November, without waiting for Parliament to obtain the power of codecision on this matter with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December. The aim of rejecting the proposals is not to stand in the way of Europol assuming its new role as a European body, but to have the powers of this Parliament, the European Parliament, extended, especially on important matters relating to freedom, security and justice. Finally, I think that it is right to give Parliament greater powers of scrutiny over Europol’s activities in order to check that the handling of data held by Europol does not undermine the rights of European citizens.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am aware that, on 30 September, the Commission presented a study on the indicators of media pluralism in the Member States. However, in 2008, this House adopted a report by Marianne Mikko in which the European Commission and the Member States were asked to safeguard, and I quote verbatim, ‘the multiplicity of opinions in the media, to guarantee the pluralism of information, to ensure that all EU citizens can access free and diversified media’. Even earlier, in 2004, Parliament adopted a report by Mrs Boogerd-Quaak on the risks of violation, in the EU, of freedom of expression and information. In this report, the Commission was asked to submit a communication on the safeguarding of media pluralism in all the Member States. To date, the Commission has still not given clear responses to Parliament’s requests. You will notice, Commissioner, that I have mentioned neither my country nor its Prime Minister. However, I, as a European citizen, am asking you in this House what the Commission intends to do at European level to ensure that media pluralism is guaranteed in all the Member States.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the motion under debate today sees the full implementation of the agreement that the budgetary authorities concluded in December on the 2012 portion of financing for the ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) research project. The ITER project, which involves the European Union as well as major countries such as Japan, the United States and China, requires a further EUR 650 million in appropriations and therefore the expenditure ceiling set out in Heading 1a of the financial perspectives needs to be revised by the same amount. Through this motion we therefore give the green light to this EUR 650 million increase in commitment appropriations. The agreement on which this important aspect of the 2012 budget is based has been a crucial aspect of these budget negotiations. In fact I would say that it has been a fundamental condition for the 2012 budget conciliation to reach a positive outcome and for the negotiations to conclude. It has allowed us to substantially increase the funds in 2012 for important programmes such as Lifelong Learning, Competitiveness and Innovation, the Seventh Research Programme, and especially for allowing us to fund ITER using transfers as little as possible. That was very important, representing a positive outcome that allowed this House to approve the agreement. ITER is therefore added to the 2012 budget without any negative impact on the implementation of other programmes and without becoming a burden on other programmes; that is a very significant fact. Furthermore, this agreement and this motion marks the real beginning of the sensitive matter of implementing the 2012 budget. Even through we focus all our attention on the negotiations for concluding the draft budget, there is then the important step of putting it into action, which starts with this step and will see us take particular care over the sensitive matter of payments. My hope is that, during the implementation of the 2012 budget, we will be able to re-locate the hitherto excellent spirit of cooperation between the Commission and Parliament in particular, which was crucial for finalising the budget and will be even more important for supporting its implementation.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank all my fellow Members for their substantial support for the report we are discussing today. I would like to emphasise that, predictably, during the debate we quite naturally looked into the substance of the ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) project. However I want to point out that today we are really giving life to the agreement signed in December, which enabled us to wind up the negotiations over the 2012 budget. We are therefore implementing an agreement reached in conciliation, which not only saw us finalise the budget conciliation but saw us finalise it in the best way possible, in view of all the negotiations we carried out last year, so that this important instrument is funded using transfers as little as possible. This is truly an important achievement, because we will not harm the other programmes financed out of the budget. To me, that seems to be the outcome that we should prize most highly. Above all, it gives me particular pleasure to point out that the conciliation process was the final step in negotiations that we managed to conduct with enormous cooperation and collaboration. Long may it continue. Francesca Balzani,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 18 November, Parliament and the Council reached a common position on the budget three days ahead of the conciliation deadline. This is a good sign: at a time of great uncertainty and difficulty, it means that the European institutions want to look to the future first; it is also a decision to shoulder their responsibilities. From the start, Parliament has put the EU 2020 strategy, the major crisis-prevention strategy for future growth and wellbeing, at the centre of the budget. Drafting a budget is no easy task for anyone today, not even for Europe, but Parliament made a choice, which was fully accepted during the conciliation. Thus, we have more resources for growth, research, employment, lifelong learning, immigration policies and international policies in Europe. Payments, however, fared badly in the conciliation. They fared badly, which is nothing new. Indeed, it is unfortunately the case that there is strong disagreement – clear and ongoing disagreement – over the issue of payments between Parliament and the Commission on one side, and the Council on the other. Disagreement that will have to be solved, that will have to be overcome, because this is a situation that we clearly cannot tolerate any longer. Unfortunately, however, conciliation is not the ideal forum in which to open discussions, in which to open conciliations, because – and the experience of the past year has clearly taught us this – opening major discussions in the strict and rigorous confines of the conciliation procedure is liable to simply jeopardise the forthcoming budget. The Commission’s faultless projections of funding requirements – and I want to emphasise this point – the Commission’s extremely authoritative and reliable projections, which Parliament endorsed, are thus rendered useless. I hope that this can be resolved. It is clear, in my view, that we will not find a permanent solution to this problem until the European budget is equipped with its own resources. However, what we, as Parliament, certainly can do – in line with the commitment to intervene promptly should payment needs increase during the year, which we signed and attached to the budget – what we certainly can and must do is to strive to ensure that this commitment is honoured and, above all, to work together to ensure that this commitment is not a victim, in terms of its form and schedule, of the next budgetary conciliation, because what we must do – and this is the decision that we made with ITER, that we made this year on the subject of payments – is to refrain from opening conciliations within the conciliation procedure. I should like to thank everyone: all my fellow Members who made an enthusiastic contribution to the drafting of this budget; the Polish Presidency, which played an important role and provided impetus; and especially the Commission, Commissioner Lewandowski, who maintained an exceptional balance throughout the entire delicate conciliation procedure. Then there are the policy advisors from our groups, and finally our assistants, who worked long into the night on this task. Francesca Balzani,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we live in a time of crisis – not only economic crisis but also a crisis of confidence. This crisis of confidence affects all citizens, but especially the youngest, who as a result find it harder to summon the courage and desire to build their own futures. The European Union has set a challenge to tackle this crisis, which is also a challenge for the EU itself: the great Europe 2020 strategy must genuinely combat this lack of confidence and help us back onto the path towards a better future and a better life. That is precisely why Parliament has put funding for this strategy at the heart of the budget for 2012, starting with its very top priority: higher employment, better employment and quality employment in a Europe that focuses on innovation and research. Hence, we in this Parliament have asked and are asking for greater resources for three key programmes, which are the true engines behind the 2020 strategy: the Lifelong Learning Programme, the Seventh Framework Programme and the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP). Today, therefore, what we need is consistency, to follow up on our intentions, to send out a positive message and hence start really building this future. Not funding a strategy to combat the crisis because we are in a crisis would be a gloomy message that would be hard to justify. Right now, our citizens are expecting us to act consistently and with sincerity. However, they are not the only ones watching us: this year the markets are also particularly attentive to our decisions and our ability to take the necessary decisions – in the right ways and in the right timeframes – in order to get back on track. Sending out positive messages is therefore a particularly sensitive issue. In this respect, it would not only be great to produce a budget that makes a genuine start on putting the 2020 strategy in place, but it would also be really important for us to do so in an atmosphere of major institutional collaboration. Parliament decided to place huge trust in the estimates of the Commission precisely in order to send out a positive message. The Commission is undoubtedly working as well as is feasible at this difficult time, which is why Parliament deemed its estimates on payment requirements to be reliable. There is another emergency: the institutional frameworks of many Mediterranean countries are currently undergoing change. Europe cannot remain removed from this process; we cannot stand in the wings but instead we must take a central role in international politics. We therefore need to react to the crisis and assume renewed leadership on the international stage. We request the use of the Flexibility Instrument for these two fundamental objectives. It will therefore be important to overcome these two challenges, instil confidence, prove our credibility and prove our reliability to citizens and the other institutions that are watching us. That is not all though, for I believe that this year there is yet another real challenge ahead: doing it in a transparent way. Indeed, our budget reading is not tactical or a negotiating tool: it is exactly the budget that this Parliament believes is essential for 2012, because I think this year it is also important to find a common position quickly and in good time, in order to communicate the essence, the ability and the image of a Europe that knows how to galvanise itself at the right time.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank all my fellow Members, as well as Mr Lewandowski and Mr Dominik, for this very interesting debate, which has seen a very important issue come to the fore. There is real unity in Parliament on this budget reading and I think this is due to something that has perhaps rarely been seen: Parliament has not limited itself to asking, but has also proposed painful cuts. As a number of my fellow Members have pointed out: on Heading 4 alone – one of the most difficult – Parliament has taken on the responsibility of making almost EUR 90 million of cuts. The motion has therefore been drawn up through effort and hard work, and – I would stress –not to fund Parliament’s priorities but to fund the Union’s priorities, because the Europe 2020 strategy is not a priority for Parliament but rather a priority for the Union. Today we are here to fund it, asking to invoke the Flexibility Instrument for EUR 240 million. We are talking about a total budget of EUR 150 billion, within the financial perspective of 2006, set up before the 2008 crisis, before the Europe 2020 strategy and even before the Treaty of Lisbon came into force. Here, today, we are asking to invoke the Flexibility Instrument for EUR 240 million, to start to fund the EU’s priorities, which we have put on the table as a way to fight the crisis. I therefore hope that our shared vision of the priorities that you have mentioned on a number of occasions, Mr Dominik, can reach its zenith in the conciliation procedure. It is difficult to talk about priorities if you do not want to take that extremely important step of turning written priorities into priorities that are realised, true, real and tangible. The year 2020 is almost upon us: we cannot wait for a new Financial Framework to start funding it and, as many fellow Members have said, it is not only citizens that are waiting to see what we do but also the markets. Therefore, I really hope that in the conciliation procedure we, as a budgetary authority, can find the unity that Parliament has found and I hope we can do so quickly. Francesca Balzani,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I simply have a technical amendment that is required in order to start the vote. In lines 05 04 05 02 and 05 08 06, the amendments BUDG1207 and BUDG1206, as recorded in the meeting reports, do not include the amendments to the amounts. These should be incorporated and adopted so as to correct the amounts in the draft budget. In relation to Amendment 1207, that means an additional EUR 2.5 million and EUR 3 million in commitment and payment appropriations, respectively, for line 05 04 05 02. In relation to Amendment 1206, that means an additional EUR 1 million in commitment and payment appropriations for line 05 08 06. However, the notes that follow particular agency budget lines must be adapted to make them consistent with the definitive amounts decided upon. Francesca Balzani,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the institutions involved in the budget procedure, namely the Commission, the Council and Parliament, described their position in the Council’s reading in July – the Council and Commission with figures, Parliament with a definition of its priorities. These positions are apparently very different, and often far removed from each other – I am thinking in particular of payments and research funding – but there are also points of convergence, and we must concentrate our efforts on these areas of agreement if we are to reach a common position. Parliament has an extremely difficult task, as it must also look to the future and play a proactive role. This is the most challenging area for elected institutions: they must operate with their feet firmly in the present, and hence be acutely aware of the tough times we are experiencing, the consolidation being carried out by Member States and the sacrifices being demanded of our fellow citizens, while always working to ensure investment, economic recovery and a more prosperous future. This year especially, the budget should strike a delicate balance between opposing desires: to maintain the stability of the present, but also to continue to look forward and start laying the foundations for the future straight away. This Parliament will make strong calls for funding for the 2020 strategy, starting with the creation of quality employment, but there are also new areas of responsibility, some of which are sensitive: I am thinking of the new responsibilities granted to us by the Treaty of Lisbon, and of the European Securities and Markets Authority. Then we have the level of payments, which should be correct from the outset, from the time of budget approval, and also undeniable emergencies such as migratory pressures and the situation in North Africa. Consequently, with regard to the documents on priorities, on which we have already voted, we will continue, in a consistent and transparent manner, to develop and create instruments that will enable us to implement our policies.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with the mandate for the trialogue the budget procedure entered its most concrete phase, the phase in which the budgetary authorities actually enter into discussions which may produce useful and significant results. This is why, above all, I hope that this trialogue is an opportunity that will be taken, an opportunity not to be missed. We embarked on the budget procedure in a spirit of great realism. The Member States are currently implementing tough national budgetary consolidation policies, and these policies have to find an important balance between the need to tackle the crisis and the need to relaunch the economy and investment. This is precisely why at this time the European Union budget, which has a great and unique ability to give added value to expenditure, investment and resources, can and absolutely must play a fundamental role. A fundamental role in which it is crucial that the Europe 2020 strategy should be taken as a starting point. This Parliament has made the Europe 2020 strategy a central issue of the budgetary discussions right from the start. The 2012 budget can and must be the first step in taking concrete measures towards this strategy, which is the tool that has been chosen precisely for the relaunch of our Union. In this sense, giving a financial dimension to the Europe 2020 strategy brings into play and gives a central role to our consistency and credibility. We cannot build such an ambitious strategy without implementing it immediately, precisely at a time when it is crucial that this tool for relaunching the economy be made to fully deploy its effects. Consistency, credibility and the ambitious Europe 2020 strategy therefore also become decisive and fundamental in guaranteeing the stability we need today within the European Union, as well as with regard to our single currency. There are also other facts and policies that are coming to the fore. I am thinking of democratic processes in the Mediterranean area and the need to guarantee an external dimension to the European Union, which at this time can truly play a role and resume an important position of leadership for itself. Let us not forget that the budget is not just an instrument to be approved when there has to be a forecast for the following year. It is also a tool that has to function throughout the course of the year. In this sense it is an issue requiring delicate handling not only with regard to the payments for the following year, but also with regard to implementation of the 2011 budget for the current year. Consistency, credibility and strong, decisive, single-minded use of the budget as a fundamental instrument for fighting the crisis and compensating for Member States’ consolidation policies – these are all issues that require a serious commitment on our part, that must truly ensure we once again play a crucial role in the security of the European Union, and above all – and this is my major concern – that invite us not to waste the opportunity of the trialogue. The trialogue can and must truly be a valuable opportunity for a concrete and useful exchange, which this year will bring us to a shared vision of the budgetary choices we need to make. I find that sharing choices when working on a document as important as the budget is another excellent sign of our ability to work within the Union, which is particularly important at this time.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that this very interesting debate, which follows on from the one we had in the special committees, shows that there is a great consensus in this Parliament as regards the fundamental strategies. Among the many others, the most important point is the budget, which is undoubtedly the only and most important tool for constructing the delicate balance between consolidation of the public accounts and the need to support growth. It is the only real bastion we have against the risk that consolidation might depress the European economy in a severe and irreversible way. The budget is therefore a focal tool. The European Parliament is not asking for a generally ambitious budget, but for an instrument that is strong on all the priorities that are today clear and easy to see. In the Europe 2020 strategy, the priority is first and foremost investment in work. Here in the Chamber today we have again mentioned research, development, social cohesion and energy, all priorities for which the budget is the most important indicator of the seriousness of our intentions. The seriousness of our intentions implies our strong institutional credibility. Today this focal budget is therefore a very important element among many, because we have once again drawn attention to the fact that it then becomes a driving force for transforming our commitments into reality, which is no small thing. The budget therefore becomes an important element for restoring stability to the European Union, and also to our single currency. Therefore, I hope that already in this trialogue this strong sense of responsibility that we all share, and it could not have been otherwise, will open the way to calm, responsible and constructive negotiations for the future of our Union. Francesca Balzani,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the document we are examining today is not merely a report on the priorities of the next European budget, but also and above all a strategic document looking at the new role that the European budget must play in the context of greater economic governance. This is the first year of the European Semester, which has been designed precisely to establish the greatest possible coordination between the Union’s budget and those of the Member States, the greatest possible synergy and the utmost complementarity. All of which essentially means one thing: convergence, and making the budgets of the Member States converge with the major goals of the European budget. Today, these objectives – these European objectives – can only be those laid down in the Europe 2020 Strategy: a grand, ambitious strategy with five highly important targets and seven big flagship initiatives. These are big, important goals, but they are also very specific. The first target is extremely important and involves building a more fully, better employed Europe by making the right investments. We therefore have a huge priority for the 2012 budget: we must not waste time in executing the 2020 Strategy, beginning with the first of the targets, that of higher employment in Europe. Immediately setting out the dimension of the 2020 Strategy in our budget is therefore essential and a matter of urgency. Two things are fundamental in order to achieve this: we must plan and we must look to the future. Planning means ruling out mathematical approaches to the budget, which are absolutely senseless. Mathematical, general and indiscriminate increases are of no use at all. Instead we must look at what exactly are the programmes and the actions that can contribute to the 2020 Strategy. Looking to the future has an absolutely crucial significance: taking the utmost care over our commitments and not simply over our payments, because commitments are the tool with which to build the sustainable financial future of our Union. Flexibility is another important subject. We are at the end of the planning period and so the budget is particularly rigid. I therefore think that it is really important that, right from the start, we consider all the available flexibility instruments as fundamental and indispensable for the budget we are going to draw up if we want it to be not only possible or essential to take the first step towards the 2020 Strategy – which absolutely must not be a failure, as we have seen in the past – but also if we want it to be a useful and effective budget. I am convinced that it will only be possible to reach all these major objectives if we work together patiently, right from the very start, to build a renewed climate of institutional cooperation. Institutional cooperation is one of the major challenges of the Treaty of Lisbon, which we always talk about rather carelessly. Institutional collaboration means really finding a renewed feeling of equality so as to work together on this sensitive issue, the budget, which is not only one of the most strategically important instruments to build our future, but also one of the most tangible and practical. Francesca Balzani,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the word ‘responsibility’ has been mentioned a number of times during the speeches. There is, however, one responsibility that I really think takes priority for the institutions: above all we are responsible for implementing our programmes and ensuring that EU citizens are not left with just our words. We have the responsibility to be consistent in what we say and what we promise. Today’s major projects are those set out in the 2020 Strategy. The first target of ‘more work’ is not only very ambitious but also very precise, since it can even be measured using unemployment reduction parameters. This seems to me to be a very specific and very ambitious goal and I think it is essential to start working to achieve it. As long as we continue to consider the 2020 Strategy as too big and too ambitious to be squeezed into a practical document like the budget, I think we will achieve nothing more than increasing the risk of another failure, which is exactly what nobody wants, starting with the Commission, if I remember the first communication on the 2020 Strategy correctly. There is, however, another important issue: austerity is not a policy, it is not an instrument, it is a condition against which we must take action, and not only by consolidating our expenditure, but also by using the European budget, an extraordinary instrument that is radically different from the national budgets and gives us the chance to do something different this year. This is precisely what the European Semester is for. Clogging up the first six months of the year is not its only use. It enables us to come up with a global strategy and to create synergies; and creating synergies between the budgets of the Member States and our budget is an extraordinarily European system to give more value to public resources and to create a real method to turn the 2020 Strategy – long and ambitious as it is – into a European reality. Francesca Balzani,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament has been called upon to express its opinion on two agreements that have been signed with the United States and with 11 Latin American countries, which will draw a line under a long and difficult affair. This affair has witnessed the European Union challenged at the World Trade Organisation, and more importantly has witnessed it as the losing party. It is a thorny issue, as the disputes relate to the principle of non-discrimination in international trade, which Europe has been accused of breaching in the way in which banana imports are organised within the Union. This is because we have a two-track system in that we apply one system to African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries and a different system to other countries. This system allowed ACP countries to bring this product to the European market without paying any import duty, unlike other countries, which have to pay a duty of EUR 176 per tonne. This agreement therefore brings the situation back into balance and most importantly allows ACP countries, which are in a fragile state of development, to export their products to the EU duty-free. At the same time, the other countries that have signed the agreements will be able to export bananas to the EU subject to the payment of import duties, which however will be gradually reduced over the period 2011–2017 from the current rate of EUR 176 per tonne to EUR 114 per tonne. However, as well as finally bringing the EU back into line with its commitments as a member of the World Trade Organisation and therefore in some ways restoring its credibility, including as an institution, the most important aspect is that these agreements make allowances for ACP countries in a vulnerable state of development, as they provide for instruments to give them financial support. These instruments will allow those countries to invest in diversifying their production and will therefore hopefully strengthen their economies. At present, these measures, worth EUR 190 million, are to be provided until 2013. I believe that these agreements are a positive step, not only because they draw a line under disputes in which the EU has been the losing party, with the ensuing consequences in economic and disciplinary terms and in terms of its institutional credibility as I already mentioned, but also because they lead to a balanced solution that respects the needs both of these ACP countries and of European producers in the outermost regions, who certainly cannot be abandoned to unbridled competition. I therefore propose that Parliament should approve these agreements, whilst asking the Council and Commission for firm commitments. In the first instance, they should provide, as quickly as possible, for an evaluation of the impact that these agreements will have between now and 2020 – quite a long timescale, therefore – on ACP countries and on European producers in the outermost regions, whose economies are closely tied to bananas. Secondly, Parliament should ask for a firm commitment to evaluating the effects of the financial accompanying measures earmarked for the ACP countries eighteen months before they are due to end. This would ensure that those countries could receive further assistance and support measures if necessary, so that they are not left to go it alone and are supported in combating, counteracting and mitigating to some degree any negative consequences that the entry into force of these agreements may have within the European Union due to the price adjustments and hence to changes in the competitiveness of bananas from other countries. I therefore believe that by resolving a tricky issue this agreement definitely provides a way out that also takes into consideration the needs of those weaker countries which, as I have already said, have always been our main concern, including during the long debate we had in the Committee on International Trade. I hope they will find strong support and a favourable solution in these accompanying measures, in particular in terms of monitoring and the commitment, which Parliament is asking of the Commission and Council, to look at the impacts of the agreement and the effects of the aid measures, and to extend and increase them if necessary in the future. Francesca Balzani,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think this debate has been very interesting and has partly restated some of the anxieties and issues which we have already looked at in the Committee on International Trade. I should like to re-emphasise an important fact that I think we lose sight of every now and then. These agreements represent the implementation of a specific commitment made by the European Union, in its role as a member of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). We must not forget this. Through these agreements, the EU is undertaking to resolve a serious problem with important countries, which it is having to sort out because it has breached the principle of non-discrimination. These are therefore agreements that restore our credibility and proper position as members of the WTO. This agreement follows on therefore from disputes and tensions, amid a climate that will certainly have been damaging for other areas of our relationships. As a definitive settlement agreement it is trying and succeeding to create a new balance, with particular attention, as we have said and have also stated in the resolution, to countries in fragile states of development. The accompanying measures will now certainly be monitored, and to my mind this is the most important point. It is important to have established the accompanying measures, but it will be even more important to have the evaluations of their impact and to have the commitment, which I am delighted to have heard today from the Council and the Commission, to keep constant track of the situation as it develops and above all the willingness to assist with further measures if they should prove to be necessary. POSEI (Programme of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity) itself has been incorporated into the resolution as a sensitive point that must be monitored due to the delicate balance between the financial contributions made under POSEI and the new situation regarding the outermost regions. Therefore the impact of the agreements on the outermost EU regions where bananas are produced will also be monitored and watched carefully. The Council also mentioned the need to work on transparency in the agri-food chain, which I am happy about, as it is an important point. We have been talking about producers the whole time, but there is also the major issue of banana distribution within the EU. There are many things that must be done going forward, therefore. We need to monitor the effects of the agreements, the implementation of the accompanying measures and the suitability of POSEI to protect Europe’s producers. We also need to use other instruments such as transparency in the agri-food chain and hence widen the scope of examination to take in the distribution chain as well, which has a major impact on the final cost of the fruit. We need to look at consumer protection, which is something that deserves our attention as much as all the other interests involved in this business. However, all these things, not least consumer protection, must start with the current situation and establishing the outcome of these disputes in which the EU has had to make concessions to the United States and the Latin American countries. I hope therefore that these agreements will be adopted, because I believe they form an essential basis for making the instruments linked to the delicate balance of the banana market work and can guarantee clear practices that will benefit other interests also, such as consumer protection, which is linked to transparency in the agri-food chain. These will in turn bring improvements to the banana market and to our European producers, which are impossible without a sound basis such as that provided by finalising these disputes within the WTO, to which the European Union belongs.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the amending budget we are discussing today and will be voting on in the coming days is an important document. It marks the last step for implementation of the European financial stabilisation mechanism, which was sorely needed in May to calm the severe storm that hit the euro and, therefore, the EU. One certainty came out of that storm: there are no individual Member State problems any more, because the individual problems inevitably become the problems of them all, and so a common response is required. Europe has found the courage and the strength to provide this common response that we are, in fact, discussing here today. This new budget line marks a clear boundary. It is the first step towards a new common approach to the financial policies and also, in the future, to the economic policies of Member States with regard to the European budget. It is the first step towards that integrated semester in which the budget decisions of the individual Member States and the EU budget will be compared more closely. The budget is therefore once again an instrument – which has always been the fundamental implementation of EU policies – that is taking centre stage and proving to be a fundamental vehicle for building Europe after the Treaty of Lisbon as well. Above all, it draws our attention to the importance of sound and responsible management of public resources as a prerequisite for real development and for a future of real European growth.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union and Turkey have strong trade links. The customs union has made it possible for the volume of trade between the European Union and Turkey to reach the significant figure of EUR 100 billion per year. Above all, the geopolitical position of Turkey makes it an important link between the Mediterranean area, the Middle East, Asia, and the Caucasus and Black Sea regions. Turkey is also a country which is at odds with Europe in that it has completely different demographic dynamics, is a young country, and one which first tackled the crisis and the challenging reforms which these dynamics required. So it is a complementary country because it is different to the European Union from many points of view and therefore there is a great degree of reciprocal potential: it is this that we must concentrate on. We must be careful not to waste this potential, but turn it into fruitful investments. It is true that the European Union is an important trading partner, but Turkey is looking ever more to Russia, Africa and the Middle East. Also, the customs union still does not apply to public procurement or services and there are still major obstacles to international trade. We must therefore work to remove the obstacles to this potential – and I believe the report that we are discussing today, and upon which we will vote in the next few days, is moving in this direction – because there are areas in which we must really make this potential grow: energy, the environment, services networks and infrastructure. This report therefore represents an important step and I think the work of Mr Kazak should be supported and I would like to thank him for it. Francesca Balzani,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the mandate for the trilogue is an important action, especially this year, because the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the single reading require as much clarity and as much cooperation as possible between the budgetary institutions from the outset. This budget is going ahead, developing and taking shape at a difficult time. The margins available for commitment appropriations amount to EUR 1 200 000 000 – and so are very narrow – but the matter is made even more sensitive by the fact that 70% of the appropriations come under Heading 2, the heading that covers policies for agriculture, conservation and natural resource management, and hence the fight against climate change. The budget is also difficult because of the many open procedures that will largely determine the quantities of resources that will actually be available. Such procedures include the budget review, financial regulation and the Interinstitutional Agreement, implementation of the External Action Service, but above all the meltdown and the instability of financial markets. The very meltdown that endangered the euro also demonstrated that the budget and resources are crucial to any European response, thus illustrating their importance, but also their limitations. Under these circumstances, the European Parliament must draw a line, and establish which of the priorities should have the highest profile in its main accounting document. As a group, we have chosen to tread a fine line between the need to uphold the purpose of this mandate, and the need not to debase its political meaning. Our central priority is therefore not to repeat our past mistakes, and this means we must guarantee appropriate resources for achieving the objectives of the 2020 strategy, but also keep enough resources for actions under Heading 2, particularly actions that help tackle unemployment. It is also important, however, to ensure that the fight against climate change remains central. There are therefore many challenges to be faced. We also recognised one challenge as central at the beginning of the mandate: the need to make a real effort to coordinate and restore consistency between our European budget and the budgets of individual Member States, because the consistency and coordination of the economic policies of the Union and its States are fundamental values for the future of the Union. Francesca Balzani,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the 2011 budget guidelines are the first step towards the next European budget, a very definite step. In the Committee on Budgets, we have made a great effort to establish the main identifiable priorities that highlight European action. The first priority is young people, not only because they are the resource on which to focus for innovation, research and development, but also because they are the basic starting point for farsighted social policies. However, the 2020 strategy is also a main priority: tackling unemployment, climate change and, above all, the need to genuinely and practically implement this new strategy for the future, allocating sufficient resources to it, without compromises and without cuts. However, these guidelines are also a very realistic first step. There is much less leeway in the financial perspective and this means that there are insufficient resources to carry out what is most important: new actions. This is particularly sensitive with regard to the first heading, the heading on competitiveness, growth and employment. There is, however, another important issue: the budget also needs to be highly flexible and to be able to respond quickly to citizens’ needs, to people’s needs and to changing needs. So there are priorities, but there are also essential conditions in order for the budget to really be a useful instrument to help Europe grow. These include sufficient resources, clear-cut implementation of future strategies, above all, the 2020 strategy, and lastly a definitive solution for a flexible instrument that – alone – can enable us to face future challenges. Francesca Balzani  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when we reach the end of a budgetary procedure and it is possible to assess the work carried out as a whole, I think that we need to ask a very frank, straightforward question: is this a useful budget? This budget is a transitional budget, one marking a shift towards the Europe of Lisbon, a shift within the major economic and financial crisis which has affected the entire world. This budget is therefore awkward in two respects. It needs to respond to the crisis, but reflect awareness that during a crisis, the resources available are scanty. It needs to make a positive contribution to economic recovery, but also cut, reduce and contain spending where possible. This budget will make EUR 141 billion available for next year. That is not much more than was available in 2009, but huge efforts have been made, a great deal of work has been done on the priorities and on channelling the available resources to the current priorities. The focus is on two budget lines: competitiveness and the environment. Competitiveness, because it contains social policies, employment policies and the delicate challenge represented by the Structural Funds, which still constitute the cornerstone of redistributive policies within Europe. This budget line will be allocated about EUR 65 billion for next year. The environment too, which encompasses agricultural policy, will be allocated approximately EUR 60 billion. This 2010 budget, however, relates, above all, to the economic recovery plan. This plan attracted strong support last year, but it was not fully financed in 2009. Today, thanks to significant efforts to redeploy resources, EUR 2.5 billion can at last be invested in energy infrastructure and broadband. Substantial efforts have also been made, however, to shape this budget in accordance with the Lisbon strategy, to provide even more resources than those provided by the Commission in the draft budget for the Erasmus programme, for lifelong learning, because there is a question which we must ask ourselves honestly, namely, whether this is a useful budget, but, first and foremost we have a fundamental yardstick: the usefulness of the budget must be tailored to Europe’s citizens. It must be a useful budget for every constituent citizen of Europe, and it is on the basis of this usefulness, tailored to the people, that I believe we must initiate and continue a sensitive debate on the review of the margins of availability and the resources that we wish to give to Europe for its policies. Francesca Balzani,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is precisely on the budget that Parliament can and should bring to bear all of its power as an institution directly elected by the citizens, in order to ensure that this vital instrument for growth, and also for fairness and justice, is fully able to meet citizens’ needs. The budget must have the ability to be tangible and dynamic, to listen and to respond. We have worked towards making the 2010 draft budget as flexible as possible at this time of particular economic and financial crisis. However, the budget must also be credible, feasible and tangible, and in this regard, it was fundamental to avoid making financial resources for the coming years too inflexible by restricting excessive spending beyond the maximum expenditure ceiling contained in the perspectives of the multiannual financial framework just to cases that really are an absolute priority. This is the case with the Recovery Plan. Again with the same aim, namely establishing a budget truly able to meet citizens’ needs, we have formulated specific amendments regarding payments in order to free up the maximum amount of resources possible with immediate effect. The European budget is structured on two tracks: commitments and payments. The commitments represent serious political intentions, but also real, concrete actions. Therefore, payments have been increased to EUR 127 billion in line with the draft budget tabled by the Committee on Budgets, compared with EUR 120 billion proposed by the Council and EUR 122 billion proposed by the Commission. Still with the same aim, with the same political approach, as a group we are strongly opposed to the creation of reserves, which are not genuine resources immediately available to citizens. The policy of establishing reserves at times of crisis should be reduced to the absolute minimum, to cases in which a reserve really is technically indispensable. In times of crisis, there is no point merely writing figures in the budget, but instead we should build a useful budget, immediately ready for action. Other matters also deserve special attention. As a group, we have taken the important responsibility of re-tabling the amendment to increase the milk fund to EUR 600 million, as decided by a unanimous vote of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and therefore with the participation of all the Members and groups, and also re-tabling an amendment for a microcredit project amounting to EUR 37 million which, and this is extremely important, does not jeopardise the implementation of other programmes under heading 2. There is a particular risk at times of crisis: that budget resources will not actually be increased, but transferred from one budget line to another. It is to counter this risk that Parliament, as a directly elected institution, with a role different to that of the Council and the Commission, must be especially careful in its actions, not least with regard to scrutiny.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as a member of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament who, even in the last few days, has watched with great sadness as one fire after another has devastated vast areas around the city of Genoa, in the Liguria region of Italy, I feel there is a truly urgent need for Europe to pay attention and to intervene in order to prevent these sadly recurring disasters. There should be no recurring disasters. We should work every day to ensure that there are no more cyclical disasters. This is why I believe that Europe alone can and must intervene effectively with binding acts to preserve these precious areas which, each year, are in danger of going up in smoke and which really are the heritage of us all, because it is true that fires are breaking out more and more frequently in southern Europe, and even when it is only a tiny part of this southern Europe that is burning, in reality, it is the whole of Europe that is going up in flames. We need to intervene with prevention policies and with suitable forestry policies – and by prevention I also mean intervening by means of a precise, thorough and targeted campaign against all forms of speculation directly or indirectly linked to these disasters – but I think that we also need to ensure broader, easier and quicker access to essential resources in order, at least, to mitigate the devastating effects of these disasters. I am referring first and foremost to the Solidarity Fund, an instrument that should undoubtedly be employed more quickly for the areas affected. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the single market is a major achievement and is now, more than ever, a key element in realising the ambitious objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. Twenty years of the single market is a long time, but there is still a lot to do. So it is fundamentally important that this celebration is used as an opportunity to relaunch the single market, and it is also important for us to look ahead and see what we still lack. For example, a common energy policy is now essential if all of Europe’s citizens are to be guaranteed secure and clean energy supplies at more accessible prices. Removing obstacles and relaunching the single market will prove decisive in Europe’s current economic and social crisis, because they will contribute to innovation, growth, development, the promotion of competitiveness and above all to job creation.

 Mr President, energy efficiency is one of the pillars of EU climate policy. That is why today’s vote is particularly important. It is the result of a satisfactory and timely agreement in terms of the content, in that it obliges the Member States to prepare a strategy based on indicative national targets that take account of EU objectives and, at the same time, enables energy companies to comply with energy saving requirements in accordance with the principle of reasonable flexibility. The goal of a 20% increase in energy efficiency by 2020 is therefore within reach. I believe that credit is due, above all, to this House, because if the most disruptive Member States within the Council have at last accepted this good compromise, that is due to the tenacity with which Parliament’s negotiators, starting with the rapporteur, safeguarded these goals. This is an important step for the creation of green jobs and, ultimately, to boost competitiveness and sustainability. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of this report because only a simpler and more coherent approach can effectively support vine growers in the future. According to the Commission’s proposal, Member States have to decide once and for all by December 2012 whether to transfer funds from the wine envelope to the single payment scheme (SPS). The draft report instead aims to avoid Member States planning five-year programmes at this stage, before they know the outcome of the common agricultural policy (CAP) reform. The proposal suggests converting the existing five-year measure into a one-year measure. We need to provide adequate support to vine growers and we must do so in the clearest way possible, while still ensuring a certain amount of predictability as regards funds assigned to farmers. Clarity and timely action are the key words in our policy to support vine growers, for a Europe which is a friend to the land. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, attracting investment in Europe requires concrete measures and courageous reforms. We need to ensure free and fair competition between enterprises. In a globalised and crisis-hit economy as we have at present the main thing we need to do is make businesses more competitive and increase their capacity for growth and job creation; jobs are the most important thing of all. Europe must once again become an attractive place in which to invest and work. The current crisis is a global one, and Europe must play its part to make business stronger, more competitive and above all more attractive. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, now that the European Union’s first two macro-regional strategies in the Baltic and Danube regions have materialised, there has been growing interest in this aspect of development. A macro-regional strategy ensures better cooperation among the EU’s various intervention mechanisms, going beyond the appropriations allocated to cohesion policy. I believe that the regions of the Mediterranean basin that share the same natural environment and the same history and culture have every interest in cooperating in this way. Significant opportunities exist in southern Europe, which can best be seized with the coordination and overview permitted by the definition of a macro-regional strategy. I am referring to the proposal for an Adriatic-Ionian macro-region in particular. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the committees have already stressed their opposition to this agreement. Tomorrow, it is up to Parliament to confirm this vote and put an end to this controversial dossier. The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) is a treaty that seeks to introduce a new framework for the protection of intellectual property rights, but does so without distinction, without distinguishing between commercial use for financial gain and consumer use by individual users not seeking profit. I think we need to fight the fake goods market, to combat counterfeiting, but without undermining the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In a nutshell, I believe that commercial interests must not allow us to eliminate civil liberties. For this reason, ACTA is the wrong way to go about this, which is why tomorrow’s vote is very important. Tomorrow, therefore, we need to say no to ACTA to ensure the transparency and protection of citizens’ rights. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, after seven years of income support for workers, the Indian owners of the Videocon plant in the city of Anagni have filed for bankruptcy and initiated procedures to dismiss 1 300 employees. A major company, the second largest in the region of Lazio, is closing down, and with it, related firms. This company was acquired with the intention to force it into bankruptcy and to shift production to third countries. Therefore, the institutions must now work to provide a future for Videocon and its workers who are going through a time of crisis, and who, for seven long years, have been living in a state of total job uncertainty. Italy and Europe must step in and deploy all the instruments necessary to provide work and a productive future for this important plant. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of this report because only a harmonised and coherent approach by Member States will allow for effective promotion of Europe’s energy objectives externally. If we want to achieve the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy and of the road map for a low carbon economy by 2050, we need to improve our cooperation in terms of energy policy today. From this point of view, both increased diversification of EU supply sources and the development of renewable energy sources will be essential. In this context, effective coordination with industry is crucial in order to encourage in concrete terms the investments able to favour economic growth and development and, at the same time, those able to ensure clean and safe energy. The challenge is open and Europe must play the game for sustainable competitiveness in the energy market. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

Mr President, I voted for this report since I believe that the time has come to build a more balanced partnership with China, based on reciprocity, fair competition, friendship and trust. The Chinese economy has grown significantly over the last 30 years. It has benefited from trade and is set to become the strongest global economy towards the middle of this century. We therefore need to open a new stage in EU-China trade relations based on transparent rules, an equal partnership and common development. Hence, we must encourage China to further open up its market to European companies and allow them to invest under the same conditions as those governing Chinese investments in Europe. A new partnership, then, so that China will no longer be viewed with concern by our businesses, but as an important opportunity for development and growth for our economy and, above all, for work and employment.

 Mr President, this document concentrates on the importance of regional airports as potential vehicles of territorial, economic and social cohesion. These infrastructures can, and must, perform this role, especially for citizens living outside major urban areas. The rule whereby the threshold for an airport to receive State aid was decreased to 200 000 passengers per year is good. Regional aviation can ensure that free movement in Europe is a reality not just for people living in major capital cities, but also for European citizens living outside of these areas, ensuring that these cities and regions enjoy not only the benefits brought about by greater mobility, but also by generating tourism.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on Europe Day, this regulation is a good example. The harmonisation of roaming charges is fundamental for the process of completing the internal market of the European Union. There is always much talk of a single market and the removal of tariff barriers, and yet barriers between European countries in the telecommunications sector as regards roaming charges seemed insuperable. Now this is no longer the case, and it will no longer be the case up to and beyond July 2014. Tariff reductions are finally real and tangible, and this is good news for citizens throughout Europe. The agreement binds all operators in the 27 Member States, without exception, to reducing roaming charges for telephone calls, messages and Internet connections, starting no later than 1 July next. This is an important and significant saving, at a time of crisis and grave economic difficulty for so many families. What is more, I am pleased with the measure that will enable users who are abroad to opt for the services of the most convenient operator as from 2014. No more chains, therefore. However, all this is not enough; it is only a first step. The real objective is ‘zero’ roaming; the real objective is the total abolition of roaming charges. Building a fair and competitive market also depends on Europe’s capacity to safeguard the needs and rights of its citizens. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the creation of a risk-sharing instrument must provide tangible assistance for the Member States worst-hit by the economic and financial crisis. The European Union must do more and support the Member States facing major difficulties in enacting projects such as infrastructural works. Consequently, we must ensure the continued implementation of the programmes cofinanced by the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund. This has to be done because these are key projects – especially those capable of generating net revenues, such as the construction of motorways – which can contribute to the economic and productive recovery of the affected countries.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, passing this measure will necessarily help to increase the level of investment and thus secure the European Union’s industrial future. We need to give industry the stimuli it needs to encourage investment capable of favouring economic growth and reducing CO2
 emissions at the same time. A low-carbon economy must not therefore in any way reduce the competitiveness of the European Union; quite the reverse, it must increase it. Finally, it is important to maintain the investment needed to encourage the development of renewable energy sources in order to guarantee savings and clean energy. On this issue Europe must speed up if it does not want to remain behind. Deeds and not words are what is needed for the ambition of having a genuine green economy capable of driving growth and sustainable development. Thank you. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, these guidelines for employment policies will be a great help in achieving the target of increasing participation in the labour market and reducing youth unemployment. Today, the future of young people is increasingly uncertain and insecure. There is no point in concealing the fact that sustained economic growth is crucial for the future of Europe. The youth unemployment figures are dramatic and unacceptable. The European Union must be committed to a medium- to long-term strategy for better, full and good-quality employment, especially for young people and their mobility, but also in terms of gender quality. At the same time, there must be parallel efforts to improve education and training systems at all levels. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important programme and an ambitious plan – to turn Europe into the world leader in terms of broadband speed, mobility, coverage and capacity. As has already been said, we need to aim to offer broadband for all. Europe is behind. The United States and China have already liberalised most of their radio spectrum. Therefore the agreement to open up the 800 MHz frequency band for wireless broadband Internet services by the end of the year, and to speed up mobile broadband to at least 30 Mbps is to be welcomed. These are important objectives. I believe that a European digital agenda could be a source of development, growth and unemployment. We have to act decisively in order to reclaim our leading role in the global knowledge economy. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 I voted for the report on collective redress because I believe that completion of the European single market also, and above all, involves harmonisation of consumer protection measures. However, it is crucial that Europe should not repeat the errors already committed in the US, where the practice of class action has become a primary source of profit mainly for a handful of powerful legal firms, only in very rare cases acting as an effective consumer protection tool. In this field, the European Union can do better than the US, first of all by encouraging the parties to reach alternative agreements not requiring formal recourse to legal means, thus simplifying and speeding up the process; and subsequently, by establishing a legislative framework that does not leave room for abuse, hence, with specific timeframes for proceedings, and rights to protection in line with European legal traditions. Only in this way will it be possible to prevent a useful tool for protecting citizens becoming a means of unfair competition between private entities. The report on which we voted today is a move in this direction, and is therefore a good starting point to build on in the future. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, open, free and fair trade is essential for ensuring and maintaining a level playing field for European businesses. Nonetheless, both companies and trade analysts, as well as the European Commission, have identified non-tariff barriers as the main hindrance to free access to partner countries’ markets. Since trade restrictions of this kind are highly technical in nature, they are perhaps being misused and it is extremely difficult to remove them. That is why a good starting point for overcoming these obstacles may be to work closely with the WTO and other trade organisations. The European Union needs to address this issue vigorously by seeking to remove barriers so as to complete the single market and by prioritising this issue in the new trade policy within the Europe 2020 strategy. Businesses need this, and so does development. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis is no longer simply a threat; it is a reality that is, in fact, capable of changing the social and political order, and which accordingly requires a powerful, ambitious response. While the success of the Europe 2020 strategy depends on the commitment made by the EU as a whole, the Member States must consider economic and budgetary policies as a matter of common interest. Some countries may be able to make faster progress on their own, but together we can all go further. We therefore need to become more coordinated when adopting and implementing budgetary measures and measures to combat tax fraud and tax evasion effectively. In this context, promoting international commercial links and enhancing the internal market are elements that are crucial to increased competitiveness and economic growth. However, the Europe 2020 strategy needs to have a broader regional and social dimension. Only by directly involving local bodies in the planning and implementation of programmes will it be possible to ensure greater awareness of the objectives to be achieved.

Mr President, the economic crisis that has affected labour markets since 2008 has caused the loss of 5.6 million jobs. That is why we need to reinforce human capital by updating skills and linking education and training more closely with work, just as we need to focus on small and medium-sized enterprises and on young people joining the world of work. There is, however, one point that baffles me, on which my group tabled two amendments that were rejected by this House. For this reason, my concerns remain and I did not support the report. This point in question relates to the way the single contract was presented by the Commission. The contract does not offer adequate legal guarantees or rights on working conditions, social security and the protection of workers under all types of contract. I maintain that the issue of the right to work and the right to social security is a very important point. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the experience of recent years tells us that we need a more robust economic governance framework, just as we need to broaden and strengthen the surveillance framework, making it credible and effective, and to introduce penalties, which will be an effective deterrent only if they are applied in practice. Ultimately I believe that Europe cannot solve the economic and financial crisis with austerity plans alone. The books need to be balanced, but it takes more than all that. We can do more and better, especially where fairness, development and employment are concerned, and that is why I felt I had to abstain on the Haglund report. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is important for the Stability and Growth Pact and the complete economic governance framework to support and be compatible with EU strategies for growth and jobs, with the aim of increasing competitiveness and social stability. We therefore need to introduce penalties for punishing fraud, pay the fines into a central fund for the permanent crisis mechanism and regulate the financial markets more. Ultimately I believe that the austerity measures being discussed today are in danger of weakening social justice policies. This is not the case with the Ferreira report, which I endorsed and which includes some valuable points in relation to social balance. It is the rest of the package that is wrong, because it focuses solely and exclusively on rigour and austerity and fails to promote growth. Europe will have a future only if we are able to marry fiscal discipline with the objectives of development, growth and employment. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report is an important step in the right direction. Research and innovation are both vital for development and economic growth. It is therefore urgent to propose a common framework for reorganising the existing schemes and programmes. Although Europe is the richest macro-region in the world, it has not actually invested properly in research, development and innovation. Suffice it to say that investment in these areas has been appreciably higher in the United States and Japan. We therefore have to act quickly to remove the inequalities that remain between the various countries of Europe. That will be the only possible way to prevent the scientifically or technologically more advanced countries from continuing to benefit more from existing European programmes. I therefore reiterate the need to reorganise the existing schemes and programmes and provide for new schemes with a view to producing a sustainable and inclusive growth strategy, while bearing in mind the objectives of stability, economic convergence and employment. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the key to establishing a sophisticated approach to the issue, one that does not relate exclusively to internal production factors, is to link trade policies to development policies: in other words, human rights clauses, labour standards and corporate social responsibility must become part of every agreement. Europe’s trump card in this respect are innovation policies aimed at guaranteeing supplies through a wide range of measures, the identification and extraction of raw materials in Europe, investment in new technologies for recycling and reusing materials, and compliance with fair and responsible agreements with non-EU suppliers. The framework programme is, moreover, one of the tools for reviving innovation policies, which are an important, indeed crucial element with regard to development and also with regard to work and employment.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the Sommer report because I firmly believe that Europeans should be able to make a free and informed choice about what they eat. In adopting this report, Parliament is giving the green light to clearer rules on food labelling. These rules concern not only the energy content and the percentage of fat present in the labelled food, but also the obligation to indicate the origin of the meat used. These are common-sense rules that have the merit of allowing citizens the freedom of choice, so that they can follow a healthy, balanced diet and know what they are eating. This regulation is a vehicle for citizens to be able to voice their specific requirements with regard to their choice of foodstuffs. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

Mr President, I voted in favour of this report because I take the view that the Member States should be equipped with a solid legal basis for deciding on the future of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), and especially because it needs to be acknowledged that the agricultural and environmental impact – as well as the socio-economic impact – can justify bans and restrictions. Indeed, I should like to point out that more than 60% of European citizens are against the development and cultivation of GMOs and that, as it stands, there is still no bedrock of scientific advice capable of dispelling all doubt about their impact on territories, cultures and consumers. Our legislative action must therefore once again be guided by the precautionary principle, because until we are certain that GMOs are not harmful for crops or consumers, we have the duty to protect European citizens from their potential damaging effects.

Mr President, this is a good report and one that is very important for the balanced, harmonious and sustainable development of our communities. Genuine solidarity between Member States allows our regions to be more attractive, more innovative and more competitive. Simplifying access to assistance, more effective controls and quality spending are the objectives for a better functioning of this instrument. We need greater investment in research, knowledge and innovation to boost growth, the development of small and medium-sized enterprises and employment. I have one final comment: creating a new intermediate category must not result in existing categories being deprived of resources, but must introduce and aim solely and exclusively at the deployment of additional resources.

Mr President, I voted in favour of the report by Mr Sosa Wagner because it effectively highlights the strengths and weaknesses in the European Commission’s approach to revitalising energy infrastructures: the need to identify the infrastructures required, the criteria for selecting projects of European interest in view of financing that will attract and boost private investment, the urgent need to deal with the dangers in Eastern Europe of relying on a single source which, as we have seen in recent years, can cause serious supply problems, and lastly the opportunity to invest part of the EUR 1 000 billion over 10 years provided for by the Commission for the reduction of pollution, combating climate change and improving supply quality for clean and safe energy.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Fukushima disaster has reopened the issue of nuclear safety. The problem of radioactive waste needs to be addressed and solved. To be brief, there are two issues that I consider top priority. The first is the ban on the transfer of waste. Every country must be able to discharge its own obligations and, above all, the ‘polluter pays’ principle is a fair one. The second issue concerns safety, and the health and safety of workers in particular. This is a point that I consider extremely important, and we have to give people peace of mind. We have to give the people of Europe peace of mind by ensuring that this subject is managed with the utmost transparency and above all, I stress, the utmost safety. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, the report on the mid-term review of the Seventh Framework Programme is especially significant. There are four reasons – which I consider to be paramount – why I voted in favour of the report: 1) the simplification and streamlining of procedures in order to make it easier to access funding; 2) the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are essential for growth and employment; 3) innovation for a competitive manufacturing sector capable of meeting the challenges of the market; and 4) the risk finance facility, which so far has produced very good results. Lastly, I should like to point out that the triangle of knowledge, education and research – on which the future of the cohesion policy rests – can only be consolidated in Europe through a steadfast commitment to research. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

Mr President, the report by Mr Garriga Polledo is a very important piece of work that allows us to set out a new financial framework for a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe. We need a budget that is designed for the challenges of the present day and that can provide a strong and innovative response to current needs. Its top priority must be research and innovation for small and medium-sized enterprises, to stimulate growth and employment, while the second objective is to reform the common agricultural policy in order to promote and support the competitiveness of agriculture in Europe. However, particular attention should be paid to the future of the cohesion policy, which I consider to be a very important instrument and one which provides financial support for investments that drive economic growth and, above all, the creation of new jobs. On this subject, I would like to revisit a point that I think is particularly important: the establishment of a new intermediate category. I believe, of course, that this new category cannot be created by siphoning off resources from existing ones, which are essential for supporting the balanced, harmonious and sustainable growth of our communities.

Mr President, I voted in favour of the report on the labelling of textile products because I think that Europe could and should do more to support enterprises in the industry. The proposal made by the Commission was purely technical and aimed to simplify the current provisions regarding labelling. Yet Parliament achieved two significant results. Firstly, textile products comprising non-textile parts of animal origin – fur and leather – must show this information on the labels in order to allow consumers to make informed choices. Secondly, by 2013, the European Commission must present an impact study on the introduction of labelling, clearly showing which garments have been produced in Europe, and which outside of Europe. The latter objective is an important milestone for the competitiveness of European textiles in Europe and the world. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mrs Merkies on her excellent work. I believe we have to invest more in innovation, research and knowledge, and we have to do so more boldly. Innovation must not be swallowed up by research. Innovation and research are not the same thing, and I welcome the fact that the report points out this strategic distinction. The report sets some important objectives: it targets ordinary people and workers through social innovation; it introduces measures to facilitate access to credit and finance for small and medium-sized enterprises; and, above all, it establishes an increasingly close and direct relationship linking together businesses, research centres and our universities. Facilitating and simplifying life for small and medium-sized enterprises through a one-stop shop and focusing on talent, creativity and innovative ideas are essential conditions for growth and development. Europe must take innovation policies seriously if we want to find a way out of the crisis and build a better future for our younger generations. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, after the tragedy of Fukushima, we all need to stop and think. Nuclear power is once more in the spotlight, and I believe we need to think above all of the future, of our children’s future. It is true that we need energy, but we need clean energy and safe energy. Safety is all well and good, but it is not enough. A moratorium is not enough; we need to go further than that. The tragedy of Fukushima tells us that there is no such thing as zero-risk nuclear power stations. Above all, it tells us that we need to organise a rapid exit from nuclear power and to focus our attention on renewable, alternative power sources. Europe needs a new energy policy in order to halt the construction of new nuclear power stations because of the terrible impact these power stations could have on safety, the environment, the climate and future generations. A radical change of perspective is necessary, for a safe future based on saving energy and the use of renewable sources. Francesco De Angelis,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if we are to restore confidence to the market, we need to prioritise the needs of consumers, workers and businesses. If we want to strengthen the rights of citizens, workers and users of public services, significant attention should be paid to guaranteeing the social dimension of the future Single Market. Growth, development and social awareness must go hand in hand. There must be economic growth at the service of citizens. From this point of view, the package of regulations regarding standards for companies contains some good proposals, including the action plan to increase access on the part of small and medium-sized enterprises to capital markets and new lines of financing for innovative firms and regional development. Small and medium-sized businesses are the heart of our economy and the growth engine of the internal market. Mr President, it is up to us to ensure these goals if we are to get out of the crisis and promote a new model of development, sustainable growth and new quality jobs. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Balzani, for the excellent work she has accomplished. Getting to the heart of the matter, there are four points in this own-initiative report that I think are crucial. The first, in general terms, is the explicit reference to the European Union budget and its redistributive nature, which are the cornerstones of European solidarity. The second, in specific terms, reaffirms the principle that outstanding commitments – which are particularly high in the cohesion sector – ought to be carried out and not, as the Council suggests, simply cut out. The third sets out some doubts – entirely reasonably in my view – as to the effectiveness of an estimate criterion based on performance in the previous year. The fourth urges the Commission to formulate proposals for the creation of new resources and, in particular, new resources must be designed to combat the persistent effects of the crisis with a robust and effective commitment to policies for innovation, research and growth in economic, productive and employment terms across Europe.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that the fragmentation of the rules on consumer rights creates a very significant obstacle to cross-border purchases and sales and is also a problem for the effective creation of a real internal market.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, news of the earthquake swarm that has been affecting the Far East and Japan in particular since 11 March has left us all astonished by the scale of the human tragedy that is unfolding. For these reasons, I think this resolution represents a necessary first step to guarantee the people of Japan all the humanitarian, technical and financial support they will need in the coming months and years. I believe that the incident at the Fukushima plant should force us all to reflect carefully, scrupulously and calmly on the risks of nuclear power. Europe must invest and must also direct the Member States to concentrate more closely and more effectively on alternative energy sources. Our thoughts go out to Japan today and our commitment for the future must be to avoid similar situations being repeated in Europe and elsewhere in the world. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs Schaldemose for her report which, above all, must be praised for proposing concrete measures to strengthen the surveillance systems for movement within the common European market of products that are safe for European consumers. It is an own-initiative report but it has the merit of going in the right direction to complete the single market and the protection of European consumers. Ensuring safety means providing traceability systems that are reliable throughout the products’ life cycle. In this respect, the report puts forward effective proposals: the creation of an information database on product safety; the strengthening of the Community Rapid Information System (RAPEX) regarding unsafe products from third countries; and greater resources to allow the surveillance authorities to withdraw products with serious risks from the market. I will conclude by emphasising that it is our job to ensure that the products circulating on the European market are safe for the most vulnerable consumers, especially children, the elderly and the disabled.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Nedelcheva, for her contribution. Talking about equality between men and women in the world of work today is not, and must not be, merely an exercise in rhetoric. On the contrary, female employment is a strategic issue for Europe, in both cultural and economic terms. As is evident from the available data, if the employment rates for women were similar to those of men, gross domestic product would increase by 30%. The current crisis must not, therefore, force us to take backward steps but, on the contrary, must make us move forward towards active policies on female employment. We therefore need targeted employment policies that allow the impact of the crisis on women to be assessed and counter-cyclical solutions to be considered. The report has the merit, moreover, of focusing on positive policies to promote the employment of women, the issue of vocational training and female entrepreneurship. I will conclude by saying that there is another phenomenon to face: the serious problem of violence against women. Europe now needs to have a comprehensive directive on preventing and combating all forms of violence against women. Francesco De Angelis,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, industrial policy is a key element for growth and employment in our regions and countries. At a time of severe economic crisis, therefore, we welcome the Commission’s initiative to provide Europe with a common medium- to long-term approach, and we fully support Mr Lange’s outstanding report for at least three reasons. The first is that the report takes an approach to the subject of industrial development that does not break down industrial and business interests into market sectors, but puts them together according to common objectives. The second reason is that it underlines the importance of regional structures through more effective support for clusters, innovation networks, knowledge transfer, research, and the improvement of skills and infrastructure development. The third reason – and I am finishing – is that it highlights the role and function of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are looking to Europe to find a way out of this crisis, which is liable to seriously jeopardise their future. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, more than 100 million workers depend directly or indirectly on small and medium-sized enterprises today in Europe. Yet small and medium-sized enterprises are experiencing an unprecedented crisis: lack of liquidity, bureaucratic obstacles and constraints and administrative barriers. Herein lies the crux of this motion for a resolution: Parliament is calling for credit and loan guarantee programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises and a vigorous European drive that is more than just a pipe dream to combat the new – and for many prohibitive – business-banking requirements, particularly with regard to higher collateral guarantees and risk premiums. Lastly, I agree with the need to significantly increase funding within the framework of the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme, and to revive the issue of simplification with strength and determination: streamline and simplify, so that firms wishing to access funds are able do so without having to resort to very expensive outside consultants. These are the reasons why I voted for this resolution: the SMEs and the 100 million European workers employed in the sector expect it of us. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Bendtsen’s report is positive for at least four reasons: – it reaffirms that energy efficiency is the most effective and fastest way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and that a firm commitment to provide resources and investment in this area will result in economic growth and job creation for small and medium-sized enterprises; – it makes valid proposals concerning workable financial instruments and calls on the Commission to firmly focus on professional training, access to information for small and medium-sized enterprises, and the refurbishment of existing buildings; – it sets specific objectives and confirms Energy Performance Contracting as an instrument for purchasing guaranteed energy savings and a launch pad for creating jobs and reducing European citizens’ bills; – lastly, the report will be all the more useful if binding emissions targets can be set without any ifs or buts. We must make the 20% target an achievable one; we cannot let this opportunity pass us by, since it would send out an encouraging signal to Europe. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my appreciation for this resolution, which is an excellent piece of work in four respects. Firstly, it reasserts that energy efficiency and energy saving are economically advantageous priorities to reduce Europe’s energy dependence and combat climate change. Secondly, it emphasises intelligent infrastructure. Thirdly, it urges us to fully implement current European legislation. Fourthly, it strives to bring about an energy policy with a robust and consistent international dimension. Finally, I should like to underline the importance of energy security and investment in research, development and innovation to protect the interests of consumers, businesses and citizens as well as possible. Francesco De Angelis  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Van Brempt, for her excellent work and for an agreement that will at last make it possible to free up significant resources for the development of renewable energies and energy efficiency in the context of the challenge for green growth. The programme includes priorities that the Member States should take into account, particularly in achieving the objective of competitive modernisation of our energy infrastructures. Lastly, I wish to emphasise what I considered to be the qualifying points of the criteria for access by public authorities to finance, in particular, the commitment to work on multiannual strategies through a system of multi-level governance from territories to local authorities up to regional institutions and the institutions of the European Union, even in the context of rationalising the available financial instruments. This is an important result for the public and for small and medium-sized enterprises. Francesco De Angelis,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs Weiler for the excellent work she has done. With this provision, Europe is putting an end to a procedure that has brought a great many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to their knees. Parliament is taking action to protect SMEs – the most vulnerable businesses and the ones most exposed to the effects of the crisis – from problems of liquidity and access to credit. The current practice of delaying payments is pushing a great many small businesses towards bankruptcy, with adverse effects on employment. That is why the provision is important: it sets the maximum payment period at 60 days, increases interest on late payments to 8% and outlaws the use of contractual terms that are unfair to the creditor. In other words, it lays down definite time periods, incentives and, most of all, no exceptions. These are measures designed to protect SMEs, stimulate our economic and productive fabric, and boost employment. It is now the turn of the Member States to take swift and effective steps to implement this directive, which confirms that Europe exists, is useful and can make itself felt.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the launch of the European Union 2020 strategy effectively marks the end of the previous Lisbon Strategy phase and it will have to tackle the negative structural effects that the financial, economic and social crisis has produced and is continuing to produce. I believe that if the 2020 strategy is to be effective, it must focus on two key aspects, the first being a system for evaluating progress which factors in the use of the carrot and stick mechanism; the second being a vigorous policy of investing in infrastructure, in addition, of course, to tools for regulating the financial system and policies aimed at restoring social dialogue and cohesion. Infrastructures are the cornerstone of the relaunch of innovation policy in industry, SMEs, manufacturing consortiums or research institutes and in the relationship between these and universities and local institutions. The van Nistelrooij report should therefore be warmly welcomed since, in addition to providing an in-depth picture of the work that has been done to date in the Member States, it starts to deal with the question of criteria for harmonisation of financial instruments and operational plans aimed at innovation. The harmonisation of rules, procedures and administrative practices for the management of EU projects and the simplification and streamlining of procedures are the solutions that the stakeholders on the ground and citizens have been asking us for for a long time. I believe that on this point, Europe can and must do much to promote growth, development and employment. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the five rapporteurs who have worked so hard on these matters, and since I can only deal with one of these questions, for the second I will wear something on my head in order to demonstrate my conviction that no fish, under EU law, can be landed without fins, and so I do not understand why sharks may be landed in this manner. Thus, in honour of sharks I am wearing a fin for the remainder of my speech. I want to support the position taken by Ms Lövin and oppose the Group of the European People’s Party’s alternative motion for a resolution. I think that this alternative motion for a resolution tabled by the PPE Group, signed by the Chair, poses a very serious problem because it deletes an important part of this report involving the conclusion of fisheries agreements in the Mediterranean. Without fisheries agreements with other countries, our Mediterranean is condemned to certain death. Removing the possibility of conducting a fisheries foreign policy in the Mediterranean means killing the sea. I would therefore ask the Chair to withdraw this motion before tomorrow, and call on all Mediterranean MEPs to vote against it if the motion is not withdrawn. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is the fourth time I have had to give an explanation of vote – which does not happen very often – under these conditions. The report by Mr Alfonsi that we have adopted today is of particular importance, especially for the Adriatic region in our country. The macro-regional strategy has a considerable impact both on European planning and on its implementing acts. I believe regional strategies will be extremely important for the implementation of these rules, not least for the sector that I personally am involved with – fisheries – during the revision of our fisheries policies. Unfortunately, this sector is not given due coverage in this report, although that does not make it any less important. Besides, the constraints of the Mediterranean are well known; these constraints in both the management and the implementation of certain policies often jeopardise Europe’s comprehensive strategies. I do not think I can say anything else in all this uproar. Guido Milana,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank Mr Stevenson for his excellent work and the structure he gave to his report, which addresses the two main issues. This is not a simple management plan for herring, but is about guaranteeing fishermen a future to some extent, and a plan of action that ensures the sea is protected for years to come. But the key point in this report is – and remains – the question of delegated acts. I believe that the Council should accept the line taken by the Treaty of Lisbon and I think that the time has come for Parliament to have the courage to take a very clear and strong position on the matter of delegated acts, with perhaps a more authoritative voice than would come from the debate in the Committee on Fisheries or a discussion on a report concerning herring. We assert the right to deal with these matters under the ordinary legislative procedure. I know perfectly well that this issue concerns not only many other kinds of fishing, which will be in a worse situation following the current reform, but also agriculture and other subjects. The right course is to respect the will of Parliament. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to avoid repeating what my colleagues have already said, I personally believe that Europe really has no strategy either for the system of controls or for the means of implementing international agreements in the Mediterranean. We must not forget that the Mediterranean comprises eight European and 22 non-European countries and that its bluefin tuna attract many fishermen from outside Europe. I therefore believe – regardless of whether Mr Romeva i Rueda’s good work could have gone further – that this debate is pointless if it does not lead to the Commission preparing a proper international relations proposal. What is really needed is to establish new relationships on this subject, and on many others concerning fishing in the Mediterranean, in an effort to create the right conditions and making resources available for those countries that apply the same European rules. It would serve the interests of the tuna, of European fishing, and of Mediterranean fishing in particular. Guido Milana,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries.

 Madam President, the Committee on Fisheries has carried out an exhaustive job, considering that this is a post-Lisbon codecision matter. In this sense, the execution rate was 97.20%, hence a good execution rate as recorded in the accounts. Despite this, however, under one of the headings, a specific heading, the heading for fish markets, number 1102, had very little execution, for which the Commission gave some quite satisfactory explanations, but these do not suggest that there will be much change in the following years. Equally, one of the issues underlined is the execution of international fishing agreements. In these, the commercial aspect is too dominant compared with the aspect linked to growth in the sector: 72% is a commercial agreement. Therefore, the fishing agreements probably need to have a slightly different execution that takes into account the policy objectives of these agreements. I will close, Madam President, with just one more small comment, which is that there are reports that have been challenged for almost a decade, the closure of which is still being delayed. This is a just a point of form with regard to the execution as a whole. Thank you in particular for the time allowed to me. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the excellent report by Mr Rinaldi has been a success in the House. I totally agree with the excellent opinion of the report. Nevertheless, I would like to raise a small issue. Compared with this new world that is trying to seek democracy and different economic conditions, our Europe is a Europe divided by the Mediterranean. It is precisely this special focus on the Mediterranean that I would like the Commission to have, as regards both environmental issues and economic trade in the Mediterranean. The Mediterranean is a fishing area. We are building a new fisheries policy in Europe in which Europe will set some very strict rules. On the other side, however, there are no rules. Therefore, why not use forms of fisheries agreements, support for these countries so that they apply the same rules that are applied in Europe? This would be healthy for European fishing, healthy for the sea and environmental conservation, and would ensure that this division becomes ever smaller but an increasingly homogenous place on which to build the future of Europe and of this new world.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank Mr Arsenis, Ms Patrão Neves and Mr Romeva i Rueda and their assistants for contributing substantially to the success of this initiative. Fish is a common good, as it provides 15% of the protein intake of more than 3 billion people, and the livelihoods of over 500 million people depend on fishing and aquaculture. This makes it a truly global common good. By approving this statement, we are indicating a clear path to the Commission on the need to encourage responsible conduct, both among the fishing community and on the part of consumers. The debate on the common fisheries policy now has one more reason to support actions to broaden the scope of European policy from a narrow vision, concentrating on fishing methods and a policy of inward-looking rules. Instead, we suggest a strategy which treats the sea as a privileged place so as to increase its function as a breeding ground, both within EU waters and through innovative fishing agreements with third countries. What is more, this is not only about protecting the environment and maintaining biodiversity, but also about responsible fisheries, economic and social sustainability, which is clearly in the interests of both fishermen and our economy. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you have done very well, Commissioner, to promote this initiative and this regulation, but I would like to return to one problem – the only thing I want to pick up on in my speech – which is the under-execution of funds. The Commission must intervene because here we are facing an example of under-execution of funds. You have moved very intelligently to accelerate this process. Mr Ferreira makes some excellent points, because there are a number of questions over this issue: I do not think that we can transform the common fisheries policy over these two years, but I think we can direct our resources appropriately, especially to the most vulnerable countries, which are in greatest need of assistance at the moment. I would add, Commissioner, that in order to make this expenditure effective, I would also suggest that the procedures for the execution phase should be simplified; that is something I would focus on. Sometimes, a closer look at the execution of spending and simplified procedures can further assist in this process. I would like to pause for just a second if I may, Mr President, on the Court of Auditors. We must be wary of considering the Court of Auditors’ report as applicable to the whole of Europe. Within the report, there are many different areas where efficiency was different. Thank you and excuse me, Mr President, for running over time. Guido Milana,

 Mr President, my remarks are intended directly for the Commissioner and the Minister. Commissioner, a year and a half ago, I urged you to act courageously as, in doing so, you would have had the support of Parliament. Now it seems to me that, instead, the idea prevails that Parliament is a sort of deadweight, a frill, in the procedures and that the Commission often prefers to take a stance that differs little if at all from the Council’s, which avoids having a genuine relationship with Parliament. Today, we are debating the reform of the common fisheries policy. Parliament is asking questions, while ministers are already mediating the Commission’s proposal. This goes beyond the application of Article 43(3). We must really reinstate the principle that the Treaty of Lisbon conferred on Parliament, and I believe that on this point, we must take a cultural leap in our relationships, rather than work in fine detail, trying to grasp whether we are on the right track by following this or that procedure. This is a different problem. I believe that we are still not aware of the role that Parliament can play when it comes to the fisheries sector. Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, we shall vote on the report that has been presented to us in a distinguished manner this morning by Ms Patrão Neves. If Parliament supports it, this resolution will immediately draw very important lines in the sand for the coming reform. I am not absolutely persuaded by the proposals regarding the socioeconomic aspect of the proposed reform. They effectively amount to driving the workforce out of the sector, not about finding alternative employment. I believe that here too we must take a culturally different direction. The list of issues you have drawn up is really short, as it does not set out a scenario for substituting fishing by some other occupation, where, say, aquaculture or tourism could have a key role. I believe that these measures have simply been relegated to a question of transferable rights, which, Commissioner, give absolutely no guarantee of a socioeconomic application for the reduction in fishing, because … (The President cut off the speaker) Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

Mr President, I am presenting an oral amendment with regard to the introduction of respect for human rights in this resolution. The text, which should be inserted after paragraph 7, is as follows: ‘calls on the Commission to introduce into the fisheries agreement with Morocco the clause on respect for human rights, as set out in the European Parliament resolution on human rights and social and environmental standards in international trade agreements’. I believe that this amendment improves the resolution and gives a timely reminder to the Commission, during the negotiation stage, to take into account the international context which often meets division in Parliament, particularly in this area. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a dreadful agreement, a dreadful extension and a dreadful performance over the years: these are the keywords in this debate! Well, we must consider this phase closed. If the Commission – or, rather, the Commissioner, who did not draw up this agreement – asks us to consent to the agreement, we must put this phase behind us and concentrate in particular on the new agreement and on what will happen in the coming years. As someone who has upheld the Sahrawi cause for many years, I am not sure if it is a good idea not to have any further relations with Morocco. We cannot replace the agreement, the lack of which would not help us resolve the conflict, which has been going on for more than 30 years. What Ms Lövin said was music to my ears. I wholeheartedly agree with her, although I do not think the fisheries agreement is the way to solve the problem. We certainly will not find a solution when the UN has had a mission in place for 30 years that has been incapable of resolving all the humanitarian issues involved. We should therefore say ‘yes’ to the resolution and ‘yes’ to extending this agreement, because the resolution should encourage the Commission and spur it on to negotiate hard, both to ensure that the new agreement truly responds to these requirements, and to ensure that it is a sign that the Union’s foreign policy must heed. Baroness Ashton cannot ignore the Sahrawi question any longer! Guido Milana,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it was wonderful to work with Mr Koumoutsakos. We worked well together, we had a good trialogue, and therefore my thanks are not merely formal but truly meant. We have become friends during this debate, and I think this friendship will probably lead us to give the Commission a hand because, Commissioner, the problem is the future. What we have achieved today has been thanks to Parliament, because if it had been down to the Council – incidentally absent today – we would not have achieved this result. A proposal of EUR 50 million was cut by the Council, and it is only thanks to the tough stand taken by myself and Mr Koumoutsakos that the Commission has been able to receive this EUR 40 million. The Commission can count on us for the future. It can count on a Parliament that believes in what it says. This Parliament is convinced to the extent that it knows perfectly well that the sea is made up of seas, coastlines and activities, and that there needs to be a common vision of these things. Coastlines cannot be the subject of urban and land planning that ends at the foreshore. The EU and Member States need to appreciate that town planning includes the sea – it does not end on the coastline. The activities themselves need to become compatible with one another. We need to initiate real planning in which tourism, fishing, mining and – why not? – the amazing wind energy that can be developed offshore can be an asset and mutually compatible, in the same way that fishing and fishing activities cannot be treated separately and considered only in terms of fishing methods and quantities. There, the focus will have to be on pollution-related issues, because dwindling fish stocks are not just the result of fishing. Commissioner, you have a major ally in Parliament. The problem will not be how to spend this EUR 40 million, but how we will all manage to have sufficient resources between 2013 and 2020 to do such important and wonderful things. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in this case, too, you have strong support from Parliament. Ms Lövin has carried out an extraordinary task, an excellent preliminary job, even though on some points and issues, she could have gone further. I have a different opinion as to whether or not it is appropriate or justified to set up a European coastguard, although I will support her position. I have a different opinion, but I will, in any case, support her position. Commissioner, there is only one real issue, and that is that the Commission needs to have a global role. We have said this in many different ways, and I think that this is the real key, to establish a real foreign policy for this activity. The relationship with the United States, China and Japan is crucial in this sense, because the essence of this activity lies within this relationship, within the construction of common rules and the resulting behaviours. Therefore the true goal is to increase awareness that fishing, in this sense, is a common asset, and a global common asset. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report was adopted with a huge majority in Parliament. I voted for it, but I would have liked to vote on something different, something bolder. In my opinion, Parliament has missed an opportunity to go further. It is quite true that the single European railway area can and must result in a much better relationship with consumers than we have had so far. Why stop, however, at a single national regulatory body and not push on towards a single European regulatory body? Why stop short of the issue of unbundling, bringing in a clear separation between ownership and service management? Yes, the budgets have been separated, but probably this time in Parliament it was not this House’s authority to make its voice heard that has prevailed, but rather the representatives of the abundant privilege and competition present today in the European railway market. We will only manage to truly change the fortunes of freight, improve people’s lives, improve the free circulation of goods when this single European space is worthwhile. Essentially, keeping well away from the train tracks is good for the health and not for economic policy; perhaps by getting too close you will get run over. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
).

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the budget sets out a few clear and important objectives within the scope of the Europe 2020 strategy; for this I should like to thank the rapporteurs, Ms Balzani and Mr Fernandes. It is essential to focus on investments and not merely on the careful management of the budget. The only alternative is to look on passively at the speculative way of thinking that dominates at present. We can no longer allow ourselves to follow individual interests and instead must finally act as a single, united structure, ready to face up to confrontation. I welcome the commitments adopted on the pilot projects and the preparatory actions in Heading 2, just as I welcome the fact that funding for the Integrated Maritime Policy is not to the detriment of other initiatives and programmes in the fisheries sector. This will allow us to implement policies for better marine resource management, through research and thoroughgoing exchange of data on fish stocks, bringing in new planning methods in the Adriatic area that can be used as best practices in other marine areas. I will conclude with a quick aside: with regard to future debates on the common fisheries policy (CFP) and in particular on the European Fisheries Fund (EFF), I hope that a greater effort will be made on fisheries control, which is at the heart of the fight against illegal fishing and is also a key issue in restoring stocks. Fish should be seen as a shared asset. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT) 
Mr President, I too welcome the vote on this report, even though a few points might well have been developed a little further. Reflecting on all the regionalisation and localisation of employment contracts cannot, however, fail to take heed of the important task of unifying workers’ rights. In other words, the greater the opportunity to develop territorial, business and sectoral autonomy to stimulate productivity and create the conditions for competitiveness, the greater the need to create the conditions for some fundamental rights to be applied on a supranational, or European, basis. That is why I am still puzzled as to whether this initiative could lead us to tackle the important issue of whether there can be a European policy on fundamental rights. Otherwise the alternative is that we will enter what I think will be a bad period in which there will be rich and poor workers, even though they are doing the same job. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Ms Koppa’s report is exceptionally current in what it really implies, and it comes at a time when the debate on Palestine is particularly important. Initiating this trade highlights the fact that we can no longer use this country just as a potential market, since until now, our exports to Palestine have been worth EUR 50 million and our imports from there only EUR 6 million. Instead, away from Israeli control, the country is preparing itself to play a role as an exporter to Europe, which we hope can truly help to change the fortunes of the Palestinian people in particular. I therefore voted wholeheartedly in favour of this report. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, many thousands of people die every year due to natural disasters and tens of billions of euro are lost. These are dramatic figures, and disasters are not always avoidable. Ms Gardini’s report is right on the mark in this respect, because it essentially identifies the two fundamental points in the new European civil protection strategy. The first is a thorough prevention plan, which can no longer be just the sum of the national prevention plans, and proper rules concerning prevention procedures. The second is the real, concrete idea of European civil protection, which cannot result from mere coordination but must be based on a genuine network. We have to move on from an emergency response requested by a country in relation to a disaster and the subsequent intervention, seen almost as a concession by another country, to a genuine strategy. With this hope in mind, I think the resolution adopted today is a useful one for the people of Europe. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is just a good initiative, but I think we will later have to develop a European policy on tourism. The European framework is a good idea, but I would like to focus on two issues. There is no sea or coastal tourism, we might say, but a coastal planning policy. I think the time has come for Europe to protect this important sector by producing an initiative in which ideas about the sea and coastline are not limited to a kind of town planning that ends at the foreshore and does not involve the sea as a whole. I think it will be useful to have an integrated policy on this, just as there will be a need to develop everything that lies behind the claims about rural tourism: rural tourism can be an excellent source of income for disadvantaged areas and areas where there is no work any more, where it is important to stop depopulation and instead encourage people to settle. For that, it is not enough just to make claims. We would need to suggest that Europe and the Member States take action on taxation. Perhaps developing tourism in rural areas could mean paying less tax; maybe that would create a real opportunity for tourism as a resource and for the people living in those areas. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have just three small points I should like to make, all centred on the fact that we need ‘more Europe’ in this area. I think it is an inescapable fact that on certain issues, we must not merely hope for more Europe, but actually set about building it. For example, more Europe means starting to really think about common traffic police and uniform safety rules. More Europe means having a European policy on training, not simply delegating it to the individual Member States, but instead putting together a proper training policy for schools, for young people and for slightly more at-risk categories, among whom motorcyclists were mentioned a moment ago, but we could talk about lorry drivers as well. More Europe means everyone having the same devices in their cars to improve safety conditions, such as alcolocks and anti-tiredness devices. This, in my view, would be a strategy well worth pursuing with businesses in the sector and European carmakers. Indeed, if all this was incorporated in a common policy, then I really think that conditions would, perhaps, improve. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt this is not purely a trade agreement. This agreement clearly contains a significant element of ‘political’ assistance. This does not involve treating Palestine and Israel in the same way; it is clear that their situations are different. The agreement with Israel is purely a trade agreement, a trade agreement that in some way supports a process leading to the constitution of a state, a process that brings improvements in the living conditions experienced by that population. Furthermore, the trade agreement with Europe has until now been mediated by Israel, and the result is one where imports form one tenth and exports nine tenths of our international trade. That means that we have seen, or rather, until now Europe has seen Palestine as a market and certainly not a place where producers should be encouraged to target the European market. It is my belief then, with compliments to Ms Koppa, that in this international context we would be doing the right thing tomorrow by using the vote in Parliament to send a strong, authoritative message that will help drive the process at the UN and the Warsaw meeting at the end of the month. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the single market, the freedom of movement and the Treaty of Lisbon are all elements which came about irrespective of changes to our method – either the European method or the national method – of lawmaking. We need to act on the commitments made in the light of these opportunities. In particular, we need to truly initiate a phase to simplify the legislative system, a simplification phase which must lead to a different kind of dialogue between Europe and the individual States. I would start precisely with our documents, and I would take this opportunity to suggest a kind of clarity test for our documents. When we draw up a white paper or a green paper, everything should be more understandable, and I would say that, in order to truly launch this virtuous phase of introducing legislation, the real, perhaps strategic proposal for our Europe, is to give particular responsibility to a European Commissioner who would have the specific task of clarifying legislation and relations between the States and Europe itself. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I support the adoption of this report because it has the effect of ensuring that the conditions applied to the Black Sea are proposed in other European areas, too. Regulating fishing in an area in which only two of the six countries bordering the basin are European is an important development. It is very similar to the situation in the Adriatic, for example, where different countries – EU, non-EU and candidate countries – with totally different rules exist side by side. The second reason is that I believe that the establishment of a European coastguard should be highlighted and viewed as a genuinely important development: it could actually be one of the first areas for discussion when planning how to protect the sea, fishermen and consumers. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT)
 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have taken the floor simply in order to lend my support to this report and to highlight two aspects in particular. The first, because it is part of the debate currently under way on the review of the common fisheries policy and on the fundamental decision relating to the regionalisation of a policy – a centralised policy – that has shown how utterly weak it is in recent years. This regionalisation phase is particularly relevant in the case of the Black Sea. I believe that the points contained in Ms Iotova’s report describe a specific situation, but one that is found in the rest of Europe, too: the situations in the Adriatic Sea, the Tyrrhenian Sea and the Aegean Sea are no different. In other words, the interaction between European fishing and non-European fishing, in particular, is often very harmful to European markets and to European consumers. The second aspect that I should like to highlight quickly is that of the call for a European coastguard. There can be no policy without controls. Controls are carried out today by different forces in Europe; I believe that the time has come to recognise that one of the main security forces in Europe, namely coastguards, can be managed jointly, can become more interdependent and, indeed, can form a single European body. In the hope that this will happen, I fully support the contents of Ms Iotova’s report. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Fukushima accident continues to produce very serious consequences, with radioactive water leaking into the sea at levels 6 500 times above legal limits. The risk of contaminated food products is high. Europe has established very strict controls but this applies only to fresh products. No rule has been issued to safeguard processed products, in particular tinned fish. We import 370 000 tonnes of tinned tuna. The principal suppliers are the countries of South-East Asia, which import fish from Japan. This means that tinned fish imported into Europe may contain Japanese fish. The provision of precise information about place of origin is crucial and urgent. Today consumers know where the tin was produced but not the place where the fish was caught. The Commission has recently acknowledged this and plans to close this gap with the reform of the common fisheries policy, but that will not enter into force until two years from now, just as the Sommer report, which is being debated in this plenary session, will not take effect until three years from now. We should not indulge in scaremongering but consumers have the right to urgent and clear information. The Commission should intervene as soon as possible. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I should like to express my overall satisfaction about the adoption of Mr El Khadraoui’s report. I believe it represents a step forward for consumer and environmental protection, including in terms of the positions of individual Member States, which sometimes complain of delays. Essentially, I think that by adopting this measure, Europe has demonstrated that it is further ahead than many Member States, which will clearly have to remedy this situation in short order. I come from a country whose government was rather tardy in expressing its interest in this directive. I therefore hope that Parliament’s decision will be productive and function as a stimulus so that the attitudes and the level of attention for this issue will be substantially improved in the not too distant future.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that this measure will mean that issues related to the Mediterranean are about to embark on an even more binding phase than has been achieved through the acts implemented to date. I believe that the act we are focusing on today is much more important than the effects of the 2006 EU regulation. I think it also offers a response to some limitations of that regulation which, because it is unilateral, has left large sections of the fishing industry with the idea that Europe is doing its bit but the other Mediterranean countries are not. I think it is strategic for us to address the issue from this aspect and with these characteristics. I believe that the work done by Mr Rivellini, which has been broadly welcomed, deserves formal thanks in this session.  However, I have the distinct feeling that the fact that we cannot resolve this issue on first reading and will move to a second reading, particularly over the interpretation of Article 28 of this regulation, raises one question: Parliament is siding with the Commission this time. Parliament is saying in essence that it is a good thing for these delegated acts to be the responsibility of the Commission and there is some resistance by the Council and, by the way, its absence today is significant. This act means that Parliament is now convinced that the operation of maintaining biodiversity, maintaining the abundance of fish in this important sea, will help secure the future of the fishers. That said, I think the next stage in the process must place the focus back on the idea of codecision. These delegated acts are delegated for a reason, and thus, today, they are the responsibility of the Commission, but the international agreements, when they come, have to be firmly the responsibility of Parliament. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think we have two problems, one relating to the method and the other to the merits of this matter. The problem with the method is that we are making use of an artifice, for which we thank Mrs Fraga, which is that of the oral question, to talk about something that should really, after the Treaty of Lisbon, be a Parliamentary right. I think this practice should end; we cannot resort to a strategy to see through an ordinary legislative procedure. Codecision occurs when this process is cultivated as the process develops. Today, we are having this debate, it will end, the agreement will go ahead and we will say yes or no at the end. This method should be changed. On the merits, however, because I agree with many things other Members have said, I simply wanted to stress the importance of measuring the effects of fisheries agreements to ensure these are not just mere trade agreements enabling us to buy cephalopods for EUR 1 per kilo in Mauritania. They must be able to measure sustainability but, above all, the impact on the economy of that country, to appreciate the quantitative change in employment figures, to appreciate the rate of innovation of small-scale fishing and to appreciate the use of these resources. It is not purely and simply about commercial trade, but a fisheries agreement, with all its implications. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

Madam President, a new season of rights is upon us, but these rights could have been more widespread. We must be aware that at distances of less than 250 km, the rights of the most vulnerable, of disabled people, old-age pensioners, and persons with reduced mobility, are not addressed at all in this measure. If it is true that homogenised quality standards are being established, it is just as true that excluding local transport seriously limits the number of passengers affected. Implementation over the course of the next four years will allow the sector to prepare itself as well as possible, but we will also need to monitor the establishment of the enforcement bodies. The result of this process represents a victory for Parliament and is a positive sign of our attention to citizens’ needs. However, compromise always implies mediation – and in this case concessions – of this House’s aims. Basically, we have shown that we are good interpreters of needs, in contrast to the Council which has shown that it only represents interests. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not want to break up this joyful atmosphere. It is true that we have come to the end of the phase begun in 2005, during which diplomacy helped to ensure that events unfolded in the best possible way. However, there are still many unresolved problems. This is a young country and will be a young country once secession has taken place. It is a country that still needs to establish its borders, address the issue we have heard mentioned several times of the conflicts in the Abyei region, the issue of the oil pipeline, which is the most important thing in that country, and also the international aid system. I would therefore like to make a very simple point to the Commissioner. There are two or three things that we need to do. We need to establish a strategy for Southern Sudan, and recognise this new State on 7 February, without waiting until 9 July when the results of the election are made official. We also need to put our international service into action immediately, and establish a delegation in Southern Sudan. This is the only way to support a process; this is the only way for smart, strategic diplomacy to support this country on the path to democracy. I would note that the first thing that the country needs to do is to draw up its constitution, and Europe can be of great help in this. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, it is important to link the condemnation of these attacks and the call for urgent, concrete measures to protect Christians around the world with the more general demand for respect for the freedom of religion and freedom of conscience and thought. There is no difference between someone who is murdered while attending mass and someone who is sentenced to death for adultery or for belonging to a Muslim, Christian or Jewish minority, or for having been born in a particular place rather than for practising a religion. The right to freedom and coexistence is universally recognised by humanist culture and international conventions. In contrast, we are seeing the world divided between those who uphold human rights and those who want to brutally extinguish them. Only an attitude open to dialogue and against any form of intolerance can provide a basis for protecting identities and values. A lack of respect for these can even lead to the expulsion of entire communities from their historical homelands. There is a great deal of work for Europe to do in this respect at a political and diplomatic level as well as in the cultural and social spheres. Today, we urge the Council and the Commission, and especially the High Representative for Foreign Affairs, to adopt clear guidelines for our relations with third countries in the context of the new European External Action Service. Bilateral agreements, too, must attach greater importance to the subjects of religious freedom and human rights more generally, violations of which should lead to the suspension of these agreements. I am also thinking that Europe should take a leading role in promoting dialogue between religions. A lack of such dialogue often goes beyond individual incidents and leads to real wars, in which religion conceals other, more complex reasons for conflict. Lastly, we must also look closer to home: there is no lack of cases of intolerance in Europe. Our cities are, in practice, multicultural, and that fact brings with it religious traditions and values that must be respected and afforded freedom of expression. There is, therefore, no alternative to dialogue and mutual respect. It is important to repeat the appeal made by religious communities. (The President cut off the speaker) Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have only one regret in this Chamber this evening, and that is that we are only discussing the Sahrawi people because the Moroccans have invaded the camp outside Laâyoune, and that is a shame for democracy in this Parliament. Parliament should have found the will to discuss this issue of its own accord, as it has been rotting on international negotiating tables for 30 years. This is the most significant political fact. We were forced into it by acts of violence, not because we autonomously decided to guarantee human rights. What is the fact that a referendum for self-determination should be held there, if not a question of respect for human rights? Precisely because Morocco is our friend, because Morocco is the strong party in the relationship, we must forcefully request that it is no longer possible to postpone this desire and follow up with all consequent actions. We must seek to create the conditions so that the aim of the UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) is not only to realise the conditions for a referendum which is constantly being postponed. We must try to use all the means at the disposal of the European Union to bring this event about and ensure that the referendum does justice to a people’s 30 years of suffering. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one minute is not long enough to cover four reports. I therefore congratulate the three other rapporteurs, but I will only comment on Mr Ferreira’s report. Adherence to the principles of biodiversity must be central to the actions which the European Union undertakes with regard to fishing and aquaculture. The compromise amendment is the result of the good work carried out by Mr Ferreira, who has clearly understood these concerns. We must not have preconceived ideas when looking for ways to improve fish farming standards, but we must be rigorous in the control and application of regulations which are as precise as possible, in order to avoid the risk of altering the environmental balance. In this way, the greatest support for organic production is a decision which is made in the general interest and which encompasses the protection of biodiversity. That, in fact, is the best way of optimising the production of native species. Commissioner, I hope that, as part of the common fisheries policy reform, this further measure with regard to aquaculture can be included in one simplified regulation. This will simplify matters greatly, and I hope that a single regulation on aquaculture will make the procedures as a whole even simpler. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 30 years ago, Morocco denied for many years that there was a war with the Sahrawi people and today, it is still denying that there is disproportional repression of these same people. Yet, in the Western Sahara, there are dead and wounded people of a population that is only claiming the right to live in freedom in its own land. Morocco has largely closed its borders to anyone who could witness these events. No information and no members of parliament are allowed in. A member of the French parliament and our fellow Member, Mr Meyer, were denied access. Europe looks on passively. There is no news from the Commission on this matter, which makes us subordinate to United Nations mediation, which continues to fail just as it has done for the past 30 years. Baroness Ashton, who is responsible for foreign policy, has not taken a stand on the subject. We need to react by Parliament making a stand. We need to react against Morocco, curtailing all initiatives on commercial agreements, beginning with the renewal of the fishing agreements. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur. When it comes to integrated maritime policy, we must go beyond the stage of good intentions and give fresh impetus to a strategy that will represent a route to growth and development in the European Union, making up for the huge amount of time lost in the prevention of environmental disasters, and in the fight against climate change and pollution. Only this morning Mr Pirillo reminded Parliament of yet another catastrophic event that occurred the other day in the town of Paola, in Calabria. The Commission must prove that it is making a real effort, that it is not just using its instruments of governance but actually implementing targeted legislative measures, and duly learning its lessons from past mistakes caused by an approach that was often too sectoral in nature. We are fully aware that this is a very complex process, but we are at a difficult and demanding juncture where no lapse in attention can be tolerated and where adequate investment and shared governance mechanisms are needed both at interinstitutional level and in international cooperation for the regional basins, among which the Mediterranean stands out because of the complexity of its jurisdiction. That is why it will be crucial to view the management of the Mediterranean basin as an asset shared by all the coastal States, on the basis of the res communis omnium
, or common heritage, principle. Otherwise, the increasingly widespread practice of unilaterally declaring exclusive economic zones or the like in the Mediterranean Sea, as well as running counter to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, would undermine the idea of effective, shared governance. I would point out in this respect that, only a month ago, this interpretation on the part of Libya resulted in an actual armed assault on a European fishing boat, and it would be wrong to argue that this is just a matter between Italy and Libya. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

Madam President, the revision of the agreement between Parliament and the Commission establishes the basis for improved collaboration between the two institutions. Much progress has been made with regard to procedure, legislative planning, parliamentary scrutiny, requirements to provide information and the Commission’s presence in Parliament. However, the point which I am most eager to highlight is the progress made with respect to the interinstitutional aspect of international relations. The role given to Parliament should not be considered as strengthened: it is a requirement. We hope that no one casts doubt on allowing the presence of European Parliament observers at multilateral and bilateral international conferences as anything but an act of responsibility. Indeed, denying the status of observer to Members of the European Parliament in bilateral agreements, such as, for example, fisheries agreements, prevents, de facto, full knowledge of the area being negotiated, upon which Parliament will subsequently be required to express its opinion. I believe that it is not possible to do without these preconditions, as otherwise we would end up with Parliament rejecting bilateral agreements which, by definition, cannot be amended and which, in the absence of a partnership, would make the vote a mere formality. Guido Milana,

 Madam President, Commissioner, Members of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, on 4 May we in committee unanimously voted in favour of the report on European aquaculture, which is essentially aimed at promoting the sustainable development of the sector. I would like to begin by thanking everyone who worked on this report over the last few months, providing me with valuable support. This text was, in fact, drafted over many long months of work, consultation and concerted action, and I hope it will provide the foundation on which to promote a suitable aquaculture policy in a serious, practical and effective manner. I also think that, in the light of its technological potential and innovative aspects, the healthy and sustainable development of aquaculture represents an extremely important resource for the European economy. In adopting the report, the MEPs have first of all demonstrated great awareness, highlighting that they have fully understood the urgent need for legislative clarity in this area. In other words, they have proved that they are indeed aware of the negative consequences caused by the lack of a single regulation on aquaculture, the confusion among operators in the sector, the complex and excessively bureaucratic procedures, the highly discriminatory situations, the market distortions and the low level of competitiveness of European production. The report maintains that there is a need to provide greater impetus to the sector by establishing a specific aquaculture fund that is either independent or part of the European Fisheries Fund, to be used to support research and innovation, to further the virtuous coexistence of sustainability and competitiveness, and to focus serious attention on employment issues. Admittedly, many measures are needed in the short term in order to deal with and resolve all of the problems that currently plague this sector, and they are not easy to implement. I am talking about an integrated maritime development plan, which is essential for making aquaculture facilities in freshwater, sub-coastal and offshore areas compatible with areas for tourism and other activities of financial importance, all within the framework of the regulations on environmental protection. I am talking about the drafting of a regulation that will consider the specific aspects of each type of aquaculture farming, to be introduced above all with the intention of lowering production costs and of guaranteeing environmental protection. From this perspective I believe that the contribution made by both technological innovation and scientific research is crucial. The task will be to actually establish facilities to reduce the dispersion of feed into the water. To this end it will be necessary to increase the utilisation of plant instead of animal proteins without altering the nutritional value of the catch. With regard, more specifically, to scientific research on feed, we will also have to focus on waste and processing scraps to prevent likely imbalances in the maritime system caused by dangerous overfishing for fish feed. The use of the European quality label helps us to compete with products imported from third countries and to meet consumers’ needs and health requirements. Indeed, I believe that it is now crucial that we introduce product certification and supervision of the sector to enable these products to be identified, and adapt the labelling systems accordingly. Last but not least, we need to design facilities that take greater account of the wellbeing of fish, farm density and slaughtering methods. Moreover, these are all measures that should be applied to organic products, too, which are in fact the result of production that is on a smaller scale and less damaging to the environment. The employment aspect must not be underestimated, since the aquaculture sector may also be the best place for fishermen who have lost their jobs. A full vote by Parliament will certainly be the best incentive for the Commission, after its communication and our reasoned opinion, to go beyond the stage of recommendation to the Member States and actually propose the measures needed in order to develop a European policy and to stop Europe being the producer of 1.2 million tonnes of fish and the consumer of over 5.5 million tonnes. Thank you, and excuse me for running over. Guido Milana,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the debate and for your positive comments on this document, which has all the same enjoyed widespread support over the last few months. Commissioner, you have a historic opportunity. In 2001 Parliament discussed this same subject and published a communication, but there has been no follow-up. However, today I believe that the time is ripe. Since 2001 world aquaculture production has increased by 6% while European production has barely increased by 0.8%. Indeed, with such a broad consensus – which I believe will result in a majority vote by this House in an hour or so – you have the real possibility to put our work to good use. What is more, the Council has also encouraged you in this direction by fully endorsing the stance that Parliament is taking. I believe, therefore, that this occasion must be fully taken advantage of in two ways. I would have liked to have said this to Mr Stevenson, who is no longer here: delegislation and simplification absolutely do not mean lowering the level of guarantees for operators and consumers. Often, delegislation can mean making the guarantees clearer for both consumers and producers. Therefore we need to make an effort along these lines. There is only one point on which I too disagree slightly. I believe that you are too resigned to matters to challenge the European framework surrounding the powers of the Directorates-General. Have the courage to do so, Commissioner. Have the courage to do so, because simplification in the interests of Member States and European citizens only helps to strengthen European integration. If there is one thing that is clear to me, it is the specific point that Parliament is making to you today: that one should not always be restricted with regard to the powers of the Directorates-General. There is someone who assigns those powers, I therefore ask you to reflect on them too. This does not mean taking away a duty or function from the authority supervising the environment. It does not mean taking away a function from the authority supervising consumer protection. It means having a Europe in which these functions are fully integrated. That is basically the sole aim of the single regulation: to streamline the regulations in order to make them simpler and more practical for operators. I have one last comment. After the speech this morning I am tempted to go on holiday to Scotland, and I may just consider doing that, but I would not be against Greece either, if I could change your mind there about the last few points which divide us. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to highlight two points and also thank Mr Romeva i Rueda for his extraordinary work. The first point is that this is an important occasion because we are adopting a law at first reading for the first time. The second is that this work has a deadline and that deadline, as Mr Romeva i Rueda already stated at the beginning, is the next Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) meeting, in four years’ time. If what we have written and will adopt today works, then in four years’ time we will probably not have the problem of inclusion in the CITES. That is my hope. I do not want this so much for the sake of fishermen, but for the sake of tuna. The effectiveness of our action derives from our ability, over the next four years, to apply the regulation that is adopted today and to develop supervision conditions. I would like to say a few words on this aspect. We have an extraordinary Control Agency in Vigo, which does a good job of controlling tuna fishing in the Mediterranean. Yet this agency, which has limited funding and needs greater resources, single-handedly coordinates controls, or rather it offers the individual Member States the possibility to do so. I think we need to take a look at this agency and try to create the conditions to grant it direct responsibility for controls and a greater degree of authority that goes beyond simple coordination. Please excuse me for running over. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I support – and I have also tabled amendments in this regard – the inclusion of bluefin tuna in Appendix II. Supporting this certainly does not make feel me like a criminal. On the contrary, I feel very much on the same wavelength as those who, before me, starting with Mrs Gardini, upheld a different position. It is deeply flawed to put tigers, polar bears, elephants and tuna on equal terms. The FAO would never allow itself to say anything different or to support a different position for these other endangered species. Holding a different view on how to manage the tuna issue certainly does not mean forgetting that biodiversity is a value that must be defended at all costs. The spirit of the motion for a resolution is absolutely worthy of support. However, at a time when some people seem to be taking a step backwards in terms of estimating tuna biomass in the sea, rapidly moving towards inclusion in Appendix I probably means overlooking the side effects of this choice, which are severe and sometimes irreversible in many sectors of our economy. In some ways, the same goes for the issue of coral and for its inclusion in Appendix II. Here, too, there is data that does not definitely indicate the extinction or endangerment of deep coral, coral that is at a depth of more than 150-200 metres, which is what is covered by the measure. Guido Milana  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT) 
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make just two observations. I think that we ought not to argue about greater privatisation, competition or what have you. It is clear that the logic of rushing to reduce costs is a negative factor in terms of safety standards. When there are attempts to reduce costs because a major competition mechanism is launched, it is inevitable that safety standards should fall. The real issue is that I believe the Commission ought to initiate a more rigorous phase based around a more strategic role for the European Railway Agency. It ought to take on a role of greater coordination, control and supervision over the national safety agencies, and it ought to do so in a much speedier manner precisely because of the differences between the various countries, which my fellow Members have already alluded to, regarding contradictions between national and European legislation. In my view, there are huge delays on this aspect. The model ought to be that of the European Aviation Safety Agency, and it should have the same binding powers over actions and enforcement. If there is a call to be made to the Commission today, it is that it should move more swiftly in this direction. The Commissioner has said that we need to wait for the results of the investigations into the accidents. On the contrary, I believe that these results will add nothing to the existing situation. Another element, Commissioner, which probably does not fall within your sphere of responsibilities, and which is probably also outside the scope of this evening’s debate, is that, all too often, the legislation as a whole does not ensure that anyone suffering loss or damage as a result of a railway accident – given that the rate of railway accidents is still low – receives immediate acknowledgment from the person bearing liability for it.

 Mr President, we still have a long way to go, but today we may have taken an important step towards finally introducing and levying a tax on financial transactions. I understand the prudence, the caution, the need to do things gradually expressed by Mr Šemeta and the technical issues rightly raised by Ms Vestager. Precisely for this reason, though, I hope that Parliament will express a clear, political will, with a broad majority, in order to encourage and drive forward the initiatives necessary to address the unresolved problems, especially at Council level. We all want to closely examine the impact of this tax, but it is not right to stir up unfounded fears which could even lead to contradictory and counterproductive choices. I refer, for example, to the rationale behind the proposed exemptions. If we are careful to reduce the impact of the tax, it is important to have as broad a tax base as possible, with a low rate, and not to attempt to extend the exemptions ad infinitum
. To those who are concerned about the consequences for small investors, I would point out the progressive nature of the tax, so those who carry out several transactions are affected more, and it is clear that the competent authorities must, in any case, ensure that there are no attempts to offload the possible costs onto end users. I therefore hope that Parliament will vote in favour of this tax by a large majority. Leonardo Domenici  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to ask Mr Barroso some questions, but I am happy to ask them of Mr Rehn. Commissioner, have you and the European Commission read that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) does not expect Italy to balance its budget in 2013 or very likely in 2014 either? Does this forecast stimulate any particular thoughts? I am speaking about Italy, but I could very easily be speaking about other countries. The strangest thing is that the IMF tells us, of course, that if there were no recession, Italy would have a surplus of 0.6%. That is great. However, the problem is that there is a crisis, there is a recession, and it is difficult to pretend that there is not. Mr Rehn, in Europe, are we making choices based on an analysis of the actual situation we are experiencing, or are we simply applying a doctrine based on abstract principles? I believe that we continue to focus on objectives that are not in line with the economic cycle. Commissioner, today, we have been told about the European Commission’s plans for growth, but are you sure that growth based on supply-side policy principles is enough, without considering the at least equal importance of a policy that acts on the aggregate demand side? Commissioner, I shall end with an appeal. I beg you to speak truthfully to European citizens, truthfully about the crisis and the concrete fact that we still do not have any choices to take at the moment. Leonardo Domenici  (S&amp;D

Mr President, yesterday in Florence, an extremely serious event took place which has caused horror and anguish: an armed fifty year-old man opened fire on five citizens of Senegalese origin in two markets in Florence – two of these victims have died and three are now in a serious condition in hospital. The murderer then committed suicide. The man was a member of the racist and xenophobic far right, who wanted to kill people who were strangers to him, guilty only of having black skin. Florence is my city, and before being elected to the European Parliament I was mayor of Florence for ten years. Florence is a civilised and democratic city, with a gold medal for resistance to Nazi fascism. Yet this abominable racist crime took place in Florence, a demonstration of the fact that Nazi fascistic madness can appear anywhere and we must never think that it has been wholly eradicated. Mr President, I ask you to express the European Parliament’s grief and to repeat this House’s commitment to combating every kind of intolerance and racism and working to improve respect for the dignity and rights of all human beings. Leonardo Domenici  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis is not a new phenomenon; it has existed for several years. Perhaps now is the time to undertake a critical review of the policies implemented up to now: have things always been done well? Have we always analysed the situation correctly? Has the right approach been chosen? Has the European Central Bank which, as Minister Rostoski said, has saved Europe, always taken the correct course of action, even when it has raised interest rates through fear of inflation? President Barroso has identified a problem: the speed of the markets and the slowness of policy; yet is this the only problem? Of course, if we consider that we are still implementing the 21 July agreement, this ought at least to suggest that we need to prepare for and organise summits and their conclusions better, but policy will always lag behind the markets. We therefore need to look further, concentrating our efforts on combating unemployment and encouraging growth. These are the areas that the European Commission should focus on; even today in President Barroso’s speech, there was more substance with regard to the deficit than with regard to signs of growth and development. The Commission must overcome its failings and state that the priority is the fight against unemployment, job creation, the redistribution of wealth and public investment strategies, while also amending the rules in the new European Stability and Growth Pact.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Tusk, your speech fills us with hope, the hope that the Polish Presidency will help combat the Europe of national selfishness, which fails to look to the future, and will help further a Europe that genuinely thinks of itself as being real, integrated and sharing a common destiny. However, as you rightly said in your speech, presidencies have specific problems to tackle and solve. In the short time that I have, I wish to draw your attention to two crucial issues relating to the economic and financial crisis. The first issue concerns the reform of the financial markets. This is not a technical problem but a major democratic issue of our time. Too much time is being taken: we need to settle issues such as the one relating to the reform of short selling and over-the-counter derivatives. The second issue is that we have the matter of the tax on financial transactions to address; we need to look at this issue in detail, and we hope that the Polish Presidency will make a real contribution in this regard. Leonardo Domenici,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to join in thanking Mr Langen and the other Members with whom we have worked to finalise this complex report. I think that Mr Langen made a particularly important point when he said that we wish to maintain the scope of this regulation, keeping faith with the mandate of the G20 in Pittsburgh in 2009. The basic objective was to bring the majority of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives onto regulated platforms in order to prevent their continuing exposure to a high level of risk and speculation. When it comes down (as it did) to exchanging or guaranteeing USD 400 million without collateral, that is, without adequate reserves, the risks we are running become clear. Having said that, however, I should also like to raise two problems. The first problem is the relationship with the Council; the second problem is the coherence of the proposal for reform of the financial markets that we must take forward. I raise the problem regarding the Council first and I say it very clearly. The feeling is all too often that the Council represents an obstacle to reforming the financial markets swiftly and well. I hope that the new Presidency will take on this problem because this time too we have to factor in an extension that is due in large measure to positions, difficulties and disputes arising in the Council. It is a problem that also affects the procedure that we wish to follow. The second question relates to the coherence and specificity of the provisions. There is not only the measure on OTC derivatives but also the measure on short selling and other matters. I would like to draw attention to two points: the specific issue of the commodities market, a special market that requires special anti-speculation measures, and the problem of the exposure in derivatives of local authorities in EU countries. I think that these are problems on which Parliament must intervene. Leonardo Domenici  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we are witnessing a paradox. The package that should correct and prevent imbalances and asymmetries is based on an imbalance and a lack of symmetry. It is like a body that stands on two legs, but one is much longer and more developed than the other. The leg that controls fiscal policy is muscular and articulated, while the one that controls development policy, which should provide impetus and long-term drive, appears spindly and lacking in strength. I think that this inharmonious result in the final structure of the package is down to a difference of opinion about the origins and nature of the crisis. The difference between those who believe that disorder and imbalances in public finances are at the root of the crisis and those who think that the underlying problem has to do instead with the lack of rules and transparency in the markets, economic and trade imbalances and social inequality. We risk confusing cause and effect. We all want public finances to be controlled responsibly, but the goal of reducing debt is not sufficient to kick-start growth and competitiveness. The main thrust of these measures lies in procedures and sanctions. Far less emphasis – too little emphasis – has been placed on investment and sustainable growth strategy, which Europe should promote and implement. We know that our actions can lead to widely differing results, even without our intending it, and can even have the opposite effect to the one we are seeking to achieve. This is the heterogenesis of purpose. I fear that this problem lies at the heart of this package. Leonardo Domenici  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Podimata’s report contains many important aspects that are not limited to the issue of the financial transaction tax. The report is packed with analysis and suggestions and I hope it is widely supported by this House. It could be the basis for the genuine new European tax policy that we need. On the subject of tax harmonisation, this report also contains proposals that move towards a tax harmonisation that gives new strength and subjectivity to Europe, although it is clear that at the moment, the debate focuses mainly on the financial transaction tax, to be applied as a first step across Europe. I think this is the time for courageous decisions, which should be applied in a balanced way, but still indicate the direction forward. I believe that Europe has a responsibility to show the world the way ahead; I believe that this House has a responsibility to send out a signal and a political message. Let me say one thing to Mr Schmidt, whose intelligence and lucidity I really respect: be careful with the arguments we use, because if we say today that we cannot levy a financial transaction tax because there are tax havens, we will make European citizens feel helpless at a time when many of these financial institutions are starting to go back into the black. Not only the Socialists are saying this. In my country, Italy, this proposal is also supported by many autonomous and independent groups; it is also supported by the Catholic, democratic movement for the promotion of development and balanced growth.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although the theme of good tax governance has always been of great importance, it has become even more relevant and significant following the major economic and financial crisis of two years ago. European and international summits – the G20 – have discussed and continue to discuss it, particularly when they are concerned with fighting tax evasion and tax havens. All this is important. It is a sign of commitment and willpower, but we should not delude ourselves into thinking that an announcement is all it is going to take. We need an effective and ongoing policy. There are still many problems to be dealt with. It really is still much too easy to buy or set up a front company in order to avoid taxation. Just look around on the Internet: there are thousands of websites offering companies for sale, even in European Union countries. Often, all you have to do is send an email and attach a photocopy of a scanned passport in order to set up a company. We must put a stop to the practice of creating fictitious legal entities to evade tax. The report I am presenting is based on the European Commission communication of 28 April 2009 on Promoting Good Governance in Tax Matters. The report moves towards putting forward firm proposals, and calls for a strong commitment from the European Commission and Council, so that these proposals can be implemented. The fight against tax havens, tax evasion and illicit capital flight must be considered priorities of the European Union. Hence the principle of good governance, based on transparency, exchange of information, cross-border cooperation, and fair tax competition. The point is that we need increasing tax cooperation and collaboration in the European Union. The general objective that we must set ourselves is for automatic information exchange on a global and multilateral scale, but this must, obviously, start within the European Union. As Mrs Alvarez has already said, we must completely abolish bank secrecy in European Union countries and hasten to put an end to the temporary derogation that allows the application of a withholding tax, which is often evaded or underestimated, instead of an exchange of information. I do not wish to dwell on the tangible proposals that the report contains. I will, however, stress that we still particularly need the following things: to extend the scope of the 2003 Savings Directive, to fight VAT fraud, to create an EU public register listing the names of individuals and undertakings having set up companies or accounts in tax havens and to give new impetus to tax harmonisation projects, beginning with the common corporate consolidated tax base. The European Union must also send out only one message internationally, and fight for the improvement of OECD standards to achieve the automatic sharing of information, instead of sharing on request. Mr Kovács, having listened to the other reports as well, we need strong commitment by the Commission and we now also need these priorities to be emphasised to the new Commission at the time of handover. As the European Parliament, we are entitled to call on the Council and the Commission to account for their work. I thank my fellow Members, and especially the shadow rapporteurs, for the contribution they have made to this work, which I hope will be adopted by Parliament. Leonardo Domenici,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my thanks for the comments on our reports, the products of a collective effort. I hope that these comments are a good omen for a positive vote by the European Parliament. I believe that – as Mr Stolojan and Mr Casa also said – our reports deserve support, if only on behalf of all our fellow citizens: honest taxpayers, who are the first to suffer from fraud and tax evasion. The aim is to make everyone pay, so that each individual has to pay less. I would just like to make two comments. Mrs Lulling spoke, at the beginning of the debate, about tax colonoscopy. I know from experience that a colonoscopy is not a pleasant examination, even if it can be very beneficial to human health. In the sphere of tax, there is a very simple way of avoiding it: it is simply not to conceal, not to hide one’s own income and not to evade one’s legal obligations. The second comment is that it is right to always be concerned about how public money is being used, but it is also right to do so when governments are forced to use that public money to bail out banks and financial institutions that have speculated their money.

Mr President, we are here to debate again a topic of great importance. The positive outcome of the negotiations on the treaty for visually impaired and blind people will finally open access to millions of books across the world. We are dealing with a fundamental right, not with charity. Commissioner Barnier, I remember and recognise your personal commitment more than a year ago here in this room. We are now taking the very last steps before an agreement. In Marrakesh the Commission and the Member States must find a compromise to the deadlock we are now facing. Two points are still open. Excuse me if I go into detail. Are you going to change the provision in the current text on the commercial availability requirement which is basically watering down the meaning of the Treaty, which would be, paradoxically, even less ambitious than a memorandum of understanding? We must delete commercial availability. Secondly, are you allowing for the possibility of sending a book to an individual rather than two organisations? Remember the opportunities offered by current technology. Let us come back to the core reason for the treaty. The current legal framework and the functioning of the market are not sufficient to provide a real solution to the book famine that the visually impaired still live with. Our goal is to have a good and effective treaty for the benefit of blind and visually-impaired people. We will not just be unlocking a problem affecting millions of European citizens, we will also be showing our loyalty to our constitutive values – human dignity, culture, equality and freedom of access.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to congratulate Ms Geringer de Oedenberg for her most patient and persistent work, which has led to a result that we look upon favourably, despite a number of question marks. The directive we are going to adopt is important, not only because it increases the number of people with access to artistic and original works – which, in itself, is highly significant – but also because it marks a break from a position which, to date, has had a negative effect on the spread of culture: a reverence for copyright to the extent of wishing to defend it even if there is no right holder, who might have died or is unconcerned. Moreover, the narrow-mindedness of collecting societies is an obstacle to the spread of culture, which is why we have arrived here with delays and with great difficulty. I refer, for example, to attitudes on access for blind people to cultural works and attitudes on private copying. On this issue, we have found ourselves confronted with a kind of wall, which today – thanks to this measure – we have been able to demolish or at least breach. The measure we are going to adopt has great political significance and the step forward we are about to take surely deserves our approval. There are, no doubt, some shortcomings – so I also understand some of the concerns raised by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance – but these do not add up to a reason to fail to grasp this opportunity and the significant innovation that this step represents. Fortunately, Mr Barnier has tabled the regulation on collecting societies under debate in our committee, so we are addressing this critical issue in order that the whole range of arguments and topics relating to copyright can be dealt with in the right way. It is a good proposal, which we think needs amending and improving but is worthy of support, thus convincing us yet further to vote in favour. Luigi Berlinguer  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to draw this Chamber’s attention to the fact that yesterday, it was officially announced that the Higgs boson has been measured and definitively identified. The particle that gives mass to all the others and their existence, and this happened on European soil. Science brings our earth to life, it gives us civilisation and well-being and, for a time, we can aspire to becoming a scientific hub once again. Utopia is characteristic of man, who invents a utopia and wants to build it, and it is through science and this wonderful ambition man has that today someone who is blind, who has no eyes, can see with his hands or read a book with his ears, and a young South African boy who has no legs can compete in the Olympics in a race. Well, Europe must be the home of science! This great event that will open up new frontiers of knowledge must be completely supported by Europe. Luigi Berlinguer  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) has been a very serious political mistake, not to mention a legal one, because it has caused a worldwide reaction of immense proportions, and that is enough to say that it is a political mistake. Why immense? Because it has created the suspicion that access to the Web, which is a great modern revolution, would really be inhibited. Why is this? Because it has made the mistake of lumping together counterfeiting and piracy, which are two totally different issues. The way to combat counterfeiting has nothing to do with copyright. Then there is another mistake, in that it has excluded Parliament from an important activity that it has been doing for some time: creating a new copyright, although some people would like to retain the old copyright law, which existed before the Web. The point is that we have to work on copyright and put ACTA aside, as it is an obstacle. We have to reject it, exclude it, because it is an obstacle to our work. Fortunately, the Commission, after months and years of hesitation, has brought two important measures to the attention of Parliament: orphan works and the one regarding copyright management companies. This is positive; let us work on this rationally rather than just emotionally, but without letting ACTA get in the way. Luigi Berlinguer,  
rapporteur. 
– Madam President, let me thank all the colleagues of the Committee on Culture and Education for their collaboration in preparing this report on the Bologna process on the consolidation and development of a European university system. I have a dream that every student applying to a university in any Member State should be enabled to get a degree, a qualification valid in all the territories of Europe, within the whole European labour market. This is definitely one of the ways to build up European unity and European citizenship. This is the deep meaning of this report. (Loud applause) Luigi Berlinguer,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I too would like to echo the warm greetings extended to Mr Lechner and the assessment of his work, which he carried out with competency, tenacity and determination: a labour of love, sometimes this draft regulation met with an obstacle and he withdrew it and began negotiating again with the Council, with the Commission, and with the Committee on Legal Affairs. I believe he can be proud of this. I note that there is unanimous consensus in his favour. Turning to this regulation of ours, I too am convinced that this is an important thing, which may not hit the headlines in the press, may not be considered high politics, but the construction of the European Union also involves meeting the needs of citizens in their daily lives – first and foremost of those millions of people with interests in more than one Member State dealing with procedures that are difficult to unravel, tedious and which sometimes touch on sensitive issues at the heart of a family which politics generally finds difficult to grasp. The European Union should take pride in being based on such sensitive attention. The solutions that have been proposed are new and intelligent ones. For example, those drawing up a will have been given the freedom to choose between their habitual residence and their state of origin. This makes decision-making more flexible, since there are such major differences between one State and another that the question of succession could always be rather tricky. But the law has also been made more certain, because once the legal solution has been chosen – either habitual residence or country of origin – this requires limitations of the jurisdiction and of the conflicts that can arise and therefore it is a more peaceful way of proceeding in this area and so there is more freedom and more certainty. Then there is the certificate of succession: now, we may believe that certificates are of little importance, but they create the conditions to ensure the heir is in a condition of greater flexibility and certainty with regard to all the possible difficulties that may arise. That is a positive aspect of this law. It is true,  this law is by no means perfect: there are problems concerning whether there is an executor of the will or not, the feasibility of direct inheritance, and so on, but I just want to say another word of a political nature. We hope that the Council will approve this text, and we hope it will become law. However, we must not lay this text to rest, because we cannot have England in a different condition – with the United Kingdom left like that – because Europe cannot do without the United Kingdom, and so we must therefore make sure that we overcome these difficulties. Thank you. Luigi Berlinguer,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has produced a massive amount of laws and standards to establish European legislation, and has created the European area known as the Stockholm Programme. There is an imbalance between this monumental amount of legislation and the use which citizens make of it, which is numerically, in percentage terms, very limited. On the other hand, national judges, lawyers working within individual States have grown up with the legislation of their own country and are mainly trained in this sense, whereas we believe that the true European judges are national judges capable of changing their mentality and imbuing themselves with a knowledge of European law. Therefore, before talking about training we need to discuss a great communication campaign aimed at citizens and legal practitioners, so that they can be the vehicles for this great innovation andso that they can increase capacity to profit from the benefits provided by this legislation. Primarily, though, it is a grassroots movement that must be created, through in-service training – we cannot provide judicial training of professionally highly qualified adults as if it were a lesson for schoolchildren. We must stimulate curiosity in dealing with their cases, encouraging them to connect with other colleagues and to come up with solutions, given that today common law and civil law are converging, and are not as far apart as they once were within our judicial culture. This is the real point. In our proposals, and I am happy that the European Commission is now convinced of this, we are calling for a reversal of the trend: bottom-up, more legal status than judicial training. There in a very interesting example in the Netherlands, called Eurinfra: it is a network of leaders in every court who spread this knowledge and push magistrates on this issue. This is the substance of our project, and we hope to have the full support of the Commission. Luigi Berlinguer,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the purpose of this report is to relaunch the initiative on the Bologna Process, keeping in our minds and in our sights an important goal, which is that qualifications awarded by universities across Europe must have overall recognition and validity. Once someone has earned a qualification at a university in a Member State, it must be such that all other universities recognise it, this is the main objective. It is a mistake to consider university education as a matter that is exclusively internal to Member States. The true dimension of the university and place of study is international, because studies and research are international, and professions are now international. We need to free the professional market from the shackles and ties which today impede employment mobility within Europe. This is a precondition that has economic value and also provides a response to a great aspiration on the part of young people. Who is this task incumbent on? It is up to individual Member States to organise study courses, but recognition abroad is not a task that can be performed within the State, it is up to the European Union to provide and make a policy to encourage this. Article 149 of the Treaty of Lisbon states that it is the task of the EU to recognise qualifications, contribute to the development of the quality of education and higher education, and develop its European dimension. For this reason, our report points out that, as well as the responsibility of the Member States, there is also a need to underline the EU’s responsibility; and the biennial meetings of the ministers of education, such as the upcoming one in Bucharest, must gradually come under the remit of the EU. What is to be done then? Our report identifies a number of measures, within the framework of a series of procedures, a gradual approach to achieve them: to support any actions that tend to give a European profile to universities within the EU; curriculum flexibility; learning outcomes and consequently monitoring for the assessment of learning outcomes; assessment for the quality of what happens in universities as a condition to create that trust between different higher educational establishments which lies at the heart of mutual recognition. The final goal is to set up automatic procedures that attest to the validity of qualifications throughout Europe. Secondly, remove social barriers against young people, against students from weaker sections of society, which today are being exacerbated by the cuts on the part of many governments. Change the teaching, to make it more learning centred, develop life-long learning, build a European higher education sector to enter into dialogue with the European research sector. These measures are instruments of growth. More than 900 years ago in Bologna, a great jurist, Irnerius, spread the idea of creating with the Alma Mater
 the unification of European culture. It was a time when there were no States. Now that States do exist, there is a supranational dimension and today for that reason we call upon the EU to promote a European university citizenship. Thank you. Luigi Berlinguer  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what we are asking for is a new treaty to regulate exceptions for the visually impaired on cultural works and on books. This is not charity – it is a fundamental right to access culture. The European Union and, in particular, the Commission, has not been particularly active: it has not done enough and has, in my opinion, been too conservative, almost to the point, in essence, of boycotting the Treaty itself. I refer to the amendments proposed by the European Union in November in Geneva. Fine words need to be followed up by concrete action. Voluntary agreements are not enough: it is a treaty that we need. So we must remove the legal obstacles that block the circulation and usage of works in Braille and in electronic format, the latter being particularly suitable for the visually impaired. We must no longer come up with the pretext that the treaty represents a danger for copyright per se

Madam President, Commissioner, in Europe growth is now a necessity we can no longer put off. It depends also on liberalisation measures addressing the obstacles and privileges that are strangling the internal digital market as well. Among these is the need for a new copyright regime, in particular for collective rights management, given that copyright represents 7% of our European gross domestic product (GDP). Reform is urgent, Commissioner, and we have awaiting it for a long time now. It has been announced many times with deadlines and dates that have never been respected, as you have indirectly admitted. We have been waiting for this directive for over two years, just as we have been hoping that the subject of Directive 2004/48/EC on the Enforcement of Property Rights and Directive 2001/29/EC would be addressed by an up-to-date scheme of exceptions. One had hoped that it would come to pass within this parliamentary term. Yet today our debate is contaminated with ‘ideologisms’ that artificially set artists in conflict with the right of free access to the web, in a paralysing conflict that is both noxious and sterile. All this must be resolved with innovative legal and technological ideas for a new concept of artists’ rights, which begins in the first place with their management. Although interesting proposals and opinions have been put forward, no progress has been made on this idea. Mr Barnier, you had significant success with patents, for which I congratulate you because I hold you in high esteem. On this issue, however, you are stalling. Why? Both you and the rapporteur, Ms Gallo, have spoken of genuine difficulties which, as you have said, partly justify this delay. The problem is that existing collective management companies and record companies represent powerful interests that are defending their patch. That is the main obstacle. I say no to territoriality, no to reasonable derogations, no to broad collective licences, no to incentives for new business models, no to greater transparency, no to interoperability for format shifting. All this is what makes for delay. What we need are well-fashioned reforms that do not create oligopolies capable of distorting the market, the cultural industries and small players and of stifling diversity and the cultural wealth of Europe. That is why we are hoping that this ‘spring’, awaited so earnestly by all, will finally arrive. Luigi Berlinguer  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the absence of a European patent can no longer be tolerated. Businesses in Europe are being penalised when it comes to patenting by costs 10 times as high as those faced by their US and Japanese competitors. Besides, the fragmentation of copyright in patents is one of the causes holding back economic recovery. The Commission is offering us enhanced cooperation with a specific language regime, something that we do not welcome. Nevertheless, there is something new. 25 out of 27 states are participating. The political framework has changed. Positive development may be possible, with an enhancement even of the proposer’s language, for example. We must all now work to achieve better respect for all. Besides, we want the Italian language to be protected and enhanced, but our government has cut funding and is very neglectful of this aspect. It is on this other ground that we shall be urging it on, but we must achieve a European patent. Luigi Berlinguer,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, due to the change in the agenda approved yesterday by this House, I would firstly like to express my approval for the fact that the Committee on Legal Affairs has unanimously approved the draft report that we are voting on today. The fact that the construction of the European judicial space finds such a broad consensus in Parliament is important. The Stockholm Programme envisages that everyday life should be intrinsic to the process of constructing a Europe of citizens and not merely of political forces or institutional representations. It sets out to resolve the everyday problems of Europeans by the real and unified creation of an effective market of labour, goods and services, entrepreneurial activity without internal borders and without red tape, to strengthen the common basis of rights of succession, contracts, consumers, timely payments, the family, children and more. It will also be the duty and responsibility of the justice system, national judiciaries, solicitors, accountants and workers who operate within individual States to build Europe, to interpret the laws that unite our continent. Our past is marked by different judicial and legal traditions – Common law and Civil law – with differences between the French or German systems and histories that are sometimes very different. We respect national prerogatives and the principle of subsidiarity, but we realise that in order to build Europe – and fortunately we are still on that road – we need progressive convergence that is based on the great constitutional tradition of fundamental rights for which Europe stands. Mr President, the Action Plan that we will approve sets out to construct, reinforce, extend and disseminate a solid European judicial culture, a European legal mindset. That is why I will vote in favour. Luigi Berlinguer  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in recent days, the Veneto region of Italy has been hit by serious natural disasters, in particular, the provinces of Vicenza, Padova and Verona. These catastrophic floods have affected around 500 000 people in various ways and have caused hundreds of millions of euro of damage. This tragedy has brought all productive sectors, small and medium-sized enterprises, and various other sectors, to their knees. I should like to appeal to my fellow Members and the European institutions to do everything possible to support these people and find solutions to respond to this disaster, within the limits of the rules set out by the European Union Solidarity Fund and the Structural Funds. I should also like to note that Italy also has another reason to weep today, although for a completely different reason: the collapse of Pompeii. I only wished to note it here in order to emphasise the significance and importance of an event of this type and the need for Europe to keep an eye on these things as well. Luigi Berlinguer,  
deputising for the author.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we called for this oral question and a parliamentary resolution to make the Commission aware of the vital importance of fostering a common judicial culture throughout Europe as part of the Stockholm Programme. I would like to say at the outset that this is important but also that, with a view to the communication that the Commission will have to produce on future pilot projects, as already discussed, we would like to clarify some points. First of all, we would like the parliamentary consultations to start soon so that we do not get to the initial phase, when we begin to draw up an idea for these future projects, too late when the projects have already been more or less fully formulated. I say this because we have some basic observations to make. National judges and prosecutors in individual states are now crucial pawns in the construction of Europe because, by interpreting national rights in a European light, they can lay the ground for settling disputes and regulating the daily lives of citizens. By doing so, they engender a sense of European citizenship; they engender a European sensibility in everyone who inhabits these lands. This comes about because the people are made to feel the tangible benefits of introducing European elements and hence Community law, above all, into all State laws so that our citizens can live better lives. This offers real advantages for overcoming problems that would otherwise remain unresolved. By saying this, my aim is to turn the whole system slightly on its head. For example, we do not agree that these projects should be along the lines of Erasmus projects because the number of judges and prosecutors involved in Erasmus-style projects would be very low. This could not be otherwise due to the high costs of physical mobility in this field and the numbers would not therefore be very significant within the judiciary as a whole. The most important question concerns the term ‘familiarisation courses’, which we introduced in our paper. Judges are not schoolchildren sitting behind their desks waiting to be taught a lesson. They are mature and highly professional people with little time to spare and who cannot therefore easily move around. Despite this, they hold a valuable store of knowledge and should be stimulated to pit their knowledge against the new problems of European law and European culture. This will create fertile ground for exchanges, virtual rather than physical, using technologies, the Internet and the various opportunities such exchanges can create. Their starting point should be not so much a general approach but rather the individual cases, the individual problems that judges and prosecutors have to deal with. The cases and problems are new and must stimulate the professional growth of these legal operators, providing them with the stimulus they need to make an effective contribution, based on autobiographical reflection on their experience and what they have learned, to respond to the challenges represented by Europe in positive terms. As you see, Mr President, Commissioner, we intend to break with the tradition of the courses that have been held so far and that we feel are not really fit for purpose. We would like to know how much and what funds are available and express our doubts over the idea – as we stated in our communication – of a Central European institution to oversee this process because we are in favour of a bottom-up movement and against centralisation. This is a new approach. What we wish to point out, however, is that unless we shape a European mentality among judges and prosecutors, who will, in this way, offer their services to justice and the citizens who call for it, we will not make Europe. This is therefore not only an important charter for European justice; it is an important charter for the development of European unity as a whole. Luigi Berlinguer  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, concluding negotiations with Croatia during 2010 is a feasible aim and the Swoboda report is a balanced examination of our progress and the steps we still need to take. Justice is now the area in which hard-hitting reform is still required. It is not enough to complete the necessary system reforms, adopt new laws and cooperate as required with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. I stress the need to build a true legal culture and mentality in line with European standards. Crucial to this is the independence of the judiciary, which is a central issue, and also the training, recruitment and career of magistrates, in other words, the fact that the government must not impose conditions of any kind on judges. I call on the Commission to consider the need for hard-hitting measures that address these issues during the final stage of the negotiations. Luigi Berlinguer  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, two innovations have been introduced by the Stockholm Programme as compared with the Hague Programme: a fair balance between rights and security and legal protection in both the criminal and the civil spheres. Security is a right: it means not being attacked in one’s own workplace, walking the streets without risking one’s life, not being the object of violence as a woman, not being exposed to acts of terrorism. The Member States and Europe must guarantee security. However, security measures that diminish the guarantees of freedom are measures that remove certainty from the law, and are thus the source of insecurity and barbarities. Think of Guantánamo. Europe is the fatherland of rights. The Stockholm Programme defines them today with an abundance of detail. There is a fair balance between, on the one hand, the discipline of measures to prevent crime and, on the other, the daily lives of citizens and their family, social, economic, work and study relations, which are all regulated by civil law and the civil justice system. That is the citizen’s Europe. It should be constructed within the Member States and the Community institutions. European society is more united, and mobility is more pronounced than is commonly believed. Mobility is now a right. The borders between the Member States are not impermeable walls, but nets through which society filters daily. The Stockholm Programme constitutes the institutional cornerstone that provides for judicial cooperation and mutual recognition, a European justice system (made up of the national systems and the Community system), both national and Community law, European citizens and European courts (both national and Community courts). European rules are dictated by Community rules and by the case-law of the European courts, but they also derive from the conduct of workers, businesses, students, and judges, both national and belonging to the European networks between operators of justice. It is a bottom-up process that the Stockholm Programme wishes to support. Parliament has done a great job with this resolution, which I hope will be adopted here by a large, unanimous vote, for which we have worked extremely hard. The Council should take it into proper account. The Treaty of Lisbon has not yet entered into force, but it is here, and present. Minister, may the Council be ambitious, and may it take to heart what we have drafted here and the many demands arising from it. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, an excellent compromise has been achieved which puts Europe on the right track to achieve the goals of the climate package. One of the successes is having maintained the target of 3% in relation to the energy efficiency of public buildings, an ambitious target at a time of economic crisis, which has great environmental value and will act as a lever for the EU’s economic growth. The directive lays the foundations for redesigning energy saving strategies, for which both private and public operators will need to call on experts in the sector, without whom the established goals will be difficult to achieve. That therefore paves the way for encouraging national training programmes for audit and energy saving experts. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, we have to face the evidence that all the available data are pointing to, which is the depletion of fish stocks. Some fish stocks have been seriously jeopardised, and therefore our objective must be to guarantee sustainable fishing if we wish to increase future fish production in our seas. Today’s debate is an anticipation of some of the central issues of the common fisheries policy. The lack of reliable data means that it is not possible to reach a shared definition of over-capacity, and it is crucial to avoid the risk of adopting measures that could penalise fishermen, given the serious crisis that has hit the sector. Fishing needs to continue to be an important source of employment and sustenance for families. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 as regards electronic identification of bovine animals and deleting the provisions on voluntary beef labelling is of fundamental importance for the defence of quality rearing, the protection of consumer information and food safety. By proposing the abolition of voluntary labelling, the Commission is weakening these aspects and preventing the consumer from having access to additional information, such as the sex, age and diet of bovine animals – elements I consider fundamental for two reasons: because they can help the consumer to make a more informed purchase and because they give added value to the product. The criticisms the Commission has made of the voluntary labelling system are based on heavy administrative burdens not offset by sufficient advantages. I should like to know on what basis this assertion is founded, given that the simulations provided by independent associations instead show that these costs are contained, and therefore justified in order to guarantee information that protects and benefits the consumer. For these reasons, I do not agree with the repeal of Articles 16, 17 and 18 in the Commission’s proposal. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

High-quality products and a strong propensity for research and innovation are the strong points of our economy; if they are to play a more important role then they need a true internal market, where businesses can compete openly. The Programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs 2014-2020 must provide a real opportunity for small and medium-sized enterprises. We need to create a new energy model that is not conditioned by the rising price of oil and can offer European businesses affordable energy access. The creation, as set out in paragraph 16, of a European observatory capable of monitoring the reduction of tax and bureaucratic barriers, and the implementation of cohesion policies, is an interesting idea.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, water is an essential and vital public good, which must be protected by means of an holistic approach to preserve it and rationalise its use. Improving efficiency and sustainability is a duty that we must not shirk, not least in view of the challenges of climate change. The target that we have set ourselves of achieving ecological and chemical ‘good status’ for our water by 2015 is a sine qua non
 of Europe’s environmental policy and a commitment to be strictly monitored. The European Union’s water legislation needs to be enforced and stricter penalty measures should be introduced. Some 20% of water in Europe is lost due to obsolete infrastructure, which it is crucial to improve if we want efficient water resource use and sustainable water management that can address the problems of water shortages and drought.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to congratulate the rapporteurs on the compromises reached in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, as they strengthen the Committee’s proposal by ensuring greater protection for vulnerable groups of consumers and an increase in the information provided. The exclusion of gluten-free products in the initial proposal is a prime example. It would have penalised a continually growing group of people affected by an illness caused by intolerance to an allergen, which does not allow them a complete and balanced diet able to provide an adequate nutritional profile to ensure physical well-being. In future negotiations with the Council a cross-cutting regulation may be proposed in conjunction with regulation (EU) No 1169/2011. In this case the generic term ‘gluten-free’ must appear with the term ‘suitable for coeliacs’ to make a clear distinction between products free from allergens and those for proper nutrition.

 We all remember the extensive damage caused by the flooding in Liguria and Tuscany, which rendered thousands of homes unusable, destroyed networks and infrastructure, and led to the loss of several lives. The economic damage is extremely high. I am astonished that, faced with this emergency, the funds provided for by the Solidarity Fund have not yet been granted. The rapid intervention of the fund is, in fact, essential for its credibility, and we cannot allow mere red tape to delegitimise the instruments that we have put in place. At a time when, following the crisis, citizens are starting to lose faith in Europe, it is vital for the institutions to respond in a timely manner, especially during an emergency.

 With today’s vote, Parliament has shown once again that it fully recognises the importance of volunteering in terms of mutual intercultural enrichment, social inclusion and active citizenship. I would say that it is Europe’s duty to promote and raise the standing of this activity among our citizens. In terms of the creation of social capital and cross-border development, I must stress that by promoting volunteering, the European Union can grasp a precious opportunity to assert and give form to the solidarity and socio-economic cohesion that inspired our founding principles. To that end, I agree with the creation of a European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps and the introduction of instruments providing for greater recognition of the professional skills acquired.

 Mr President, despite the progress that Turkey has made on human rights, I regret to say that violence against women is still one of the country’s most pressing problems. The official Turkish statistics are alarming: 39% of Turkish women are victims of violence. The establishment of the Committee on Equal Opportunities within the Turkish Parliament and the Gender Equality Commission within the Ministry of Education represent a step forward. The recognition of Turkish women’s rights must be an essential part of the negotiations for accession to the European Union. They must be granted the same rights to education, access to employment and to justice that men have. I voted in favour of the report because I hope that Parliament’s requests will be accepted in full by the European Commission. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 The citizens’ initiative introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon is a tool for participatory democracy, which involves citizens in decisions and actively helps to establish the political agenda through a shared path towards stronger European integration. Being able to present the initiative in a public hearing with the direct participation of the relevant parliamentary committee helps to strengthen our dialogue with European citizens, at a particularly difficult time for the solidity of the economy and for consolidation of political Europe. The times we are living in are characterised by the development of Eurosceptic movements, which is why I believe that the initiative is an important step to bring European citizens closer, even physically, to the EU institutions. For this reason, I voted in favour of the amendment to the Rules of Procedure. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, China is an important trade partner for Europe, and I firmly believe that our relations must be strengthened, without neglecting the numerous and persistent obstacles to fair, balanced trade. A new chapter in EU-China trade relations needs to be written, based on reciprocity and compliance with the rules. It is regrettable that China continues to apply non-tariff barriers that limit European companies’ presence in the Chinese market, giving rise to additional costs without creating opportunities for trade. Non-tariff barriers, breaches of intellectual property rights and human rights abuses remain among the biggest problems to solve. I hope that cooperation with the Chinese Government will eliminate the remaining obstacles by 2016, when the World Trade Organisation is due to grant China market economy status.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Armenia is fundamental and strategic for strengthening bilateral relations in the South Caucasus. The renewal of the association agreements with the EU will be crucial in order to pave the way for strengthened regional cooperation. With the EURONEST delegation, I have had the opportunity to visit Armenia and to see for myself the progress that has begun to take place in democratically building the rule of law and respecting human rights on the basis of the partnership agreements initiated in 1999. The participation of Armenia in parliamentary cooperation with EURONEST is an excellent indication of their willingness to adhere to European values and principles, for which there is broad consensus in civil society. I voted in favour of the association agreement and I feel that Armenia should commit itself to resolving the conflict in the south so as to avoid undermining the stability of the country.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the goal of reducing CO2
 emissions by 80-95% by 2050 enables us to lay the foundations for a post-carbon European economy. It also requires us to launch a new industrial revolution based on new thinking about the system of production, involving the whole socio-economic sphere, to create better awareness of energy consumption and the efficient use of land. Research will play a key role in fully exploiting renewable energy. With firm and binding objectives, we shall be able to prepare industry for the transition while preserving its competitiveness at the global level. Europe must take pride in having set out at every level on the road to protecting the environment and combating climate change. There is no way that we can negotiate with the environment, and that is why we must insist on solutions that lead to zero emissions, and why I am convinced that nuclear energy must not form part of the energy mix. As the rapporteur for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE), I am grateful to Mr Leinen and Mr Davies for their excellent cooperation. Thank you. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the report on the European Fisheries Fund (EFF) because I believe it is necessary and should not be delayed, in order to align EFF expenditure in all the EU countries as a matter of urgency. Therefore, I agree with Mr Ferreira in asking for its application at first reading. Ms Damanaki did well to propose an urgent measure for countries with little investment capacity, as this has often been reduced to historic lows as the report shows. The debate about the reform of the common fisheries policy has already begun and therefore, EFF expenditure needs to be accelerated also by increasing the cofinancing threshold by 10%, in order to avoid there being resources from the old programming period still to be spent from the time the new reform applies. It is important to avoid overlapping between the EFF and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF). Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the progress made by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia shows its strong desire to join the European Union. It is a strategic country in the Balkan region, is involved in several European initiatives, and is giving proof of cooperation and openness. The reforms of the judicial system, administrative decentralisation and initial, if weak, signs of a willingness to discuss freedom of expression are very hopeful signs for the future. However, the following issues are still worrying: respect for human rights, corruption levels and the lack of pluralism in the media. This country still has a long way to go, and the years leading up to its entry must act as a stimulus to speed up the necessary reforms for the country’s democracy to develop. I believe in an enlarged, strong Europe, and therefore I voted in favour of the resolution. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the progress that has been made, we do have to admit, unfortunately, that women are still subject to many instances of inequality in all areas, including active participation in decision making and the political process. This is a feature of all Member States and even of this House, since women occupy just 34% of the seats here. In order to achieve equality between men and women, we must first of all remove the cultural obstacles and start to talk about gender policy. The parties themselves have got to initiate this first step towards change. Various positive measures are put forward in Ms Pietikäinen’s report, which I wholeheartedly support. These include the measures on quotas for women which, while not the ideal solution, are the only feasible approach until we see a change of culture and outlook, as I said. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, the current economic crisis, together with the austerity measures adopted in some countries, has created new social categories at risk of poverty, including young people and elderly people. Given the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, the Annual Growth Survey must ensure consistency between the various priorities in its political guidelines in order to ensure that budgetary needs are based on social justice. I agree with the rapporteur on the need to act immediately in order to improve employment conditions for categories at risk of social exclusion and to make tackling youth unemployment a priority. Future national reform plans will need to include training programmes able to develop lifelong learning and to create qualified jobs with dignified pay and conditions. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, today’s vote is a first step in the direction of economic governance in Europe, as hoped for by Mr Delors as early as 1993. The introduction of Eurobonds, which I hope will come about within a reasonable timeframe, is part of a wider process that will lead the countries in the euro area to strengthen the coordination and achieve the integration of their economic and fiscal policies. The three options indicated in the European Commission’s Green Paper propose three different types of Eurobond, with a decreasing degree of solidarity between Member States. The serious economic crisis we are currently experiencing shows that no country is safe from financial speculation. To sceptics, I say that Eurobonds are, to date, the only practical answer to reviving growth and development in Europe. This is why I voted in favour. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the hundreds of petitions to the European Parliament from various EU countries clarify the extent and severity of the waste management problem. An interesting aspect of the report is the attention paid to the disposal of illegal waste that affects many regions. In my region, as a delegation from the European Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety was able to ascertain, high levels of caesium-137 have been detected. This is typical nuclear waste even though there are no nuclear power plants in Italy. It is clear that this is a Europe-wide problem. There is illegal trafficking of waste that must be monitored and curbed, but which has so far been ignored by the European Commission. It is therefore easy to state that only a few countries, including Italy, do not apply European standards. Instead, given that illegal trafficking of waste extends beyond national borders, we need to think about how to deal with this at a European level. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, this own-initiative report highlights how crucial the issue of the supply of inputs is for the competitiveness of European agriculture. Over the last decade, European farmers have seen an intolerable increase in production costs, which is not adequately reflected in sales prices. European agricultural production still depends, to a large extent, on oil. Over the last decade, the price of oil has risen by 60%. In order to address this challenge, the new CAP must increase the use of renewable energy by implementing self-sufficient energy production in farms, using agricultural waste and so forth to feed biomass and biogas plant. This will give us sustainable agriculture and a reduction in costs. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it has not been easy to find a balanced compromise to combine the objective of greater protection for human health and the environment with a faster and more efficient authorisation system for the industrial sector. However, I would have preferred a European authorisation from the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) for new biocidal products immediately, and not in stages. That said, the centralised authorisation system will definitely have positive repercussions on the internal market, because it will allow equal application of the requisites in all the Member States. In order to streamline bureaucratic procedures for small and medium-sized enterprises and facilitate the entry of biocides onto the market, we needed to remove comparative assessment, still required for biocides that have been proven to be safe for use. This places a hefty bureaucratic burden on companies. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, of all the EU’s instruments, the ‘Intelligent Energy’ programme has been the most successful. It has funded over 500 projects, involving more than 3 000 partners – the majority of which are small and medium-sized enterprises – not to speak of the added value that the programme has given to the renewable energy and energy efficiency sector. Like my fellow Members, I am concerned about the future of the programme, which has played a central role in awareness raising actions, the exchange of good practice, and energy policy implementation in the European Union. I therefore ask the European Commission what it intends to do in order to continue the programme, as stopping it would put an end to so many hopes. To conclude, I would like to ask what the programme is for the Multiannual Financial Framework that will provide the necessary funding. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

Mr President, I can only welcome today’s report on the review of European Neighbourhood Policy and, in particular, the vital proposal to strengthen the EU’s Southern partnership, following the historic events which took place last spring, for the democratic consolidation of the area. Funds for countries on the southern shore of the Mediterranean were allocated before the crisis and, in the light of the concrete needs and modernisation of society in these countries, they seem inadequate; I think we should increase support for the instrument for civil society. I will table Parliament’s proposal to establish Euro-Mediterranean Erasmus and Leonardo programmes to the European Commission again, so as to encourage the mobility and the exchange of best practices amongst young people.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank Mr Perello Rodriguez for the excellent work which he has done. It certainly cannot have been easy for such a complex directive to manage to combine the demands of consumers with those of business, just as, to encourage free movement within the European Union, it was not easy to lay down rules on composition, manufacturing specifications and labelling of fruit juices and similar products. We are now at the second amendment of Council Directive 2001/112/EC, which has been necessary in order to continue including provisions of the Codex Alimentarius in European legislation. I am extremely satisfied and I consider the fact that we have avoided the serious risk of finding orange juice on our table which is actually a blend of oranges and mandarins, unless it has been properly labelled as such when sold, a victory both for consumers and for our market. The new changes will finally allow consumers to understand the difference between fruit juices and fruit nectars, and if the fruit nectar naturally contains sugars, then the label can state that the juice contains natural sugars. Important progress has been made, above all, with regard to nectar, and I believe that the directive is going in the right direction to help consumers make informed choices in terms of what they purchase. In Europe, the fruit juice market represents 10% of the non-alcoholic beverage market. I hope that in future, we will be able to encourage purchases of locally produced products that reflect high quality and sustainable development in agriculture in line with European food security principles. The annual demand for orange juice from European industry is estimated to be around a million tonnes, whilst internal production only provides 10% of that. It is therefore obvious that we should increase production of citrus fruits and I hope that the new CAP will include financial incentives to encourage an increase in the cultivation of citrus fruits and the associated creation of a virtuous food and agricultural supply chain to utilise fruit that cannot be used in the fresh market due to small defects or size in the production of fruit juices. This request is obviously directed at Commissioner Cioloş, who is here today. To conclude, Mr President, I believe that this directive achieves two fundamental aims: a more complete labelling system and an increase in product quality. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, with today’s vote, Parliament has laid the foundations for future discussion on the new directive which, as anticipated yesterday by Commissioner Barnier, will be presented on 13 December. I approve of the report given by the rapporteur who, in collaboration with all the rapporteurs, has managed to synthesise the view put forward last June by the Commission with the Green Paper. I feel I should underline two key elements at the heart of the report: language and training. I believe it is necessary, in particular with regard to health care professions, to introduce an accurate means of evaluation of the level of linguistic ability that should take place prior to the authorisation of allocating work, and to raise the minimum training requirements common to all Member States, with a view to ensuring ever greater security to European patients.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the last five years, gambling has spread over the whole of Europe. In Italy, according to the state monopolies, online gambling increased by 153% from 2008 to 2009, and by 29% from 2009 to 2010. These worrying figures provide evidence of the widespread impact of this phenomenon. We must consider this issue seriously. Although online gambling falls within the jurisdiction of the Member States, common actions must be established across Europe to protect vulnerable consumers and to tackle illegal gambling. The report on the initiative opens the door to actions which I hope will soon be initiated and I agree that there is a need to implement preventative measures with a view to reducing addictive behaviour. The trials taking place in some countries could set the measure for ‘best practice’ to be replicated all over Europe, with the aim of monitoring the phenomenon and promoting responsible gambling.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today’s vote has drawn attention to the beekeeping sector, which plays a crucial role in European agriculture by helping to maintain biodiversity and provides an income for around 600 000 workers in the European Union. I consider the programme launched by the European Commission for monitoring the health of honeybees to be a useful one that has the aim of identifying the reasons behind their increased mortality rate in recent years. The impact of pesticides on the health of bees must be explored in more detail. I have voted in favour of the report and I am disappointed that the reference to a correlation between some pesticides and bee mortality has not been supported, as proposed by the rapporteur. I call on the European Commission to provide greater financial aid to the beekeeping sector in the new common agricultural policy (CAP) for 2014-2020. Mario Pirillo,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the mobility of European workers is one of the pillars for full implementation of the internal market, as well as leveraging development and the economy. It is estimated that there is a need for around a million health care professionals in Europe. This means that we need a quick and efficient system for recognising qualifications, and the professional card could facilitate this process. However, in the health care sector, mobility must be combined with safeguarding and ensuring patient safety. This is the direction taken by the report voted for by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for which I was rapporteur. Mobility and patient protection must be considered two sides of the same coin. Therefore, extension of the rapid reaction mechanism to the health care professions is not only commendable, but also necessary. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I voted for Mr Tatarella’s report, which seeks to postpone by three years the entry into force of Stage IIIB for the placing on the market of more efficient tractors for the reduction of CO2
 and pollutant gases. In the case of tractors, a number of reasons led to the parameters laid down by Directive 2005/13/EC being revised: the sudden fall in sales caused by the current economic crisis and the lack of technical solutions capable of limiting CO2
 emissions. It will be particularly important to transpose the amended directive rapidly so that it may be applied without delay. I hope that the European Commission will take into account the European Parliament’s call for it to examine in advance whether the technology available will be capable of meeting the requirements of Stage IV, scheduled for 2014.

I hope that the Member States and the Commission will heed the call to prepare legislative acts that facilitate their inclusion. The Member States have not yet signed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Despite this time of economic crisis, I hope that the national governments will prove capable of protecting them by putting in place policies in line with the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020. I welcome and endorse the report tabled by Mr Kósa, who, by drawing on his own experience, has managed to give heartfelt, practical suggestions in order to offer people with disabilities non-discriminatory access to social protection and to health and education services.

 Mr President, with today’s vote, we have laid the foundations for the future revision of the Procurement Directive. Simpler bureaucratic procedures and principles for participation in public tenders are a fundamental means of speeding up implementation processes and ensuring the full realisation of contracts between public authorities and the private sector. The increased use of information and communication technologies would allow businesses and public authorities to save money and time, and would provide greater transparency and accessibility. I would like to stress that the criterion of the lowest price should no longer be the determining factor when awarding contracts: it should really be replaced by the criterion of the most economically advantageous tender, in order to draw economic, social and environmental benefits.

 Mr President, today, Europe has taken an important step in recognising the fact that organised crime is a European problem that has been underestimated for too long and traced back to local situations or individual Member States. I fully support the content of the report and hope that a legislative proposal will soon be presented, one which leads to the creation of a European anti-mafia committee able to expertly review and fight the phenomenon of organised crime through the institutions. Culture, education, development and work in Europe are defences capable of preventing criminal organisations from recruiting young people. I would like to thank Mr Crocetta, shadow rapporteur of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, who has always been at the forefront of the fight against the Mafia and who made a significant contribution to the improvement of the text.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to the many Members who have signed this oral question. The EU’s objectives in terms of the fight against climate change have resulted in the implementation of what are very demanding EU policies and measures for European industry. The target of reducing CO2
 emissions is, at present, a unilateral commitment that is exposing a large proportion of Europe’s industrial system and, in particular, its energy-intensive industries to a high risk of carbon leakage. The emission reduction targets, while worthy in their aims, should be pursued in a realistic and practical way. We are calling on the Commission to adjust the tools for applying the Emissions Trading System (ETS) and the financial compensation measures envisaged as carefully and as accurately as possible, in order to prevent any imbalances in the EU internal market. Under Directive 2003/87/EC, as amended in 2009, thermal power companies will be obliged, from 2013, to purchase allowances for all of their CO2
 emissions, which means that the increased costs will be passed on in electricity prices and hence, that production costs will rise significantly. According to Eurostat data, the ETS will cost European industry an estimated EUR 8.5 billion more each year in increased electricity prices. Indirect emissions, as opposed to direct emissions, do not benefit from a compensation system to prevent differences in treatment between industries in the same sector that have different production processes and which face obvious distortions of competition within the European Union. If an equivalent compensation system is not established for indirect emissions, there is a very great risk that companies will relocate. Choosing sectors exposed to carbon leakage on the basis of the NACE code classification system is simplistic and restrictive, since it does not allow for the specific type of energy-intensive production to be identified, with the result that compensation cannot be granted to subsectors. In the case of steel production, there are two production processes: the electric furnace and the full cycle, which uses fossil fuels and a small amount of electricity; it will receive almost all of the free allocation of allowances for direct emissions. The electric furnace process, on the other hand, will receive only 30% of the free allowances due to the lack of a compensation system for the electricity portion, even though it emits a fifth of the CO2
 produced by the full cycle. Therefore, because of the type of production process used, the same product will see its price increase in Europe. Fears of such a market imbalance have been voiced by many parties, by many industrial sectors, as can be seen from the responses to the public consultation launched by the Directorate General for Competition. How does the Commission intend to proceed with regard to State aid for energy-intensive industries, in order to ensure the continuation of European industry and to guarantee jobs and prosperity? Could the revenues from the sale of allowances not be used to offset the imbalances that will be created from 2013? Are we certain that the sale of allowances will not lead to speculation? How does the Commission intend to rectify competitive disadvantages? Mario Pirillo,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I must thank all my fellow Members, from all the political groups, who have spoken and who have strongly supported my question. I cannot say that I am satisfied, because the catch-the-eye procedure will follow, and then the Commission will speak; this makes no sense to me, and I hope that we will adapt the Rules of Procedure accordingly. I must say that I will be making this statement to the press but, if I may be so bold, I am truly disappointed by the response that the Commissioner, as the Commission’s representative, has given to my questions. I think that the Commission wants to wash its hands of this problem; it is a major problem as my fellow Members have described magnificently. I hope that the Commission will answer my questions, the questions I asked in my speech, and I hope that it will give serious consideration to this major problem that is affecting Europe: this industry that we boast about in Europe and then undervalue.

That shows how our different political ideologies have been overcome on important issues, such as this one of humanitarian aid. The principle of European solidarity among Member States in the event of a disaster is the central pillar of this report, supported by liaison and interaction initiatives within the European Union. The merging of the humanitarian aid crisis rooms is a step in that direction.

Parliament has today voted in favour of setting up a new common framework for European tourism in line with the new powers introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon. Emphasising the importance of the quality of the tourist services offered as a decisive variable in the choices made by tourists was an appropriate decision to increase the competitiveness of Europe’s tourism industry. Niche tourism – religious, spa, mountain, rural, etc. – should be encouraged through measures to improve it in terms of quality and quantity. Lastly, I hope that the harmonisation of the hospitality industry classification systems will continue so as to define unequivocal quality standards for all Member States. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

The efforts made to make the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development more favourable to small and medium-sized enterprises have not improved their participation rate. Simplification has not hit the target. As the report by Ms Matias clearly indicates, there is a need for administrative simplification and a significant reduction of financial reporting requirements.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the gas and electricity market is an instrument for driving economic growth and job creation, crucial factors in restoring the Union’s competitive edge and enabling it to overcome the crisis without delay. We must therefore prevent abuse and manipulation of the market, where monitoring and the application of penalties, along with the prohibition of insider trading, are a national responsibility. The recent introduction of the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) enables market transactions to be monitored, and the national and European registers of market participants make it possible to register transactions in wholesale energy products, thereby promoting transparency. Today’s vote, which is the result of close cooperation between the Polish Presidency, the Commission and Parliament, has laid the foundations for a more transparent market that safeguards consumer interests.

Today’s vote is a first step. I agree with the call for Member States to reflect on the role of women as care-givers. This role, if legally recognised, could create forms of official employment that make it easier for women over 50 to work. As for the pension system, I repeat the call for the Commission to introduce forms of protection to reduce the pension gap between women, who have often had to interrupt their careers in order to care for and look after their family, and men.

Better still, I hope that cooperation will be strengthened between the inspection bodies in order to establish common and independent standards at European level. I think that the proposal to establish a Mediterranean Offshore Authorities Forum is a positive one. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

Mr President, today we voted on the vexed and controversial issue of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Offering Member States the chance to prohibit or restrict the cultivation of GMOs in their territory means that the European Union will surrender its leading role on this most delicate of issues. Many questions remain to be answered. Do we know what the long-term effects will be on the ecosystem? Are we reasonably sure that the use of GMOs does not carry serious health risks? Are we sure that consumers whose government has banned their cultivation will not find themselves eating them anyway? We are a long way from any definitive answers. The only thing I know for sure is that both the Commission and the Member States should guarantee that the necessary resources will be made available for independent research, and that GMOs will not be merely a short-cut to profit.

Mr President, there is huge anticipation for the legislative proposals on the forthcoming post-2013 cohesion policy, which will be tabled in September. The Commission has already announced that this reform will see the introduction of an intermediate category, which should replace the current system of phasing in and phasing out. I am left perplexed by the implications that this new category will have, since it will also include – or at least seems to include – the regions that currently are neither converging nor competing. I should like to point out that the priority of the cohesion policy is to assist late-developing regions, and I therefore would not want the reform to damage precisely the poorest regions of Europe, which struggle to put development policies into action. I hope, however, that the new programming can give European growth a kick-start. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the idea of setting up horizontal multi-fund programmes with clearly defined aims and streamlined access mechanisms is something I fully support. I agree with Professor Barca’s report, according to which an approach based on local development is the way to improve efficiency and effectiveness and to operate in a more integrated manner. We need to focus attention on the urban dimension and to ensure coordination between the funds and the other financial instruments of the European Investment Bank (EIB) and European Investment Fund (EIF). In a situation in which the budget is tight, these instruments, together with revolving funds, would allow results to be monitored. This would multiply the available resources and increase the number of beneficiaries, which in turn would deliver more results. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, everyone is aware of the importance of the common agricultural policy and of the contribution it has made to the development of the EU and to food security. Environmental challenges and the fight against climate change mean that the post-2013 CAP now has a new role to play, for which I believe we need a stronger and more sustainable CAP equipped with a budget that can meet the objectives to be pursued, with particular attention to the development of quality food products and to the needs of small farmers. Speculation in agricultural commodities and extreme price volatility put food security at risk and require flexible measures. Possible market fluctuations must be tackled with counter-cyclical measures, which should be included in the first pillar and be capable of responding swiftly and automatically.

Mr President, today’s vote represents a marked step forward in bringing in the ‘polluter pays’ principle, including in the road haulage sector, which makes a significant contribution to atmospheric and noise pollution. Despite the criticisms of industry organisations, I think that the Council’s position is the best compromise available right now, even though I hope that improvements can be made in the future. I voted in favour. I must point out, however, that we need to identify better ways to use the revenues, making it mandatory for the Member States to invest these resources to improve the trans-European transport network (TEN-T) and infrastructure for reducing pollution. This is the only way that, in future, we will be able to say that today’s decision has had positive results. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

Mr President, research and innovation play a central role in the European Union’s development and competitiveness and they are crucial in terms of reaching the objectives set out in the Europe 2020 strategy. The Seventh Framework Programme is the main instrument for funding research in Europe, as shown by the report voted on today. However, there are still many problems being caused by excessive amounts of red tape for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). In its resolution of 11 November 2010, Parliament asked the Commission to introduce procedural, administrative and financial simplification measures into the current management of the Seventh Framework Programme, yet these measures have still not been addressed. I call upon the Commission to acknowledge Parliament’s observations and to identify solutions to make it easier for SMEs to access the seventh and eighth research programmes. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

I voted against the resolution rejecting the indication of the presence of DHA in milk substitutes for babies because I think it is right to advertise the reasons for which DHA is added. I want to mention here that DHA is an omega 3 fatty acid which is present in breast milk and has a positive effect on children’s eyesight. I would point out that the EFSA, the European Food Safety Authority, expressed a favourable opinion to extensively indicating the presence of this substance. I have not appreciated the many e-mails received indicating the belief that we want to favour artificial milk over breast milk. We must always provide adequate information on substances added to food products, especially when they are for children. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the news regarding Fukushima is increasingly worrying. Safety limits have been greatly exceeded and we do not know what will happen in the near future. There has been a lack of clear and transparent communications. Stress tests should be conducted on existing nuclear plants and if the outcome raises concern we must have the courage to call for their immediate closure. We need to introduce higher international safety standards and there should be no thought of constructing new nuclear plants. We must prepare the way for a gradual withdrawal of this type of energy which causes irreparable damage to the environment and human health. Careful thought on the development of future energy policies is essential. We must urgently develop policies that aim at energy conservation and efficiency, and increased investment in research into new technologies and renewable energy sources. Finally, we should open a debate involving citizens and local authorities. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, women have always had an important role in the agricultural and rural sector. Indeed, women account for 42% of the labour force out of a total of around 27 million workers. Despite this high percentage, women are not well represented in sector organisations and face discrimination in the decision-making process. There are many areas in which women’s circumstances could be improved, including ensuring adequate social cover. The European institutions should therefore act to balance this inequality, perhaps by monitoring the sector through an observatory for female entrepreneurialism in agriculture, as already operated in Calabria and other regions in Italy. The report voted upon today – which I supported – also takes a long hard look at the issue of the exodus from the countryside. In order to help keep employment levels steady we need support policies and strategies which are designed to build infrastructure and create services suited to the requirements of modern life, which can be implemented in rural areas.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as an elected representative from Southern Italy, I join the chorus of fellow MEPs who have preceded me in calling for appropriate action to address the critical situation faced by citizens and migrants in Lampedusa. The health and sanitation situation on the island has exceeded all limits of decency. I appeal to the sense of responsibility of the Italian Government to ensure it adopts all measures available to it, and call on the European Commission to implement the measures provided for in the EU Directive on temporary protection for immigrants. The next European Council of Ministers of the Interior, scheduled for 11 April, must take appropriate measures to ensure that neither the migrants nor the citizens of Lampedusa are left in a desperate condition. We therefore need to initiate a serious debate on the European Neighbourhood Policy which will focus on initiatives to support the path to democracy, especially in the countries of the southern shores of the Mediterranean. I congratulate Mr Provera. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over the past 15 years, the number of natural and man-made disasters has increased significantly and we see phenomena that are more severe and more frequent in almost all European Union countries with serious consequences for the economy, infrastructure and ecosystems. We need an urgent EU approach to develop preventive policies and to identify and adapt the relevant financial instruments. The European Union Solidarity Fund and national funds are no longer able to cope with frequent disasters. I would ask the Commissioner who is present when will it be possible to provide data and a map of areas at risk, as announced in his communication of 23 February 2009? I regret, finally, that the Soil Directive for the improvement of land management has been blocked for some time in the Council. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the current economic crisis has revealed serious shortcomings in the framework for monitoring the financial sector and the need to respond with new instruments and new fiscal policies. The financial system has started to generate profits from speculative transactions and it is absurd that this sector is not subject to any taxation. We need a cure, a financial transaction tax, which is why I voted in favour. For other policies such as energy or the environment, Europe has managed to be the world leader, becoming an example and a stimulus for other countries outside the European Union. I believe we should do the same for the financial system. I hope that the Commission will respond soon, presenting a legislative proposal that can meet the expectations of citizens, on whom the burden of the crisis has fallen. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, the deep international economic crisis has hit industry especially hard. The idea that the markets should regulate themselves has been proved wrong. Europe has lacked the ability to give a unified response or to perform an economic analysis. Europe therefore needs to equip itself with a solid, competitive and diversified industrial base. Europe’s new industrial policy must be able to look to the future by taking a global approach to its own policies aimed at reaffirming the core importance of industry, especially manufacturing, which must continue to be the driving force of our economy and to prompt new intelligent, sustainable and inclusive modes of growth. I endorse and congratulate Mr Lange on his report, which examines all these factors and provides some interesting food for thought. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in which bluefin tuna fishing finds itself in the Mediterranean continues to cause incalculable economic damage to fishing communities. The Italian Government adhered to the decisions of the ICCAT and reduced fishing quotas for bluefin tuna for commercial fishing vessels only, with a de facto 
increase in the quantities intended for recreational fishing, an absurd measure that penalises only fishers, who are already facing a very difficult time. In this sense, I remind you of the negative effects on the industry of failing to take the decision to grant a derogation for whitebait fishing. I hope that one outcome of the forthcoming meeting to be attended by Commissioner Damanaki, who is here today, will be that fishing for whitebait can resume in 2011, at least in certain districts, such as Schiavonea and Corigliano Calabro in Calabria, with a possibility of a review for 2012.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even today in the European Union, health inequalities still persist over access to services, treatment and social factors, and this necessitates an integrated response. The reasons for these differences are, in many cases, avoidable and unjust, because they are due to discriminatory factors such as the reduced economic capacity of individuals. I believe that reducing health inequalities should become a fundamental priority for Europe, with an approach based on ‘health in all policies’, enhancing the quality of care for all. In the coming months, the European Parliament will discuss the revision of the directive on recognition of professional qualifications. It is an appropriate opportunity to achieve an improved mechanism capable of dealing effectively with emergencies without any discrimination. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is essential for Europe to ensure a fair balance between the need to support a vital sector, in other words, the agriculture of Member States, and the need to strengthen Europe’s international trade policy. A business strategy highly focused on pursuing the dynamics of global markets would end up sacrificing the ability of the European agricultural sector to compete. This not only damages the sector economy, with serious implications for employment, but also undermines any possibility of developing our rural areas. It is necessary to defend the quality of agricultural production and impose the maintenance of equal quality standards in terms of food security, human and animal health, and welfare and social rights when drawing up trade agreements with third countries.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, everybody has said that the free trade agreement with the Republic of Korea is an institutional and strategic innovation on the part of the Union. On the contrary, it is an unbalanced agreement that will have a negative impact on the European manufacturing industry. The elimination of duties on Korean products in return for a rise in environmental and social standards in Korea cannot be considered fair. The Korean shipbuilding industry benefits from substantial state aid, which has enabled it to attain a 30% share of the world market. This means that European industry, be it automotive, textile, chemical or any other, must defend itself against competition that if not unfair in form, is unfair in fact. The introduction of the safeguard clause is an appropriate measure, but it is not sufficient to patch up the many weaknesses in the agreement. I therefore call on the European Commission to be more prudent if it really wishes to defend European economic interests. Mario Pirillo  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the transition towards a low carbon economy and the achievement of the objectives set out in the climate change package mean that we need to establish rules to regulate CO2
 emissions in various sectors, including the automotive sector. I am very pleased with the negotiations, which led to an agreement with the Council to limit emissions to 147g CO2
/km by 2020. This is a realistic limit that also represents an excellent balance between environmental, social and industrial rules. I hope I also played my part in this as shadow rapporteur for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. The agreement reached takes account of the economic crisis that the sector is experiencing and also makes reasonable allowances for the difference between the passenger car sector and the light commercial vehicles sector. Just as we saw with the regulation on passenger cars, the European automotive sector will also manage to develop green, competitive and environmentally beneficial technology for light commercial vehicles. I hope it will also manage to take advantage of the environmental challenge to invest even more in innovation and research. Paolo De Castro,

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which I have the honour of chairing and for which I drafted the opinion on the interim report, clearly expressed the wish that the common agricultural policy budget should be frozen in real, not nominal terms, as proposed by the European Commission. Although this is evidently the majority position, at this sensitive point in the negotiations I am in favour of giving full support to the own-initiative report drawn up by Mr Böge and Mr Kalfin, who have done an excellent job, providing Parliament with a strong, cohesive and united negotiating position. However, I should stress that were further cuts to be made to the common agricultural policy budget, it would be very difficult to reach an agreement on reform. All of the political groups in the committee have always stressed their wish not to have a final vote on the reform reports until there is clarity on the budget question. Indeed, the budget must be equal to the challenges posed by the agriculture of the future. Paolo De Castro,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the regulation on agricultural product quality schemes, on which we will be voting tomorrow, is the second most important legislative provision in which Parliament has been fully involved under the ordinary legislative procedure for agricultural legislation. As happened with the Milk Regulation, Parliament has again managed to introduce significant amendments to improve the Commission’s proposal. I would highlight, for example, the stricter rules to protect certified products against misuse and imitation (the so-called ex officio
 rule); the new system of optional quality terms, starting with the ‘product of mountain farming’ quality term; area marks; and greater simplification in the authorisation procedures for Protected Designation of Origin (PDO), Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) and Traditional Speciality Guaranteed (TSG) products. I would also like to mention the amendment to the list in the annex, which at last makes it possible for chocolate to enjoy a protected geographical indication. Allow me to take this opportunity to greet the friends of Modica chocolate who are here in this Chamber. These are just a few of the many amendments that Parliament has successfully introduced to strengthen the prospect of leveraging quality in order to compete in the sector. This was made possible by the excellent work done by the rapporteur, Ms García Pérez, whom I thank, as well as the shadow rapporteurs and the entire Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. The only regrettable fact, as the rapporteur herself mentioned, is that Parliament has not managed to persuade the Council of the need to extend production planning, which we usefully introduced in the milk package, to all the other protected designations of origin, particularly in the ham sector. However, as has been pointed out by Mr Dorfmann, one of the shadow rapporteurs, we shall not fail to do so in the debate on the reform of the common agricultural policy, and on the single common market organisation document in particular. Paolo De Castro,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to direct your attention to the six legislative reports on alignment with the Treaty of Lisbon that we are about to vote on. They do not just address agricultural issues, but affect all of Parliament. Indeed, we risk losing the new powers that the Treaty of Lisbon has given us. The Council systematically opposes delegated acts, replacing them with implementing acts that exclude Parliament from the decision-making process. We must press on to defend Parliament’s powers. Hence, I would ask you to lend your vigorous support to the decision already reached by a huge majority in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. Paolo De Castro,  
rapporteur. 
– (IT) 
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon abolishes the old comitology system, replacing it with a two-tier structure, consisting of delegated acts which include Parliament’s and the Council’s right of veto, and implementing acts which completely exclude Parliament from each step in the approval process. The existing body of legislation therefore had to be aligned to the new legal reality. We started this exercise with the three most important regulations all of which, Mr President, I shall deal with together, and which make up the heart of the agricultural policy: the regulations on direct payments, on rural development and on the common organisation of the markets. The Commission’s proposals immediately appeared to be quite balanced and there were very few changes made by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI). In particular, as regards direct payments, delegated acts must be used in cases where the basic act is amended, and in cases where rights are conferred to farmers or reversely where negative consequences may be incurred. In addition, given the spirit of the treaty on the common agricultural policy (CAP) budget, we felt that the financial discipline process could no longer be applied without the participation of Parliament. Indeed, maintaining Article 11 unchanged, with the Council acting on a proposal from the Commission, would constitute an unacceptable continuation of the Council’s exclusive right to implement measures directly. As regards rural development, we believe that the Commission has done an accurate repartition between more general provisions establishing additional elements, and which therefore require delegated acts, and more technical elements that are very much connected with the discretion that Member States enjoy in implementing this measure, and which therefore require implementing acts. By contrast, the proposed alignment with the regulation on the common organisation of the markets has proved to be more problematic, especially on issues connected with Article 43(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The article in question provides that the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, shall adopt measures on fixing prices, levies, aid and quantitative limitations. This is an exception to paragraph 2 of the same article, which requires the ordinary legislative procedure (OLP) to be used for the common agricultural policy. As an exception, Article 43(3) needs to be interpreted restrictively, that is, only when there are provisions that do not form part of the fundamental policy decisions, which must be taken pursuant to Article 43(2) of the Treaty. We therefore believe that the Commission proposal does not interpret Article 43(3) in a sufficiently restrictive way. The task of drawing up conditions and criteria for fixing aid amounts, export refunds and minimum export prices should remain with the legislator, which means Parliament and the Council, leaving to the Commission the fixing of amounts through implementing acts. Once these three recommendations had been approved by an overwhelming majority in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, we began to negotiate with the Council and the Commission so that we could reach an agreement at first reading. The urgency was dictated by the imminent reform of the common agricultural policy, which we would not have wished to be encumbered by complex negotiations on institutional issues. Despite our willingness to negotiate, to concede something with respect to our initial position, and despite the outstanding activism first on the part of the Polish Presidency and then from the Danish Presidency, we were unable to find a compromise solution, hence the need for the committee to act efficiently and in a timely manner, on the one hand, and the new and stronger powers conferred on Parliament by the Treaty of Lisbon, on the other. The main obstacles we encountered were from the Council, which wishes to systematically and horizontally eliminate delegated acts, even where these are legally required, in order to replace them with implementing acts which completely exclude Parliament. Such a position is unacceptable to us, because it means surrendering the new prerogatives that the Treaty has assigned to us, thereby severely limiting the powers of Parliament. Another factor that made negotiations more difficult was the attitude of the Commission which, during the negotiations, moved from a position close to that of Parliament to siding with the Council’s, leaving us alone in the battle to defend the most authentic interpretation of the Treaty. We are now faced with the difficult negotiations on the reform of the common agricultural policy; we therefore decided to ask plenary to confirm the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development’s vote on alignment, so as to strengthen our position when we negotiate future agricultural policy. Indeed, only by defending the prerogatives of Parliament can we be sure to respect the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon and, at the same time, ensure that in future, the CAP is more democratic and closer to citizens. Paolo De Castro,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take advantage of this minute just to thank my colleagues for their comments and also to thank the Commissioner. We take note of the support that the Commissioner has shown today, in the hope that the difficulties of reaching an agreement with the Council on implementing acts do not turn into difficulties of reaching an agreement on common agricultural policy reform. For this reason, I appeal to the Commissioner: we are in the Lisbon era, the Council needs to understand that Parliament has new prerogatives, which it is not prepared to surrender. In tomorrow’s vote, we will be following the Commission’s approach, so we hope that the Council will, in the end, join with us on these positions. Paolo De Castro,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in its capacity as co-legislator it is essential for Parliament to know the Member States’ simulation data for the new biophysical criteria put forward by the Commission on identifying Less Favoured Areas. The lack of transparency and unwillingness to send this data to the representatives of EU citizens reveal the ongoing ignorance of Member States and the Council of the democratic revolution enshrined by the Treaty of Lisbon. Parliament is co-decider on agricultural matters and, together with the Council, we are preparing to reform the common agricultural policy. We cannot therefore accept any discrepancy in the information held by the two institutions. We must be on the same standing as the Council in order to be able to evaluate the criteria put forward by the Commission in full awareness of the facts. The Commission – I would remind the Council – will not let us have this data, as some Member States have opposed it being given to Parliament. We therefore urge the Council to appeal to the Member States for the utmost transparency and full cooperation, in the light of what is a new institutional reality. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to express my delight in the fact that we have achieved the highly important goal of extending the programme for food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Union to 2013. It has been a long and difficult process, involving the efforts of all of Parliament. Now, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have together urged the Commission to make a clear commitment to the European Parliament to pursue the programme after 2013. The statement of 6 December 2011 in which the Commission acknowledged the opposition of some Member States to a new programme must not prejudice the Commission’s right to legislative initiative as provided for by the Treaty. The Commission must take into account the strong desire on the part of the European Parliament and the vast majority of EU Member States to continue this programme. Therefore, we are pleased with the statements the Commission has made to us today. We are talking – let us reiterate this – about an instrument which allows the EU to distribute 440 000 tonnes of free food every year to over 18 million poor people and struggling families, a number which, unfortunately, also includes many children. This is why we cannot consider our political initiative to be over. Mr President, Commissioner, taking into consideration also the new global challenges, such as food security, which are making life even tougher for the disadvantaged, Parliament will do its best to ensure that differences are overcome and that the programme can continue in 2014.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the vote on opening up the tariff quota for imports of high-quality beef marks an important moment in good transatlantic relations. What is more, thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament is, for the first time, playing a fundamental role in approving this sort of decision. This fact increases the United States’ interest in and understanding of Parliament, as we saw first-hand during the meetings held with the US Congress by a delegation from our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI) last June. This agreement puts an end to a long-held, age-old dispute, thereby enabling the sanctions imposed by the US to be lifted, while also maintaining the ban on imports of meat treated with hormones so as to guarantee our own high standards on food quality and safety. For these reasons, the AGRI Committee – which I am honoured to chair – gave staunch support for the conclusion of this agreement and did not present any amendments, in the spirit of deepening transatlantic trade relations and improving dispute resolution within the framework of the World Trade Organisation. My heartfelt thanks to Ms Quisthoudt-Rowohl and to the rapporteur for our committee, Mr Lyon. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that tomorrow we will be voting on the recommendation for a second reading on the programme for the distribution of food products to the most deprived persons in the Union, which involves the continuation of this important programme until 2013. After all these months and the commitment of so many people, whom I would like to thank, starting with our rapporteur, Vice-President Siekierski and Commissioner Cioloş, we have managed to achieve this important result, which means not abandoning 18 million poor people in Europe to their fate. The European Parliament has often expressed its approval of this programme and also of its continuation after 2013. Our political initiative will therefore continue, we will not rest just with tomorrow’s vote, Mr President. In full compliance with the ruling of the Court of Justice, Europe must also be able to continue offering solidarity to the weaker members of our society in the future, particularly during these tough economic times.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the measure we are about to approve represents the culmination of a process undertaken by Europe after the 2009 crisis in order to find solutions for stabilising the market and revenues of dairy and cheese producers. The work and commitment of the European Parliament and our rapporteur Mr Nicholson, whom I must truly thank for his enormous commitment along with the shadow rapporteurs of this important report, have meant we have reached a rapid agreement on a text that improves the Commission’s proposal. An important new provision is the possibility of managing and planning the volumes of certified quality dairy products. Such a tool is even more strategically significant at a historic time of prolonged and considerable market volatility, and we will consolidate it within the new regulations on quality agricultural and food products. The new possibility of involving representatives of the trade in interprofessional organisations is very important, as it will promote and consolidate positive links between all the components of the supply chain. Today, Mr President, Commissioner, we are showing that Parliament knows how to face up to its responsibilities and work swiftly as a whole towards completion of the legislative process. This is our first testing-ground before the major challenge of the debate on reform of the common agricultural policy. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with the report by Mr Bové, whom I thank for his work, Europe is focusing decisively on establishing a legislative framework to ensure fairness and greater transparency in relations within the agri-food industry. In this field, the ideas and requests approved in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are very much to be welcomed. Higher levels of transparency in prices, the reduction of the costs of production inputs and more effective management of energy and natural resources within the industry are just a few of the most important points. Madam President, on these grounds, and taking advantage of the presence of Vice-President Tajani, I think it appropriate to recall the central point of the joint resolution on the imbalances in the food supply chain, to which my fellow Members have also referred: a European system to harmonise the length of time taken for payments in commercial transactions between agri-food producers and the distribution system. Mr Tajani, we can no longer allow distortions of competition between European producers; it is no longer acceptable to have different national legal systems that regulate deadlines for payment, contractual agreements and discounting practices differently. There is a lack of territorial homogeneity exacerbating this phase of extreme market volatility where sharp price rises are not translating into higher margins for farmers; they, on the contrary, see their incomes dropping lower and lower. Mr Tajani, we in Parliament are ready to support a legislative proposal that goes in this direction and I know of the work that you are doing with the high-level group. I therefore sincerely hope that we may soon see a legislative proposal on harmonisation of the distribution systems in Europe. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the importance of cultivating trees for the landscape and the environment is already well known and acknowledged. Different scientific studies demonstrate that trees are more capable of reducing CO2
 levels than meadows and pastures. Considering the dispositions of direct payments, which anticipate that 7% of farmed land should be set aside for ecological purposes, what, Commissioner, will happen in the case of an olive farm that already comprises within it dry-stone walls and rows of trees, and that includes centuries-old trees of important value to both the landscape and the economy? Do you not think that such farms are already sufficiently sustainable from an environmental point of view, and that the application of the required 7% indicated above would instead risk causing harm to economic sustainability and the environment, with farmers forced to cut down part of their olive grove? Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for the response. We hope that no olive trees will be cut down. I will take this opportunity to ask a quick question. Commissioner, yesterday the result on help for the destitute was important and a very important agreement was established; we can now move forward with the 2012-2013 programme, and for this I thank you. However, what I would like to know is this: will the budget remain the same, at EUR 500 million, or will it be cut? Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Sawicki, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, the food aid distribution programme for citizens at risk of poverty represents an extraordinarily important tool to sustain the most underprivileged in our society, an instrument that has been a success for the common agricultural policy in recent years and which enables the Union to distribute 440 000 tonnes of free food each year to over 18 million poor people and families in difficulty. This number unfortunately includes many children and looks set to rise at a time when access to food is defined as a fundamental right. We therefore cannot but express incomprehension and opposition when faced with the blocking minority in favour of cutting aid which has emerged within the Council of Ministers for Agriculture. We are aware of the Court of Justice’s ruling and we will work to ensure that from 2013 there will be a text which will, of course, take account of the Court’s comments, but we certainly cannot allow this programme to be interrupted. I believe that, while Europe is today discussing a EUR 500 million programme of aid to its internal population, in the United States for over 40 years the US ‘Fair Deal’ law has been providing aid to the US population with a programme worth more than USD 20 billion. I would therefore argue that we must all redouble our efforts and in this respect I would like to thank the Polish Presidency and Mr Sawicki, and to commend Mr Cioloş, who has taken this matter to heart with courage and determination. We must find a solution. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report on information to consumers allows Europe to take a new and important step towards achieving its specific objective of protecting consumer rights. I would like to thank Mrs Sommer for this, and all the shadow rapporteurs, in particular the shadow rapporteur from my group, Glenis Willmott. While it may be true that Europe can look to the future with more confidence now that the instruments for food protection and transparency have been made more effective, it is also true that the agreement in second reading redefines, albeit in part, what this House approved at first reading. For example, we would have expected more, Madam President, on origin labelling for foodstuffs. The obligation to indicate the origin of all meat, given to us in the new paragraph 25, is a significant change that meets the expectations of large numbers of European consumers. At the same time, we have to underline its less ambitious approach with regard to the introduction of mandatory labelling for all fresh agricultural products and single-ingredient processed foods, which this House had approved. Meat labelling in Annex XI excludes some important products that require an equal level of protection, such as rabbit meat, which for some reason has been excluded. However, the way forward in food transparency has been shown, and we now need to pursue it with the same commitment and responsibility that have brought us this far. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, fifteen years after the emergence of BSE, we should take stock of the implementation and prospects of the European legislative framework and the relative checks carried out on feed and food. As the rapporteur has said, figures show that the number of cases testing positive in the European Union has fallen from over 2 100 cases in 2001 to just over 65 cases in 2009, and in the light of this declining epidemiological trend we can conclude that the legislation implemented helped to eradicate BSE. This is why the report we are about to vote on is an important opportunity to show commitment and responsibility in moving towards aligning legal provisions with the actual situation in terms of risk. One good signal in this regard is the review of the ban on using animal meal in feed. The period of panic having passed, scientific progress shows that the time is now ripe for reviewing the ban on feeding non-ruminants with processed animal protein. This is an important new factor, and one which, in full compliance with food safety rules, is of strategic importance, particularly in light of the EU’s current protein deficit. At the same time, it is naturally important not to lower our guard in terms of checks and monitoring. We need to make sure we do not threaten the extraordinary progress Europe has made in consumer and animal health protection. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Dess report marks the beginning of a new phase in the common agricultural policy (CAP) reform process. It is the result of several months’ hard work by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, for which I would like to thank Mr Dess and all the shadow rapporteurs and parliamentary groups. Today this House can give a clear opinion on the future of the common agricultural policy: it must be a robust, simple, flexible and greener CAP that takes young people and employment into account. That, Commissioner, is why we are worried by the news in the press today about budget cuts, especially in the second pillar. That would be incompatible with both the Dess report and the report on the European Union’s financial perspective by Mr Garriga Polledo, which we adopted in plenary in recent weeks. The latter report introduced the important principle for the CAP of maintaining the current level of funding in the next financial programming period. Therefore, Commissioner, we would like some clarification about the news that has been circulated, and we would like to know whether as far as you are concerned there are different guidelines from what we have been told up to now.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we have an important chance to tackle the growing problem of antibiotic resistance in animals responsibly and with commitment. This is a strategic issue for the agriculture sector and, in particular, for the future of the European animal husbandry system. The data show that around 50% of the antibiotics in Europe are prescribed for animal use. If used properly, antibiotics are a useful tool that helps farmers keep their livestock healthy and productive and safeguard its welfare. Therefore, we are not here to demonise antibiotic use in animal husbandry, but we want to ask the Commission to provide a concrete response for the more efficient and effective use of antibiotics, in order to reduce resistance in animals. In our resolution of 5 May 2010 on the EU Action Plan for Animal Welfare, this House underlined the link between animal welfare, animal health and public health, and urged the Commission and the Member States to address the difficult problem of antibiotic resistance in animals in a responsible manner. In particular, we called on the Commission to collect and analyse data on the use of all animal health products, including antibiotics, with a view to ensuring the effective use of such products. A year later, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which I have the honour to chair, is here to ask the Commission to implement all relevant initiatives to resolve this long-standing problem, which can also have consequences for human health. What is needed, Madam President and Commissioner, is a tangible commitment from the Commission that it will use the data collected to put the results obtained into practice, not only encouraging research and monitoring activities, but also ensuring more effective use of antibiotics as an important tool for fighting animal diseases. On that front, I would point out that some studies show that low-energy animal feed could lead to a higher incidence of diseases and, hence, more antibiotic use. It would therefore be desirable to review the ban on the use of animal meal for non-ruminants, in line with the opinion of the European Scientific Veterinary Committee. These are the requests made in the resolution adopted in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on 12 April this year and which will be put to the vote in this Chamber tomorrow. It has been hard work for the last few months, and for that reason I would like to personally thank Mrs Paulsen, the shadow rapporteurs and all the parliamentary groups for their invaluable contributions to establishing a common text on this issue. The future competitiveness of European animal husbandry may depend on how this problem is managed, and its cross-cutting nature calls for commitment and responsibility, through a coordinated approach and a shared political will.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank Mr Wojciechowski and all the shadow rapporteurs for the work carried out on this report, which aims to make the rules on vaccination against bluetongue more flexible. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has made every effort to approve the text as a matter of urgency in order to allow the vaccination campaign to go ahead before the summer. The European Commission had presented a proposal which did not take into account the approval of the Treaty of Lisbon. In other words, it left decision-making power solely with the Council, totally excluding Parliament. After intense discussions, for which I would like to thank Parliament’s Legal Service and the secretariat of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, we managed to reach an agreement to change the legal basis, in accordance with Article 43(2) of the Treaty; in other words, within the framework of the ordinary legislative procedure. Now we expect the Council to be equally efficient in accepting our position and including the correlation tables, in order to give a prompt response to European livestock farmers. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the petition under discussion today has arrived at a time when Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and its Committee on International Trade are debating the new chapter on agriculture in the agreement with Morocco. The European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) confirms that there have been irregularities in the calculation of duties on tomato imports and that this has been damaging to European producers, the very same producers who are expressing their concern at the expected increase in tomato and fruit and vegetable imports in general that will take place if the agreement is signed. We are obviously sensitive to the concerns brought about by bilateral agreements where the agricultural element is often sacrificed for the sake of broader industrial interests. It is not a good way to proceed, and we will continue to repeat this to the European Commission. However, I would like to point out that the current economic and political crisis throughout the Maghreb area should lead us to consider this agreement carefully and with greater solidarity. Paolo De Castro,  
Chair of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to speak briefly just to underline the importance of the Wojciechowski report on bluetongue for an institutional issue which concerns us all. As far as the content is concerned, there is no conflict between the Commission, Parliament and the Council. However, the inclusion of the correlation tables in the text remains a very sensitive issue. Despite the fact that the Council was totally opposed to it, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development decided to vote for a text that includes the correlation tables, which oblige Member States to report on transposition of the directive. It is now up to the Council to decide whether to accept the correlation tables and conclude the agreement at first reading, or to answer to European farmers for causing the bluetongue vaccination campaign to be missed this year in order not to give way on this point. I believe that this report can act as a precedent in future negotiations with the Council. We must be united and determined in calling for maximum transparency from Member States and in defending total compliance with EU law. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, social tensions, such as the recent ones in North Africa, are almost always triggered by rising food prices. The record increase in the prices of cereals, sugar and vegetable oils is a clear sign of the increasing imbalance between global supply and demand. A further – sadly possible – rise in prices would have dramatic consequences particularly for those parts of the world where food expenditure accounts for more than 40% of per capita income. It also poses a real risk of creating tensions throughout the entire planet in an increasingly interdependent world economy. The European Union must therefore have a clear awareness that agricultural policies – the common agricultural policy for the European Union and the Farm Bill for the United States – have a role of extraordinary and strategic importance to play in the world order, a role that goes far beyond the legitimate protection of farmers’ incomes. We need, Madam President, a new global food policy capable of coordinating agricultural policies at international level. Personally I hope that the forthcoming G20 summit will be an opportunity to actually embark on this new path. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should also like to thank Commissioner Dalli for coming to the Chamber today to report on this case, which is a source of great concern for European consumers. Next week, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which I have the honour of chairing, will also meet to look further into the debate on the consequences of this serious episode. Despite the fact that Europe is very much committed to food safety, further efforts in terms of transparency and checks are needed in order to avoid further cases of food contamination. I would note that last year, Parliament adopted an own-initiative report on agricultural product quality and, above all, that this Chamber adopted the regulation on the provision of food information to consumers at first reading, introducing obligatory marking of the place of origin of agricultural products on labels. Unfortunately, this important development stalled on 8 December in the Health Council. We shall try to reintroduce it at second reading, because it is an important objective for protection and transparency in favour of European consumers. Parliament is therefore moving in the right direction, showing that it is on the side of consumers. We hope that the Council and the Commission adopt a similar attitude. Paolo De Castro,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today represents an important opportunity to discuss the strategic issue of protecting animal welfare in agriculture. On 1 January 2012, the terms of Council Directive 1999/74/EC will enter into force, laying down minimum standards for the protection of hens, tantamount to the abolition of conventional battery cages as a system of rearing for the production of eggs. This method of animal housing will be banned in favour of systems of rearing that guarantee better animal welfare. Mr President, the memory of the Council of the European Union on Agriculture, held on 19 July 1999, is fresh in my mind. It was an important day, on which, as the representative of my country (at the time I was the Italian Minister for Agriculture), I contributed to the approval of this important directive by voting for it. Now, one year after the irrevocable entry into force of the new legislation, data show that European producers are proceeding to adapt their production system, but not without running into difficulties. What we need is a concrete commitment from the Commission to safeguard animal welfare, to protect producers who have adapted their system of rearing to Council Directive 1999/74/EC, and, at the same time, to effectively guarantee the passage of the new legislation, avoiding distortions in terms of market competition. This is why my fellow Members and I felt it appropriate to add this important topic to the agenda of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which I have the honour of chairing. Hard work over recent months, involving all parliamentary groups, resulted in the oral question of 28 October 2010, which puts three important issues to the Commission: Firstly, to report on the implementation of the new legislation within the Member States; Secondly, the actions to be taken in the Member States to guarantee compliance with the terms of the directive, and compromising where necessary with those undertakings that show a genuine desire to adapt. Lastly, measures and guarantees to be adopted to avoid crises in the egg market in the coming years and to prevent unfair competition from third countries that are not obliged to respect the European Union directive within the European internal market. These are the queries to which we are awaiting concrete and definitive responses from the Commission. Lastly, we ask the Commissioner to guarantee a more transparent market, along the lines of the concept of so-called reciprocity of rules, in order to facilitate the prospect of greater international convergence on the animal welfare standards applied by the European Union. Attending to this matter, which we have discussed a number of times in committee since the start of the legislature, is essential to prevent Europe’s efforts on animal welfare – our efforts, Commissioner – from being rendered useless by a market that is incapable of recognising the social values that are bound up in foodstuffs. We need to reduce the distorting effects of the possibility that producers outside the European rules system could translate the lesser restrictions they are subject to into greater competitive advantages. Mr President, adopting the motion for a resolution on the welfare of laying hens, which we will vote on this morning, could represent a first and important step in this direction. Paolo De Castro,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as Chair of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I am deeply disappointed for several reasons with the contents of Mr Szájer’s report, which is being voted on tomorrow. Firstly, none the amendments voted for by my committee unanimously – and I stress, unanimously – were taken into account, even though the common agricultural policy is one of the policies with the most acts adopted under the comitology procedure and is therefore one of the ones most affected by the adaptation of legislative acts under the Treaty of Lisbon. Secondly, under the text of Article 10, the European Parliament will have no power to exert pressure nor a margin to negotiate with Council over the adaptation of CAP legislation to the new treaty. We are aware, in fact, that the Council has already demonstrated its unwillingness to agree acts delegated to the European Parliament and, with the adoption of this Regulation, the Council will not have any interest in proceeding with negotiations because the automatic adaptation – which excludes delegated acts and only covers implementing acts – has no deadline because it is transitional. For this reason, together with other fellow Members, I tabled an amendment that makes the automatic alignment genuinely temporary and I call on you all to support it in order to reinforce the role of the European Parliament. There is no reason, in fact, to come to an agreement at first reading over such a sensitive file that sets the rules for implementing the treaty for the coming years. This is the reason why, for this all-important file, we have the right – I would even go so far as to say the duty – to improve the text as much as possible and therefore proceed to a second reading without giving in to blackmail by the Council, which is threatening not to move on this file in order to force us to accept this negative agreement. After the budget, I think this is the most important file we have to vote on, because it redraws the balance of power between the European institutions. Here in this Chamber, we must vigorously defend the prerogatives of Parliament, which has been democratically elected and represents all European citizens. Paolo De Castro,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution we are about to vote on represents the view of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the European beekeeping support policy. As is normal practice for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, this important paper has benefited from the participation of all the parliamentary groups, who have added their valuable contribution to the end result. Despite the recent increase in the annual budget for measures to improve the general conditions for production and marketing of bee products, a widespread concern persists with regard to the numerous challenges and problems that beekeeping will have to face in the near future. Difficult production and marketing conditions, strong and prolonged price volatility and difficulties emerging from the increasingly widespread mortality of bee stocks are some of the critical factors that afflict one of the most important sectors of European agriculture. Like all other primary sector operators, European beekeepers must be put in a position where they can plan their own affairs. Since the current support depends on European agricultural policy implementation procedures in force at present, the future of this policy after 2013 is uncertain. This is the background to today’s resolution, whereby we intend to call on the Commission to make an active commitment to defend beekeeping. The main demands to the Commission contained in the motion for a resolution include the following: a specific undertaking after the expiry of national programmes, also in view of new challenges and problems in the sector, namely bee mortality, price volatility etc.; a commitment to the necessary improvement in statistical measurements, for more effective control of non-EU honey imports and research development; a strengthening of the role of European veterinary policy; an action plan to tackle the phenomenon of widespread bee mortality, partly through specific undertakings in the field of research; greater financial support in the field of operator training and education and, lastly, a revitalised role as a leading player for the beekeeping sector within the common agricultural policy after 2013. In thanking Mrs Lulling and all my fellow MEPs for the common work carried out, I would like to remind you, Madam President, Commissioner, that the International Year of Biodiversity is about to end. This is why we hope that approval of the resolution will definitely mark the start of the road to relaunch a sector that is particularly strategic from the viewpoint of environmental sustainability and maintenance of biodiversity, as well as in terms of economic and social impact.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are here today to call on the Commission to implement suitable efficient and flexible market instruments to combat the crisis into which the European livestock sector has plunged. We hope that the proposal that the Commission will shortly present on market instruments for the milk and dairy sector will also include proposals to limit the impact of price volatility on the agricultural sector as a whole. Many actions can still be deployed to send out a strong signal to European livestock breeders. We believe, for example, that it would be very useful to the livestock sector to review the current ban on the use of animal meal for non-ruminants, for example, for the avian and fisheries sectors. As you know, this ban was introduced following cases of BSE but now, a few years on, the scientific community agrees in stating that the ban can only be justified for ruminants. In the case of non-ruminants, conversely, there is no danger to human health and the environment and we therefore hope that this ban may be overturned with the aim of offering these animals a greater possibility of higher-energy diets.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after a year and a half of difficult negotiations between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, we have at last arrived at a compromise text in the sensitive dossier on animal experimentation. It has been difficult work and I should like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Jeggle, and our shadow rapporteurs, for having carried out such intense negotiations. The text was adopted unopposed, with only 4 abstentions, by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which it is my honour to chair. It achieves a good balance between the need to improve the welfare of animals used in experiments and the need to allow for progress in medical research. The proposal aims to examine and improve the 1986 directive, which is now obsolete, and harmonise European regulations on the subject. Animal experimentation is a particularly sensitive topic for all of us as well as for the general public, but I can say with conviction, ladies and gentlemen, that the text on which we are about to vote is reasonable and the outcome of serious, meticulous work. It is a definite improvement on the existing legislation in terms of animal protection while, at the same time, it does not lose sight of our moral responsibility to advance medical research. Paolo De Castro,  
Chair of the AGRI Committee.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as chair of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which is the relevant committee for this topic, I am against referring back the Jeggle report. After more than a year and a half of intense debate, our committee has already come out quite clearly in favour of the compromise reached on the common position, without any votes against and only a few abstentions. I therefore see no reason for re-examining the text: we already have everything we need to vote on it today. Paolo De Castro,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Jordan River is a major asset of not only environmental, but also agricultural and economic significance for Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian Territories, and the degradation it is suffering cannot fail to worry us. It is important to point out that roughly 98% of the 1.3 billion cubic metres of natural fresh water in the lower course of the river is diverted away every year, and long stretches of the river are at risk of running dry. This is devastating not only in terms of biodiversity, but above all in terms of local communities’ access to sources of water. Several international actors, including the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly and the United States Senate, have addressed the situation of profound degradation of the Jordan River. We, too, must demand intervention, not only from the local governments and authorities, but also from the Council, the Commission and the Member States, to provide technical and financial assistance for the rehabilitation of the river. In particular – as stated in the joint resolution signed by all the political groups, whom I thank for their wholehearted support – we must ask the Commission to insert a clear, specific reference to this project in the action plans of the neighbourhood policy with Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority. An initial step could be to set up a joint study on the situation of the Jordan River. We are well aware that water is a precious, inalienable asset, so I would like to point out that distributing the water fairly means paying equal attention to the demands of all the communities in the region. This is a matter of supreme importance if we want to achieve lasting peace and stability in the Middle East. We have been watching the resumption of peace negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians in recent days with some hope, as these negotiations have identified water resource management as one of their essential points. We hope that the governments, local communities and civil society organisations in the countries and territories involved will begin to cooperate effectively as soon as possible in order to save the lower Jordan. This is a duty not only because of the high symbolic value of this river but, above all, in order to improve the living conditions of the local communities. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over the next few years the challenges accompanying the development of the European agricultural system will be huge: the growing demand for food will have to be met through the sustainable use of natural resources, with a parallel increase in the level of environmental performance. This outlook, which strengthens the relationship between the agricultural sector and the production of public goods, gives agriculture a new strategic importance: the creation of the future common agricultural policy (CAP) today represents the solution to these major challenges facing our society, and the policy will play a crucial role in responding to what is already a food crisis. Therefore, it is a case of producing more while polluting less: this is the difficult objective that European agriculture will have to fulfil over the next few years. Based on these assumptions, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which I have the honour of chairing, has produced an intense and concise piece of work – which Mr Lyon, with the involvement of all the groups, has overseen in an excellent fashion – in the shape of the report presented to Parliament today. It is a report that we are convinced will help lay the foundations of the future CAP and will provide the European Commission with some clear pointers so that it can prepare the year-end communication on the future of the CAP after 2013.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a new phase of reflection has opened in Europe today on the issue of quality, which is intended not only as a guarantee for consumers but, above all, as a stimulus for our producers to be more competitive in a market that is far larger and far more competitive. Our businesses need to gain market recognition of the distinctive and quality-related aspects associated with their products. In this sense, as Mr Scottà’s report intends – and I, too, thank him for my part – we are making progress in guaranteeing, first of all, more information on the origin, composition and characteristics of production processes. At the same time, Commissioner, it is fundamental that European regulations allow organisations designated for the protection and promotion of quality products to plan their product supply and to adapt their production potential to market needs on the basis of fair and non-discriminatory principles. We hope that the approval of this report will signal the definitive establishment of quality as the lynchpin of the European strategy for the agri-food sector, and that the Commission will seriously consider our committee’s proposals, so that one of the principal strong points of European agriculture can be transformed into a precious competitive advantage. Paolo De Castro  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT) 
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I must express my sincere regret, and that of the entire Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which I have the honour of chairing, that no reference whatsoever has been made to the agri-food sector in the 2020 strategy. It is absurd that the Commission’s proposed strategy for the next 10 years does not include the central issue of the challenge relating to food security, growth and job retention in rural areas. Madam President, how can one conceive of a green and sustainable Europe without taking into account that 45% of all European territory is managed by farmers? How can one fail to take into account the nearly 30 million people who work on that territory? These are workers who must be safeguarded and protected. Before we focus on new jobs, we must protect the existing ones. I would remind you that agriculture provides a whole host of essential services relating to, among other things, food, biodiversity, the landscape and the environment, and these are tasks that are performed for the sake of the social and economic life of rural areas. The Spanish Presidency has also insisted strongly on the need for a powerful common agricultural policy. I am therefore concerned about this very serious omission, which I hope Parliament will be able to put right. Paolo De Castro,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, here we are once again discussing the crisis in the agricultural sector. In recent months, Parliament has spoken several times on the difficulties that have seriously beset the milk sector, and asked the Commission and the Council to take urgent action. We have achieved results, albeit only partial results, but on the basis of these initiatives, a special fund of EUR 300 million has been made available to deal with the emergency. However, we must now take note that the crisis that has affected the dairy farming sector is rapidly extending to other sectors of European agriculture, with the wheat, olive oil and fruit and vegetable markets showing alarming signs, as Mrs Fischer Boel has just said. As for milk, we are facing a cyclical phenomenon that goes hand in hand with the difficult economic situation that has inevitably resulted in a fall in demand and in the ensuing stagnation of the markets. This crisis is starting to take on a decidedly worrying dimension, as demonstrated by the numerous protests led by farmers in many regions of Europe. These are symptomatic of a pressing and alarming situation and of widespread concern for the future of the sector as a whole. That is why, at the last meeting of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on 1 December, we decided unanimously to invite the Commission to the House to report to us on the status of the crisis faced by our agriculture and the trends that the various productive sectors are going through. On this front we expect, first of all, the Commission to make use of all the measures at its disposal to stabilise the market and to stimulate the recovery of consumption but, at the same time, we believe that this opportunity should also be seized upon to look to the future, and help guarantee that the common agricultural policy will continue to be an important European policy, which will look after the interests of all citizens and all European regions, from northern Sweden to southern Cyprus. Farmers expect immediate answers, and today we are here to accept responsibility to speed things up, to tackle the crisis in a decisive manner, and to put the lessons of recent experiences to good use, thus avoiding wasting time and quickly remedying a situation that is in danger of becoming even worse. We would like to receive an answer and also news from the Commission in this regard. Paolo De Castro,  
Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, here we are once again discussing the crisis in the milk sector. The dramatic nature of this crisis continues to concern us, just as European farmers continue to express their hardship and voice their fears for the future. Parliament has already expressed its views on this matter, both by adopting a resolution with our proposals and by adopting the Commission proposal to extend the intervention period for milk powder and butter, to which we added the request for the measure on the private storage of cheese. At that time, we pointed out that the measures proposed by the Commission did not go nearly far enough. We now have to decide whether or not to allow the urgent procedure for the extension of Article 186 of the single CMO Regulation to the dairy sector, namely the possibility for the Commission to decide, in the event of a market crisis, to implement emergency measures without going through the normal procedure in Parliament. Yesterday evening, an extraordinary meeting of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development was held to discuss this, with Mrs Fischer Boel attending. Firstly I, and the committee which it is my honour to chair, would like to thank the Commissioner for coming to us in Parliament right at the end of the Agricultural Council which was held in Luxembourg. This gesture was one of great attentiveness which we appreciated. Yesterday evening, the debate was very spirited, Mr President, and our fellow Members voiced a lot of criticism. First of all, it was pointed out that the Commission was very slow to act, and did not adequately grasp the seriousness of the crisis under way. Then the objection was raised that Article 186 deprives Parliament of its decision-making prerogatives, thereby giving carte blanche to the Commission. It was also said that the Commission should have made more funds available to tackle the crisis. These are legitimate concerns which we agree with in part. Nevertheless, Mr President, I feel compelled to admit that the Commission has made considerable efforts and progress, showing that it takes Parliament’s opinion and wishes seriously. It has explained how it intends to use a fund of EUR 280 million – which, I would remind you, we will be voting on this Thursday in the context of approval of the 2010 budget – and set out some of the measures it will implement, such as the private storage of cheese and raising the ceiling of de minimis
 aid from EUR 7 500 to EUR 15 000, as requested in our resolution which was adopted in September. Although I am aware that all this still does not go far enough, I nevertheless believe, Mr President, that today we should vote in favour of the urgent procedure. European farmers expect immediate answers and too much time has already been wasted. Today we must take responsibility for speeding things up in order to face the crisis head on. Let us show, ladies and gentlemen, the same responsibility which pervades our preparations for the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon with codecision in agricultural matters. Paolo De Castro,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Mrs Fischer Boel, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to take the opportunity to say how pleased I am at the responsibility shown this morning by the House when it adopted the urgent procedure to include the dairy sector under Article 186 of the single CMO Regulation, along with many other agricultural products. The rapid extension to this sector of the rules governing intervention in the event of market crisis enables us to provide a significant response at an extremely difficult time for farming as a whole and the dairy sector in particular. At this point, we expect the European Commission to take onboard, as Mrs Fischer Boel just said, Parliament’s requests, which have pointed out several times that the measures taken until now have proved to be inadequate given the seriousness of the current crisis. Parliament’s openness towards the Commission today should not be interpreted as full delegation with unrestricted powers, but as a gesture of responsibility in a dramatic and wholly exceptional situation. I am keen to stress that in this regard, Parliament considers it essential to be involved at every stage of the decision-making process in order to guarantee democratic scrutiny, and this is why we believe that the Commission should notify Parliament in advance of how it will actually use these new powers conferred under Article 186 for the milk sector as well.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 2 October was a great day for Europe thanks to the Irish who voted in favour of the Treaty of Lisbon. The entry into force of codecision will be a veritable democratic revolution for the common agricultural policy in particular. Parliament will finally have decision-making powers equal to those of the Council of Agricultural Ministers, thanks to the agreement of the Irish and the favourable votes received in the national parliaments, including the Czech Parliament. Any delay would create problems for farmers throughout the Member States. In fact, the agricultural sector is going through one of its most delicate and difficult times of recent years, with a fall in the prices of most products, and not just of dairy products, as we have seen these last few days. As we await the formal entry into force of the Treaty, we expect the Council and the Commission, Mr President, to give careful consideration as from today to the decisions taken by Parliament – which was democratically elected by all European citizens – regarding agricultural matters too, starting with measures to address the crisis in the dairy sector.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the dairy farming sector is going through one of the deepest and most serious crises of the last few decades: the fall in the price of milk and the more general crisis in the dairy farming market have now become a source of concern throughout Europe. This is a cyclical crisis, caused by the difficult economic situation, which has led to a decline in milk consumption and created stagnant markets, with the prices paid to producers in free fall. The prices paid to milk producers have plummeted everywhere, averaging 24 cents per litre within the European Union. Many economic operators are in an even more serious situation, as they get prices of less than 20-21 cents, when their production costs come to at least 40 cents per litre. Other markets, such as the cereal, olive oil and fruit and vegetable markets, are showing some alarming signs too. On this front, first of all, we should continue to make use of all the measures at our disposal so as to stabilise the market and to stimulate an upturn in consumption, but at the same time we need to be able to look to the future with medium- and long-term policies and to do everything possible to identify acceptable and lasting solutions aimed at minimising the risk of price fluctuations. In this context the Commission proposals extending the intervention period for butter and skimmed milk powder have been welcomed and accepted within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, as the unanimous vote of 2 September demonstrates. We believe, however, that these proposals are not enough to mitigate the serious consequences of the crisis in the sector. That is why, still in relation to the adoption of the European Commission’s proposal, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has adopted an amendment to my proposal that also reintroduces aid for private storage of cheese, which was abolished under the health check on the common agricultural policy in November 2008. This was a unanimous decision, Madam President, Commissioner, representing what are, in essence, identical views shared by the members of the Committee on Agriculture, which I have the honour of chairing, and expressing our desire to send out a strong signal to the Council and the Commission at a sensitive time for an extremely important sector for European agriculture. As well as being a first important demonstration of the positive leadership that we as the European Parliament want to provide when looking ahead to codecision in agricultural matters too, this is a measure that can also offer immediate help to dairy farmers, who are grappling with an increasingly difficult market and with an obvious and dramatic fall in sales. However, these initial measures, on which we will vote today, are not enough to support the producers in crisis, and that is why the Committee on Agriculture, through an oral question and a resolution on which we are preparing to vote, is calling on the European Commission to introduce new and effective measures to combat the crisis and to support the sector. We want to encourage and at the same time support the European Commission in the process of deciding what must be done to end the crisis in the European dairy farming sector once and for all. In this sense we hope that the Commission will provide an exhaustive answer to our questions and will take our proposals seriously, so that interinstitutional cooperation produces the results that European agriculture deserves and shows its solidarity by offering practical support to European farmers in crisis, who need our help today.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank the Commission for deciding to come here to Parliament today to present new proposals on the crisis in the dairy farming sector. It is important for the parliamentary term that has just begun to be characterised by an interinstitutional dialogue between the Commission and Parliament, a positive dialogue, which has in fact already launched the codecision process. We will assess your new proposals very carefully, Commissioner, and it will be my job to ask the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to issue an opinion on the new ideas immediately, without delay. May I conclude, however, by pointing out that, if the amendment adopted unanimously within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is also adopted by this House in plenary, it will become a political problem if the Council, after the ratification of Lisbon, should then vote it down. I therefore invite you, and the Council, to give it serious consideration. Rita Borsellino,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is an emotional moment for me as I come to present my own-initiative report on the European Union’s internal security strategy. It is, in fact, 20 years ago this week – on 23 May to be precise – that Judge Giovanni Falcone, his wife and his police escort were murdered. I would like to dedicate the adoption of this report to all the victims of mafias, organised crime and terrorism, and, in particular, to Melissa Bassi, the young victim of last Saturday’s attack on a school in Brindisi, in which six other girls were also wounded. The motive for the attack is still unknown, but it clearly comes within the context of growing tension and lack of security caused by the crisis, which organisations or individuals may be tempted to exploit for violently subversive ends. My thoughts also go out to the victims of the earthquake in Emilia Romagna, because natural disasters also come within the Union’s internal security remit. The text that we will vote on tomorrow highlights the importance of having a consistent security strategy for the Union, and in that respect I would like to thank the Commission for the major effort it has made in drafting this strategy. As is repeatedly shown in the report, security must always be pursued in accordance with the rule of law and people’s fundamental rights, which form an integral and inseparable part of this strategy. That is also why the role of the EU institutions in defining and implementing the strategy is of particular importance, especially in the post-Lisbon context. The European Parliament also needs to play an appropriate role in this context, both in setting priorities for the strategy and during the evaluation stage. This role derives from the fully-fledged legislative powers that Parliament has acquired in matters of security. It is also essential for ensuring proper democratic control, which the European Parliament should exercise alongside the national parliaments. That is why we will undertake to establish regular links between the European Parliament and the national parliaments, so as to create a parliamentary political round associated with the Commission’s annual report on this subject and ending with an annual parliamentary report on the implementation status of the internal security strategy. We believe the Union needs to have a clear idea of the extent of the threats to internal security, which it currently does not have. We therefore call on Europol, with the support of the other EU institutions and agencies, to conduct a global analysis of the threats facing the Union, on the basis of a more transparent and robust methodology and relying on information contributed by the Member States. In relation to the five key objectives identified by the Commission, we are of the opinion that they are not exhaustive and that the order of priorities could probably have been better structured. The fight against terrorism, organised crime and mafias is, and must remain, a key priority within the internal security strategy. The Union must know not only how to react to whatever happens in Europe, but also how to prevent and interpret it. That has been shown by the events in Utøya and now again in Brindisi. We need to be able to recognise the early signs of violent radicalisation, barbarisation of the social milieu and violent extremism. Judicial cooperation is the main element lacking in the security strategy outlined by the Commission, and this gap needs to be filled. Joint action by judicial systems across Europe is crucial if we are to clamp down on crime and terrorism; strengthening such action must be prioritised, as must fighting corruption and combating environmental, economic and corporate crime. While we agree with the emphasis placed on fighting cybercrime, the Commission’s decision to include the protection of intellectual property rights among our security priorities hardly seems justified. As the issue of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement shows, this topic is not just a security matter but is highly complex and involves people’s rights, and therefore it requires a more thorough debate. I would like to finish by thanking all the shadow rapporteurs who played a part in drafting this report, as well as the staff of the political groups and my personal assistant. Rita Borsellino,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I was part of the European Parliament delegation that visited Sicily in November last year. The head of our delegation, Ms Wikström, wrote to the Italian Minister for the Interior, Ms Cancellieri, and has received a reply that is clear enough. I should like to put on record first of all that since our visit, there has been a change of government in Italy, and there has also been a change of approach to the situation. However, the situation itself in the countries from which the flow of migrants largely originates has also changed. This is why we must not shirk from the need for a close examination of what has happened or of the situation as it is now. The most important fact, still an issue, is Lampedusa’s status as an unsafe port with the closure of the Contrada Imbraciola emergency assistance and reception centre following the fire in September 2011 in which it was damaged. However, the damage was only partial: a dormitory was wrecked and one of the facility’s seven buildings was damaged, followed by the effective termination of the Presidium project. Now, apart from the consideration that the only unsafe port in the Mediterranean was Tripoli in the Gaddafi era – and this analogy does not seem flattering to me – and given that the migration flows have certainly not come to an end, even though they have notably lessened both in numbers and for seasonal reasons, it is important that there should be a functioning emergency assistance and reception facility, and that it should be located at Lampedusa, which is the first landing point for those arriving from the opposite shore after journeys that are certainly not easy or free from risk. This is something the shipwreck victims from Somalia who arrived in April this year know well, after seeing 10 people die on the barge on which they were travelling, or the 20 who were transferred from Linosa because there was no place for them in the other reception centres, or the 18 who are still in Linosa, living in the stadium’s changing-rooms. There is also the tourist residence of Cala Creta, where they are currently housed, which is certainly neither an identification and expulsion centre nor a reception centre for asylum seekers, and especially the fact that in the meantime, both the sanitary arrangements and the possibility of receiving asylum at Lampedusa have been removed. Everything has been entrusted to the goodwill and the kind-heartedness of the police or the citizens and volunteers of Lampedusa. Another thing that must be borne in mind is the role that the centre itself has assumed in the recent past. After having allowed thousands upon thousands of people to gather, against all legal and ethical standards, in a place which, in terms of capacity and function, was only intended to accommodate a few hundred passing through, after having allowed an area of a few square kilometres, already made problematic on account of its location and logistics, to be forced to accommodate a number of people far in excess of the local population itself, we must give thought to who is responsible for an extremely tense situation, which then resulted in the fire itself. I believe that a perusal and examination of the facts is enough to understand that it was precisely the removal from Lampedusa of the great number of people who had gathered there which led to all this. Today, the best relations will surely lead to a better state of affairs. Rita Borsellino  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Member of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to join my colleagues who have welcomed the anti-corruption package approved by the European Commission on 6 June. Corruption is a transnational phenomenon and European-wide measures are needed to fight it. According to estimates from Eurobarometer, the vast majority of our European citizens believe that Europe should do more. How can we fault them? Many Member States have lacked the political will to fight corruption. One only has to consider that some European countries have still not signed the United Nations Convention Against Corruption. If we think of the devastating effect of corruption on democratic processes, citizens’ rights and confidence in the rule of law, it is clear that the national anti-corruption measures adopted by Member States to date are not sufficient to curb what is a growing problem. The European Union has to give a unified, strong response, especially now, in the midst of an unprecedented economic crisis, which is having an impact on people’s lives, on the survival of welfare and pension systems, and on the ability of institutions to guarantee essential services. Each year corruption causes the loss of EUR 120 billion, the equivalent of 1% of the European Union GDP. Every day it siphons off resources belonging to the EU and to Member States that could be used to provide key services – education, children’s services, employment and transport. In other words it siphons off clean resources from services to support people. We therefore need to be more courageous and more firm, both in overseeing the implementation of anti-corruption measures, and in intensifying and strengthening measures to combat corruption at EU level. More specifically, we cannot talk about combating corruption unless we are capable of adopting at least basic standards for defining the crime of corruption, which there is no trace of in the package just launched. The same goes for the definition of standard parameters for measuring the extent of the problem in Member States, which is essential for preparing an adequate response. For example, we are in favour of relaunching the network of EU anti-corruption contact points, as I proposed in the resolution we will be voting on tomorrow. Rita Borsellino  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today’s debate on readmission agreements cannot escape the now thorny issue of the agreement between the European Union and Libya. We know that one part of the agreement centres on the fight against illegal immigration. We are worried because so far, the Commission has said little to us on the issue, despite the fact that the Treaty of Lisbon obliges the Commission to provide Parliament with information promptly. As we know, Libya is not a signatory to the Geneva Convention on Human Rights, nor has it so far shown that it has adopted standards of behaviour in line with international law. I am thinking of the case of the Eritrean immigrants held in inhumane conditions in the Libyan centre of Brak, as well as the closure of the offices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Above all, however, I am thinking about the events of last week, when a Libyan patrol boat opened fire on an Italian fishing boat from the Mazara del Vallo fleet in international waters, claiming that there were illegal immigrants on board. This is an extremely worrying explanation that brings to mind the agreement signed between Libya and Italy. Among other things, this provides for the refoulement of immigrants to Libya without any provisions on the right to request asylum or individual, case-by-case assessments of each situation, whilst it also permits the use of firearms to stop immigrants. Given that part of the agreement is secret in this case too, I wonder if the Commission is aware of its content and whether, in the case in question, it thinks it necessary to request explanations regarding the Libyan authorities’ ability to open fire on boats if they suspect that they are carrying illegal immigrants. Because if this was the case … (The President cut off the speaker) Rita Borsellino  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Chastel, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the French Government’s decision to expel more than one thousand Roma is an extremely serious matter, above all, when we consider that this measure was taken for propagandist and populist reasons at a time when the French Government is far from enjoying favourable public opinion, and this is true political manipulation. This measure undermines the principle of European citizenship first and foremost. Under Directive 2004/38/EC on freedom of movement, this principle must be restricted only in specific cases and the restriction assessed on a case-by-case basis. I do not believe that this is what happened. As guardian of the treaties, the Commission’s job is to intervene quickly and to carefully assess conduct by Member States that is xenophobic and does not comply with EU law. I would also like to remind you that when the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force, the Charter of Fundamental Rights became binding and prohibits any kind of discrimination based on ethnic origin or nationality. Today, this debate gives us the opportunity to find out what the Commission and the Council think about these measures and what action they will take in this regard, not least because, quite sincerely, I believe that the Commission’s response was a little late in coming. I shall conclude by asking the Commission and the Council what became of the action plan for the development of a European strategy for the Roma and their integration, and how France and the other Member States are using the European money earmarked for the integration of ethnic minorities.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is not my intention, nor that of my group – which supported and wanted this debate – to transfer Italian internal political diatribes to the European domain. The issue of freedom of information concerns us all: it concerns the European Union, which can and must regulate the matter at Community level, so as to resist political and economic conditioning and to guarantee true pluralism of information. The Italian anomaly, where the Prime Minister is also the owner of some of the most important private networks, lies precisely in the existence of a dangerous link between the media and political and economic powers. It is precisely for this reason that we are calling for a European legislative measure, a measure that – far from being an anti-Italian act – will help to safeguard pluralism of information, preventing concentrations and conflicts of interest. We therefore call on the Commission today to intervene as quickly as possible – as this Parliament has already requested in the past – in order to equip the European Union with common rules for safeguarding freedom of information for all European citizens.

 Mr President, Mr Barrot, Mr Billström, ladies and gentlemen, in recent days, when setting out the European asylum plan, you yourself, Mr Barrot, talked of steadfastness in the fight against illegal immigration and of humanity when receiving the victims of persecution. Translated into legal terms, this means ensuring protection and the right to asylum for those fleeing starvation, war and persecution, and preventing their expulsion to countries where their lives are in danger or they risk inhumane treatment. This is basically the opposite of what the Italian Government is doing, as demonstrated by the latest worrying refoulement of 75 immigrants from Eritrea and Somalia to Libya, which happened without at least checking whether there were any potential asylum seekers, as required by international law and as denounced yesterday by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. An agreement between Italy and Libya cannot transform that stretch of the sea into a free zone where human rights are violated. I therefore call on the Commission to take action as soon as possible to ensure that the rules of international law are restored and complied with. Furthermore, I would like to know what progress has been made in the negotiations on the bilateral agreement between the EU and Libya, already underway for a number of years. When do you expect to conclude it? Can the Council and the Commission confirm that this agreement would prevail over the Italy-Libya one? Can you explain to Parliament the key points relating to tackling illegal immigration and guaranteeing the right to asylum and the principle of non-refoulement? Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, I would like to move this oral amendment, which is purely technical, to add to paragraph 22 the words: ‘which are eligible for registration and expected to register’.

Madam President, we are having a strange debate. We are discussing two balanced reports, and then the third one, the report by Ms Ferreira, on which the EPP has chosen to follow an ideological and extremist line, sticking to the defence of an integralist version of austerity policy. The members of Berlusconi’s party in this Parliament are performing the miracle of being extremist twice over: extremist in Italy against austerity, and extremist in this Parliament in supporting austerity, but behind the ideologies there is reality, and the reality is that the rate of fiscal consolidation is not only worsening the recession and unemployment, it is not reaching its main goal: the reduction of deficit and debt.  Open your eyes, EPP colleagues in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. With your medicine, public debt is growing in Europe, and if we want to reduce it, fiscal discipline must not be blind. It must be growth-friendly; it must leave room for public investment and have a sustainable space. After the IMF, the Commission and the European Council are recognising this reality, but not the EPP in the ECON Committee, which even went so far as to delete a paragraph which simply welcomed the efforts of the Commission to pursue growth-friendly fiscal consolidation. We hope that in plenary the EPP will isolate its extremists and will return to moderation and a spirit of compromise, but if this does not happen, our ‘no’ will be loud and clear.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the current crisis is not just an economic crisis, it is also a political crisis that has to do with the contradiction between the prevalence of the national political sphere and the need for the euro to have a European government founded on European institutions that have democratic legitimacy at European level. For this reason, the resolution is of great importance. Roberto Gualtieri,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. 
– (IT) 
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I said that the crisis currently affecting the euro is not exclusively economic but is rather a political crisis based on the growing contradiction between the fact that the national dimension prevails in politics yet the policies needed to face the crisis are European. This resolution aims to bring about a reform that does not require changes to the Treaties or secondary legislation. It is an important political and institutional reform because it uses the mechanism of nominating a candidate for Commission Presidency based on the model of parliamentary regimes, although we are obviously not dealing with a direct election. Nomination is by the European parliamentary parties, recognised by and present in the Treaties. We are therefore applying the spirit and the letter of the Treaties, which state that the President of the Commission is elected by Parliament and that the appointment of the President should take into account the result of the EP elections. At the same time, we are introducing a reform allowing the citizens to participate directly in choosing the political government of Europe. This brings genuine democratic legitimacy, based on a real European political sphere for the European institutions, which is a precondition for the effectiveness of their actions of government, as well as for their democratic legitimacy. On the other hand, this reform does not, in my opinion, contradict the independence of the Commission. This is because Article 17 of the Treaty of Lisbon on the independence of the Commission refers both to the fact that the Council should propose a candidate, acting by qualified majority, and that the proposal should take account of the results of the elections to the European Parliament, clearly demonstrating, as is the case in ordinary democratic regimes, that the democratic legitimacy of a governing body does not necessarily conflict with its independence. The question here is one of democratisation and politicisation, in order to strengthen the action of the Commission and, overall, to build a more legitimate, stronger European Union that is closer to its citizens and therefore more capable of providing a response to the extraordinary crisis that we are experiencing. Indeed, with reforms such as this, the crisis might well be the opportunity to take another step on the road to a political Europe. Roberto Gualtieri,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fundamental message of this report is that a single currency cannot simply be a system of rules but requires proper economic governance, with its own resources and full democratic legitimacy. A genuine Economic and Monetary Union should therefore be based on the EU institutions, around which a true European political space should take shape. Consequently, an increased role for Parliament is not a case of empire-building but is an essential condition for giving legitimacy and strength to the governance of the euro. However, we believe that a loose federation, based on a clear definition of roles, resources and powers between the EU and the Member States, would be more effective and democratic and, at the same time, more respectful of the national parliaments’ prerogatives than the model that has taken shape in recent years. Because of this, we support the idea of stronger fiscal powers based on own resources, the embryo of a proper European Treasury, provided that this operates within the EU budget and is based on additional resources. For this reason we believe that the ex ante
 coordination of economic policies can be increased and must involve Parliament on a different basis from the contract-based model indicated in the interim report. Because of this we believe that implementing common debt management mechanisms at EU level is unavoidable. So this means reinforced governance, but also different policies. Budgetary discipline should be accompanied by countercyclical measures that can guarantee a suitable role for public investment, and the protection and revitalisation of the European social model should become an integral part of the governance of the euro, a genuine ‘fifth pillar’ based on a social pact that prioritises youth and employment. With this report, Parliament is therefore promoting an ambitious vision and a clear and realistic roadmap. Firstly, full use should be made of the broad margins for manoeuvre offered by the Treaties; in the next parliamentary term, boosted by enhanced legitimacy from Parliament and the Commission, through the mechanism by which the European parties choose the candidate to be chair, a Convention should be set up that completes the process of building proper economic and democratic governance of the euro, which is essential if the crisis is to be overcome and Europe saved. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the current difficulties facing the European steel industry demand an examination of the role of the industry in EU policies. This not only concerns the limited powers of completion, shall we say, of the industry, but the overall effect of competition, trade, cohesion and fiscal policies. Although the economic crisis has highlighted the central role of manufacturing, we must move away from a system that has in recent decades put consumption before production, services before industry. I believe that the various cases, such as the special steel manufactured at Terni and the Piombino steel plant, are food for thought in this respect. In terms of competition policy, for example, we should maintain a global, and not just a European, outlook when evaluating dominant positions. With regard to this particular question, I believe it is important that we guarantee the integrity of the Terni site during the current sale and hive-off by Outokumpu of its steel pipe business. In terms of fiscal policy, the measures contained in June’s Growth Pact must be implemented swiftly, encouraging fiscal consolidation to bolster growth and thus safeguard the role of public investment in European fiscal policy. Finally, there is the question of rules on State aid, which should be recast to encourage bridging finance aimed at securing the future of manufacturing at sites deemed to be strategic. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a single currency requires genuine economic union; not merely a system of rules and regulations but economic government based on democratic institutions and equipped with adequate resources. Parliament insists that there can be no effective and legitimate ways of achieving this aim unless developed within the Union framework based on the institutions of the Union, and that the European Parliament is the Parliament of the euro because the euro is the currency of the Union. It is right that these principles should be recalled in the European Council’s conclusions, but they need to be stated tangibly and coherently. Greater fiscal capacity is required to absorb the shocks caused by the crisis and to sustain growth and social inclusion, but clearly such fiscal capacity can and must be made a part of the EU budget and must be based on additional own resources; above all it should not distract from the need to have a joint capacity for issuing and managing debt. However, we are opposed to individual contracts: they are ineffective and risk bringing about an asymmetric transfer of sovereignty, which would accentuate the democratic deficit. Parliament proposes a different model: binding and general social and economic objectives defined in ordinary legislative procedure at EU level, with national governments and parliaments competent to decide how these might be achieved. This approach reflects a vision that is at once more ambitious and more realistic of a Europe in which stability, growth, social cohesion and democracy go hand in hand – and for this reason a fifth social pillar is essential – and of a federal transition aimed at building consensus among citizens on the basis of a clear road map. This would involve: 1) correcting a policy based on austerity and the inter-governmental method with swift Decisions that take maximum advantage of the possibilities offered by the Treaties and prioritise growth and employment; 2) rendering the upcoming European elections genuine elections for the government of the EU. Finally, a convention should be called to complete the building of real democratic government for Europe and its currency. Parliament calls on you to act, and Parliament will exercise all of its powers. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with Mr Brok’s statements and with his report, which see progress in the development of the European External Action Service. This, together with your personal action, is starting to give shape and identity to the EU’s common foreign and security policy and external action, along the lines of a global multilateral approach based on plural instruments, which is the only possible way to face the challenges of the world today. In this framework, I believe that the balanced approach you have taken on delicate issues such as those of Syria and Iran, based on a correct awareness of the delicate network of interdependence and on the contradiction between state and national religion that characterises the Middle East, is commendable. That said, there is clearly a long way to go towards a better identification of the priorities, which are to strengthen the unity of intent of the Member States, strengthen European defence and develop the parliamentary dimension of the common foreign and security policy, both in terms of parliamentary control of the spirit and the letter of Article 36, and of strengthening the potential of parliamentary diplomacy. I believe that in these areas, too, we can work together, not least in preparation for the review of the decision establishing the External Action Service, towards which we will work constructively.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the ‘two-pack’ shows that there is a legal basis for EU governance of the euro area, as this Chamber had called for during the revision of Article 136. What we now have to assess is whether these two regulations seem to be capable of dealing with the deterioration of the crisis and the potential of their legal basis. Here, the answer is clear: the Commission’s proposal seems to belong to another epoch. As Commissioner Rehn has said, the Commission proposes an addition to the ‘six-pack’ without taking into account the obvious limits of austerity policies and economic governance that are solely focused on introducing rigid constraints and without attributing any real financial decision-making powers to the EU. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has introduced significant improvements to the Commission’s proposal, especially visible in the report by Ms Ferreira, first and foremost, in the article on the debt redemption fund. However, there remain several limitations. I am struck by the deafness of rapporteur Mr Gauzès who, faced with the proposal to involve Parliament in activating the enhanced surveillance procedure, introduces a procedure similar to that used for delegated acts. Our group, however, has responsibly decided to focus on one point, on which, however, there still appears to be some confusion. Amendment 82 is not a weakening of the Stability and Growth Pact, it is not a classic ‘golden rule’ clause. Quite the opposite: it is a tool to defend the Stability and Growth Pact, to make it effective and to ensure compliance, as well as giving a greater role to the Commission. The amendment is based on the concept of sustainable discipline and gives the Commission the task of prioritising investments for growth and employment when defining medium-term objectives and assessing Member State budgets. For this reason, I call upon fellow Members in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) to read the amendment, to reflect and to prevent this Parliament from appearing to be cut off from a situation that is evolving throughout Europe as well as in the Council.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Martin’s report paves the way to the full implementation of the Treaties’ provision governing the right of inquiry, essential for carrying out one of Parliament’s fundamental duties: political control. The Treaty of Lisbon introduced a special legislative procedure, and we therefore hope that during negotiations, both the institutions – Council and Commission – will uphold the spirit of this rule which explicitly entrusts the power of initiative and regulatory power to Parliament, and limits the role of the Council and Commission to a mere expression of consent. Mr Martin’s report draws on the previous experiences of temporary committees of inquiry which have shown the limitations of this instrument, and proposes significant innovations. Informal talks with the Danish Presidency and with the Commission have resulted in satisfactory compromise proposals which meet some of the requests of the Member States and the Commission, but which do not limit Parliament’s right to hold to account EU and national institutions for the correct implementation of EU legislation, and to identify possible instances of maladministration. Certain wording could be better clarified, but it is vital not to compromise on one point: the committees of inquiry must have access to documents and persons. This has nothing to do with judicial duties but, precisely, it concerns the full implementation of the political right clearly enshrined in the Treaties: the right of political control.

 Mr President, now the figures more than the theories clearly demonstrate that not only has the austerity strategy failed to produce growth and employment, but that it does not even provide stability within the European Union, which was Ms Merkel’s main goal, given that public accounts are getting worse, not better. We therefore need a change, and although the actions on which a consensus seems to be emerging are certainly positive, they are still insufficient. The project bonds pilot project is an important precedent, but its macro-economic impact is just a drop in the ocean. Even strengthening the European Investment Bank, which has greater potential, is not decisive, whilst better spending of Structural Funds is unlikely to have much of an effect since we currently lack even the resources to pay for projects already begun. Two essential elements for emerging from the crisis are missing. The first is a reformulation of the Stability Pact, which would also affect the fiscal compact without it needing to be amended, to separate a portion of investments from calculation of the structural deficit, giving the Commission a specific role in establishing them and activating this separation in recessive phases of the cycle. The second is joint management of a portion of the public debt based on the model of the proposed debt redemption fund. These two elements must go hand in hand and form a ‘growth and stability pack’ which must be EU-wide in order to be effective: so a ‘pack’ and not a ‘compact’. For this we need to make the most of the ‘two-pack’ discussion in order to act quickly and effectively on EU legislation. I believe that the Commission should play a clearly defined role in this process and stop defending an austerity policy now acknowledged by everyone as disastrous. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I join in thanking the Commission and the Presidency of the Council, but this debate is especially timely and important because we are facing two unacceptable violations of the letter and the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon. The violation of the letter – as many speakers have pointed out – is the European Union’s boycott on acceding to the European Convention on Human Rights, which is clearly set out in the Treaty of Lisbon and is a essential complement to the adoption of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The violation of the Treaty’s spirit, meanwhile, relates to the project currently under discussion in Brighton to amend the Convention, reducing citizens’ opportunities to appeal to an unacceptable extent. These are truly paradoxical proposals, not only because Protocol 14 has already significantly reformed the Court’s procedures, but also because, in more general terms, solving the problem of too many pending cases by reducing opportunities to appeal is like combating an epidemic by closing hospitals. The problem is not too many appeals, it is too many violations of rights in Europe and that is what governments should be worrying about. Parliament is therefore very concerned and highly vigilant. We think a reaction that prevents the kind of reforms under discussion in Brighton is of the utmost importance. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have to say that I was disappointed with Mr Barroso’s speech. As many have said – the last of whom was Mr Domenici – a fact evident to all, with the clear exception of the European institutions, has not been acknowledged. That is that we are falling from a recession into the risk of a depression, and in these circumstances, compliance with the objectives of the ‘six-pack’ and the fiscal compact is quite simply impossible. There is only one solution for tackling this recessionary and depressive downward spiral and that is to revitalise demand through investment. The solutions and answers that Mr Barroso proposed cannot work by themselves. Investment is needed, and as it is not realistic to make a substantial increase in the European budget at the moment – although we have been asking for it – public investment is needed, and therefore a reform of the ‘six-pack’ that introduces the golden rule on a group of public investments, which need to be separated from the calculation of the structural deficit. This is what Europe needs today. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the satisfaction of having escaped danger is understandable, but it should not make us forget the mistakes and the delays of recent years, not to mention the decisive role played by the European Central Bank (ECB) and by the new Italian Government. Most importantly, our satisfaction should not stop us facing up to the enormous structural problem that the policies of recent months have not resolved. The strategy of salary deflation brought in by austerity policies as an alternative to devaluation is not economically or socially sustainable, nor is it universally accepted in political terms. We should leave the caricatures behind. Nobody here is proposing deficit spending. We do think, however, that it is possible to combine national fiscal responsibility with a revitalisation of investment and demand; it is possible with a more even distribution of wealth; it is possible if we confront macro-economic imbalances; it is possible through large-scale EU investment; it is possible if we set up shared management of debts through a debt redemption fund. The Community method offers the instruments for realising these objectives, but we need a change in political direction which, between the elections in France and the European elections of 2014, will start a new cycle and see the consolidation of a different strategy and of truly European economic governance. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, by taking part in a critical but constructive capacity in the negotiations for the fiscal compact, this Parliament has reached an important point of unity. Greater budgetary responsibility at national level is necessary but insufficient, and without concrete steps towards growth and solidarity, it could lead to an unsustainable downward spiral towards recession. There is no evidence of Parliament’s approach, which is well thought-out and balanced, in the preparatory documents of the European Council. For the Council and the Commission, the word ‘growth’ seems to mean fiscal consolidation and salary reductions. It is true that there are positive developments taking place on the internal market, but they are not enough. Growth requires a robust internal driver, which involves a two-pronged objective: to reinforce internal demand in countries with a surplus and to promote an extraordinary investment plan financed by project bonds. However, the Commission only interprets the macro-economic imbalances in one direction – ignoring the logic of the Ferreira rule – and there is no trace of project bonds and shared investments in the European Council documents, except for a vacuous game in which the card picked is to use the existing resources of the Structural Funds, a bit like the way Mussolini used to move his tanks around in the Second World War to make it seem as if he had a bigger army than he actually had. It is therefore clear that this ruling class has had its day, and only a major political sea change can save Europe from disaster. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, commenting on the rather forgettable conclusions of the summit on 9 December, we said that this Parliament would watch and work to limit the damage of that unfortunate choice. This has been the case. Parliament’s united commitment in the difficult negotiations that have taken place has definitely helped to prevent even worse developments. There was a real risk that the new treaty would seriously undermine the law and the common European institutions, by establishing standards, mechanisms and procedures external to the Union and in contradiction with its laws. That is no longer the case. Parliament, the Commission and the President of the European Council have averted this danger. Now the treaty will have to be implemented through EU legislation. The parameters for defining deficit and debt levels have been substantially, although not completely, brought back into the context of the current regulatory framework, and the dreadful possibility of having a new parliamentary institution has been averted. But even though we have significantly limited the damage, the fiscal compact is not an adequate response to the crisis. There are still unacceptable and unwise aspects, such as the limitations on the presence of Parliament at Euro summits. From a legal perspective, the Court’s power to impose sanctions seems highly dubious. Only if the proposals that Parliament put forward with one voice in its resolution – financial transactions tax, project bonds, stability bonds – are finally adopted, can Europe overcome a crisis that unidirectional fiscal discipline threatens to aggravate.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Brok reminded us, this Parliament has adopted a critical approach to the new international agreement, which is reflected in the resolution we are about to approve. We have given the reasons for our criticism on several occasions. At an institutional level we believe that the tools provided by the treaties would have made it possible to avoid the damage of an intergovernmental agreement and to strengthen governance and budgetary discipline in the euro area whilst remaining within the legal framework of the EU. It is a paradox that even before the ink on the ‘six-pack’ has dried, some Member States already want to amend it by intergovernmental means, introducing some elements that they had not asked for before, indeed in some cases that they had actually opposed. This is a step backwards and not forwards along the road to fiscal union. On a political level we believe the economic slant of this agreement is dangerously unilateral, because without concrete measures to strengthen growth and solidarity the EU will not emerge from the crisis and the very objective of stability will not be achieved. We nevertheless felt that we had a duty to become active and constructively involved in limiting the damage to the edifice of the EU, defending the primacy of the Community method and Parliament’s prerogatives, and emphasising the necessity and urgency of shared management of sovereign debt. It is extremely significant from a political point of view that the four pro-European groups have defined a shared platform of amendments along these lines. Now we are waiting for the fourth draft of the agreement. It is clear that if not even the smallest points, on which there was agreement, are faithfully carried over into the text, Parliament will have recourse to all the tools at its disposal in order to oppose the agreement. However it is also clear that only a significant correction in approach, on an institutional and economic level, will be able to eliminate the reasons for our criticism and our determination to build a real European economic government based on the Community method and focusing on stability, growth and solidarity. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, the European Union is a Community based on law, and therefore form cannot be separated from substance: form is substance! That means that using an intergovernmental treaty as the basis for a fiscal compact is legally and technically quite a complex operation, or indeed an impossible one in practice. The comparison with Schengen and Prüm is not valid, because those areas were not governed by the Treaties. The fact is that we have reached this point because the premise was wrong; in other words, the Treaties could and should have been overhauled. We now have to find a way out, avoid the risk of renationalising Union competences, preserve the EU’s legal system, avoid duplications and, of course, correct an economic policy that is both wrong and inadequate. This House will watch carefully, ready to play its part in sorting out this incredible mess, by putting the process started at the European Council back on the rails of EU law, which are the only possible foundations on which a true fiscal union can be built.

Mr President, since Ms Koppa has already stated why the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament supports the Lisek report, I would like to focus on the Council’s conclusions, which, to my mind, represent a small but nonetheless significant step forwards. Of course, Parliament expected more, above all, in terms of planning and conduct capability, but the serious risk of a widespread abandonment of the common security and defence policy (CSDP) has been avoided, and for this I would like to thank the High Representative for her work on this front. To return to the subject of new operations, after the uninspiring outcomes of the European Union Force (EUFOR) in Libya, the Horn of Africa, Sudan and the Sahel, we expect to see real results and we are ready to offer our political and financial support. Whilst we already have pooling and sharing projects to be implemented, in terms of planning and conduct capability, the search for unanimity has presented limits, but the will to consider activating an operations centre as only a first step also emerges from the Council’s conclusions. It is important now that we do not lose momentum and instead take further steps forward, because otherwise no Member State will be able to avoid a future of global irrelevance. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation is coming to a head, and it is time to act with the speed and effectiveness that has so far been lacking. Relying on the miraculous effect of a Treaty reform announcement would be pointless and counterproductive. Embarking on the risky road towards an intergovernmental treaty would have a quite devastating effect on the markets. Reforming the Treaties takes too long; an intergovernmental agreement will not result in any kind of fiscal union. The truth is that the problem facing the EU today is a political problem, not an institutional one. It is possible, under the current Treaty, to strengthen economic convergence, enhance fiscal discipline, maintain stability in the euro area and boost growth. The two new proposals for regulations tabled by the Commission demonstrate this, and with that legal basis, Article 136, it is possible to go even further, including with regard to the role of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The flexibility clause would make it possible to increase the powers of the euro area, and Article 122(2) is an appropriate basis for that extraordinary Eurobond-based debt redemption fund proposed by the German Council of Economic Experts. In short, one has the feeling that Treaty reform is being sought so as to avoid codecision, so as to have less rather than more Europe. Hence there are no excuses: immediate action must be taken and the foundations laid for the full creation, with the citizens’ consent, of a fiscal union based on stability, growth, solidarity and democracy, one that ultimately serves as the basis for that reform of the Treaties, which is too important a goal to be compromised by a clumsy, ill-timed reform that would be legally unnecessary, economically insignificant and politically harmful today. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this excellent report can make a very important contribution to the debate under way on economic governance and on the possible reform of the Treaties, because it highlights very successfully the extremely close and obvious connection between the effectiveness of economic governance and the degree of its democratic legitimacy, thereby also emphasising, I wish to say, the absurdity of the idea of a limited Treaty reform. Because, although the objectives that such a limited reform seemingly sets could easily be achieved, as we have already argued, not with a reform but by applying the Treaty, if instead we turn the guidelines and recommendations made on the basis of Articles 121(2) and 148(4) into decisions with legal standing, we are stepping beyond the confines of a limited reform and moving towards a full-blown federal-style fiscal union that cannot be created without full democratic legitimacy and hence without a full codecision role for the European Parliament. In short, this reform, if limited, is useless; if it grants new and unconditional powers in relation to economic policy then it certainly cannot be limited. Therefore, a completely different approach must be adopted; Parliament must be involved straight away in defining the guidelines and recommendations, as the report proposes. This is a prerequisite for subsequently making those guidelines binding in nature. Adopting a completely different approach, following the Community method and striving for greater democratic legitimacy: that is the line that the Berès report convincingly proposes to us.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all allow me to offer my sincerest congratulations to Mario Monti for his good work; his nomination to guide the Italian Government is fantastic news not only for Italy but also for Europe. I believe that from this debate strong messages from all political groups will emerge with clarity, and I hope these will be listened to attentively. The first message is that without instruments for growth and development, and with only an austere approach to fiscal matters, the idea of a stable Union is a chimera. The second is that the government of peers, this peer pressure of which President Van Rompuy has also spoken, cannot function. We need provisions that have a legal basis, and we need institutions legitimated democratically. This is the only way to produce a true European economic government. In all this, to think that reforming three paragraphs of Articles 121 and 126 as decided in Berlin should be a panacea is an illusion not only because of the difficulties and risks of the revision itself but also because, of these three amendments, the first is useless, the second is irrelevant and the third is impossible. Thus, our position is clear. Firstly, before changing the Treaty of Lisbon, apply it and read it, and you will discover that Articles 136 and 352 are founded on strong legal grounds for strong governance of the euro area based on communitarian methods. Secondly, it is obvious that this Parliament is not opposed in principle to strengthening the EU’s jurisdiction by reforming the Treaty, but this mandate can be limited and should be well-balanced, and this Parliament will not accept a reform which, alongside stability, does not create a Union of solidarity, growth and democracy.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, cooperation between the European Union and the United States is certainly going to play an increasingly important role in transatlantic relations. Dialogue with the European Parliament has a crucial and growing part to play in this cooperation, which is something our friends across the Atlantic have grasped perfectly well and often better than many national governments and parliaments. This dialogue is first and foremost legislative in nature, but there is also political and strategic dialogue on major economic and foreign policy issues, areas in which this House intends to strengthen its actions and make the most of its prerogatives. One of the issues that I would like to highlight is a matter of great importance which has been positively taken up in the joint resolution. I am referring to the Middle East question. We are committed to supporting the efforts by the High Representative and the Quartet to resume the negotiations between the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli Government, because we all know that if the parties do not negotiate there will be no peace and no two-state solution. At the same time, however, we believe that recognising the Palestinians’ aspirations to be represented in the United Nations as a state does not negate the need for the talks but instead may strengthen them. We therefore call on the Member States and the United States to come up with pragmatic measures to achieve this recognition. In the context of the budget procedure, we are committed to increasing EU economic support for the Palestinian Authority and believe that the Unesco boycott is a misguided and counterproductive reaction.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Gahler has just explained, cluster munitions are terrible, fiendish instruments of death for the civilian population. Banning them is therefore a battle for civilisation to which this House has been committed for some time. The entry into force of the Oslo Convention was a major success, but now, little more than a year later, we are faced with a dangerous attempt to undermine its outcomes through an additional protocol to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons – the review of which is currently being negotiated in Geneva – which would again allow the use of cluster munitions. This is a protocol that must not and cannot be signed by countries that have already signed up to the Oslo Convention, because, as you said yourself, Commissioner, it is clearly incompatible with the Convention and would open up a dangerous loophole, not least for those other countries that want to continue to produce, stockpile and use these types of munitions. Moreover, it would create a very serious precedent and would be a blow to international law. The argument by those who say that the protocol would in any case improve the situation, because it would be signed by countries that have not signed the Oslo Convention, sounds decidedly specious to us, and on this point we would perhaps have liked to hear a rather clearer and less equivocal statement from Ms Ashton’s representative. Protocol VI would undermine the Convention because it would allow for the use of munitions produced after 1980, which form the great majority of them; it foresees a long transition period; it would allow for the use of types of cluster bomb that are extremely dangerous to civilians; and it would not set out any clear obligation to destroy individual countries’ stockpiles. It is therefore crucial that all the Member States do not support the entry into force of this protocol and that the High Representative commits herself to ensuring that all the countries in the Union adopt a clear, united position in favour of a definitive ban on cluster munitions. The joint resolution that we are about to adopt on this issue is an important political signal, and we are certain that it will be adopted in its entirety by a large majority.

 One of the causes of the current economic and financial crisis is the lack of adequate regulation of financial markets. Through the adoption of the report by Mr Canfin and the first-reading agreement between Parliament and the Council, the EU has taken an important step forwards by bringing in new rules on credit default swaps and short selling. Thanks to the work of Parliament, the slightly timid approach taken by the Council has been corrected in a number of fundamental ways. Indeed, we have brought in a ban on naked short selling – that is, selling securities that you do not actually own – which includes a ban on buying credit default swaps unless you also own the relevant government bonds. Moreover, the information and transparency obligations imposed on operators will allow national supervisory authorities to keep up to date with any pressure on a security, thereby effectively preventing risk. Parliament can therefore only express its satisfaction about the adoption of this regulation: it may be just an initial step and a simple part of a more general project to regulate the financial markets, but this regulation represents significant progress and a robust contribution to better-functioning financial markets, particularly in terms of sovereign debts.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the most recurrent words in these conclusions are ‘urge’ and ‘commitment’, including Mr Berlusconi’s commitment to tackle the North-South divide in four months. It is clear, then, that exhortations and commitments do not add up to any sort of common economic policy; nor do institutions that do not exist, such as Eurosummit, for example. The proposed regulations based on Article 136, announced by Mr Barroso, show that the institutions that do actually exist can, instead of exhortations, make laws. We say: ‘make them; make these laws now’. We would add, furthermore, that we shall not allow any treaty reforms unless all the possibilities of the existing treaty have been exhausted. We shall not accept a limited mandate that has not been devised in part by Parliament and does not include codecision on economic policy and shared responsibility for Eurobonds, because without democracy, growth and solidarity, a stable European Union remains merely a chimera.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Heading 4 is structurally underfunded with respect to the EU’s commitments and strategic interests. This has forced us to make painful choices to protect our priorities and particularly resources for Palestine, which are clearly necessary, especially in the light of the decisions taken by the United States Congress. That is what is behind the cuts to the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) budget, which are not generic, linear cuts but policy-based cuts on specific issues, which do not therefore affect other operations. First of all, Afghanistan: this is a painful cut, but at the same time we must be aware that, despite the good results of our mission, the EU is a bit-part player on this issue, subordinate to the strategies of others which, moreover, are not seeing great success. In terms of emergency measures, the issue of special representatives is coming to the fore, so this is a logical cut to make. In terms of preparatory measures, the Council rejects Article 51(5)(c) of the Financial Regulation, which gives Parliament a limited role in these measures, in line with the Madrid agreement. Hence, this cut is inevitable. It is not Parliament that has chosen this path of austerity: the Council can hardly be taken aback by its consequences. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, even though it is too early for a conclusive assessment, it is difficult to escape the impression that this Semester is producing weak coordination and inadequate democratic legitimacy. The two things are linked because without full democratic legitimacy, the Semester runs the risk of being more a bureaucratic exercise than a coordination of substance. This limitation certainly relates to the crucial issue of the Union’s competences and Parliament’s prerogatives, which should lie at the very heart of any Treaty reform, which would otherwise be pointless or harmful. This limitation also highlights a problem of effective political will to make immediate use of all the instruments offered by the Treaty in order to strengthen coordination and give Parliament a greater role. Then there is a problem of content. A reading of the Council’s recommendations shows an obvious limitation in the line of economic politics that inspired them: deficit reduction and development of the internal market are necessary but not sufficient conditions for tackling the crisis, and unless there is a major investment plan, they are liable to trigger a vicious circle that may bring us to collapse. The political line of the Semester therefore needs to be the subject of a genuine political debate, which can only take place in the context of the discussions between Parliament and the Council. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, President Barroso said some important things today, but several points need to be clarified. I would like to highlight three of them. First, euro area fiscal union. At last, someone has noticed the existence of Article 136; however, the President of the Commission spoke of a Commission-Council procedure. In fact, Article 136 also contemplates the possibility of regulations. It is therefore possible that, under Article 136, 17 Member States will vote in the Council and 27 in Parliament. We would like to know whether – as Parliament has requested – the Commission intends to propose regulations with the ordinary legislative procedure pursuant to Article 136 for the conditionality of the stability mechanism. Secondly, the stability mechanisms themselves. The 21 July agreement is fine, the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) is fine, but the truth is that the quota method does not work. You must tell us if you think that the EFSM, which still exists, can continue to operate, especially after the ruling from the German Court, and if therefore it is possible to think in terms of the communitisation of the stability mechanism. Thirdly, the Secretary General of the German Christian Democratic Union (CDU) today said that he would like to move on from monetary union to stability union. Without growth, development and employment, there can be no stability. You should tell us if the Commission agrees with this. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 In voting against the Wortmann-Kool report, and in fact against the entire ‘governance package’, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is not saying ‘no’ to more robust and stringent European rules on the fiscal policies of the Member States, but is expressing its opposition to a specific line of economic policy: a line focused solely on budgetary discipline, and therefore an inadequate response to the current serious economic and financial crisis. As a condition of its support for the package, the S&amp;D Group had requested the introduction of a golden rule to ‘save’ productive investment from swingeing cuts. The alliance between the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Euro-sceptic conservatives of the European Conservatives and Reformists Group, backed by the Council, has made it inevitable that we would vote against by rejecting this potential compromise, which opposes a line that is destined to exacerbate the sovereign debt crisis and to hit both social cohesion and growth prospects in Europe hard.

Despite the measures taken by the individual Member States, the number of victims of road-traffic accidents in Europe is still too high. By approving the report by Mr Koch – which contains more than 100 suggestions on how to ensure effective road safety – Parliament is adopting a resolution in response to the Commission communication of 2010, which appeals to this House to put forward an even more ambitious action programme. We shall need to improve the deployment of road signs, as well as infrastructure and vehicle safety and information exchange. Above all, however, we shall need to move towards harmonising legislation on the subject, for example, by reducing the speed limit in residential areas to 30 km/h and banning new drivers and those driving with passengers from drinking alcohol. This is the only way that it will be possible to halve the number of victims and reduce the number of injuries by 2020. We therefore expect the Commission to produce a new plan that follows Parliament’s suggestions by the end of the year. Road safety must be a priority for Europe. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

Mr President, would you not agree that the treaties already allow for closer integration in the euro area and that therefore it is not necessary, and indeed would be counter-productive, to achieve it outside the EU institutions, as the current governments of France and Germany seem to be aiming for? In particular, would you not agree that Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union makes it possible to adopt legislative measures for the euro area within the scope of the economic policy competences given to the EU by the treaties? Secondly, would you not agree that Article 352 makes it possible to strengthen the powers of the existing institutions in order to reach the objectives set out by the treaties? Lastly, is it not the case that Protocol No 14 does not forbid the Eurogroup Heads of State or Government from meeting without having to create another institution, and therefore that it would be unreasonable for the President of another institution – the European Council – to preside over this expanded Eurogroup? Therefore, would you not agree that achieving euro area integration within or outside the treaties is a problem of political will and not of legal barriers? Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have reached a crucial moment in the decade-long aspiration of the Palestinian people to have a state of their own and also in the rightful aspiration of the people of Israel to live in safety. This is because the latter is so intimately connected with the former, because there can be no safety without peace and there can be no peace without a democratic Palestinian state that is respectful of international law, as outlined by Mr Abbas to the United Nations. The acceptance of the timeline drawn up by the Quartet is a victory for the European Union and one which we must salute you for, Baroness Ashton, even though some countries did try to steal the European Union’s limelight. However, the news of new settlements warns us that the path ahead will be strewn with difficulties. That is why it is important to increase the pressure on the Israeli Government and clearly express the EU’s support – despite the absence of absolute unanimity – for a possible vote in the UN General Assembly on awarding the status of non-Member State. This House must be united in upholding and increasing this pressure, including putting aside differences of opinion on full membership, giving its unanimous backing through its resolution on the legitimate aspiration of the Palestinian people to be represented as a state at the United Nations.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, after 42 years of dictatorship and six months of conflict Libya is at a turning-point in its history that could open the way to a future of democracy, peace and development. This future is in the hands of the Libyans and no one can expect to impose choices and ready-made solutions on them, but at the same time it is clear that the European Union has a great responsibility, a decisive role to play in supporting the process of stabilisation and transition to democracy in the country. After being marginalised by the divisions among its members in the early stages of the conflict, a conflict the wise management of which can be attributed to NATO, the EU has gradually begun to demonstrate the capacity for action that we all value and which has produced concrete results, with the opening of the office in Benghazi, missions in Tripoli, which we would like to be more coordinated, external service action and ECHO (Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection). This activism must now find its place in the context of a strong and credible political strategy capable of defining a multilateral framework that is both robust and effective, and of ensuring a true unity of purpose within the international community, preventing overlapping and competition and guaranteeing real support for the Libyan transition. The transition will inevitably be long and complex, and will have to focus on national reconciliation while preventing the creation of new divisions within the country. At the same time it will have to ensure progress and democracy, and guarantee the involvement of civil society and the creation of new ruling classes. During this transition the return to normality and restoration of public order means difficult problems such as border control, rebuilding the judicial system and the security forces, and controlling the widespread distribution of weapons, must be addressed as a matter of urgency, while at the same time the transition has to be based on a robust and credible road map that is both democratic and representative. All this requires dialogue, commitment, leadership skills, as well as intensive planning and work to identify resources. It is therefore an important test for the EU, for the European External Action Service, and for its comprehensive approach, and the European Parliament is ready to play its part and to support this commitment.

 Parliament’s vote on the report by Mr Glante opens the way to the development of a European satellite navigation system. The establishment within the Galileo programme of a public regulated service (PRS) – an encrypted, maximum security network to be used by operators authorised by governments, such as the police or the armed forces – will provide an extremely useful service for European citizens by helping to ensure that security forces can respond to crises or emergencies without delay. Other than providing benefits for citizens, the Galileo programme also represents an opportunity for European industry in the new technologies markets by helping to create high-level jobs in the satellite navigation sector. Parliament now awaits the position of the Council, in order to make the PRS service available and operative from 2014 onwards. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 By adopting this own-initiative report, Parliament is proving its commitment to increasing female employment in such a highly significant sector for the economy as entrepreneurship. If it is true that women traditionally encounter greater obstacles than men in entering the labour market, then this is particularly the case in the business sector. It is therefore important to incentivise female entrepreneurship through targeted actions. This can be achieved, in particular, through easier access to credit – in which case the European Microfinance Instrument Progress can be of major help – or by subsidising exchange initiatives, similar to an Erasmus scheme for young female entrepreneurs, which could encourage women to embark on such a professional vocation. The European Union must therefore strive to promote the presence of women in small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe, removing the economic and obstacles that they encounter.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament believes that the construction of a true European political space is a prerequisite for progressing towards a political Europe that can rise to this century’s huge challenges in a strong, determined and appropriate way. The Treaty of Lisbon represents a significant step forward in this respect, especially when it comes to the principle already mentioned by the rapporteur, Mr Duff, which clarifies that the European Parliament directly represents European citizens at EU level. Nevertheless, despite this and other important innovations in the Treaty of Lisbon, and despite the fact that everyday life clearly shows us that a political Europe is necessary, the construction of a true European political space is still a long way off. Debate in our Member States is too focused on national issues, too many of the discussions among political parties are carried out from an exclusively national perspective, and the European elections themselves often appear to the citizens as an extension of national political debate, which is also one of the reasons for the overly low turnout. We believe that a reform of European electoral law that strengthens our common principles can contribute towards this Europeanisation of European political debate. Clearly, it is not the only requirement, but it can help. Therefore, despite being aware of the numerous problems associated with this proposal, the S&amp;D Group supported the proposal for a transnational list in committee. At the same time we supported the request for a referral back to committee, because we realise that broad consensus is needed on this proposal. However, we also believe that we must proceed with determination towards a reform of the European electoral system that strengthens the transnational nature of these elections.

 By adopting the Sommer report, Parliament is showing that it is mindful of the transparency of information about the nutritional value and the provenance of foodstuffs, in line with the requirements of European consumers for greater safety in the products they buy. By confirming the agreement at second reading with the Council, Parliament is introducing the obligation to provide detailed information about the composition and energy value of foodstuffs, as well as extending origin labelling to fresh swine, sheep, goat and poultry meat. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has played a dynamic role in the negotiations, convincing the Council and Commission to consider the subsequent adoption of rules on origin for meat used in packaged foods, as well as on the effects of using hydrogenated fats, which, from today, are subject to legislation. The adopted text signals recognition of the Italian approach, which has already previously shown how to protect and promote Italian and European excellence, and it is therefore a source of satisfaction both for Italy and for operators in the sector. However, although the step taken is important, our commitment to European citizens being able to make ever more independent and informed choices about the products they put on their tables will go on. Roberto Gualtieri,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution that we are preparing to vote on is important and timely because it sets out and unequivocally clarifies the principles that must guide the action of Parliament and its representatives in conducting these difficult negotiations with national parliaments. First and foremost, these principles derive from Treaties that, by getting rid of the pillar structure, on the one hand, and assigning Parliament the role of representing citizens directly at EU level, on the other, make the European Parliament a vital source of democratic legitimacy for the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) and the common security and defence policy (CSDP) as EU policies This double innovation results, as we know, in increased functions and responsibilities, from the vote to approve the High Representative, to the referral powers established by Article 36, to the budget powers that, we must remember, make the European Parliament the budgetary authority for the exceptionally large increase in CSDP missions which, as we are aware, are civil missions. However, the reasons that lead us to take, with determination and readiness for dialogue, the road towards genuine agreement with national parliaments are also political and pragmatic. Interparliamentary cooperation is appropriate and necessary to strengthen support for the CFSP and the CSDP and to increase consistency between them and the choices made by Member States at national level. It is precisely for this reason that this cooperation should represent, in a balanced way, the institutions that express Europe’s democratic legitimacy at a different level, and an imbalance that excessively compromises Parliament’s power would be incongruous with the mission to Europeanise the debate on foreign security and defence policy in Europe, which is at the root of the idea of holding a conference. That is why it is good for tomorrow’s vote to clarify that the readiness for debate is accompanied by the utmost commitment to certain principles, starting with the principle that, as Article 9 of the first protocol clearly states, no regular form of interparliamentary cooperation can be established without Parliament’s consent.

 The single European emergency number 112 is a service that aims to ensure rapid access, free of charge, to emergency services for everyone throughout Europe, thus markedly simplifying access to the service, especially for people who are abroad. Adoption of the Rapti report is Parliament’s response to Europeans’ scant knowledge and awareness of the potential of this service. This lack of information is certainly worrying. Among the aims of the European Parliament resolution is in fact to carry out an effective information and awareness-raising campaign in key locations such as doctors’ surgeries, pharmacies, schools, airports and stations, as well as to call for improvements in the quality, efficiency and accessibility of the single service, thus ensuring easy access even for people with disabilities and vulnerable individuals. By providing the Commission with clear guidelines on how to improve use of the universal service, we have taken a step forwards in protecting people who live and travel in the Union, with particular attention to social and geographical inclusion.

 The vote on the Langen report on over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives further reinforces Parliament’s priority of regulating the financial markets and fighting speculation, the main factor in market instability at a time of crisis. Parliament has defined its position at first reading on the proposal for a regulation in line with what has already been suggested both by the European Commission and by the G20 mandate, which calls for a strengthening of the system within which OTC derivatives work, in order to provide more transparency and greater risk management. It is necessary, in fact, to provide the relevant European and national authorities with all the tools they need to supervise and control the derivatives market, including more information on the nature of derivative transactions and on the contracts entered into by counterparties. We now expect the Council to get over the splits between Member States and offer the opening needed in this area, so that the wholesale reform of European financial markets can come to fruition.

 Urban areas, which are home to 73% of Europe’s population and generate around 80% of the GDP, are the Union’s major centres of innovation, culture and growth. However, the urban dimension has up until now received insufficient recognition. For this reason it is important that Parliament should propose to enhance the European Urban Agenda within the framework of EU policies, reinforcing the contribution of cohesion policy to urban development and encouraging greater involvement on the part of local political stakeholders. It is necessary to direct the urban dimension of political cohesion towards supporting the development of basic physical infrastructure, the modernisation of economic, social and environmental characteristics of cities, urban regeneration and the promotion of social innovation in disadvantaged neighbourhoods. All this requires direct participation on the part of local authorities and civil society, and the involvement of cities’ political representatives in strategic planning and in defining and negotiating partnership contracts. Within this framework the call for the Commission to promote the creation of urban administrators and to establish an Erasmus for local and regional elected representatives is of significance. Let us monitor closely the Commission’s commitment to welcoming the important proposals of this report, in the belief that a full appreciation of the central role of the urban dimension in EU politics constitutes an indispensable condition for its success.

 Europe needs stronger and more Community-based economic governance. However, the package of measures being voted on today wrongly reflects the tendency of the current centre-right majority to view governance as a mere austerity exercise, by strengthening the preventive and corrective dimension of the Stability and Growth Pact without outlining mechanisms and instruments for supporting investment and development. One cannot accept the reverse majority rule and tougher parameters and sanctions without a golden rule to protect Member States’ investments and without Eurobonds to fund European investments and, at the same time, to guarantee sovereign debt. This is not a good enough formula for tackling the crisis and it is destined to make it worse. That is why we will vote against this and the other reports on fiscal surveillance. Moreover, we will fight to take European economic policy in a different direction and, at the same time, to strengthen the Community method and the EU’s instruments and resources.

 The European Parliament has brought an end to the long legislative procedure on the Consumer Rights Directive by adopting the Schwab report, which is a satisfactory compromise with the Council and the Commission. Two important steps have thus been taken. On the one hand, we have adopted a single legislative instrument on consumer rights, which provides harmonisation and takes over from the four previous directives in this area. On the other hand, we have laid down detailed rules for buying and selling online, in order to promote cross-border trade and to guarantee transparency for both businesses and consumers. The new directive lays down aspects that are intended to give greater protection to the European consumer, such as the information to be contained in sale contracts, delivery times, the right of withdrawal, and the right to repair or replacement of a defective product, as well as the cases in which the risk is transferred from the vendor to the consumer. Although yet more detailed rules may be laid down in future, the text that has been adopted represents a positive compromise in the harmonisation of existing regulations, guaranteeing secure purchases and putting a definitive end to typical sharp practices that hide behind electronic purchasing.

 The tragic earthquake in Japan is an incentive for Europe to look more deeply at the consequences of nuclear technology use and its impact on the safety of European citizens. In adopting the report on the proposal for a directive on the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste, Parliament is showing that it is particularly sensitive to this issue and demonstrating a clear desire to find common, definitive solutions to the storage of nuclear waste in Europe. By calling for common minimum standards for all the Member States, we are encouraging their governments to invest in new technologies, with a view to obtaining rapid, concrete results in relation to the disposal of this extremely hazardous waste. I therefore welcome two amendments tabled by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament calling for Parliament and the Council to co-decide on matters relating to nuclear energy use and endorsing the fundamental ban on waste exports to third countries, a ban which demonstrates Parliament’s determination to shoulder its responsibilities. Parliament’s vote is therefore a further step towards the gradual abandonment of nuclear energy, in favour of sustainable energy solutions that are safe for the public. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 The Dess report adopted by this House is entirely consistent with the guidelines already set by the European Commission. It calls for the common agricultural policy for 2014-2020 to be reviewed in order to meet the challenges of environmental sustainability, job creation and guaranteed high-quality, safe food. In adopting this text, the European Parliament is demonstrating its opposition to regressive tendencies and proposing that the future CAP budget remain at least at the same level as the 2013 budget, thereby ensuring that farmers receive the support they need to invest in new technologies, a crucial step if this sector is to remain competitive. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has made a decisive contribution – partly as a result of the numerous amendments tabled both in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and in plenary – to achieving a convincing result, thereby sending a clear message to the European Commission ahead of the legislative proposals scheduled for October.

By approving Mr Klinz’s report appealing for effective regulation of rating agencies, Parliament is taking another step towards greater transparency in the financial markets. It is important to overcome the current problems that characterise the sector: the lack of competition, the regulatory over-dependence on ratings, and the low reliability of notes. In this vein, Parliament’s request for the Commission to consider creating an independent European agency that could also be responsible for sovereign debt ratings is significant. Since the irresponsible behaviour of credit rating agencies (CRAs) has often been the initial cause of speculation that primarily harms European taxpayers, it is hugely important to review their role in sovereign debt ratings as part of the ongoing reform process, which will be completed in the autumn.

 By voting for the Garriga Polledo report, the European Parliament has made its voice heard on the future of the European budget and put forward an ambitious proposal for the next Multiannual Financial Framework. The request to increase the post-2013 EU budget by 5%, and therefore to increase the total European Union GNI from 1.06% to 1.11%, corresponds to a desire to honour commitments made to support growth and development, first and foremost, the Europe 2020 strategy, for which adequate resources are needed. It is important, in fact, to remember the added value of the European budget, which can act as a driver for economic growth, research and development and employment, particularly for young people, alongside national budgets. The report also reinforces Parliament’s position in favour of new financial instruments, such as the tax on financial transactions and Eurobonds, which are an opportunity for the European economy. It is now down to the Commission to take up Parliament’s ambition, presenting its proposals for the next European financial framework and not falling victim to the restrictive budget policies of Member States.

 Parliament’s approval of the directive on the charging of heavy goods vehicles is a step forward in the protection of European citizens’ health, and a commitment to lessen the harmful effects of pollution caused by such vehicles. The ‘polluter pays’ principle has been introduced for the first time in this sector in order to encourage safer and more sustainable transport, and hence to promote alternatives such as rail transport. Under the compromise reached, however, due consideration must also be given to the protection of the haulage industry, which must not be penalised excessively. Member States must therefore strive to make more effective use of the revenues collected under the Eurovignette, for example, by investing in infrastructure improvements and encouraging the use of less polluting haulage vehicles, so as to ensure that the benefits of the directive are enjoyed by all the sectors involved.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the common security and defence policy (CSDP) is going through an extremely difficult time. Just when developments in the international system require the European Union to become a credible actor in security and defence; just when the European approach to crisis management through supporting democracy rather than exporting it appears to be more suited to the challenges of our times; just when the economic crisis makes the option of developing a common defence inevitable; just when the Treaty of Lisbon provides new instruments to develop the CSDP within the framework of an integrated approach; in short, just when a quality leap in the CSDP has become necessary and possible, the European edifice seems to be creaking dangerously and there is a real risk that the ambitions and possibilities of the CSDP will have to be drastically downsized. The report I am presenting seeks to tackle this contradiction and suggests possible answers for the other institutions. With regard to the Libyan crisis, we do not confine ourselves to expressing our disappointment either at the European Union’s inability to define its position and take joint action or at the restrictions placed on the EUFOR Libya mandate. We believe the time has come for a European political initiative, in conjunction with our other partners, to bring about a ceasefire and to hold negotiations that will put an end to the Gaddafi regime and begin a transition to an inclusive democracy. NATO’s military intervention is clearly unlikely to solve anything and it will do well to adhere scrupulously to the mandate of the UN resolution, avoiding any disproportionate use of force. At the same time, we hope that CSDP assets will be used effectively to provide humanitarian assistance to the civilian population under attack and that future operations will be planned in such a way as to support the development of democracy in Libya. The Libyan situation also calls for reflection on a wider scale, and I believe it reinforces the report’s suggestions. Responsibility for the future of Europe and for security and defence, of course, lies primarily with the European Council, its members and also its President, who represents the Union in matters of foreign and security policy at that level. We say to them clearly that bilateral cooperation and coalitions of the willing cannot replace the CSDP as the Union’s policy. We do not find the idea of renationalising this policy convincing, not because we are Treaty purists, but because, if it were renationalised, this policy would not be equal to the challenges that lie ahead. We propose that Parliament should enter into a strategic dialogue with the European Council, which we call on to discuss Parliament’s recommendations, to draw up a proper foreign policy strategy and to devote an extraordinary meeting to European security and defence. We call on you, Baroness Ashton, to intensify your efforts to build a consensus among the Member States and to make use of your multiple functions to improve consistency between the CSDP, the common foreign and security policy and the other facets of the Union’s external action. The European External Action Service is an instrument with enormous potential for this work. The report puts forward several proposals for the role it should play, starting with that of being a crisis management board able to provide a genuinely integrated response to crises, and we are delighted to see that it is taking shape. The Libyan situation also confirms the inadequacy of Europe’s military capability, which is well below the overall high level of national defence budgets. It is quite obvious that strength only lies in unity. This involves pooling, sharing, strengthening of the European Defence Agency, permanent structured cooperation, development of an efficient and competitive European defence market, strengthening of the industrial and technological base, and enhancement of joint command and control capabilities. The inadequacy of these capabilities has been a factor preventing Europe from responding promptly to the Libyan crisis, starting with setting up a permanent operations general headquarters. The report formulates a large number of concrete proposals on this and other issues, such as the integration of external and internal security policies in a way that respects the primacy of the Community method. It is noteworthy that in this respect, the main pro-European political groups are united, and I thank the shadow rapporteurs and coordinators for this fruitful collaboration. Parliament is ready to support the development of a CSDP that is fully integrated with the Union’s external action and is rooted in the values and principles of Europe. Baroness Ashton, we hope you can respond convincingly to us both in words and, above all, in deeds. Roberto Gualtieri,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe Mr Albertini was right because as rapporteur, he had four minutes for his speech and two for his reply. I therefore take the liberty of pointing out that he should have his four minutes. For my part, I think this has been a useful and important debate, which shows how united Parliament is and how ready it is to offer its support for consistent and effective external action by Europe. We have not only heard recriminations for the obvious limitations shown by Europe in recent events, but we have also heard proposals offering a kind of strategic partnership between Parliament and the other institutions in order to make Europe a credible actor in security and defence matters. I believe this partnership would be not only an opportunity but a necessity as well because, if what we have been saying is true, which is that Europe’s integrated approach is its main potential, achieving that integrated approach will require the support of a body endowed with clear legislative and budgetary powers. For that reason as well, I think we should find a balanced solution to the matter of interparliamentary cooperation. It has become clear from the discussion how we must act. We must first of all assess the possibilities offered by the Treaty: by permanent structured cooperation and by Article 44, which makes it possible to delegate the task of carrying out a mission to particular Member States, but within an EU procedural framework, which is not the same thing as renationalisation. We need to make use of existing structures – starting with the European External Action Service – and set ourselves ambitious tasks in the field of capabilities. Of course, we also need to know how to offer leadership ability. We would like to thank Baroness Ashton for her commitment and for the important statements she has made. It is an attractive thought, as she said, that a small group can do great things, but Europe is a great civilised power which cannot shirk its responsibilities. Roberto Gualtieri,  
rapporteur.

 By approving the Hökmark report, Parliament is opting for innovation: the broadband and mobile telephony sector is not only of great interest to Europeans, but it makes it possible to develop new prospects in terms of research and development, areas in which the European Union can and must aspire to play a leading role. In this respect, it is important to ensure that the first European radio spectrum policy programme is in line with the objectives already outlined in the EU 2020 strategy and the Digital Agenda and comes within the priority actions of the Single Market Act. The EU must endeavour to overcome the digital divide that results in huge disparities within Europe – between urban and rural areas in particular – so as to ensure all citizens have equal access to services, especially those involving new technologies. I therefore welcome the ambitious targets proposed, to provide broadband access throughout Europe by 2020, with particular emphasis on wireless networks. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 The approval of a common transparency register, following a broad majority vote in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, is another step towards greater transparency in parliamentary activity. A common register between the European Parliament and the Commission that is public and accessible online will make it easier for citizens to check the various stakeholders with whom MEPs interact. However, the agreement still needs to be improved as registration by actors is still on a voluntary basis, although a pre-requisite for obtaining access to the institutions. The next objective will therefore be to make registration mandatory for all lobbyists. We also expect that, like the other European institutions, the Council will adhere to the indications of Parliament and the Commission and participate in the register. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

The specification of a European forest protection strategy is part of the EU’s overall commitment to the fight against climate change. Particularly positive points in the report that has been approved are the proposal for a specific regulation on the prohibiting of building on land cleared by fires proven to have resulted from arson, and the request for suitable funding for forestry strategies, which is currently at a very low level. Finally, the request for appropriate sustainability criteria for biomass produced for the use of energy is also important. We therefore urge the European Commission to continue along this route, by presenting a White Paper on forest protection to deal with these issues. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

I voted against the joint resolution because of the rejection by the House of two key amendments presented by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament on the development of medium- to long-term strategies for the progressive phasing-out of nuclear power and the definition of binding renewable energy targets. The vote against the entire resolution by the House highlights the fact that the nuclear issue is no longer just one of greater safety. It is now vital that we begin to think seriously about the energy issue and about investment in renewable energies. Japan’s tragic experience has shown us just how necessary it is to discuss nuclear power in depth. In this sense, the European Parliament’s vote is the first step towards a change of direction in energy policy choices on both a European and an international scale. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that the establishment of a permanent stability mechanism is an important achievement that provides the foundations for the political commitment to defend the euro at all costs. Therefore, despite not inconsiderable reservations about the methods and intergovernmental nature of the fund, Parliament supported this watershed moment and has focused on ensuring a solid link between the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and the EU Institutions. In this vein, the reference in the European Council’s conclusions to a regulation establishing the procedures to define the conditional requirements is important and we now expect the Commission to come up with a suitable proposal. Even though this is a positive result, it is difficult to consider it adequate. The problem is the basic direction of European economic governance. We persist in treating the symptoms of the illness instead of its causes. Deficits are the effect and not the cause of the crisis. Thinking that we can cure the illness by limiting ourselves to cutting deficits with one hand and refinancing banks with the other is sheer make-believe: it risks deepening the crisis and making the very task of the permanent stability mechanism unsustainable. If we want to treat the illness and not merely the symptoms, then we need to tackle a number of basic problems. We talk about strengthening European competitiveness. Rightly so, but which model of competitiveness are we pursuing? We cannot bring in a model for recovery driven solely by exports to third countries, because this will accentuate imbalances. In order to be more competitive in external trade, we also need to stimulate high-quality internal demand. We must therefore deal with the issue of the banks and the system for providing credit to the economy in order to direct European savings toward long-term investments. We need to equip ourselves with instruments such as Eurobonds, the tax on financial transactions and a budget worthy of the name, in order to make large-scale public investment at a European level that can provide a kick-start for private investment. Finally, we need to think of the European social model as a resource instead of a burden. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

A European regulatory framework in the fight against violence against women represents one crucial step forward within a comprehensive strategy. Only a combination of legal, social, economic and preventive actions will manage to resolve this problem which is rather close to home, given that over a quarter of women in the European Union have experienced violence during their lifetime. Violence against women makes no distinction by age or ethnic or cultural background, and it remains an invisible problem that has nonetheless very high human, social and economic costs. The European Union must affirm its active role in fighting discrimination against women and that is why the Svensson report supports the European Commission in its attempts to create a clear and homogenous regulatory framework in the context of the Stockholm Programme. I am therefore in favour of the request for an instrument of criminal law which would define violence against women as a crime in itself, through the development of a directive against gender-based violence, to be brought in line with the multiple training, prevention and awareness-raising initiatives in order to fight all forms of abuse against women.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the report that we are about to vote for, we still have reservations over the decision to adopt a revision of the Treaty on the intergovernmental character of the mechanism, but at the same time we are in favour, because – as Mr Brok explained – the negotiations that we conducted allowed us to achieve important objectives that relate mainly to the fact that the conditionalities associated with the assistance will be determined by a regulation, hence by a codecision procedure. It is therefore fair to vote in favour and I would like to thank the many fellow MEPs who have contributed to this result and mention the privilege of working with Mr Brok, Mr Pirillo’s extremely useful advice and also the work of the two rapporteurs from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON): Mr Scicluna and Mr Gauzès, Mr Schade, Mrs Häfner and the group coordinators and of course the chairmen of the groups that have given us such significant political support, thank you.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it would not be an exaggeration to say that this is an historic time in the process of Europe-building. The economic crisis has made it clear that the single currency needs real European economic governance and, for the first time, significant and innovative steps are being taken in this direction. At the same time, we are seeing a dangerous trend of giving this new governance an intergovernmental flavour, which not only risks threatening the institutional structure of the European Union, but also making the new mechanisms ineffective. Hence, the permanent stability mechanism is an issue of symbolic and central importance. Indeed, on the one hand, the establishment of a permanent stability mechanism represents a decisive and important step forwards. Parliament supports this decision, although it is important to stress that it must not rule out the possibility of using extraordinary solidarity mechanisms, such as those based on Article 122, which are currently in use. On the other hand, if the establishment of a permanent mechanism is therefore positive, the European Council has chosen to create a purely intergovernmental mechanism, thereby denying in a unique manner the European institutions any role, including in the procedure leading up to its establishment. Amongst other things, this could stir up disputes during the ratification process about the appropriateness of a simplified procedure, given that it is hardly in doubt that cutting back the competences of the European Union would require an ordinary revision procedure. Furthermore, since the treaty states two clear things; that the monetary policy of the Member States whose currency is the euro is an exclusive competence of the European Union, and that the Member States must coordinate their economic policy within the framework of the Union, as the treaty states, a mechanism that operates completely outside the European Union’s institutional structure would scarcely be compatible with these principles and would therefore result in a reduction of the European Union’s powers, which would not be compatible with a simplified revision procedure. This problem could also be raised by a number of national parliaments during the ratification procedure which, as we know, will be a complicated and risky process. Likewise for this reason, Parliament would have preferred a different, more institutionally appropriate and less politically risky procedure, such as Article 352, either alone or in combination with Article 136. The report sets all this out in black and white, but we preferred to concentrate on the substance rather than on procedures so as to reach a realistic yet determined approach. The central point is that the permanent stability fund will be created by the Member States because that is what they decided, but it may also lay the foundations for a new structure lying outside the EU institutions or it might be an intergovernmental wagon within a European Union train, travelling down the tracks of European law. Parliament wants to make a contribution because we are following the latter of these two paths. Hence, we asked in our report for two conditions to be respected: the proposal for an amendment must be redrafted so that the establishment of the mechanism’s distribution is somehow placed within an EU procedure, or that the EU institutions are heavily involved in the practical implementation of the mechanism and, above all, in defining the conditionality measures. What principles and rules should be established for providing assistance? Who shall establish them and how? For this, we need a regulation with an ordinary legislative procedure and we are waiting to consult with the European Council and the Member States on these issues. Roberto Gualtieri,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this has been an important debate which I think has clearly shown the existence of broad consensus among the political groups over the assessments and general direction of the report. With a few exceptions, Parliament is truly speaking with one voice and that is important. We are saying yes to the permanent stability mechanism though we cannot hide some confusion and concern which, as we have learnt, is also shared by the Commission, even though we would have liked to read of these concerns in the opinion of the Commission on the procedure selected. We are open to showing practicality and a sense of responsibility in noting that the political conditions do not exist to set up a European mechanism today and, nevertheless, we have shown and continue to show determination in our desire to help insert the mechanism into the Union’s legal and procedural framework, whilst also respecting the Treaties. Our proposals are clear, but now I think the crucial issue is another. Is the European Council willing to start up a real discussion with Parliament on its proposals and is the Commission willing to take an active role in this discussion? I should like to underline that Parliament has taken what I would call a customary decision to postpone the vote to 24 March. I think this is an important sign: this is a responsible Parliament, but I think the Council also needs to show this sense of responsibility by taking Parliament’s proposals into consideration.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday evening, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, by a large majority, adopted Parliament’s opinion on the amendment to the Treaty to introduce a stability mechanism. The text proposes a change to the amendment to the Treaty of Lisbon, setting out a procedure which, while safeguarding the intergovernmental nature of the fund, justifies the inclusion of the rule in the Treaty. It also contains some clear proposals regarding the operation of the mechanism, designed to make it compatible with the duties that the Treaty assigns to the European institutions and with the need to have real economic governance, which simply would not work if it were intergovernmental. To use a metaphor which you, Mr Barroso, used in the last debate, Parliament proposes putting this intergovernmental wagon on the rails in a Union train and giving the Commission its due role in running this train. How does the Commission view Parliament’s proposals? Is it willing to help push them in the negotiations over the coming days? (The President cut off the speaker) Roberto Gualtieri,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we stand at a crossroads for the future of the Europe Union. After the many delays that we are guilty of, it has become obvious to everyone that Europe needs real economic governance, which must be particularly stringent for those countries that have adopted the euro. We therefore welcome the creation of a permanent stability mechanism, which we feel is a key point in the construction of genuine economic governance in Europe, even if we continue to nurture legal and political reservations on the procedure adopted, which we think is risky and does not make full use of the instruments provided for by the Treaty. I am delighted to hear that you also share these reservations. In any case, we are now focusing on a different point: how will the new mechanism actually work? Will it contribute to strengthening the economic governance of the European Union or will it be a step towards a new (and inevitably discretional) ‘intergovernmentalism’, which is the direction that was also taken by the unfortunate wording of the Franco-German competitiveness pact? Basically, in what direction is this train setting off? Who will be driving it? Indeed, on the one hand, the proposed amendment to Article 136 sets out an intergovernmental mechanism that is entirely disconnected from the Union and its institutions, while, on the other, we can read in the opinion of the Commission that the mechanism shall have to rely on economic governance exercised by the Union and that the Commission will take all measures to ensure consistency between the stability mechanism and the aforementioned economic governance. We do appreciate these intentions but, since there is no sign of any of this in the proposal to amend Article 136, we think that this is the time to clearly define how this mechanism will work. What procedure will be adopted to put the mechanism in place? What role will the Commission have in its management and in defining the conditions for its application? What will be the composition of the secretariat? What does the Council think about what Mr Barroso has just said on the validity of the current extraordinary solidarity mechanisms? Will there be a role for the European Parliament? I believe that only a rewording of the amendment to Article 136 or, alternatively, a clear declaration from the European Council on these issues, will enable Parliament to adopt an opinion in line with the desired schedule of the European Council.

Mr Present, ladies and gentlemen, I am a keen supporter of regard for the European Union and the competences assigned to it by the Treaties, which I believe also represent the best way to carry out our role as the direct representatives of the citizens of the European Union. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, ladies and gentlemen, I see two major problems with the proposed amendment to Article 136, one of them institutional and the other political. The institutional one is that Article 3 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that monetary policy for the countries whose currency is the euro is the exclusive competence of the Union, but Article 2 provides that exclusive competence may be exercised by the Member States if authorised by the Union. It is difficult to understand why the application of a rule clearly set out in the Treaty should require reform of the Treaty. Then there is also a political problem: choosing the Treaty reform option, rather than using Article 2 or Articles 352 plus 136, places the European Stability Mechanism, and hence the future of the euro, at the mercy of 27 ratification processes. Do people realise that if just one of these 27 ratification processes proved unsuccessful, it would then be difficult to find a plan B for the euro? Does the European Council realise that choosing this path puts the future of the euro at great risk? Roberto Gualtieri,

 Mr President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, there seems to be positive agreement between Mr Danjean’s remarks and what you said in your speech, Baroness Ashton, regarding the analysis of the situation, which is that the situation in the Sahel is critical. We are talking about one of the poorest regions in the world, bordering on some of the countries that have been shaken over the last week by more dangerous instability than ever. It is also a region where terrorist infiltration and drug trafficking are intertwined to a truly worrying extent. All that makes the situation unsustainable and a real threat to Europe. We therefore need to see a qualitative leap in Europe’s initiative. The 2009 initiative for security and development in the Sahel has so far proved ineffective. What is needed is the new strategy for security in the Sahel that the Council of Foreign Ministers have called to adopt, which we are awaiting. I believe there are two important points that have been highlighted: firstly, a regional approach; and secondly, an integrated approach that enables us to make the best possible use of the various instruments available to the EU in a concrete, operational and coordinated way. We must realise, however, that the path for a possible mission must be assessed very carefully, because Common Security and Defence Policy missions are one of the instruments we have available, but they are no replacement for a political strategy. Our group therefore fully endorses Europe’s new, renewed commitment in the Sahel and we are anxious to see the new strategy, discuss it in detail and support its implementation. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, procedure is the stuff of democracy and therefore the implementation of the citizens’ initiative was not merely a technical exercise but imposed crucial choices that made it possible to turn the citizens’ initiative into an instrument effectively capable of helping to build a genuine European political space. Parliament undoubtedly exercised its prerogatives in an exemplary manner, significantly improving the original proposal. The main results have already mentioned and I do not need to remind you of them. I would, however, like to emphasise another one, to which our group made a significant contribution: European political parties will also be able to promote a citizens’ initiative. This is an outcome of great significance because the fate of European democracy lies at its heart, since there can be no genuine international democracy until European political parties take on an effective role in the democratic process. Today we are taking a step forward in this direction and this is another reason why it is a great day for European democracy. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the new strategic concept developed by NATO contains important, positive changes to meet the challenges of the 21st century in a manner consistent with the values of the Atlantic Pact. In particular, we welcome the revival of the strategic partnership with Russia, the explicit formulation of the goal of a world without nuclear weapons, the recognition of the importance of a stronger European defence, the reaffirmation of the principle of collective defence and, at the same time, the statements that NATO does not consider any country to be its adversary. There are still, however, problems and contradictions that this far from new concept does nothing to dispel. Firstly, there is no clear and unambiguous commitment to the elimination of tactical nuclear weapons, which are still deployed in Europe even though they are strategically anachronistic and economically increasingly unsustainable. Secondly, the European Union's role in the strategic concept is still insufficient and the planned civilian crisis management capabilities are at risk of pointlessly duplicating those of the European Union. We are aware of the political problems that hinder more effective EU-NATO cooperation, but this cannot get in the way of developing an operational perspective, complementarity and synergies that are a match for our ambitions. Helicopters, medical support and explosives represent significant progress but are not enough: we need vision and an active commitment and we call on you, Baroness Ashton, to deploy them both with strength and clarity. Roberto Gualtieri,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament approves the establishment of a new section of the budget for the European External Action Service (EEAS) and the provision of additional funds for staff. This position is due to Parliament’s desire to see the EEAS set up, because Europe urgently needs it, but, of course, it does not mean that it will give up its role as budgetary authority in the debate on the nature of the body that will deal with crisis management or on the priorities of staff policy, as shown by the reserve that we established in the 2011 budget. The regulations that we are going to adopt reinforce the outcomes of the Madrid agreement and, in some cases, go further, for which I would like to thank Mr Rapkay, Mrs Gräßle and Mr Rivellini. I must also thank Baroness Ashton and Mr Christophersen for their willingness and openness in our discussions. The Staff Regulations ensure that all EEAS staff will have the same rights and duties irrespective of their origin, and requires the High Representative to ensure a geographical and gender balance. These arrangements will be binding and Parliament will make sure that they are complied with. At the same time, they avoid the use of quotas, which would be not just difficult to implement but also wrong. The Financial Regulation ensures a solid control system and keeps the EEAS closely tied to the Commission. I welcome the success we have achieved with the setting up of specific budget lines for the main common security and defence policy missions, which represents a major leap forward for Parliament’s ability to exercise control over the common foreign and security policy. With tomorrow’s vote, therefore, we will have an EEAS that is stronger, more communautaire
 and subject to greater Parliamentary scrutiny. We will be strict and demanding in performing this scrutiny but, at the same time, we will do it responsibly and in a constructive spirit, since we are determined to help the High Representative in the colossal task of providing Europe with a real foreign policy to serve its values and interests. Roberto Gualtieri,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think the genuine satisfaction that has emerged in this debate shows that Members were aware of just how difficult yet important the task facing us was. How to unify functions associated with different policies and subject to different decision-making procedures in order to make the European Union’s external actions more consistent, without endangering the communautaire
 nature of certain policies, but embracing the contributions of bodies operating in the field of the common security and defence policy, was not merely a problem of European law or administration science or a test of the power relations between institutions. Instead, it was a necessary condition if we were to endow the High Representative with an instrument that could enhance Europe’s potential on the world stage, strengthen its role as a civilised power, and allow us to act more effectively in the Middle East, the Horn of Africa, the Caucasus or the Balkans. Well, I think we have risen to the challenge marvellously, and so our satisfaction is fully justified. The High Representative will, I believe, enjoy Parliament’s exacting support as she performs her duties. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is very important to make a success of this budget procedure, not just because it is the first budget under the Treaty of Lisbon, with a new procedure and new functions for the European Union, but especially because it comes at a crucial time for the future of Europe, affected as it has been by a severe crisis. Faced with the crisis, many governments think of an economic governance model based entirely on stability mechanisms, which means cutting their national budgets and perhaps also the European budget. We, on the other hand, think that a stronger European budget, supported by own resources and also a financial transaction tax, is a precondition for effective European economic governance and for greater discipline in national budgets. We must therefore decide which way to go, and to that end, the amendments that the President-in-Office of the Council has considered inappropriate are, in fact, extremely important. However, the greatest disagreements concern the figures, of course. In this respect, I would urge the Council to make up its mind, because it cannot want to keep strictly to the margins and, at the same time, expect Parliament not to bring its own priorities into play. The Treaty of Lisbon is quite clear on this: the Council is paramount as regards the quantity of spending, whereas Parliament has the last word on the quality of spending. Thinking about heading 4, we are not against increasing funding for the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) or for the Industrialised Countries Instrument (ICI+), but we do not want it to be at the expense of our priorities: first Palestine and then development cooperation. The Council therefore has three options to choose from: it can accept Parliament’s priorities, or it can agree to a revision of the margins, or it can accept greater flexibility of the budget and in the budget, in the knowledge that Parliament will stand united in defence of its prerogatives and priorities. Roberto Gualtieri,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the strengthening of the industrial and technological basis of European defence is an essential part of developing a common defence system. What it needs, however, are common rules and a coordinated approach in order to enhance the development and competitiveness of the European defence industry and, at the same time, to ensure that this development is in line with Europe’s principles and international commitments. To that end, together with the directive on the internal market in defence, the December 2008 common position defining procedures and criteria for military exports to third countries was an important step forward. As we know, these procedures do not include a general consultation mechanism. However, the common position does include a timely reference to the need to enhance cooperation and convergence in this field within the framework of the common foreign and security policy. Until the hoped-for progress on this front, and until such time as the creation of a common defence system makes it possible to adopt even more binding mechanisms, the cooperation and convergence referred to in Article 7 should not remain just on paper and the annual report on military exports should be made available to Parliament. Naturally, the question tabled by the Members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) seems implicitly – although it has now been made explicit – not to confine itself to matters of a general nature. Given that it would have been better to refer to things by their names right from the start, it does not seem that the sale of French ships to Russia contravenes the 2008 common position. On the contrary, such exports could strengthen European-Russian ties and cooperation in the security field and make them more binding. These ties, however, should be removed from the bilateral sphere and be entirely addressed, discussed and managed at a European level. Roberto Gualtieri,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets.

 Mr President, Mrs Ashton, Mr Šefčovič, ladies and gentlemen, clearly, the report on which we are preparing to vote is not a simple opinion, but the result of intense negotiating efforts, for which I would like to thank the High Representative and the Spanish Presidency. These are negotiations in which Parliament played a prominent role in significantly improving the text of the decision that the Council will have to adopt. The compromise reached in Madrid is fully in line with the objectives that guided this highly coordinated work carried out by Mr Brok and Mr Verhofstadt: to provide Europe with a service that has resources and powers sufficient to increase the consistency and effectiveness of the EU’s external action, but which is, at the same time, closely linked to the Community method and the Commission, and subject to the full democratic control of the European Parliament. I, too, would like to say to those who have mentioned so-called red lines that the European Parliament must not cross, that it is precisely because Parliament has been able to exercise its prerogatives fully and dynamically, and even cross some of the red lines outlined by governments, that Europe will have a more effective, more democratic and more European service. I am talking about a service, for instance, that is able to reconcile development cooperation policies with the rest of the EU’s external action, without undermining either the necessary independence of those policies or the Commission’s responsibility. Parliament shall continue to make strong and determined use of its legislative and budget prerogatives, especially over the coming months, in order to define the Staff Regulations and the Financial Regulation in accordance with the basic outline of this report. It will also carefully supervise the actual development of the service and ensure that the letter and spirit of the Madrid Agreement are fully respected, beginning with the proper participation of European officials at the helm of the service and in the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) budget reform. It will also make use of these prerogatives to provide the High Representative of the service’s officials with its full support as the European Parliament, an institution which cares more than any other about the development of a true European foreign policy and about its gradual communitisation, in which the Madrid Agreement is an important stage.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Madam High Representative/Vice-President, I would like to emphasise the fact that we are discussing three excellent documents drawn up by Parliament: ambitious documents that express clear stances, make clear-cut choices and are subject to broad consensus between the groups within this Parliament who care about Europe and its future. It is an important fact, demonstrating Parliament’s will and ability to offer itself as a candidate to play a central role in CFSP/CSDP on the basis of what I would call a dynamic reading of the Treaty of Lisbon. We intend to exercise this role in the process of constructing the External Action Service, not only to guarantee Parliament’s prerogatives, but also to contribute to making the service an organisation capable of ensuring that EU external action is consistent and efficient while, at the same time, strengthening and gradually extending the community method. As regards the Danjean report, I would like to highlight that the concept of strategic autonomy is presented in the context of a multilateral approach, and that it is a condition for strengthening the strategic partnership with the United States. I would also like to highlight the fact that Parliament is united in requesting an Operations Centre, and I am glad that you, High Representative, have declared yourself open to a more exhaustive discussion of this idea. Concerning the non-proliferation resolution, I would like to underline the importance of envisaging a world free from nuclear weapons, the clear judgment on the anachronism of tactical nuclear weapons and the value of the positions recently adopted by some European governments on this front. Thus, Parliament’s message is clear, realistic and ambitious, and we hope that the High Representative is able to grasp and endorse it. Roberto Gualtieri  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the unprecedented humanitarian disaster in Haiti affects us deeply and the European Union has a duty to contribute as best it can to the efforts by the international community, using all the tools at its disposal. As far as financial resources are concerned, significant progress has been made in recent days and hours. What deserves more thought is the other aspects of Europe’s response to the crisis, but we should avoid worrying about our image and concentrate instead on the substance, as the High Representative rightly said. The central role of the MINUSTAH mission has now emerged clearly, in terms of both civil protection and security, ruling out an autonomous CSDP mission, but the EU’s coordination role in support of the UN mission remains key. On this point, I would like to remind Mr Juvin that this coordination exists, and that the Monitoring and Information Centre is performing it in the area of civil protection, and the Situation Centre is performing it in the area of security, and it is to be hoped that this work will result in deployment of the European Gendarmerie Force, as has been expressly requested by the United Nations. What it is useful to understand from the High Representative and from the Commission is how the MIC and the Situation Centre are responding, in practice, in the face of such onerous tasks and tests, how their coordination is working, and whether their instruments and resources are adequate. This will also help us at a later date when we will have to consider the adequacy of these instruments and the capacity of consular protection, but now is not the time for these debates. Now is the time for action and commitment, and we fully support the action being taken by the High Representative. Roberto Gualtieri,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the developments in the situation in Iran, one cannot help but express serious concern. These concerns relate to the increasing infringements of political and civil rights, which we strongly condemn, and concern over the failure to perform the duties resulting from Iran’s membership of the Non-Proliferation Agreement, upon which even the country itself states it does not want to cast any doubt. We do not question Iran’s right to the peaceful development of nuclear energy, nor do we intend to underestimate the important role that Iran can play on a regional level, its legitimate security requirements, or the need to create a credible system of regional security that involves all the nuclear powers in the area. It is precisely because of this, though, that we do not understand the reasons for the failure to comply with the request by the International Atomic Energy Agency for the uranium to be enriched abroad, and we regret this decision. Faced with this situation, it falls to the Security Council to determine the international community’s response and the possibility of new sanctions, which should be focused on non-proliferation and designed to be an instrument to support the path of difficult but unavoidable dialogue, and not designed and used to beat down the regime. With regard to this course of action, the European Union should play its part by giving thought, at the appropriate time and in the appropriate form, to possible technical measures to complement the UN sanctions and, at the same time, by confirming its readiness for debate and dialogue, which should never be lost, even at difficult times. We will fully support action by the European Union and the High Representative in line with the approach that was set out clearly in the High Representative’s speech. Rosario Crocetta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that today is a great result for Parliament, because when I wrote to President Buzek on 15 July saying that ‘we need to set up an anti-mafia committee’, I remember many Members from different countries saying, ‘But the mafia is only a problem in Sicily and in Italy’. Today, recognition by our fellow Members from the north and from the whole of Europe that there is a problem of ‘organised crime in Europe’, and the desire to fight it together is, I believe, a momentous fact, and I would like to thank you, Mr President, and Parliament as a whole.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if Arab dictators shoot at the crowd the West immediately responds, with no-fly zones, UN intervention, and so on. If, on the other hand, the Israeli air force bombs Gaza there is silence, because it is natural for Israel to bomb the Palestinian people. Yet the lack of a solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict is the main cause of conflict between the Arab world and the West, and it provides strength to extremists. Today the Arab revolutions have brought a fresh wave of democracy to North Africa and the Middle East. This cannot fail to have an effect on the relationship between Palestinians and Israelis, too. The very existence of Israel is in some way linked to an understanding of this cause. Either Israel accepts the existence of a Palestinian state, or Israel will no longer be able to live in the same conditions in that region. Within this framework, I believe that it would be very hypocritical for Europe not to give the Palestinians the same support that it is giving to those who are today fighting for freedom and rights in the Arab world and elsewhere. This is because I believe that the right of people to have their own land, to govern themselves, and to have their own state is an inalienable right, and I believe that Europe should support the Palestinian resolution at the UN.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Commissioner Malmström for having forcefully raised the issue of an anti-corruption package, however I must be honest. Those who, like me, live in a Mafia-controlled area and have also paid and continue to pay a terrible price for it, are not amongst those who are convinced that a magical law is all it takes to finally put a stop to corruption. This seems to be the main problem and cause of the state of emergency we currently find ourselves in. Corruption is an ancient art, much older than the world itself, and has probably now become part and parcel of the way in which politics is done, not only in Italy, but in many other countries too. I strongly support what the Commissioner said: we must ensure that we fully emphasise the importance of this policy. When considering how to combat corruption, we must start by asking ourselves how public procurement procedures are conducted; what the threshold is for cases in which a degree of discretion is allowed; whether or not a monitoring network exists to monitor, for example, whoever wins a contract; how people have accumulated their wealth; whether or not there are any rules for tracing money; and how we check whether politicians who have been found guilty have actually been sentenced and imprisoned, or ascertain whether they are still members of parliament, protected by their parties and the laws of their country. We should start a revolution, so to speak; I personally would make the fight against corruption, the Mafia and organised crime the focus of this second half of the parliamentary term, in order to tell the Spanish ‘Indignados
’ that we want a better Europe, a freer Europe, a more transparent Europe, and to tell the young people participating in the Arab Spring that we too want to change the world, and that we want to enact serious change. So, congratulations, Commissioner, but let us do more. Rosario Crocetta,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Beijing’s justification for the arrest of the artist Ai Weiwei for economic crimes is not convincing, and neither is the need to treat a free, dissident artist so harshly. It is not convincing since this arrest is one of hundreds of arrests of opponents and part of the systematic repression of all signs of dissent. At a time when uprisings are breaking out in the Arab world, we think back to the images of cruel violence in Tiananmen Square against young Chinese who, just like today’s Jasmine revolutionaries, were demanding freedom and democracy. China has opened up to the West in economic terms without, however, linking production to respect for the environment and safety at work, and it is unable to embrace democracy and pluralism in any form whatsoever. This is not interference on our part in Chinese internal affairs, as Beijing maintains, but the appeal of men and women, of movements and parties that intend to build a world free of intolerance on every continent. The Beijing government should watch what is happening in the world to grasp that, if it does not change, it will be historic events and Chinese citizens that will change China.

Then, it was considered one of the most democratic countries of the Gulf and has been considered so even in recent years. So one must say, imagine what happens in other countries given that Saudi Arabia performs a few hundred executions a year, given that terrible massacres take place in Iran, given that throughout the Gulf, killings are commonplace and there is complete denial of the rights of the press. Today, we approved the resolution on Syria, Yemen and Bahrain, but when we will prepare a resolution for Saudi Arabia, for Algeria, for China and for the other countries which violate human rights in the world?

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is sad to note that sometimes, the West can find great solidarity when it comes to bombing, sending companies into third world countries and taking oil, but finds it more of a struggle to make solidarity and migration policies. This evening’s debate touches on these themes. I went to Lampedusa on Monday and saw 4 000 - 5 000 people on the ground, huddling together to sleep under the sun and the rain, doing their business where they ate and not being able to change the wet clothes – which some have said were designer labels, but are, in fact, fake designer labels – they had on during the crossing, in lamentable conditions. Among these were 4 500 children, 12-13 year-old kids, living under the same conditions, conditions of discomfort shared also by the inhabitants of Lampedusa. Tunisia is now home to 150 000 migrants who come from Libya and shows its solidarity. It is a poor country showing solidarity, while wealthy Europe is unable to accommodate 5 000 migrants. Europe should instead show its solidarity to these wonderful kids who have sparked the Jasmine Revolution originating in Sidi Bouzid that is changing North Africa and the world.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Egypt: from the virtual community on Facebook to the real one, with millions of people seeking fairer distribution of wealth and greater justice, and protesting against corruption. We must move on from the transition period of soldiers and tanks to a true democracy: a new constitution, new elections, abolition of the death penalty, more humane prisons, social rights and freedom. It will be difficult. Those who are willing to deploy any means in the name of an idea are lying in wait. We want to believe in the great Egyptian people, who have not, however, ever experienced democracy. We want a secular democracy, with a distinct separation between religious authority and political power, a democracy that integrates minorities and establishes true rights: to public healthcare, social security and work. Europe is supporting this approach by investing resources with the ability to promote real development in Egypt: no more dictatorships, no more misery, no more poverty. Rosario Crocetta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commissioner for having devoted her attention to the issue of Tunisia. To be sincere, I would have liked this debate to be given a different title, namely ‘Debate in support of Tunisia and other countries fighting against dictatorships and for human rights’. Instead, we are making a humanitarian crisis out of the fact that one of the greatest world powers, Italy, is having to tackle the problem of taking in 5 000 people. Of course, for Lampedusa, these refugees are a problem, even though a daily ferry links the island to Sicily and there is also an airport through which these people can be taken away. We have to realise that what is being discussed at the moment is not the problem of Frontex or how to stop the boats, but the fact that we are dealing with peoples whom we have urged to fight for democracy and, now that they are doing so, we must be in a position to receive them. Granting more visas is one policy that Italy can pursue to try to help those countries. Rosario Crocetta  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is time that Europe made efforts to give the Tunisian people and their transitional government concrete support and to re-launch a Euro-Mediterranean dialogue that has been badly neglected in recent years. The explosion of anger among the young people and the poor in the Maghreb and Egypt has been caused by the inequitable distribution of wealth and restrictions on people exercising their fundamental freedoms. North Africa is fired up and is demanding more democracy, better economies, more participation and more employment, while looking in disbelief at the old continent of Europe, which is immobile and unable to grasp the social transformation that has taken place in the region or to develop genuine policies for progress and peace. Europe needs to be pay closer attention to human rights and democracy and must promote more dialogue, more collaboration and more genuine economic assistance. Europe must open its doors and its heart to North Africa, so that the Mediterranean can become a sea of peace. There must be no more rejection of migrants through violent collaboration with countries like Libya. What we need is more investment, more openness, more aid and more of a Euro-Mediterranean policy. History demands it of us. Rosario Crocetta,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by asking for the immediate release of Nasrin Sotoudeh, we are urging the Union and its Member States to do more to liberate Iranian citizens and the world from one of the cruellest and most authoritarian regimes in history. The Islamic Republic of Iran is characterised not only by the threat it poses to world peace with a nuclear project capable of evoking the terror of nuclear war, but also by the illegitimacy of its elections; mass arrests of people requesting free elections; the killing of objectors; the rape and physical abuse of those who do not support the regime; the iniquity of judicial processes, where decisions can be predicted as soon as the accusations have been made; serious discrimination against women and homosexuals; and the absence of freedom of expression and of association. The conditions of Iranian prisoners in Camp Ashraf, where they are subjected to violence and even stoning, are absolutely incredible. Every day, at least two people, including children, are sentenced to death in Iran, and they are guilty of nothing more than of not pleasing the regime. Legal evidence is often created through the cruel and skilful use of brutal methods of torture. These criticisms are certainly not aimed at Islam, which is based on peace, but at the Iranian regime. The arrest and conviction of Nasrin Sotoudeh bring to light a new level of judicial deceit, since in this case, the attack and conviction are against a defender of the people, which means that citizens of Iran cannot even defend themselves.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the purpose of my speech is to point out the severity of the deindustrialisation process affecting a range of Sicilian industrial centres, in particular, the Termini Imerese automotive centre owned by the FIAT group, and the Gela petrochemical centre belonging to the ENI group. Termini Imerese is being damaged by the competition arising from the low salary system within some EU countries, whilst Gela is being damaged by competition from Asia. With regard to the severe deindustrialisation processes that are taking place in widespread areas of the Union, I would argue that the time has come to reconsider the policy of non-intervention that the European Commission has adopted up until now, and to begin to launch a set of important, strategic measures to support European industry. This call is addressed chiefly to the European Commission and to Mr Tajani, the Commissioner for Industry and Entrepreneurship. Rosario Crocetta  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as someone who has visited Tunisia two to three times per year since 1982 and who, as a Catholic, on 6 January attended mass, as I regularly do, I find it truly difficult to think of Tunisia as a country which suppresses religious freedom. There are problems, but for Heaven’s sake let us not to look at these countries, countries which are trying to make progress, through the prism of Western countries, because if we were to use that parameter, a parameter which someone is using this morning with regard to Tunisia, then certain European countries would probably be denied entry into the European Union, because the violence and denial of freedom which exists there is on a greater scale than in Tunisia. Thus, the issue arises as a result of one concrete fact: namely, that we have before us a country which has abolished Islamic fundamentalism, which is making efforts to develop a cooperation and peace policy with Europe, which is trying to evolve. There are problems. I believe that the way to solve these problems is to strengthen dialogue and friendship and to help these countries to achieve more. Rosario Crocetta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we were in Ramallah when we heard the news that Europe had adopted a new decision on the Middle East peace process. We saw the hopeful smiles on the faces of the Palestinian representatives. They were days filled with emotion and suffering, etched on the faces of the children gripping the window bars of their homes on the Hebron road, the deserted road that no Palestinian is allowed to cross. We saw the suffering of an 85-year-old woman, driven out of her occupied home, forced to sleep in the cold in a tent set up in the garden of what used to be her own house, and the suffering on the faces of the Palestinians who had built a farm using European funds, subsequently destroyed by Israeli soldiers. Israel has the right to be an independent state, but the Palestinians also have the right to a homeland, a state and a passport. The decision of the Council of Europe represents a considerable step forward, but we need to act immediately. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is just the tip of the iceberg in a larger conflict. On the final day of our visit, the Israeli authorities prevented us, the European Parliament delegation, from visiting the Gaza Strip. I believe that in this regard, the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, should step in to protest on behalf of democratic Europe. I should like to thank Mr De Rossa who led the delegation and all the other members of the delegation, because during the days we spent in Palestine, the vulnerable were able to see and hear the face and the words of a Europe which upholds rights and wishes to, and must, do more.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, concerning the request from the Council that we approve the proposal for exchanges of information between Europol and partners, including third countries, one can see what this would lead to: the proposal, if approved, would create the absurd situation of regulating, among other things, the exchange of information between Europol and third countries without Parliament having yet approved any such list of countries. This proposal, in its depiction of the handling of personal data, seems to pave the way for the creation of a truly limitless database which could even be made available to third parties that have not yet been specified by Parliament. Article 15(2) of the Council’s proposal states that in cases of absolute necessity, even where there is no suggestion that a crime has been carried out, data may be transmitted that reveal a person’s race, ethnic origin, political stance, religious and philosophical convictions, trade union membership and so on, without it being specified what is meant by ‘absolute necessity’ and, worse still, by endorsing the idea that there is such a thing as racial groups. It would be interesting to hear the Council clarify what a racial group is and which racial groups exist. As far as I am concerned, I believe that there is only one race – the human race. For these reasons, but also to maintain the independence of Parliament, which must work within the necessary time limits, I believe that the Council’s proposal in its present form must be rejected by the requested deadline of 30 November.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank you for asking the Belgian and French authorities to provide me with police protection. To feel the solidarity of the institutions when you are on the frontline fighting a phenomenon such as the mafia in Italy, which has resulted in many victims over many years, is really important in my view, and I offer my heartfelt thanks. However, for some time, Mr President, mafia organisations have been a global phenomenon: not just through money laundering, but also through their permanent presence in various European countries, and also via immigration. When, on 16 July this year, I called for the establishment of a committee of inquiry into mafia organisations in Europe, I did so with the aim not only of serving my country, but also the European Community, in the belief that a lack of vigilance when it comes to organised crime associations such as the mafia could have a negative impact on citizens’ quality of life and safety and on development mechanisms. And it is strange, I have finished, Mr President ... (The President cut off the speaker) Salvatore Caronna  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted for this report and I would like to congratulate Mr Alfonsi once again, because I believe macro-regional strategies can be a tool for creating added value for the whole of Europe. That is why it is important to continue along this path, though subject to certain specific conditions. Macro-regional strategies have to be developed around a well-defined geographical area with specific, uniform characteristics. In addition, strategies must be functional and stakeholders must be willing to push forward the integration process. Essentially, the regional approach should guide local communities towards integration at a higher level in order to address and overcome challenges that they would be unable to tackle otherwise, if they did not cooperate. With regard to the Mediterranean area, I think it is important that the report envisages one strategy for the western Mediterranean and another for the eastern basins, in other words, the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. In particular, it is significant that there is already a very high degree of coordination in the Adriatic and Ionian region. I therefore believe the Commission and the Council should follow up this important report. Salvatore Caronna  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the role of the cooperative movement has always been important for creating a more balanced and just economy. Currently, while we are going through one of the most serious economic and social crises since the war, the function of cooperative societies has become crucial. It is quite clear that where there has been substantial development of the cooperative dimension in the economy, the result has been an increase in employment, more skilled labour and more equitable redistribution of the wealth generated. Therefore, it is good that the European Union has adopted a statute for cooperative societies, but now more than ever, there needs to be a real simplification of the rules. We need to give new incentives for the creation of a common European framework on cooperatives and this must occur by giving assistance and not creating bureaucratic obstacles. This is why I voted in favour of this resolution and I hope that the Commission and the Council will take action to resolve the problems mentioned. Salvatore Caronna  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the creation of a European Higher Education Area is a major goal that the European Union has set for itself. However, despite the progress made with the Bologna Declaration – which, as noted, dates back to 1999 – we have got to recognise the fact that in terms of student mobility and the harmonisation of degrees across the various countries, the results have been far from satisfactory. That is why I voted in favour of this report. We need to move forward with greater speed on this issue and reverse the trend – especially in some countries – of cutting investment in education. Accordingly, the harmonisation put forward under the Bologna Declaration is still essential in order to improve the entire European education system and make the labour market more dynamic. I, too, would like to applaud Mr Berlinguer for his excellent work. Salvatore Caronna  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Parliament’s vote relating to the scheme for distribution of food products to deprived persons for the next two years was, above all, a mandatory step, bearing in mind also the fact that a few weeks ago, we approved a report against food waste that had amongst its targets the fundamental objective of helping the most needy sections of the population. It is unthinkable that at a time of economic crisis and social suffering like the present, we should not be responding, albeit partially, in such a way. In such a perspective, it is to be hoped that we will find a definitive solution for the entire 2014-2020 period. As we are seeing at the moment in the squares of Athens, the image of a European Union capable only of imposing cuts and sacrifices is a devastating one. We need to offer an alternative Europe capable of solidarity and of taking care of those in difficulty, and we need to do it soon. Salvatore Caronna

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first, I would like to thank the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their cooperation during the drafting of this report. This fruitful collaboration meant that we were able, swiftly and almost unanimously, to approve a text on an issue, that of the waste of food, which has, for too long, been underestimated by the institutions and by policy. We can no longer permit ourselves to underestimate it. All the most authoritative specialist sources now say that one of the main problems in the immediate future will be to tackle the new and extremely high demand for food and that therefore, the issue of food security has become one of the most difficult problems to tackle because, in the future, the demand for food will tend to exceed supply. If this is true, we can no longer allow ourselves to remain passive in the face of food waste. When we talk of food, we are talking of food that is still perfectly edible, and so this issue has become a large-scale problem which is no longer sustainable. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) estimates that a third of food produced every year in the world that is intended for human consumption is wasted, and in Europe, the figure is already 50%, with every citizen on average wasting 105 kilograms per year. We have reached such a level, in fact, that we have to say that we are faced not only with an ethical problem, but with a real economic and social issue, with enormous implications for the environment. That is why, through this report, we want combating food waste to become a priority on the European Union’s policy agenda. We are therefore asking for the Commission to lead the 27 Member States in adopting a common strategy that can foster a real step change to reduce food waste significantly by 2025. We therefore ask that all the associations, volunteer groups and initiative-taking centres that have produced specific projects in this area in various countries should be turned to good account. These experiences have generated a virtuous system which has guaranteed significant recovery of products to be sent to those sections of the population that are experiencing financial difficulties. I would like to remind you that in Europe, wealthy Europe, nearly 70 million citizens live under the poverty threshold and suffer from malnutrition. We are therefore asking for precise directives from the Commission. Specifically, it would be important to amend the regulations on public procurement for catering services in canteens and hospitals so that, when they are being considered, priority is given, other terms being equal, to those enterprises that have a management model established on combating food waste. On this aspect, I would like to point out that the important fact is that the first to set an example should be the European institutions, starting with this Parliament. Finally, we are calling for all stakeholders in the agri-food industry to take responsibility. A real awareness-raising campaign needs to be conducted, targeted firstly at the large farmers’ organisations, the world of industry, schools and universities, which can produce a civil and scientific culture oriented towards a more restrained and environmentally sustainable model of consumption. With this report, the European Parliament has done its part. Now we hope that the Commission will address this work by putting an effective strategy in train. Above all, we hope that swift action will be taken to declare 2014 the European Year against Food Waste; this would be a tangible sign of the institution’s true, strong and immediate commitment in this area. This would give an immediate signal to all citizens that the European Union is able to be at the forefront in establishing a fairer and balanced development model. Salvatore Caronna  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are currently living through a period that is decisive for the future of the euro and with it of the whole European project. Being aware of this would mean abandoning a short-sighted logic that subordinates everything to an ideological balance of payments straitjacket. We all want various countries’ books to be in order. We all want to reduce debt. Nevertheless, it is clear that without a sensible policy of investment capable of breathing life into the economy, there will be no possibility of growth. The one clear outcome of this approach is that the greatest price will, as usual, be paid by the least well-off. That is why we in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have voted against this report. In fact, it continues down a one-way street that is one of austerity without growth, a direction that has so far proved to be the wrong one. Salvatore Caronna  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very appreciative of the work done by Ms Ferreira in this report. In fact, this was the only one of the package’s six legislative proposals devoted to economic governance for which my group and I voted. We did so because it includes, among other things, a clause on the protection of social rights, starting with collective bargaining, and because it also strengthens Parliament’s role in the adoption of delegated acts. Therefore, although we cannot change the overall balance of the six-pack, with this report we are definitely making progress towards, among other things, a surveillance system that takes account of fundamental rights. In this context, then, although a vision based solely on a policy of austerity does not, in our view, produce positive results, this positive report certainly bucks that trend. Salvatore Caronna  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I had no hesitation in voting in favour of the report by Ms Zimmer, above all, for one purely political reason: I think we need to bring this major issue of food security right back to the core of all European Union initiatives. It is not only a matter of helping developing countries to tackle this issue more effectively. Rather, since the demand for agricultural products is set to increase by more than 70% between now and 2050, the food crisis is a key issue that must be dealt with quickly and decisively. Otherwise, it may become one of the main threats – if not the main threat - to stability, peace and, as we have seen, even democracy. I think it is therefore incumbent upon the European Union and the Member States to take the required steps to properly tackle this important issue, beginning with adequate investment, as the report proposes. Salvatore Caronna,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that the challenge of the coming years is to ensure that Europe, as has been said, maintains its position as the world’s number one tourist destination and, at the same time, is able to enhance its entire territorial heritage, both in terms of environmental protection and competitiveness. The challenge is a difficult one and not to be taken lightly, having regard not only to the opportunities but also to the aggressiveness of other countries in this sector, of other continents from China to India and Brazil. Against this backdrop, as Commissioner Tajani mentioned, and as noted also in the opinion that we approved on the Committee on Regional Development, having a strong, general, EU-wide strategy on tourism with an enhanced role for the regions and territories becomes fundamental. Accordingly, in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity, it is essential that regions and local authorities are fully involved from the outset. Moreover, I believe that the development of integrated tourist networks and projects should be encouraged through the creation of partnerships for the exchange of best practice. I think that the proposal to identify a ‘Europe brand’ that is capable of defining a high quality of tourist product is also good. Obviously, it will be up to the Commission to define better the priorities, above all from a financial point of view, to guarantee that Europe retains its number one position in future.

Mr President, I voted in favour of the report by Mr Garriga Polledo on the forthcoming financial perspectives of the Union because, at one of the greatest times of crisis for the so-called European spirit, I am convinced that it is vital for us to insist upon and prevail in our belief that it is essential to provide the Union with credible instruments, beginning with adequate funding. The request for a 5% increase in the next budget is therefore just and necessary. Perhaps it will not be enough, but it is essential in order to provide answers to the big questions that lie ahead: these resources are needed to tackle real problems, such as greater cohesion between the regions, a greater capacity for research and innovation, and a greater capacity to generate growth and provide jobs. Without adequate resources, none of these problems will be properly dealt with, beginning with the introduction of the intermediate category in cohesion policy, which only makes sense if it does not harm the other categories already in place. That is why I voted in favour and I hope that the Commission and the Council will follow the recommendations of the report. Salvatore Caronna  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the adoption of the report by Mrs Podimata represents a significant step forward for a more balanced, more progressive and stronger economic and fiscal policy in Europe. It is now clear to everyone that Europe, as the coordinating authority of the 27 countries, urgently needs to equip itself with economic and financial instruments that are capable of controlling the economy and not just submitting to it. For this reason, the proposed taxation of financial transactions has caused quite a stir and generated a large amount of attention and discussion. The fact that the majority of this Parliament has voted for this regulation is important and significant because, for the first time, things were not just left to ride and instead, we have achieved a step forward. I do hope that the Commission and the Council will continue on this path. Salvatore Caronna  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Open Days have been taking place here in Brussels over the last few days. Many municipal and regional representatives have been talking about how to address the serious problems our cities are facing and about the old and new needs affecting workers, families, and small and large production companies alike. The economic crisis that has hit our societies has made it harder and more difficult for all of us to find suitable solutions to a new and serious social issue. In this context, I believe everyone has come to understand that, time and again, cohesion policy has been the only real instrument the regions have had available to them for trying to provide solutions. We can therefore say that over the last few years, cohesion policy has provided a vital fillip to the European integration process for all of the regions. Now we are having to redefine this policy for the period after 2013, and we are therefore at a turning point. That is why it is vitally important to avoid certain risks. The first fundamental risk would be to renationalise it: that would be a serious step backwards. Next, when preparing the financing budget, we must lay down appropriate requirements with regard to the weaker areas without penalising the more competitive and more advanced regions. Lastly, it is essential to simplify the procedures for those who have demonstrated efficiency and to make more legally binding the power to penalise those who have not. We expect the Commission to take action along these lines. Silvia Costa,

 Madam President, I want to remind you that today is the 23rd anniversary of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and I believe the digital world is a new frontier for promoting and protecting the rights of babies and children. I wholeheartedly thank the shadow rapporteurs from the Committee on Culture and Education and the rapporteur from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for the excellent job they have done too and I hope that today we will really send an important signal to everyone awaiting Parliament’s vote. Silvia Costa,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, 23 years after the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the internet is becoming the new frontier at which the rights of minors have to be protected and promoted, given the growing penetration of the internet among children and adolescents in Europe – a kind of symbiotic relationship which helps to form their personalities and the way in which they relate to the outside world. A few years ago, the average age at which children had their first access to the internet was around 9 years old, but today, the first steps on the web, for those born in the digital age, are being taken even before they learn to read or write. Young people under 16 use computers for study, play, watching video clips, downloading videos and music, file sharing, and for visiting chat rooms, blogs and virtual worlds. However, the majority of children between the ages of 9 and 16 have their profile registered on a social network, many using a fictitious identity, and a quarter of adolescents declare an older age than their real one. Twelve per cent of those in the 9 to 16 age group report that they have been harassed, in particular by being bullied (40 %) and by content and approaches of a sexual nature (25 %). Therefore, opportunities and threats coexist on the internet; nowadays the internet is indispensable for the integration of children from a social, educational and work point of view, but the European institutions and the Member States must do their utmost to ensure that minors are guaranteed the conditions they need for their education and to keep themselves informed, the rules required for safe navigation, and that providers, business and educators are made aware of their responsibilities. The report proposes a holistic approach in respect of the promotion and protection of the rights of children online. Exchanges with the various political groups in the Committee on Culture and Education and the shadow rapporteurs – whom I would like to thank – allowed us to arrive at a compromise text which was highly satisfactory even though it deals with a topic about which there are different sensibilities and trends. The work carried out with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and its rapporteur, Ms Hedh, made a significant contribution. The report welcomes and incorporates – with precise recommendations – the recent communication from the Commission for a better internet for children. It was our aim to strike a balance between the fundamental rights of the child in the digital world, the right to access to education, the right to protection and the right to digital citizenship, in a new system of governance which puts at its heart, as paramount, the interests of the child, as a person undergoing education and as a European citizen, on the basis of Article 24 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Treaty. Where governance is concerned, we call on the Commission to mainstream children’s rights across all the policies of the European Union that refer to the internet, to continue to finance specific programmes such as the Safer Internet Programme on the basis of a report and monitoring, and to take appropriate measures, through the internet among other things, which make it possible to coordinate the implementation of codes of conduct and the CEO coalition initiative. In addition, we support the Commission’s proposal to take legislative action if the adoption of the current codes of self-regulation should fail. As regards safe and untroubled access to internet use, we propose taking measures for an educational alliance among families, schools, associations and those involved in media and audiovisual services, to integrate these skills in school curricula and to train trainers and adults; vigilance in respect of the online marketing and publicising of harmful substances; an exchange of good practice in the role of informal education by the dissemination among adolescents of positive and good practices on the internet; the access of minors to safe and high-quality pluralistic digital content in educational programmes and services and, in particular, in the public service media. As regards the right to protection, the report makes a clear distinction between illegal content and unsuitable and dangerous content. For the dangerous and unsuitable material, we call for action to protect identity and privacy; to prevent excessively early contact with sexuality, grooming and improper behaviour – including that towards other minors, such as online bullying and sexting. Furthermore, we call on the Commission to maintain the initiative for classifying unsuitable content and, in general, for all the technical innovations that guide parents and children; we support the proposal from Ms Reding on the protection of personal data, privacy, the right to be forgotten, with specific measures for minors, and with mandatory parental consent for the processing of their data. As regards illegal content, however, there must be tools which are effective in dealing with online crimes such as grooming, and we would repeat that such crimes are of a cross-border nature and so stronger international cooperation is required in dealing with computer crime and in supporting hotlines. Finally, we would encourage – and we call on the Commission to encourage – the Member States to give whatever support they can to digital citizenship, which is crucial for the development of an intelligent and inclusive Union and civic participation, including that on the internet, by minors.

 Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, sending disconcerting, destabilising messages to Europe’s young people is not a great way to celebrate 25 years of Erasmus. The 33 countries involved in the Erasmus programme and the two and a half million students who have so far had the opportunity of studying abroad deserve certainty. It is unthinkable that the reason that this programme is in crisis is its success, including in terms of the funding already used. We need to be aware that the entire lifelong learning programme accounted for just 0.7 % of the EU budget in the last seven-year period, and we are talking about seeking an increase of 65 % or 75 % for the next seven-year period. We would be giving a completely mixed message if we were to say we could not honour our commitments. I hope that the Cypriot Presidency and the Council will make a very real commitment to reconsidering the extra funding requested by the Commission. Parliament should give a strong, united signal to ensure young people do not become eurosceptics too. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I, too, would like to congratulate Ms Jiménez-Becerril Barrio and Ms Parvanova, the Commissioner and the Council for this step forward by the European judicial system represented by this directive, which is also a way of honouring the victims of 9/11. I believe that, after the directives concerning human trafficking, child pornography and the European protection order, it is very important to focus on vulnerable people using a holistic approach with this directive. It is very important for all the countries to decide on a shared basis of inalienable rights, starting with the right to understand and be understood in one’s own language, access to services, information, compensation, and basically to justice for oneself and one’s family. It is also important that, thanks to the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, reference is made in this directive to the specific nature of violence against minors and women. I hope that in this regard, major efforts will be made to inform and update magistrates and lawyers, and I will conclude, Mr President, by saying that it is important to ensure that we prevent the secondary form of victimisation that often takes place via media that is not self-regulated, which broadcasts pictures of minors, exposing them to further violence and violating their privacy.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we must acknowledge that the European Council of 28 June represented an important political step forward, finally bucking the trend of years of repatriation of EU policies and delays in the process of strengthening and completing the Union’s institutional and economic framework to accompany the single currency. It is now irresponsible of certain governments or political groups to question or threaten to veto the decisions that have been taken, which I hope will be confirmed and fleshed out at the next Ecofin Council meeting. Such behaviour also risks negating Parliament’s efforts to push ahead with common objectives, namely boosting own resources, investment, jobs and growth. Thanks above all to the efforts of our political group and the work of the Italian and French Governments – together with the Spanish Government – the ‘golden rule’ and the Tobin Tax are now on the agenda, but a renewed push for greater political and economic integration in the European Union should be there as well.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I very much wish to emphasise the importance of this report on volunteering, and also to congratulate the rapporteur, with whom I had an excellent relationship in the Committee on Culture and Education (CULT), especially to ensure that Parliament’s attention on this issue will not wane now that the European Year of Volunteering is over. We were hoping – as I had asked previously in my role as shadow rapporteur – for a White Paper on volunteering work, which unfortunately has not been forthcoming. That would have provided an overall comparative framework at European level between the various situations, defining a status for European volunteering work and ensuring consistent fiscal treatment. I find that, despite not having had this, this report does fill a void and looks ahead. It is important to want to strengthen cross-border volunteering and remove the barriers that hamper many volunteers from gaining access to this opportunity and also, in particular, for disadvantaged people who need to be able to get help from volunteers. I think it is vital for us to find out how widespread volunteering is in areas such as cultural heritage, the environment and sport, and to make sure that in European tenders, the work of voluntary associations can be considered as a form of cofinancing for the purposes of being eligible for such tenders.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work. Fifty-five years on from Article 119 of the Treaty and after Article 157 of the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, the average pay gap in Europe is still 16.5%, demonstrating that a more comprehensive approach should be attempted, as the report itself advocates. In my view, the nine key issues identified in the report provide a sound basis for amending the 2006 directive, which Parliament is asking the Commission to review by February 2013, with the inclusion of both legislative and non-legislative measures. I would remind the previous speaker that the legal basis is Article 157, which provides that Parliament and the Council can act through the ordinary legislative procedure, in conjunction with the Commission, to introduce measures to ensure that the Member States implement equality measures. In particular, I must stress the need for transparency in defining work of equal value, which should be based on a job classification system that takes into account professionalism, skill and responsibility. Statistics should be made comparable – which is not the case at the moment – and there should be effective monitoring bodies to which appeals can be addressed, as well as more effective sanctions. Additionally, in terms of pay evaluation, greater transparency is needed in the wage or salary component, which is generally equal compared with the other components, such as benefits, allowances or deductions, in which the gap tends to be greater. That is shown by the fact that the higher women climb in their professions, the greater the pay gap becomes. We should therefore focus on that aspect, together, of course, with the need to reconcile work and family life and the need for training opportunities, not to mention raising the profile of part-time work in relation to the ability to pursue a career, a factor that penalises women to this day. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate the words of the Council and Ms Malmström. I think that today we must at long last talk about a proper European strategy on fighting trafficking, on prevention and on protecting victims. I attach huge significance to the role of the European coordinator, whose staff should, I think, be beefed up. We also need strong direction from the Commission so that all the Member States create equivalent organisations that will work with the national rapporteurs through ongoing consultations, with non-governmental organisations – which are often the most involved in this area – and closely with the police, the magistracy and with the cyber police on offences committed online. It is also important to compare the measures against customers and on discouraging demand in the various countries. This will allow us to move forward and connect the measures on children in a more holistic way as we implement this directive and the one on Internet child pornography. I think that training legal professionals is of central importance, as is legislative consistency. In this vein I would note the appalling situation of those in Italy who from 1998 had the humanitarian residence permit while now illegal immigration has been made a crime. I hope the current government will change this, because it is making it impossible to use the humanitarian residence permit for women who are victims of trafficking. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me just clarify this: I think, personally, that I have some concerns over one point in the report but I would not express it in the way Ms Bizzotto did, in the sense that it seems to me that the report goes a bit beyond the remit of the European Union, not so much when it describes various types of cohabitation, of family, and so on, in different forms, but when it says that the EU must somehow enter into what comes under family law which is still subject to subsidiarity. As far as same-sex families are concerned, I would like to make it clear that there are definitely same-sex unions in Italy, there are same-sex unions in situations where children are present, but same-sex union is not treated as being equivalent to the condition and legal status of the family and this is allowed under the various freedoms of Member States. I believe this is the point that should be clarified, it is not denying reality, it is denying legal gender equality in this case in my country. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that to sum up the situation and indicate more advanced goals for equality between men and women – today, in March 2012 – means facing up to the dramatic data from the economic crisis that show a rise in female unemployment, especially among young people, increasing poverty amongst women and I feel we should also acknowledge the rise of violence against women, especially where it is perpetrated in private. There is a situation, therefore, of suffering exacerbated by the cuts being introduced in many States in areas such as welfare, education and social security, which has mainly hit women. I believe there is a connection between this situation and the continued exclusion of women from the decision-making process and that this leads to an underestimation of the impact on women of the crisis and of our policies. Against this backdrop, the two reports focus on some goals that I agree with: a stronger focus when planning 2014-2020 Structural Funds on actions also targeted at women; economic independence, encouraging women entrepreneurs with Guarantee Funds and support tools; abolishing the gender pay gap, by reassessing women’s work and professionalism; prohibiting discriminatory behaviour – for example in my country, forcing women employees to sign blank resignation letters. We also call for standards and measures to recreate a balance in terms of representation, with transparent selection procedures for men and women in politics and in decision-making, and I would welcome it if Commissioner Reding can with the support of Parliament – as she has announced – really get a directive on quotas in enterprises. We also need to act at a symbolic level, not only countering the stereotypes in the media, but by promoting the enhancement and respect even for the dignity of women which is all too often commodified and abused. I am disappointed that the rapporteur Ms In ’t Veld proposes an amendment to delete this reference to the dignity of women, perhaps not fully grasping that the degradation of their image becomes a legitimisation of the violence towards them. Thank you. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, it would be truly strange if, at a time of such difficulties and problems in the lives of millions of people in Europe, the European Union were to impose further restrictions on food distribution. This would have a detrimental effect on basic social citizenship rights, the value of social cohesion and the very perception of the European social model. The signal that Parliament and the Council are both giving is a positive one, but we need to work on giving a definite structure and future to this necessary initiative. I would like to point out that in my country, Caritas, local bodies and other not-for-profit organisations providing free meals have seen an exponential increase in the number of people joining the ranks of the deprived, who can no longer count on being able to feed themselves, and these include not just immigrants, but many elderly and young people as well. I believe that, in the context of our ambitious fight against poverty and efforts to reduce poverty, this scheme is a prerequisite, and if we had not approved it, we would have gone against our own policy objectives.

I voted for this important report on sport, which is a response to the Commission’s communication on the subject and anticipates the proposal to create a sub-programme for sport in the 2014-2020 multiannual programming. As the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, we pushed for the following points: the adoption of sport as a compulsory subject in school curricula, the need to encourage women and girls from disadvantaged backgrounds to take up sport, focusing on sport as a driver of social integration and as a tool with which to combat intolerance, racism and violence, increasing the protection of minors in competitive sport, combating doping, the use of the European flag at all official sports events, the establishment of a European Day of Sports and the extension of the Erasmus programme to sports.

 Madam President, one of the fundamental rights that the European Union must guarantee for its citizens and residents is real freedom of movement under safe conditions throughout the 27 Member States. At the moment this is not guaranteed for those people – most, but not all of whom are women – who have obtained protection orders in their own countries, often with great difficulty, after being persecuted, stalked or repeatedly threatened even with being killed by someone they know, often a spouse, as Ms Reding mentioned, or an ex-husband or a boyfriend, or in any case someone they know. Such people are in fact no longer protected when they travel to another Member State. Parliament and the Council, in conjunction with the Commission, are seeking to fill this legislative gap by means of this directive. I would like to point out that we have applied the codecision procedure for the first time, at the initiative of the Spanish Presidency together with another 12 Member States, including Italy, and with strong support from the Polish Presidency, whom I would like to thank. This is the first legal instrument offering effective prevention and protection for actual or potential victims of crimes against the person or crimes of a moral nature across the European Union. It may be executed by either the civil or the criminal authorities of a country with measures that are the same as or equivalent to those taken in the issuing country. As the shadow rapporteur in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I would like to highlight the excellent cooperation that arose with the two rapporteurs and the invaluable contribution made by Ezio Perillo of Parliament’s Directorate for Legislative Affairs, who is today at the Court in Luxembourg. I also want to say how pleased I am with the key points of our proposal: the expansion of protection to cover physical and psychological integrity, dignity, personal liberty and sexual integrity; the right to information; the guarantees that the perpetrator of threats will also be informed of the consequences of breaching the European Protection Order; and the obligation for Member States to draw up comparable statistics. Of course, I also expect Parliament to adopt a position on the Victims package that Ms Reding has announced, so as to make this focus on victim protection truly horizontal. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that three issues are important in the transition from training to work: the relationship between theory and practice in teaching and learning; the integration of the humanities with technical and scientific subjects; and the structure of higher education and technical training, including non-academic training and continuous development. This is the direction that should be taken in teacher training, the promotion of training partnerships between companies, training centres and research centres and the promotion of high-level training. Today, we have a two-speed market for young people, and the situation is getting worse. We also have a flexibility that has not been matched by welfare provisions, but the new welfare is continuous development and opportunities to return to work and for mentoring. I think this should be presented more as a new social right. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that compromises are made not only by aiming downwards but also by seeking a middle way that aims upwards, and by improving the living and health conditions not only of women but also of children, whom I believe have not received much attention in this debate. I appreciated the intellectual honesty and politeness with which Mr Mleczko described the Council’s difficulty. I truly hope that a balanced compromise can be reached. However, I believe that we have done well to raise the bar compared with the requests contained in the Commission’s project, which were truly modest. I want to say one thing which I believe is really a basic objection. It seems as though Europe has not yet understood that, unless it helps reconcile work and motherhood, millions of European women will be excluded from the labour market or will be unable to remain in it. A different type of compromise would rejuvenate Europe, reduce childhood and family poverty and increase the productivity and community of Member States, unless the only proposal for welfare reform and cost optimisation is to increase women’s pension age, which would lead to a paradox. Under this system, these women will never reach pension age, because they will leave their jobs, as happens in many countries including mine, because it is not possible to reconcile work and family during their productive and childbearing years. I believe that unless European economic thought revises its conceptual base and moves beyond an ‘accountancy’ approach, growth will not be intelligent, inclusive or sustainable, because the women will not be there. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a point I very much welcome in Ms Wallis’s report on alternative dispute resolution is the fact that it calls for a general ‘justice for growth’ agenda across sectors which goes beyond consumer-producer disputes to include civil transactions, and family disputes in particular. I would argue that family mediation and a strong commitment from Europe in this respect are extremely important issues, in view of the growing number of disputes that generally follow separations and divorces in the European Union. In particular, disputes between spouses who are often of different nationalities tend to drag on longer and consequently have a terrible effect on the children. Experience in many countries shows that having a family mediator, as someone neutral that they can freely turn to, helps partners reach a mutually acceptable understanding, with an agreement in writing that can be submitted to a judge to be made official. This goal must therefore be determinedly pursued at a European level, although with due respect for subsidiarity, not least in light of the 2005 EU regulation on parental responsibility. It will also strengthen cross-border protection, particularly with regard to child abduction and the role of the European Parliament Mediator. I hope, therefore, that the Commission also includes this aspect directed to the Member States in its legislative proposal. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her complex, interesting and fertile report. As has been mentioned, single mothers now make up over 5% of the female population in Europe, and I would also point out that 85% of single parents are women. Single-parent families are therefore concentrated on the female side, and this fact should now be increasingly acknowledged by welfare, employment and social security policies. Naturally, as the report shows, this is a highly diverse population in terms of age, legal status and economic situation. In northern Europe, for instance, the vast majority are young unmarried mothers, especially in certain countries in Scandinavia and the United Kingdom, while in the south, most single mothers with children are separated, divorced or widowed. Their conditions are therefore also highly varied. Whereas certain welfare services and systems are probably more advanced in northern Europe, not least because family connections are less extensive, in the south, we are having to face a new, emerging problem of young unmarried mothers as well, but with a welfare system that has not yet been properly focused or thought through. There are therefore different speeds of response. I believe the first thing that should be done, as the report also points out, is to compare welfare systems and best practices in order to work out the right mix of services for employability, for training and for welfare, in order to guard against forms of poverty and exclusion from the job market and to enable these women to achieve a work-life balance, which is much more complicated for them. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Alfano, on this important report. It has become an essential reference for Parliament’s actions in an area in which it has new, enhanced competence based on the Treaty of Lisbon. It is a fundamental reference because of its subject matter – the fight against organised crime and mafias in the European Union – and because it calls for a special committee, the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor’s Office and the harmonisation of the Member States’ legislation. I also appreciate the fact that some of the proposals I made as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality have been accepted, for instance, the proposal to promote the role of associations of victims’ families and the establishment of a European forum, as well as the call for a holistic approach to people trafficking, especially child trafficking, and to illegal adoptions, not least in light of the recent European directive. I would like, however, to place a little more emphasis on the extent to which the text succeeds in showing that women and children make up the majority of direct or indirect victims, especially of crimes against the person, and that there must therefore be a specific, targeted commitment to support and protect women victims of crime and violence, including when they are witnesses or have dissociated themselves, especially from mafia and criminal families, and also to value their role when they commit themselves to a culture of legality. I would also like to mention the growing number of women involved in combating crime as judges, lawyers and police officers, and also as teachers trying to change the culture of our young people in this respect. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as I congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Gardini, and the Commissioner, I must say that I agree with the calls for European legislation, a bottom-up approach and a coordinating centre that draws on the best experience and the models of civil protection intervention used in the various Member States, bringing together expertise and voluntary resources, national coordinators and local bodies. I would like to refer to two points. Regarding the consolidation of 112 as the single emergency number in Europe, I would ask the Commission to carry out an active check, given that my country, for example, is moving towards further fragmentation of emergency numbers and the services that answer emergency calls. There are even two numbers for fires. Secondly, we should increase the part played by new technologies in the field of early warning and warning systems, for example, by supporting the roll-out of prototypes that the EU finances but which are not then taken up by the Member States. Lastly, in terms of the organisation of civil protection, I think it is also important to highlight the social changes that have occurred in the European population, which, to an increasing extent, is elderly, of foreign origin and concentrated in outlying areas where there is little infrastructure. Hence, there is a need to safeguard access and the possibility for this most vulnerable section of the population to be supported. Silvia Costa,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as everyone knows, being a woman is already an undertaking in itself, because it means having to manage and reconcile family, professional and social life, in a context that still does not adequately recognise the high level of education (as Commissioner Reding mentioned earlier), professionalism and expectations of women. I appreciate that in this report Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou has worked extremely hard to collect numerous proposals and objectives that, as a shadow rapporteur and member of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I advanced together with several of my colleagues. In the European Union women are under-represented, as they are in management positions in companies, currently making up only 12% of the membership of boards of directors of listed companies. Against this background we are happy to have heard the serious commitment of Commissioner Reding, and we call on the European Commission to propose legislation including mandatory quotas by 2012, to increase percentages to 30% by 2015 and to 40% by 2020, if the steps taken by companies and the Member States are found to be inadequate. In this regard it is an encouraging sign that six countries, including Italy in the last few days, have approved legislation along these lines with a bipartisan vote. I would like to clarify that these quotas are not just numerical, but also aim to achieve better performance in the corporate system, by sharing the management not just of large enterprises, but also of small and medium-sized enterprises. This is why we are proposing the use of several instruments under corporate social responsibility, including family-friendly services, flexi-time working arrangements, and management training for women. It is also important to recognise the link between the presence of competences and women’s roles in corporate governance with a different approach to process management, optimal use of human resources, anti-discrimination rules and sustainable productivity which they often guarantee. I would like to raise another point also in response to what Mr Bauer rightly said earlier, and that is that we have not merely just included female quotas, but we have also included an important mechanism, which was our own proposal, and that is that the joint presence of men and women is linked to greater transparency in appointments, in the selection of men and women, so that this is a benefit for everyone, not just for women. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Mr President, it is highly significant that Parliament is using this resolution to send a strong message to both the Member States and the younger generations to ask for greater commitment to European cooperation on learning, vocational training and higher education in order to bolster the Europe 2020 strategy. We know that youth unemployment has severe repercussions on poverty and social exclusion, as does the prolonged period of insecurity in which 40% of European young people live. Strong backing should be given to a combination of education policies and a new incentive-based welfare system for enterprises that provide full-time employment for young people and women. Ensuring that the skills being learned are in line with the competences – including for citizenship – required for the new goals of sustainable and intelligent growth is essential, as are policies for the transition from education to the workplace and speeding up the recognition of professional qualifications, titles and academic credits. Those Member States which, like my own, are cutting resources for education and research at a time of crisis must know that they are hurting young people, and hurting the future of Europe. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, in an ageing Europe that is struggling to find answers to the global challenges of the future, the European Union and its Member States must seize this strong stimulus from Parliament to demonstrate that they can be more courageous, investing in future generations, in education and in culture. With these four reports and the Sarajevo proposal, Parliament calls for these issues to be placed at the heart of the Europe 2020 strategy. In particular, the economic advantages, as well as those in employment and innovation, are highlighted by the report on cultural and creative industries, which already account for almost 3% of Europe’s gross product and employ 5 million people – a figure which rises to 7% if ancillary industries are taken into account. As shadow rapporteur for this measure for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists &amp; Democrats in the European Parliament, I am pleased to see that the rapporteur, Mrs Sanchez-Schmid, has welcomed our amendments. What did we propose? First of all, that cultural tourism and fashion should be added to the eight sectors already included. We also hope that the Commission – and I am sure that Mrs Vassiliou will take action to ensure this happens – will submit a White Paper on cultural and creative industries as soon as possible in order to strengthen this cross-sectoral strategy throughout Europe and the Member States. Cutting funds for culture and education at times of crisis – as my country is doing, on the grounds that culture is not essential to survival – means failing to invest in the future and in smart, inclusive growth; it means failing to understand that culture is essential for life. The report states that the European status of artists and of those engaged in creative professions should be officially recognised, and that in cultural industry, small and medium-sized enterprises should be fully recognised as such for the purposes of access to credit and support when starting up, especially for young people under the age of 35. It also promises to protect jobs, and to introduce specific training and innovative financial instruments, bearing in mind that capital in the creative sector often consists of values that are intangible but nonetheless crucial for innovation in all sectors. The Europe-wide cultural sector must be taken into consideration in the legal framework for international trade, certainly in the European dimension and in cultural diplomacy, in the internal market, in mobility … (The President cut off the speaker) Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, naturally, I wish to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur on this report which really signals a significant step forward in EU policies, in its invitation to the Commission to submit a proposal for a directive on the procedures to be adopted by Member States to recognise, and possibly revoke, international protection. I believe that the events of recent days between the African and European coasts indicate that we need the ‘asylum package’ – as it is to be called – to become a binding rule. In particular, I think of the positive amendments that were approved; for example, the whole question of greater safeguards with regard to minors, since I believe that children must not be detained under any circumstance (which is exactly what has been happening in Lampedusa, where children have been treated in exactly the same way as adults, together with adults, often in totally unacceptable conditions). It would have been better to have this directive in place before these dramatic events took place in Europe and Africa. Another very important issue is that of vulnerable people and their issues, especially women, and problems relating to family matters and reunions. Congratulations also to the rapporteur. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as some of my fellow Members have already said, I think that by voting in favour of this report by Mrs Svensson we are making a commitment to ensuring that the Commission fulfils its pledge to adopt a Communication, before the end of 2011, for the implementation of a strategy and a European action plan to combat violence against women, which will take a global view and therefore include all the different cases, from sexual violence to domestic violence and female genital mutilation, and – I hope – all the new forms of violence. I am referring to the actual inducement to violence, which is often carried out by advertising and the media, as well as the forms of blackmail and violations of women’s human rights that occur in the workplace when they decide they want to become mothers or are already working mothers. Following the implementation and adoption of the directive on trafficking in human beings – to which Parliament was very committed – and the directive on the European Protection Order, I think it would be important to have a proper directive on this issue within the new legal framework created by the Treaty of Lisbon and the Stockholm Programme. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Svensson. We know that violence against women and children is increasing across Europe. For this reason, we urge the Commission to submit a proposal, as it has already promised, for a strategy on violence against women by 2011. This should be all-inclusive, in the sense that it should cover domestic violence and genital mutilation, but also some more insidious forms. I am thinking of severe discrimination and bullying in the workplace against women who are pregnant or intend to marry and who are called on to resign beforehand, which is something that happens in my country but is no longer a crime as it was in the past. I am also thinking of what can only be described as the incitement to violence perpetrated by the media and advertising. After the directive on trafficking in human beings and the imminent directive on the victims of violence, announced by Commissioner Malmström, I think that the Treaty of Lisbon has laid the basis for achieving greater legal harmonisation in the way Member States acknowledge the importance of crimes of violence against women and children as specific forms of violence, as well as defining the essential standards of services for consulting, legal assistance and protection for women and children in cooperation with NGOs. It will also lead to consistent and comparable statistics with impact analyses of forms of prevention and enforcement by Member States to ensure a reduction in violence. I think, in this respect, that there is a common will by Parliament – I was one of the signatories to the written declaration – to define a year of reflection across Europe on the theme of violence, and I think that Parliament can add its very strong and very influential voice to this.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to ask my fellow MEP who spoke just now if it can really be considered appropriate to apply the terms ‘freeloaders’ and ‘fortune seekers’ to people who are fleeing from a situation of great political distress – and all the political groups agree on this – such as the one in North Africa. I find this to be an extremely serious allegation and call on the President to somehow highlight what has been said and establish whether this can be considered appropriate in such a sensitive debate that touches on the suffering of human beings, who are clearly not considered to have the right to eat, as it has been said of them ‘they even demand food and are lot of freeloaders’. I find it very serious that this has been said in this House and I hope that European citizens can read this extremely harsh utterance, which only serves to reveal the total political inadequacy of the person who said it. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteurs and I also dedicate this 8 March to the women of North Africa and the Middle East, such as the many women who, at this moment, are demonstrating in Cairo and Iran and fighting for democracy and liberty in their countries. In this respect, I hope that firm measures will be taken, including in the external actions of the European Commission, to establish links with these women. Even in Europe, there is a great reawakening of women’s participation, starting with demands to respect the dignity of women in the media and in the behaviour of men in institutions, as was said in town squares on 13 February by 1 million Italian women and many concerned men. As for the reports under discussion, I would note that there is a strong link between growing insecurity at work and in the lives of young women, even though they are better educated and more skilled, the inadequate protection of atypical female workers – which most young women are – during maternity and parenthood, the shortcomings of current policies for achieving balance and the lower rates of female employment, the more frequent instances of poverty among women and children, and the lower level of their pensions and, hence, their exclusion from decision-making powers. While I agree with Mrs Reding’s initiative concerning boards of directors, I am less supportive of the initiative on insurance which risks penalising women in particular. Without this, there will be no Europe 2020. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, I voted for this resolution because I believe that the compromise reached with such difficulty within our committee is essentially positive, insofar as it is a tool to remind Member States to ensure that pensions are adequate, sustainable and portable throughout Europe, in the context of a significantly ageing population. I would however like to make three criticisms, which I hope the European Commission will implement in the coming White Paper. The first is the lack of recognition of the importance of the third pillar in pension systems. Second, although the difference in retirement income between men and women resulting from the pay gap, breaks for periods of care and greater unemployment among women has been acknowledged, there are no flexibility criteria for women of retirement age who cease to be employed, and there is no adequate recognition of periods of care for the purpose of defining retirement age. This would, however, be desirable. Thirdly, European citizens’ right to a common programme of welfare education and information about their pension and insurance situation should be affirmed, in particular for young people and workers throughout the course of their working lives. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, during a stage in its life in which Europe is undergoing a crisis of identity and prospects, I think that the establishment of a European Heritage Label that identifies those sites – both material and immaterial – of high symbolic and educational value for the history, culture and creation of the European Union, is particularly significant. My sincere thanks go to the rapporteur, Mrs Paliadeli, who efficiently took on board the proposals and additions suggested by many of us in the Committee on Culture and Education, providing, in particular, for procedures that are more certain and more respectful of the Treaty of Lisbon with regard to the subdivision of tasks among Member States, the Commission, the Council and Parliament. As some of my fellow Members have picked up on, we also strove to make sure there was no overlap between the label and other initiatives of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) or the European Council’s historic and cultural itineraries. Indeed, on the basis of well-defined criteria, the Member States will present not more than two actively managed sites every two years. This is an important point: the Member States must show that they believe in the sites and therefore manage them in an educational way, involving the people. The Commission, meanwhile, will be responsible for pre-selection after hearing from a panel of experts, but it will also assume a monitoring role, will assess the effectiveness of the management of the sites every six years, and may also withdraw the label. Parliament comes out of this with a stronger role because not only does it appoint four of the 16 members of the European panel, but also because it has an active relationship with the list of pre-selected sites. I also support the solution provided to the complex problem of the marks already assigned on an intergovernmental basis to many Member States that, in any case, though not suitable for the new system and the new criteria, will retain their earlier mark and will not therefore be downgraded. I also appreciate the priority given to transnational sites, which will be a very interesting challenge for Europe, and the role assigned to the Committee of the Regions as part of an approach of subsidiarity, as well as the emphasis on the necessary involvement of Member States in the selection phase, including municipalities and regions, in order to avoid their being only partially involved. However, I think an extra effort by the Member States would also be useful. It would be very important for them to launch competitions aimed at young people in schools and universities to start a process to identify the sites, which would also become a way to reconstruct a common European history and destiny and mean that they, too, would contribute to the sense of belonging and European citizenship.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if this programme is brought to fruition today, it is thanks to the determination of Mrs Pack and the will of Commissioner Vassiliou. As an Italian-Swiss citizen, I am happy that Switzerland is the first country from outside the European Union to participate in EU education programmes for young people, both in higher education and continuing skills training. Indeed, let us remember that even if Switzerland is not part of the European Union, it has made a major contribution to building the values and freedoms that are a shared heritage of the European continent. It is a symptom of the success of programmes such as ‘Youth in Action’ that Switzerland requests that the mobility of our European programmes be extended to their young people and therefore, it is of significant importance that Switzerland is not only requesting a larger economic area but also a larger educational area. I believe that it will be very interesting for the young people of the European Union and Switzerland to get to know each other better, and I am sure that this will lay foundations that will also have an influence on the future of the European Union.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, through this proposal for a directive – for which I should like to express my great thanks to the rapporteurs, with whom I worked as a shadow – Parliament is supporting and expanding the Council’s proposal, which was designed to protect people across all 27 Member States who suffer forms of persecution or serious and repeated threats from known and previously identified persons – often ex-boyfriends, husbands or partners – who threaten their physical and sexual integrity, dignity and personal freedom. Indeed, the number of attacks and killings – particularly against women – is on the increase. Their complaints are often not taken seriously enough by the police and the judiciary, and protection orders and measures against the aggressor are currently only valid in the country in which they are issued. Commissioner Reding, the measure under approval may not be perfect, but it plugs a legislative vacuum. After all, in creating the European area of freedom, security and justice, we have always acted empirically, at times pushing matters through where necessary. Indeed, we believe that this initiative is important because it will allow all citizens of the European Union – men and women – and all European residents to travel freely across borders, taking their human rights and their rights to protection and security with them, as stated in Article 3 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which we in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament intended as the legal basis, in order to give a more coherent direction to the structure of the proposal. Through the establishment of the European Protection Order, the protected person is guaranteed to be looked after even in other Member States, through a fast and free-of-charge procedure. Each Member State must appoint a competent authority to inform victims of their rights, carry out campaigns, collect statistics and inform the person as soon as their national protection order has been issued. Furthermore, it gives a great boost to the creation of the European legal area and the implementation of freedom of movement, and it also applies the ordinary legislative procedure involving codecision between the Council and Parliament for the first time. I hope that the Council will confirm this commitment and I hope that the Commission – though showing particular attention to the coming ‘Security for Victims’ package of measures – does not miss this particular chance to respond right now to this extremely serious situation, which is also demonstrated by European and national statistics. Amongst other things, this could lead to important legal convergence among Member States. I would therefore suggest that we avoid any delays and make a specific commitment to this particular type of victim protection. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur, I should like to thank the rapporteurs and say that I think this directive is extraordinarily important because it is the first time that the European Union has taken legally binding action in the fight against the trafficking of human beings. Fifty years after the United Nations convention, there are still hundreds of thousands of people in our civilised Europe – mainly women and children – who are reduced to slavery. For the first time, the EU is equipped with a single instrument to fight against the trafficking of human beings, whether for reasons of sexual or labour exploitation, including forced begging. Our group had three priorities: to hit traffickers with uniform, more severe sanctions, including confiscating assets and using them to support the victims of trafficking; to ensure a high level of protection and social rehabilitation for victims, with free legal representation and immunity from prosecution for crimes committed in connection with being trafficked; and to promote the crucial role of the non-governmental organisations, both secular and religious, that work to support the victims. However, I am hoping for a revision of the 2004 directive on the resident permit for victims. I would also underline that in the proposal, we provide for the safeguarding of children through strengthened measures and I support Commissioner Malmström’s call for further measures against sex tourism and child pornography. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, I believe that Parliament has a great opportunity today to reiterate that motherhood is a social value, that the protection of a mother’s health and that of her child must be strengthened, that a female worker must not be discriminated against for being a mother in finding and keeping a job, and that childcare should be better shared with fathers. Notwithstanding the current crisis – as has already been highlighted – we must make the same observation which has already been made by the most advanced economists: the impact assessment which has been carried out shows the need for a more far-sighted and holistic approach. Today’s costs, which can potentially be staggered, are a social and economic investment in the greater well-being of children, fewer diseases and the greater participation of women in the labour market. Many claim that there will not be an increased and appropriately trained and qualified female workforce without a new welfare system and new opportunities to achieve a work-life balance: I fully agree with and thank the rapporteurs, Mrs Estrela and Mrs Plumb, for the complex work they have carried out, as I do all Members who have strived to find common ground. I also agree with the facility which, I believe, many of us wanted, and which will provide mothers of disabled children, and in the case of adoptions and multiple births, with greater opportunities to have flexible working hours, the reversal of the burden of proof against breaches of the law and greater protection from dismissal. Furthermore, I proposed, together with other Members, that with respect to the compulsory six weeks’ leave following childbirth, a safeguard clause be provided for those countries where legislation provides this compulsory period prior to childbirth too. In conclusion, I hope that now, over these two days, we will be willing to find common ground so that we do not miss the important opportunity to adopt this directive in this parliamentary term as well.

 Mr President, I should like to express my support for maintaining the European Social Fund’s own budget and rules, albeit with a view to its greater integration with all the other Structural Funds. However, the rules need to be revised in at least five areas: we need more simplification and more monitoring of results and not just of procedures; we need to really make the most of experience such as that gained in the Italian regions over the last two years, to offer integrated packages of guidance, training, retraining and support to help integrate workers who have been made redundant or who are unemployed into SMEs; we need to promote training partnerships between educational training institutions, universities and businesses in order to provide opportunities for continuous training that take into account the need for new skills; we need more transnational projects, which, until now, have only been experimental; and we need more national and transnational work-study initiatives for young people. I believe that it is on the basis of these points, among others, that we need to reconsider the prospect of introducing new rules for the European Social Fund. Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, through this debate – which frankly I was hoping would be rather better attended, because it deserves far greater participation – Parliament is seeking to add its voice to that of so many others around the world who have come out in recent days against the tragic death sentence by stoning for Sakineh Mohammadi-Ashtiani, after the appeal by her son Sajad, and to save all the other women sentenced to death or unjustly imprisoned, like Zahra Bahrami, in summary trials in Iran. In this age of globalisation, it is even more obvious that human rights and women’s rights are inseparable. If a woman dies after being tortured by stoning, our consciences and our freedoms will be stoned with her. In our resolution, we urge both the European Union’s High Representative, Catherine Ashton, and the Commissioner for Human Rights, Viviane Reding – two powerful women – without further delay, to take all necessary steps with the Iranian Government and in international forums for the death sentence for Sakineh to be rescinded, for Zahra to be released, for the barbaric practice of stoning to be abandoned, and for renewed efforts to be made in the battle to achieve a moratorium on the death sentence and also to support the democratic opposition in Iran. We, the Italian female Members in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, together with all our fellow Members, are holding a candlelight vigil tomorrow evening here in the courtyard of the European Parliament in Strasbourg. We are calling it ‘A light for Sakineh’s life’, and we ask all Members to take part so that darkness does not fall over this tragic, highly symbolic affair and so that the Iranian people and the Iranian opposition are not abandoned. We are calling for more robust intervention from the Union because we believe that the defence of human rights, here and around the world, is an area where the European Union’s credibility and identity are at stake.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteurs – whom I thank – have raised a key issue, which Commissioner Reding has also addressed in part. We must ensure that policies for women and for equal opportunities are incorporated and integrated more effectively into general policies at European and national level alike. I am thinking of the crisis, poverty, development, cooperation, employment and welfare. I believe, however, that there are three issues that should be emphasised by the Commission, by us in our work and by the Member States. Firstly, I would like Commissioner Reding to emphasise the role of women in the European Union’s external action. A new policy of which women must be made more aware is contained in Mrs Figueiredo’s report. The second issue is that of the Commission’s support for the draft directive on the European Protection Order, which is a tool of fundamental importance for guaranteeing the … (The President cut off the speaker) Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 10 years since the introduction of the Lisbon Strategy and on the eve of the Europe 2020 strategy, in the middle of a full economic, social and employment crisis, we know that we cannot come out of this crisis, nor lay the foundations for new and sustainable growth and a new social cohesion, as you have said, unless we strengthen the mechanisms and instruments that the European Union has at its disposal to sustain investment in the knowledge triangle: education, training and research. Just now, Commissioner, you confirmed that as regards this objective, some European governments are performing well, others a little less so. In order not to fall within the limits revealed by the Lisbon Strategy, I believe that in this area, the Commission has to strengthen the open method of coordination with Member States, provide incentives and penalties in the European Social Fund and monitor the results. I do not consider it to be consistent for governments, as the Italian Government has done, to cut EUR 8 billion in three years from education and the universities, without reinvesting the savings in these areas, especially as we have a 19% early school leaving rate and 25% youth unemployment. In conclusion, do you not consider it opportune to strengthen the legal powers in Directive 2005/36/EC to facilitate the mutual recognition of professional qualifications among Member States? According to Professor Monti’s report, currently, less than 3% of European workers in fact work in another Member State, and one of the reasons seems to be precisely this difficult issue of mutual recognition of qualifications.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Beijing +15 is confronted this year with a financial, economic and employment crisis that is having a negative impact on the living and working conditions of millions of women throughout Europe and the world, but which may represent an opportunity to review development models, the organisation of the labour market and social policies. In strengthening the Beijing +15 objectives, the European Union must prioritise, on behalf of women, policies for providing access to environmental resources and credit, including by means of micro-finance; the balance between family life and work life, including by means of the adoption of the directive on parental leave; training policies and incentives for businesses that employ young people and women; and the fight against trafficking in human beings with a new directive, which we hope will be based on the resolution approved during the last part-session in Strasbourg. Above all, we must focus development cooperation support on the empowerment of women in the poorest countries, and in African countries in particular, building a possible Euro-African alliance with the women. It would be good – I am addressing the Commissioner and the President here – if the European delegation in New York promoted and gained support for the campaign to award the Nobel Peace Prize to the women of Africa, symbolically represented by the leaders of associations active in those countries worst affected by conflicts and poverty.

Madam President, Commissioner Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is very important for the European Parliament to take the opportunity offered by this debate with a view to the March elections in Iraq. The Iraqi political process has shown itself to be important – even if, as you were saying, interesting – but still very fragile. It is thus even more important to do everything possible to consolidate and strengthen the country’s new institutions and the political equilibrium which sustains them. We believe this to be a vital objective if we wish the first substantial withdrawal of US troops to occur in August without it having serious consequences on the country’s internal situation. The coexistence of Shi’ites, Sunnis and Kurds which is today embodied in the federal structures should be guaranteed by new laws, as well as by a political consensus involving all these parties. On this point, concerns are being aroused – and we would also like your view on this – by the electoral commission’s recent decision to bar many candidates and parties with close links to Sunnis or Christians, thus running the risk of weakening the already fragile democratic process in Iraq. Through the measures undertaken, the European Union must follow this electoral process, as you have said, but also be more ambitious in the development of relations with Iraq. The Union’s EUJUST LEX programme directly involves us in the process of improving Iraqi legislation and democratic institutions, and we, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, consider it a positive sign that the Council has decided to extend the mission until 30 August 2010. The EU should continue to maintain strong support for Iraq through its cooperation programmes, with the aim of participating in the process to stabilise and develop the country, and after the elections, it should strengthen relations between the parliaments. It should be remembered that many Member States are working with Iraq, including Italy, with the important cultural cooperation programme. Iraq’s political equilibrium is essential not only for the country but also in terms of the role that Iraq can play in the region strategically, with the aim of overcoming existing conflicts and securing peace. In this sense, the improvement of relations with Turkey by the regional government of Kurdistan constitutes a positive step in that direction. However, as we know, Iraq remains a country with very serious problems in relation to security, respect for democracy and human rights, as well as economic insecurity. It is the most vulnerable groups, such as refugees – forming 10% of the population – ethnic minorities, women, religious minorities and children who are suffering the negative impact of this situation. We must therefore play a still more incisive role in this area – I am just finishing – partly through support for local and European NGOs working in Iraq and, in this regard, women can also be involved as strategic figures to overcome some of the population’s difficulties.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my great satisfaction that today we are tackling a subject like this with an important question, for which I warmly thank the authors, and I would also like to express my gratitude for the high level of cooperation that we have seen between all the political parties and the two committees. I am also very happy to have heard very serious commitments voiced by the Commission and also by the Spanish Presidency, and I truly hope that the new directive will soon be drafted along the lines that essentially seem to enjoy a large consensus. I think we know that the numbers in this field are very complex to analyse, but in brief, we are talking about almost 300 000 people, 79% of them women, many of them minors, being trafficked every year in our civilised Europe. Unfortunately, numbers have been rising in recent years. For this reason, too, we need to make very strong progress in the light of the new areas of responsibility that the European Union has and also in the light of what we have already approved in the Stockholm Programme to bring in some innovations. It was a great step forward when we approved, at EU level, the provision – which, for example, had already been in force in Italy since 1998 – allowing humanitarian residence permits to be issued to victims. However, we must also make progress on safeguarding victims in relation to protection, social and employment reintegration, the possibility of preventing there being customers – which we must think very seriously about – and more serious and effective measures on sanctions which must, as you said, Commissioner, be harmonised at EU level. In particular, we ask that the consent of victims to their exploitation be considered irrelevant, in view of the high level of blackmail involved in these circumstances. I will conclude very shortly, just adding this: we need not only special protection for minors but, above all, also forms of support for persons arriving in Europe who have already previously suffered forms of trafficking along the journeys, ever longer and ever more tragic, that they complete before reaching our coasts and our territories.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it would be very important for 2010, the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, to mark the birth of a new Community financial instrument, dedicated to microfinance, aimed at those who are disadvantaged in accessing the banking system but who have micro-enterprise plans. As we are aware, micro-credit has proved to be an extraordinary tool for creating self-entrepreneurship opportunities and widespread social value in developing countries, particularly for women. It has become a new strategy of the United Nations and of the World Bank, but it has also been trialled with positive results in many countries, in many European Member States, including Italy, particularly for immigrants, women and young people. By adopting this report, Parliament is providing, in the midst of a serious economic and financial crisis, not only a strategic opportunity for social inclusion but also a positive challenge to the banking system, since it is developing a new approach and new powers, in collaboration with non-profit bodies and local and national institutions. I welcome the adoption of many amendments, which I will not go over again, but I would like to say that today we are asking not just for micro-credit resources, but we are also asking that micro-credit … (The President cut off the speaker) Silvia Costa  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to dedicate this International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women to the memory of Anna Politkovskaya, a journalist and a woman who paid for her love of truth with her life, to the African women in conflicts, and to the many forms of suffering of women in Europe that often go unobserved. These examples are at odds with the degraded and consumerist image that the media often attaches to female identity, helping to create a culture where women are oppressed and humiliated. This is also a serious form of violence against which Europe must speak out and intervene in. We must urgently set up a consistent European system for statistical recording – it has been said more than once – with particular reference to minors, trafficking, physical and sexual violence, and women in vulnerable categories, such as immigrants. Yet we would also like to see tangible results from the European Union guidelines on women in armed conflict, which the Commissioner also mentioned previously, at least through the provision of financial and other support for projects, often organised by small associations, local NGOs, including in countries concerned with reintegrating and assisting women who are victims of violence. We are aware that today, we have a new possibility, as offered by the Treaty of Lisbon and the Stockholm Programme, to enshrine this preventive action within the Community. However, we must also denounce another aspect of violence: the context in which violence takes place. Alcohol- and drug-related violence is growing among young people and minors, and perhaps we do not mention this often enough when we discuss violence against women.Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me first thank Mr Leichtfried for this document. It is important because it provides better definition of the interinstitutional relations between Parliament and the Commission on an extremely sensitive question: Parliament’s powers have been extended in the area of trade, which was not part its competences under the ordinary legislative procedure. There is therefore a fundamental problem, not with the Regulations we are amending today, which are being adapted to a new regime, but in terms of the relations between the European Parliament and the Commission. In this regard, although I welcome Mr Leichtfried’s report, I am not at all pleased with the views expressed by the Commissioner in this House. The relationship between Parliament and the Commission is still overly technical. There is an evident and continuous effort by the Commission and the Council to reduce relations with the European Parliament to their pre-Lisbon level and we cannot allow this to happen. Limiting the powers of the Commission is an important step that should result in more parliamentary control and make the Commission act in a more focused manner. Only in this way can we respond to the problems raised by Mr Salvini: I completely agree that the EU’s exclusive competence in the area of trade policy should be maintained, and that the EU’s power should be increased over that of the individual Member States. However, we must also be stronger within the World Trade Organisation, in the knowledge that unless we pay more attention to the real economy, we will never emerge from the current crisis. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that on your travels around Europe in this difficult period – especially given your competencies in some key areas at this time of crisis – you will have had a chance to ‘see for yourself’ the situation in which Europe finds itself. I say this because the last thing I would like in the present case is to find myself agreeing with Mr Salvini. We must be aware of the situation we face: we know that China represents a great opportunity, and not simply great problem. It represents an opportunity for those enterprises that export EUR 170 billion worth of goods to China each year, although we also import EUR 250 billion and are only too aware that this represents a trade deficit. However, if we do not introduce strict and exact rules on fair trade, we will end up by fuelling and increasing the wave of anti-European sentiment against the EU institutions. What else do we need to say or do to make you understand in that ivory tower that is the European Commission what kind of situation we are facing? These continuous sermons on innovation and development mean very little to the sector we are dealing with here, which is at the cutting edge in terms of innovation and development! So all of you, and all of the gnomes that live inside the offices of the Commission, cannot but be aware that the timetables that you are proposing do not do justice to Europe and the problems we are facing! I think that you should make an effort to understand that for the largest economic power in the world to impose the rules of fair trade simply means enhancing its own dignity, showing that it understands how to live within the great global village of the present with a sense of dignity. Currently Europe is not managing to do this in a way that benefits its citizens. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, nobody in this Parliament is in any doubt that the importance of the measure that we will be voting this evening goes well beyond the specific issue we are discussing. I have always considered myself to be a friend of Israel and I personally have no doubt that the conflict that has pitted a large part of the Arab world against Israel for decades is due mainly – if not exclusively – to the fact that too many in the Arab world do not want to recognise the right of the State of Israel to exist. Having said that, however, we must also strongly condemn the repeated violations of international law and of the agreements signed by the Israeli Government, which have led to a downward spiral that Israel should – precisely because it claims to be the only democracy in the Middle East – make a definite effort to end. We therefore request that this report be referred back to the Committee on International Trade and be shelved until Israel takes decisive steps towards dismantling its settlements in illegally occupied Palestinian territory and until it shows more respect for the Palestinian people’s right to exist. Such signals can be encouraged by a more effective European Foreign policy in the area, which today is altogether lacking. Despite the fact that I am not voting in favour of the measure, I believe that Parliament should at least support the amendments by Mr Moreira, Ms De Keyser and Ms Schaake, aimed at preventing the extension of the advantages for Israel under this measure to products originating from the unlawfully Occupied Territories. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I voted in favour of this proposal on trade and economic relations between the EU and the United States, in part because of the important, balanced and complete report drawn up by Mr Moreira, for which I thank him. The proposal offers us a complete framework of the commercial and economic prospects and of the difficulties and challenges involved in the meeting of the two main world economies that together account for about half of global economic output and nearly a third of world trade flows. After many years of deadlock, we are now approaching a possible turnaround in bilateral relations, with the prospect of a far-reaching agreement between Europe and the United States that could open up positive scenarios for transatlantic relations. Naturally there are questions relating to tariff barriers, and an agreement of this scope would have to aim to remove the many trade and technical barriers that unfortunately persist. It would also deal with other important issues, such as the protection of indications of origin, the opening up of the public procurement markets and harmonisation of rules of origin and regulatory standards, including health and plant protection standards, where there is still too much divergence. However, this in no way detracts from the steps being taken. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution before Parliament is an important policy document taking account of the ambitions and concerns that European manufacturers have for some time held with regard to a country that is both a great opportunity for our economy and a great problem. The EU and Japan together represent more than a third of world GDP and more than 20 % of world trade. These figures alone give us an idea of the importance of the upcoming negotiations. I would have preferred Japan to send out stronger signals than it has done, in my opinion. The most important question remains the removal of the numerous non-tariff barriers (NTBs) by the Japanese as well as regulatory barriers that cannot merely be ascribed to cultural differences. Such removal should be seen as a precondition for reaching a mutually balanced and mutually advantageous agreement. The outcomes on public procurement and the automotive sector seem particularly decisive for a successful conclusion to negotiations. Japan should open up its market to the same extent as the EU in a spirit of real reciprocity, in particular with regard to NTBs in the automotive sector such as the ‘zoning regulations’ and special fiscal treatment for ‘key cars’.
 The question of indications of origin for agro-food products including wines and spirits is also important. Parliament should also ensure that it is continuously informed on the progress of negotiations and that the Commission carry out a second assessment of the impact of a possible free trade agreement with Japan, in particular with regard to more sensitive sectors such as the automotive and electronics industries. This is the only manner in which to provide proper protection to European manufacturing sectors at a time of crisis without compromising our commitment to free, sustainable and fair trade.

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Leichtfried, the negotiations on the trade agreement with Colombia, Peru and Central America and the corresponding stabilisation mechanisms and safeguard clauses have kept many of us and the Committee on International Trade very busy. We are in favour of the proposed regulations because they secure a balance between various demands, all of them referring back to the principles of free trade, attending to Union interests, and international trade as a tool for growth and development based on environmental sustainability and respect for human rights. In particular, these regulations are designed to protect European companies and consequently the workers they employ – our farmers – especially those in the outermost regions of the European Union. The safeguards and stabilisation mechanisms are effective for a limited time only, and we believe that the time period suggested is long enough for us to adapt our production system to the liberalisation measures included in the agreements and also for the countries in question to increase their exports considerably. That is why we voted in favour. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D
).  
– (IT) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on this issue, there should have been a more respectful approach towards the prerogatives of Parliament, towards the need to avoid a confused agreement which tends to regulate matters that are, in themselves, too diverse. I will be voting against the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) not because I am convinced that the fundamental rights of the Union are truly being violated to the core, but because counterfeiting and online piracy cannot be fought with the same weapons, almost as if counterfeiting a handbag or a drug is similar to downloading a song or a film from the Internet. I am against ACTA because the Commission and the Council hitherto have not yet regulated in a credible way an issue that is so very much in the limelight in the digital age, such as the protection of intellectual property on the web. I am opposed because current legislation would already enable action to be taken against those countries that make a living out of counterfeiting. I conclude by reiterating my opposition to an agreement that touches on highly sensitive issues, but does so in an inefficient, confused way, lacking a legal framework that is the only thing which would allow me to do anything other than vote against, as I shall be doing tomorrow. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, while we appreciate the care with which they were formulated, your answers only partly give us peace of mind. We are facing a highly political issue, not just a commercial one: formal consistency between this agreement and the more general association agreement with Israel cannot justify the sort of subterfuge that facilitates infringing the prohibition that international law has imposed on Israel regarding products made in the occupied territories. I understand our economic interests, I also understand the technical scope of this protocol, but I believe the European Union should undertake a careful review of the origin of the products, because no protocol or agreement can ignore the more general context which prevails today. The repeated violations on this point by Israel do not help the process of détente which we all feel is required and which needs the European Union to be an active part of the solution.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to explain my vote also in relation to Ms Ferreira’s report, because it seems to me that it is the right time to overcome the contradiction between growth and austerity, which is at risk of becoming outdated. Today, we have spoken in favour of growth and, at the same time, in favour of recovery. There is a contradiction when we say that we do not want to adopt a report like Mr Gauzès’s, on which I abstained for reasons I will explain, and then at the same time we call for a consolidated European budget and fiscal union. We need fiscal union, we need to monitor the budgets of Member States and, at the same time, encourage growth with the amendments we have presented and voted for in Ms Ferreira’s report. I therefore believe that we have done something important. We have done it even though Mr Gauzès’s report contains an article – Article 10 – which sends a negative message to the markets, as it concerns controlled default procedures, which we should not even talk about at the moment because we have to show the European public that we want to move forward with the euro and with greater integration.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the prudence with which the Commission is looking at the new system of relations between the first and the fourth largest economies in the world is a comfort to us. Deep underlying reasons, based on the history of our times, push for relations between the democracies of Europe and of the Rising Sun, based on the desire for friendship, development and the opening up of new opportunities. We cannot, however, overlook the fact that, amid all the distrust caused by long-term antagonism and by resentments that have not yet fully died down, the history of a system of relations in the name of multipolarity, overcoming the hegemony of the United States, is pushing us into new partnerships with the Far East. This has led to new forms of cooperation between China and Japan, shifting the balance that has become established since the Second World War and which must not be used against the European Union. The new set-ups which are being introduced at global level and in the major regions of the world thus require the European Union to be an enterprising key player, both by strengthening the multilateral approach and through bilateral relationships that will help Europe strengthen its competitiveness. For these political and economic reasons, we fully support your efforts to create conditions that will improve the system of relations between ourselves and Japan. However, we are not willing to begin negotiations unless the Council first involves Parliament in drafting the negotiating mandate. Although, formally, Parliament has the power to conclude the negotiation process by ratifying, or otherwise, any treaties that have been signed, it is equally true that parliaments throughout the world, due to their democratic legitimacy, have always been involved in drawing up the policies that underlie negotiating mandates. Europe needs to follow not only the letter but also the spirit of the treaties, so we call upon the Council, in this as in other cases, to duly take this into account. Finally, acknowledging the words of the Commissioner, we stress that it is imperative that Japan prove it wishes to break down tariff and especially non-tariff barriers that still dominate its domestic market. It is not therefore our intention to impede negotiations, but to assume responsibility for the growing demand within European public opinion, which fears that bringing together an open internal market such as ours with the increasingly closed markets of our main competitors will, in the end, damage our competitiveness and, with it, growth and employment. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are duty bound to acknowledge the positive elements in the Commission proposal on which, following the improvements proposed by the Committee on International Trade (INTA), we will be asked to vote. However, from a methodological point of view, I honestly do not agree with concluding at first reading a matter that will only become effective from 2014 onwards, and which divests Parliament of the power to exert its full potential on such an important issue. Looking at the substance, I believe that the positive elements in the new regulation are not fully compensated by the persistence of negative issues that adversely affect the interests of industrial sectors that have already been severely tested in Europe by a globalisation governed neither by multilateral rules nor by reciprocity. One positive aspect, however, is the new geographical coverage owing to the principle of differentiation, which provides a boost for the poorest nations. Equally useful is the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance, known as ‘GSP+’, linked to the implementation of the main international conventions on social, human and environmental rights. Also positive is the safeguard clause for the entire textile and clothing sector, as well as the general clause. However, the loosening of the financial criteria for the beneficiaries of the GSP+ regime and the exclusion from the graduation mechanism of nations that come under this scheme actually opens the door to unfair competition in relation to already heavily affected sectors, as I said, and gives priority to countries such as Pakistan, whose violations in the field of human rights must not be approved. In short, there is no doubt that this is a positive regulation, but the issues I mention cast a shadow over other aspects that we wished to consider. Gianluca Susta,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we speak of trade relations between China and the European Union, we evoke relationships which, on many occasions, have affected the course of history, as the pendulum has swung between East and West. The pendulum appears now to be firmly in the East. Europe seems to be labouring in China’s wake, as our second trading partner has seen its exports rise by 39.5% in just under two years. It is our loss if we view China only as a source of problems, as certain nationalist and protectionist elements on the political right have been trying to portray it for years, and not also as an opportunity. In the 21st century, however, the greatest world economies can work together only in an atmosphere of reciprocity, compliance with the rules, and intolerance of illegality, of unfair practices and of discrimination, to which we have grown accustomed after a great many absolutely unacceptable episodes. It is understandable that the pendulum of history is now swinging in favour of emerging countries. It is right that we open our markets. However, the Chinese Government has a number of unacceptable policies: protecting its country’s businesses while leaving our companies’ intellectual property inadequately safeguarded; the proliferation of technical barriers, sometimes much more burdensome than tariff barriers; keeping a closed procurement market; and an almost total disregard for the most basic social and human rights, as the oppression in Tibet shows. In the European Union, terms like ‘reciprocity’ and ‘traceability’ – which recall others, now long forgotten, like ‘transparency’ and ‘quality’ – must become a precondition for every trade agreement and every legislative initiative within the framework of a renewed multilateral policy. It is our duty, therefore, to keep our market open while protecting the Union’s interest from outside protectionism – from China and elsewhere – by demanding adequate quality standards for the goods and services available in the European Union market. This report addresses these matters with clarity, describes important solutions, and is heading in the right direction. It will therefore have our support. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I thank Mr Rinaldi for his broad-ranging report, which is worthy of support in political terms, and packed with ideal aims and practical proposals that will undoubtedly be looked upon with renewed hope by the people living on the shores of the Mediterranean after the revolutions that have taken place in their countries. We need a change of pace and a return to the spirit of the Barcelona Declaration in order to overcome the fragmentation characterising trade relations between the European Union and the Mediterranean countries. Only a short-sighted view of the EU’s strategic role could consider that a policy of greater integration with the countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean contradicts the EU’s western vocation. Trade governed by a balanced new free trade agreement could also represent an instrument of stability in a region criss-crossed by uprisings that have not yet perfected an approach to democracy, which also involves reducing inequality, strengthening production, better protection for civil and social rights, and commitment to avoiding Islamic fundamentalist tendencies. Of course, this does not just depend on us, on the European Union. It also depends on the tremendous difficulties of cooperation and integration experienced by the countries on the southern shores. However, to paraphrase a great writer, if the Mediterranean becomes a project once again rather than a state of affairs, together we can overcome the current political and economic obstacles that have prevented a good agreement being reached in the past. We need an EU initiative towards the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, to hold more in-depth talks about legislation with all countries in order to eliminate the excessive number of tariff and non-tariff barriers, and to open their markets up towards reciprocity, which means that a larger amount of aid must be tied to greater commitment on the part of our partners. In conclusion, I can only repeat my appreciation of this report and trust that the Commission will make it a priority objective of its political and administrative agenda. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the goals of the agreement are all highly commendable and it should therefore be adopted. However, we cannot forget the big social question that cuts across this sector: a trade that improves the quality of its product, offers fair prices and develops the industry cannot fail to bring about an improvement in the economic status and living conditions of 5.5 million smallholders and the 14 million workers who depend on cocoa production. Since the European cocoa industry is the biggest in the world, we must urge our processing companies to commit to fighting the exploitation of children and for a sustainable and fair cocoa supply chain. That is what this resolution sets out to achieve and that is why it deserves our support. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Mr President, the political importance of the convention under discussion today will be clear to everyone. The European Union is well consolidated, but a further process of integration within the confines of Europe and between Europe and the rest of the world on its borders is a prerequisite for strengthening this region in the new global balance of power. Once again, a modern framework for trade relations may be a useful point of compromise between those who believe that Europe should primarily have an Atlantic vocation and those who believe that a new balance of power in the Mediterranean is essential for building a democratic future for Europe. This convention brings together in an improved multilateral, if interregional, logic, all the different positions currently in force concerning the origin of goods traded with the participants in the Barcelona Process, the EFTA States, the Faroe Islands and all of the Balkan States participating in the Stabilisation and Association Process. By adopting a legal instrument of this kind, it will be easier in the future to have recourse to the pan-Euro-Mediterranean system of cumulation of origin, and therefore agree on preferential tariff treatment for Mediterranean goods, although the absence of a review clause and uniform provisions for the settlement of disputes must be lamented. Precisely for this reason, the convention may be an important element to help revive a process which began in Barcelona almost 20 years ago and to which various initiatives refer, some more convincing and effective than others, but all of them important, such as the Union for the Mediterranean, the trade road map agreed under the framework of that process. Ours is an ambitious goal, but a slow-moving one due to the imbalances that are still too strong between the two shores of the Mediterranean, the political instability that is still crossing the Middle East – which requires greater effort from the European Union to push Israel to respect the international agreements on the Occupied Territories – and on account of the uncertainties linked to the evolution of the Arab Spring in North Africa. These are all major outstanding issues, which require a strong political and diplomatic initiative from the European Union. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, the relevance to the EU of this agreement is more than just that of farmers in the south, although this is of course important. The southern shore of the Mediterranean will not develop peacefully or democratically if we retreat into autarchical nostalgia which could encourage the spread of anti-European sentiment on the African continent. Of course it would have been preferable to pursue a multilateral approach with the countries of North Africa, in order to avoid future inequalities. Nevertheless this agreement appears to be balanced. It does not threaten many of our traditional products. Quota restrictions on six out of the fifteen most sensitive products exported by Morocco will remain. New opportunities are opening up for some of our products and for those to which total liberalisation will apply. Finally, the safeguarding clause offers an additional protective mechanism in the event of serious damage. It is true, ladies and gentlemen, that this agreement does not resolve the ancestral issue of the Saharawi people. Every trade agreement needs to be accompanied by a courageous political initiative on the part of the EU to promote the values of liberty and justice in the world. However we cannot use the tragedy of the Saharawi people to safeguard a few individual sectoral economic interests. We can and must have the farsightedness of a trade policy vision that looks beyond its own immediate requirements – a vision that this agreement allows us to catch a glimpse of, and therefore I will vote for it.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of this report because, in these difficult times, a free and fair trading system based on principles of reciprocity and harmonisation within an enhanced multilateral framework is a fundamental prerequisite for development. We need to bring down customs duties, non-tariff barriers and protectionism, which is still too widespread, and not only in emerging countries. These are the most serious obstacles to creating an effective international trading system. Europe should be more aware of its role and should use its democratic, social, open model of political union to achieve stronger multilateral cooperation and bilateral agreements that are balanced, sustainable and respectful of civil and social rights. Europe, ladies and gentlemen, should play its role with authority, so as to eliminate distortions of competition by the main global players, and it should maintain the Generalised System of Preferences only to help lift the least-developed countries out of poverty. Such an approach will benefit our producers, workers and entrepreneurs, as well as those who look to Europe as a model for greater freedom and social justice in the world. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Mr President, as well as seeking to remedy its mistakes, Europe must also start investing in its future again. We have set ourselves an ambitious target: 75% employment for the 20-64 age group by 2020. However, just as it is inconceivable that only public expenditure will drive new investment for growth, there will be no new jobs if we do not stimulate private investment in innovative sectors and youth hiring; if more training - better training - is not carried out; if budget, fiscal, pensions and welfare policies are not harmonised across the EU; and if the labour market is not made to be more flexible, making contract negotiations more in tune with and proximate to the needs of businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, while also respecting fundamental rights. My vote in favour of the report by Ms Bastos is an act of faith in the EU institutions and in their ability – albeit late in the day – to pull the leading world economy out of the crisis without distorting the European social model. At the same time, however, the institutions must succeed in releasing the hidden energy reserves in Europe’s economy, which are hindered from reaching their potential and contributing to the much-needed growth of the European economy and the resolution of the sovereign debt crisis by bureaucratic inflexibility, the labour market and dumping within Europe.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we could sum up our debate by saying that, while Athens is weeping, Sparta is not rejoicing, in the sense that both Europe and the United States are going through a serious crisis, and both are struggling to come up with the solutions needed to overcome the crisis. The world is certainly sending some undesirable signals with regard to the approach we must take in order to relaunch the economy, with our focus being mainly on regulating the financial markets and, to a lesser extent, on the possibilities of developing the global economy. We have to move away from the debate between those in favour of economic rigour and those who support growth, because Europe and the rest of the world need rigour in the management of their public debt and public resources, but they also need to grow, and we need to be seriously concerned about the protectionist signals coming from the United States, from Argentina, from Brazil, with the introduction of new taxes, and from parts of the world such as the Mercosur countries, which are facing difficulties today. We must therefore pay a great deal of attention and understand that the world markets have to be extended, safeguarded and broadened, and that we have to eliminate barriers in order to encourage growth. Mr Caspary’s proposal was very interesting, and I think that as part of the logic of opening up world markets, we should have a far-reaching Marshall Plan, a new Marshall Plan for developing countries, so that they can compete with the major players that compete with us. On the same day that the House rejected President Obama’s plan containing the ‘Buy American’ provisions – which we oppose – the United States Senate passed a law on the issue of the yuan and the strengthening of the yuan against the dollar. These are also measures which must be seen in the context of a new way of managing world monetary policy. Alongside an open global trading policy, we need to safeguard EU interests, and we also need a new Bretton Woods agreement to define the world’s monetary framework. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of this package, despite the instructions of my group. I believe that in a seriously critical moment like this, the most important thing that Europe can do is to react with urgency to a demand that comes from its citizens. I therefore believe that this package does not go far enough, but it is absolutely necessary to continue down this road, strengthening the instruments of growth but bringing budgets under control and increasing regulation in order to enable development to be managed. Consequently, I think tomorrow is an important day for focusing on what has made the European Union the most important democratic institution at this time. Certainly, much remains to be done, but this is an important initial response, and we could not miss the opportunity, after years of discussion in which we failed to tackle the greatest crisis in our lifetime with the necessary urgency and firmness.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the future of our trade policy coincides with the future of European competitiveness itself. For years, we have justifiably pursued a policy of opening up our market – and perhaps we have been more generous to others than to ourselves – but the slowdown in the Doha Round, the resurgence of protectionist measures by several partners, including strategic ones, and the enterprise shown by emerging countries must lead us to reconsider the way in which we Europeans want to relate to the world. In this context, words like ‘reciprocity’ and ‘protecting European interests’ must become the litmus test to show whether what we are doing is right. We have to play a leading role and not a supporting one in seeking to conclude the Doha Round with a well-balanced global agreement, which is an essential condition for arriving at a free-trade agreement that really opens up the markets and, above all, creates equal opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises. Trade policy and economic governance go hand in hand in this world, and we are therefore calling for a new financial system and a new monetary and exchange rate policy, as well as a redefinition of trade protection measures.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, no one can deny the importance of closer trade relations between the European Union and Taiwan. Yet, surely they must be aware of the well-known and delicate question, which the Commissioner also mentioned, of institutional relations between the countries officially known as the Republic of China and the People’s Republic of China, with whom the European Union and all the Member States maintain steady diplomatic relations. Furthermore there is no doubt that the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement signed in 2010 between Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China will help to overcome the consequences of the territorial and political separation of ‘One China’ and will facilitate better trade discipline between the European Union and Taiwan. Trade relations between us and the fourteenth largest global trade partner, the European Union’s seventh largest trade partner, can only improve, even though they require new regulations to eliminate the current barriers, in particular non-tariff and linguistic barriers, of a market that is still locked in the multilateral framework of the World Trade Organisation, which Taiwan has been a member of since 2002. As I have already mentioned, however, the principle difficulties concern relations with the People’s Republic of China. While we must address the issue of maintaining a dialogue with all parties, yet politically recognise a ‘One China’, we must ensure that the two Chinas do not turn the current triangular trade into veritable triangulation which could put the European Union at a trade disadvantage, as has already happened with other East Asian trade partners such as Korea.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, almost 10 years have passed since the Doha Round began. In two months’ time we will be marking its 10-year anniversary, but it has still not achieved any results. The global setting has changed profoundly. Countries which were considered to be developing countries have now become emerging countries, and today those countries are emerging even to the point where they are able to put themselves forward as saviours of the European Union or of certain Member States. The rules of global trade need to be rewritten. Trade still has extraordinary potential to promote growth, better distribute wealth around the world and rebalance the North and South of the world. Within the multilateral framework, all of this has remained unchanged, but we need the chance to renew reciprocity between countries too, and we also need to launch and contribute a new process to strengthen democracy within the World Trade Organisation which is unable to function properly in its current form.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, any initiative that aims to promote our real economy at a time of serious crisis like the present must be thoroughly welcomed, especially when its goal is to make our businesses more competitive on the global market. I am grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Jadot, and to the other shadow rapporteurs for having delivered a report that singles out support for investment and makes it more transparent without increasing the already substantial number of administrative requirements imposed on SMEs. I hope that this agreement that we are adopting today, and which was concluded within the OECD, will be signed by other countries that are trade partners of ours in order to guarantee a genuinely level playing field for operators and to ensure that Europe does not suffer competitive disadvantages in a sector that accounts for 10% of world trade and which is therefore crucial to the overall growth of the European Union.

 Madam President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is at a turning point and this crisis could lead to situations that would imply the dissolution of the biggest political and institutional project of the tragic century that was the 20th century or, alternatively. a decisive step forward in the process of integration. It is worrying, therefore, to see governments asking to reduce Europe’s financial perspective or acting against the idea of amending the Treaty to strengthen the euro; it is worrying to see all these initiatives that do not aim to help the real economy but the financial economy – the dream of so many irresponsible people who continue to travel back and forth across Europe. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) also have to play their part in tackling new markets, offering new products, adapting to the whims of the global market, bolstering their capitalisation, investing in research and innovation and showing – as they already are – that in this changing world, nobody can reserve the role of bank of the world for themselves while making others function as their workshop. We are heading towards a world in which today’s emerging big players are capable of being both bank and workshop and will have to face the challenges – including social and environmental challenges – that this world will deliver to them and will also affect us. Our competitiveness, our ability to grow and simultaneously ring-fence employment and security largely depends on our SMEs’ ability to adapt. SMEs have much to gain from a new commercial policy, but to do so they must be strengthened, they must present themselves as consortia on world markets, and they must know how to work together to crack open new markets and meet growing demand, including in sectors that require the huge volumes which we have not been able to provide in the past. They must be supported when they have to defend themselves before the courts of third countries because their patents and trademarks are being violated. Europe and its Member States have certainly done a great deal, but the fragmentation of skills and the random distribution of resources in many countries has so far prevented SMEs from working effectively on an international scale, in particular – I would reiterate – when faced with the enterprise shown by our big global competitors. This is what we need to focus our attention and commitment on. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted for the reports, with the exception of Mrs Wortmann-Kool’s report, on which I abstained despite supporting my group’s amendments. Therefore I did not vote following the overall indications of my group, because I believe that we are facing such serious problems that we must at this point demonstrate the cohesion of European institutions and our ability to deal with the problems we are confronting. Despite a certain timidity and arrogance on the part of the Council with regard to this crisis, I believe we need to show this cohesion. I did not agree with the postponement either, because we are in a position in which we need to give our citizens urgent responses to the economic crisis, which is not just the result of financial speculation, but also of our inability to deal with the problems of recovery and growth. We have a duty to heal Europe’s public finances and we have a duty to set out responses, which have to begin with the involvement of businesses and the world of work, and have different and more open rules in order to complete the single market and be in a better position to compete on the global market. That is why I voted for the reports with the exception of Mrs Wortmann-Kool’s report. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I feel bound to note that a sense of fear and a need to defend European interests still prevail among some Members in this Chamber: in other words, they are on the defensive. As far as I am concerned, I believe that this agreement with a country with which we have a long-standing bond of friendship is important as long as it is entered into on the right basis, that of true reciprocity, and is a balanced and ambitious agreement. It should not be limited to the elimination of tariff or non-tariff barriers but should represent an opportunity to take a qualitative leap in the elimination of environmental and health policy differences, and I refer, in particular, to the farming sector, the protection of animal species at risk of extinction and particular economic extractive activities that have a significant environmental impact, such as asbestos mining and oil sands drilling, or that restrict access to medicines for the poorest countries. However, we must be positive in our attitude, not defensive like we were with Japan. I would therefore emphasise the need to improve reciprocity in terms of the protection of intellectual property, including trademarks, geographical indications and policies for the reciprocal promotion of bilateral investment, aimed principally at innovation and technology and inspired by the positions already taken in this field by the European Parliament. Madam President, I believe that the numerous bilateral agreements between Canada and the Member States are the best foundation on which to build a robust free trade agreement in the commercial arena, thanks to a friendship that we have already experienced in the UN, the G8, NATO and the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, a friendship based on the ideals of democracy and freedom that characterise Canada and the European Union.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this proposal for a regulation is worthy of support because it helps to simplify and harmonise the different laws in the Member States. The proposal sends out a signal that is in line with the Commission’s proposals on small and medium-sized enterprises and the strategies to stimulate European competitiveness in the manufacturing sector. The regulation also implicitly rewards product innovation and contributes to greater transparency in the process. However, I would point out that the compromise reached with the insertion of the review clause and the joint statement by Parliament and the Council on origin marking – the political significance of which is not lost on me – could set a precedent and compromise the outcome of the difficult negotiations between the Commission, Parliament and the Council on the complex issue of origin marking for non-EU products, which Parliament approved at first reading last October and which concerns non-textile products also. It is high time that the Council acknowledged once and for all the democratic will expressed here by the majority of MEPs. However, despite these concerns, we will vote in favour of the proposal for a regulation. Gianluca Susta,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, quite honestly, we do not understand why the majority of the Committee on International Trade were so adamant in wanting to put this matter forward for debate, only to then ask for it to be referred back to committee, a request that we reject. Both decisions are wrong; however, because of the time constraints, among other reasons, I intend to focus solely on the issue of merit, but only after voicing my full support for Mr Moreira’s speech. In this complicated world in which natural and man-made disasters are occurring all the time and in large numbers, we would be setting a dangerous precedent if we were to turn every humanitarian emergency into a review of trade policy. That is a slippery slope that could result in serious imbalances and, hence, unfair treatment of the poorest countries. Yet it is only through balanced, permanent and objective rules that those countries can reap the benefits of trade policy, which must not replace development cooperation. We know that any aid earmarked for Pakistan would not be used to help the people hit by the floods almost a year ago. We know with just as much certainty that it will be the European textile sector that mainly, if not exclusively, pays the price for this humanitarian aid. We cannot accept this unfair departure from trade policy rules because we are aware of the need to consider other factors, too, in our discussions. We all know that, as well as showing solidarity with Pakistan’s flood-hit populations, another fundamental reason for granting aid lies in the decision to support Pakistan’s counterterrorism efforts. The grey areas that have emerged in recent days between the Pakistani authorities and al-Qaeda, and the Bin Laden affair itself, show how unreliable that country is. I believe that we must focus attention on this, just as we must focus attention on the major human rights issues that have emerged lately. Gianluca Susta,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council’s request to open negotiations with Japan on the conclusion of a free trade agreement must be assessed very carefully. We therefore welcome the Commissioner’s cautious approach to this issue and we call on Parliament as a whole to follow that approach, which inspired our group’s motion for a resolution. The new Japanese Government has demonstrated – at least verbally – its willingness to open up its market, one of the most closed markets in the developed world. This positive attitude must be verified in practice, especially with regard to the 27 non-tariff barriers identified by the European Union, which must be lowered so that we can open negotiations with Japan and make them one of the priorities of our trade policy. We believe that improving these relations can help make Europe more competitive, since Japan accounts for 9% of world GDP, or over 35% when its GDP is added to our own. Today, however, we cannot adopt resolutions unless they make the opening of free trade agreement negotiations subject to specific, binding and verifiable conditions; namely, that there will be genuine reciprocity and a proper impact assessment. Firstly, Japan’s protectionist policy in the automotive sector concerns us, because there is an imbalance between exports and imports. Secondly, we wish to raise the issue of non-tariff barriers. I am talking about a whole range of standards, from health and plant health measures to technical standards – especially in the agricultural and automotive sectors – export subsidy rules, customs checks and factors allowing for counterfeiting and also triangular trade with China and Korea. To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, we ask that before Europe declares itself willing to open negotiations on the conclusion of a free trade agreement, it resolutely defines the Community interest that it intends to protect and specifies the areas in which it will request reciprocity from Japan. We hope that the Commission will take these comments of ours on board. Gianluca Susta,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on International Trade.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the economic and financial crisis has led many people to rediscover the central importance of industry. Despite your efforts, Mr Vice-President, the Commission has still not always realised that. A great many acts, of which the documents on the Europe 2020 strategy or certain free-trade agreements that have recently been approved or are under discussion will not be the last, are still biased towards the service economy and the strengthening and development of services, particularly in the financial, banking and insurance sectors. In contrast, the real economy is giving us opposite signals, as you have said. Production and exports are rising and we are witnessing a reversal of the trend for relocations. We must encourage these signals, since no great economy in the world can escape the central importance of industry. Hence, we need to complete the internal market and to speed up the implementation of strong initiatives in support of innovation and research, technology transfer, product traceability, protection of intellectual property and promotion of European production, not to mention effective rules against dumping and for true reciprocity in bilateral negotiations. This report is a step in that direction, and I am very grateful to Mr Lange and all those who have worked on it. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is wrong to have turned the debate on the Free Trade Agreement with Korea into a stand-off between supposed neo-protectionists and die-hard free-traders. I also think it is wrong for the Commission to have acted more like a service economy development agency than the political government of 500 million Europeans, which should strike a balance between considerations relating to growth on the one hand, and to employment and distribution of wealth on the other. What differentiates us from the United States, which has not yet ratified this agreement – and we know why – and this also applies to relations with Korea, is the very fact that no world economic power exposes its quality – and I stress the word ‘quality’ – manufacturing industry to inevitable dismantling processes, sacrificing it on the altar of financial interests, setting white-collar workers from the City of London against the white-coated workers of modern European factories, which is exactly what Europe does not need in the wake of the crisis. All this, Mr Sturdy, Commissioner, has nothing whatsoever to do with neo-protectionism. Otherwise we would have to include in this category the Spanish, German, Polish, Portuguese, French and Italian Industry Ministers who, in the 10 February edition of Le Monde
, reiterated the need to make Community interest central to the work of the European institutions, stating that in this case it definitely could not be protected by the safeguard clause, however worthy it may be. An excellent academic exercise in the field of international trade relations has taken place, but we have failed to act in Europe’s interests. For that reason ...

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it happens all too often that intellectuals or high-powered institutions in some countries refuse to understand the phenomenon of Italian terrorism, raising doubts about the trustworthiness of our judicial system. Since this is the legal basis for the refusal to extradite Cesare Battisti, we cannot but reject it. Cesare Battisti, an individual with something of an ambiguous past, is the product of a time in which thousands of young people – many of whom were desperately lonely – chose armed struggle as a means of political struggle and ended up turning the alienating utopian dream they believed in into a crime. Other countries have experienced similar tragedies but none have so far offered the protagonists of these any chances to reform, unlike Italy, which, in fighting terrorism, really cemented its sense of national unity. Taking up the appeal of the victims’ relatives, we therefore ask for Cesare Battisti to be brought before the Italian judicial system, which will know how to show – as it has done in hundreds of other cases of former terrorists who are now reintegrated into social and civil life – that to be punished is also to make amends, as the Italian, Cesare Beccaria, taught Western legal civilisation, and not just intimidation or brutalisation, as the Brazilian authorities fear.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I totally disagree with the last speakers. Personally, I find that this measure is harmful to the priorities of Parliament and is against the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon. We are about to conclude 70% of the agreements at first reading with the Council, but I fail to understand the rush to conclude such a sensitive measure as this at first reading since it concerns the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon, which has extended our powers, particularly on commercial policy. At the very opening of the anti-dumping procedures, we are changing from the objectivity of legal certainty to an intervention by Member States, which threatens to become the outcome of bargaining between the Commission and Member States. I therefore think it is a step backwards, as is automatic alignment without any time limits from the old comitology system to the present system in the agricultural field, which strengthens the role of Parliament. Therefore, I do not believe it is wise to rush into an agreement with the Council at first reading, because we also run the risk of disputes before the Court of Justice. Gianluca Susta,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Scholz for drafting this report, which establishes a financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised countries. It is right that this instrument is managed by the Committee on International Trade because, above all, it relates to cooperation with industrialised countries and emerging countries, so there is a certain difference compared to other instruments. First and foremost, I think it is necessary to emphasise the role of Parliament. We have lost too much time in a tug of war with the Council and the Commission on an obvious issue after the Treaty of Lisbon. We must defend the centrality of Parliament, in regard to both delegated acts and executive acts. Secondly, I think it important to underline the strategic importance of this whole game and, thirdly, the need to intensify collaboration with developing countries and emerging countries, without taking money away from the poorest countries. We must make an effort, within the budget of the European Union, to divert more resources to the poorest countries, bearing in mind that the problems with emerging countries are mostly to do with rules, rather than financing. In any case, innovation must also be supported, but with additional resources that have not been taken away from the poorest countries. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we have to be mindful of the crisis that the European Union and its Member States are experiencing on a global level. With a crisis that is hitting work, employment and growth, I wonder about the logic inspiring some European countries but, above all, the European Commission, in terms of international relations. The Commission proposal under discussion today will heavily penalise some industrial sectors, particularly textiles and, in a situation like the present one, we must ask ourselves whether it is reasonable. Some people fear that these decisions are borne from the desire for Europe to take a leading role on the world stage. In reality, we know that this is not so and that the attempt to reduce the pressure, including terrorist pressure, within or related to some political and institutional systems, has even less to do with it. The truth is that not even the recent flood has anything to do with this proposal, since the main concentration of the Pakistani textiles industry is not based in the regions hit by the disaster. The actual reason is that once more, the aim is to penalise a sector in favour of financing the European economy and to favour large-scale retail, rather than the interests of the manufacturing industry located in some European countries. This is profoundly mistaken in terms of growth, work and employment in a time of serious economic crisis and the need for real EU growth on global markets, in terms of its exports and its capacity for innovation and quality.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Muscardini, and all the shadow rapporteurs with whom I have worked on this issue, which is extremely important for us. I hope that tomorrow, the European Parliament gives the same strong backing to the legislative resolution that it gave in July 2006, with the written declaration of 2008, and the favourable vote on the resolution of 2009. We are preparing to adopt a measure that should protect the consumer, informing him or her of the origin of products for a more general purpose, which renews equality of opportunity in international trade and reciprocity between the European Union and its main competitors. It does not add costs for businesses in third countries, which are already obligated to mark their products in all our competitor countries in the world and in many others. Nor does it create any burdens for the European distribution system which, indirectly, without costing the public finances anything, favours the return to Europe of significant production, slows business relocation and also contributes to the fight against counterfeiting. It is a combination of very obvious advantages, which cannot be halted by calling perhaps for further measures because here, it really is the case that the best is the enemy of the good. We must come to the end of a process that began seven years ago, showing our concern for the interests of our businesses – above all, in this time of crisis and unemployment – but also for the potential for a trade system regulated so as to provide reciprocity, consumer protection and correct information which could be further developed in terms of traceability. If this measure is not voted through by Parliament, there will be trouble. I should like to thank the European Commission once again and all those who wish to support this measure, because it is helpful for European citizens and for world trade. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I think we must ask ourselves what we want as Europe, what we are calling for as Europe, and what commitments we intend to adopt in relation to this serious economic and financial crisis, the depression we have experienced around the world, and the difficult recovery that we are facing. In my view, a Free Trade Agreement at a time of such great difficulty for multilateral relations, when the Doha negotiations are at a standstill, should fulfil at least two major requirements. On the one hand, it should establish a truly level international playing field between us and the other competitors in world trade and, on the other, it should show the world the direction in which Europe wants its economy and development to go. This agreement is divorced from all that. It takes no account at all of the global context. It is on one side or on the other. It is simply a very cleverly produced Free Trade Agreement. It is an important conceptual document, and it would certainly be able to open up useful scenarios in a totally regulated world, a world in which reciprocity, common rules and common qualitative standards are the order of the day. The world is not like that, however. What we see, in fact, is that Europe’s manufacturing industry, on which it should build in order to create more development, more employment and more jobs, is being penalised, while once again, the financial services sector is being rewarded. In its positive aspects, this agreement has hardly any effect on increasing GDP; in the best case scenario, it will raise it by 0.03%. I do not see the need for it. After President Obama’s cautious overtures, even the United States is putting the brakes on now under pressure from at least 100 congressmen from the majority party, who have described this kind of agreement – similar to the one we are about to sign – as ‘job killing’. The ratification process in Korea is extremely slow and neither the ecological standards nor the social standards are guaranteed. Even so, we want to move towards ratification very fast. We must ask for one thing, however. We asked for it before in the preliminary stages through the vote that we cast then. There can be no provisional implementation of this Free Trade Agreement unless the safeguard regulation is adopted, and in this Parliament, we have introduced some important amendments that will enable us to address the subsequent stages more effectively.

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, ladies and gentlemen, as I am one of the last people to speak, I would like to offer you some words of comfort. In my opinion, you were right to point out here that you do not represent the governments, but Europe and the European Union itself: an affirmation that is obvious, though not for some, evidently. We therefore urge you to persevere in your role to ensure that the stable Presidency of the Union provides that encouragement, that backing, and forces the governments to turn their words into action. We welcome what has been achieved over recent months, the idea of the task force and also the fact that the Heads of State or Government were forced to draw up a significant document because, Mr President, the content of that document, if put into effect – although we are not really sure whether all of the Member States do wish to put it into effect – is certainly significant. For example, we do not know whether the statements in the final document on the taxation of financial transactions or on the tax on banks will actually become reality. We are waiting for the task force’s conclusions in order to see whether these effective instruments, in conjunction with the statements on economic governance, together with the statements on growth, are really an essential premise of our political action. We wanted the constituent process, which ended with the Treaty of Lisbon, in order to signal a change: we hope that the stable Presidency of the Union will insist – as Mr Van Rompuy underlined in his reply – that these words become reality.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you to the rapporteur, and also to the shadow rapporteurs, and to Commissioner Tajani, or should I say Vice-President Tajani, for the precise and accurate answers you have given us on key points. Eighteen years ago, the University of Barcelona carried out a study that concluded that the textile industry would have disappeared from Europe by the year 2000. It is now 2010 and this gloomy prophecy has not come true, and it has not come true for one simple reason: namely that the research and innovation developed in Europe and in countries that have maintained their manufacturing base – because they have not just acted as research centres, but as centres of applied research and industry – have ensured the production of new innovative fibres. Hence, the need for these regulations instead of a directive, to guarantee flexibility, protect consumers where labelling is concerned, and also to vouch for the country of origin. I believe, Vice-President Tajani, that it is worth imagining a future where we also have a European Monitoring Unit to protect health and safety, in other words, an authority to safeguard this originality. I believe that we must all agree on this positive aspect that has emerged from this report. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I listened with interest to the introduction by the President of the Council and the Vice-President of the Commission, and I have to say that I am not convinced by the conclusions. I am not convinced by the conclusions of the March European Council, because we are witnessing a decline, among some leading figures of European contemporary history, of the Community ideal and method. It is this that concerns us given what is happening in the world; rather, certain aspects concern us. The Greek affair is merely an illustration of what Europe ought to be, but is in reality not yet. Therefore, we call on the European Commission, on the Vice-President, who is standing in here for the President, and on the President of the Council, to adopt a strong political initiative, a legislative initiative: the Commission must set the agenda, and the Council must ensure that we do not trail in the wake of governments whose power and incisiveness is too often curbed by imminent electoral issues – yesterday in France and Italy, tomorrow in the United Kingdom and Germany – which paralyse the action of governments. Your role must be not only that of a facilitator, Mr Van Rompuy, but of a driving force behind this Europe, and we appeal to your democratic and pro-European sensibility to ensure that this new impetus will bring benefits for this Europe. It is no longer enough to set objectives; we need to define instruments. We agree on the objectives, just as we agreed on the Lisbon Strategy. What are the instruments, though? Do we want to end up with a federal budget – and to call it that – which equates to at least 2% of GDP? Do we want to bring into play Eurobonds, European investments and treasury bonds so that we can politically enhance this Europe, without which we will go nowhere? In essence, we need to know whether we are succeeding in defining the new Europe and whether we are succeeding in defining – through a new relationship between the European political forces within and outside this Parliament – the real distinction, the real boundary that exists within today’s Europe between conservatives and progressives, between those who want a more politically integrated Europe and those who, instead, want only an enlarged single market.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe’s ambition to remain the world’s largest economy must increasingly be linked to the revival of its competitiveness, to the quality of its manufacturing system and to its ability to conquer new markets. The fight against counterfeiting and commercial infringement plays an essential role in this context. However, the protection of trademarks, patents and intellectual property are not only non­financial instruments that make the system more competitive, they are also a tangible example of the application to the industrial economy of principles of a democratic legal culture founded on respect for the rules, for those rules which have been violated in past years under the force of international financial speculation. The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) is a fundamental instrument with which to combat counterfeiting, a phenomenon which yields incredible revenues of USD 500 billion per year, which has links with organised crime and which affects – indeed threatens – fundamental human rights such as health, if we only think of the counterfeiting of medicines. If we are to assess the need for ACTA, we must bear this international context in mind. On the other hand, we must call for this treaty to also respect certain basic, fundamental principles of coexistence inspired by respect for the rules. We cannot hide the fact that we are concerned about the legal basis of the treaty, about the negotiating mandate and its transparency. Those who represent, as this Parliament does, 500 million citizens, must be informed officially, not confidentially. The negotiators from the Commission must report back to this House on the state of progress of the work, and access to the documents and information must be provided so that a detailed opinion can be expressed. The difficult yet fruitful cooperation between Parliament and the Commission can help the European Union to realise its potential in the best possible way. The resolution is along these lines and, as such, it is worthy of our vote. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important opportunity to reaffirm, above all, the importance of the Generalised System of Preferences. Both the basic GSP system and the GSP+ system, which are both linked to the ‘Everything But Arms’ initiative, contribute to reducing poverty, in strict accordance with the primary obligation of ensuring respect for human rights. It is the violation of these basic principles of coexistence that recently led the European Union to withdraw Sri Lanka’s preferential tariff benefits following a detailed investigation by the Commission. The new institutional framework must, however, fully include Parliament in the legislative process aimed at modifying the legislation in force. We therefore hope that it will include a complete review of the regulation, in accordance with the ordinary procedures, since it has several shortcomings, including on the very subject of investigations. The next step will be the joint resolution. The effectiveness of the regulation depends on its credibility, the objectiveness of the criteria upon which it is based and the strictness with which it is applied. In a Europe in which the vast majority of citizens do not agree with exporting democracy at gunpoint, trade and trade­related aid are essential vehicles for disseminating principles of coexistence based on respect for fundamental human rights. It is our duty not to lapse into indifference – which would be wrong – but also to avoid making hasty judgments about certain parties, judgments which sound like irrevocable sentences, as is the case with Colombia. This is why I do not feel able to support what are almost one-sided inflexible attitudes to one country or another, but I do strongly support the need for enhanced monitoring of all of the problematic situations, in the spirit of the legislation in force and according to the principles of the rules on which we want to base the legislative review that we are demanding.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, new players have emerged out of the wings onto the world stage, some of which were actually considered developing countries not long ago. This must change our approach, cultural and otherwise, towards free trade and the tangible manifestations of the relationship between the European Union and its major competitors. This relationship is currently mediated by certain magic terms that have not yet entered into the vocabulary of the European Commission. These terms are reciprocity, European interest, the fight against dumping and the fight against tariff barriers. This is the background to the free trade agreement with Korea, which incidentally confused two Commissioners – the Commissioner for Internal Market and Services and the Commissioner for Employment – and some governments. What are the real advantages of this bilateral agreement, when 50% of the trade between the European Union and Korea concerns the automotive sector, when the disparity between the 700 000 Korean cars exported to us as opposed to the 27 000 European cars imported by Korea is glaringly evident? What is the sense in providing indirect aid of approximately EUR 1 600 for each Korean car sold in Europe when some European governments find it difficult to provide incentives for buying and selling cars to stimulate consumption? How can we also fail to take into account the serious doubts over the textile and electronics industries? We will not settle with hearing for the umpteenth time, Commissioner, as Mrs Ashton said before you, that there are advantages for our chemical, pharmaceutical or agrifood industries because these pale scandalously into insignificance compared to the consequences for textiles, electronics and, above all, for cars, or financial services. Could it be that Europe, even with the crisis we are in today, is yet again choosing the financial option for its development? We all welcomed the birth of the new Europe in Lisbon with hope. Europe cannot however, fail to take responsibility for European interests in the world, particularly today. The United States is jumping through hoops to defend Boeing against Airbus and the Argentinean Government is threatening to expropriate Telecom. The agreement with Korea actually legitimises pass-through financing with China which, until now, was illegal. This is the scenario in which our major businesses are forced to operate. Behind them are hundreds of thousands of workers, of families who can see their future going up in smoke, not because they are producing poor quality services or goods but because poorly defined interests are allowed to prevail over more evident and objective interests. We trust in your sensitivity, Commissioner, in the hope that you will avoid over-hasty ratifications, which could go hand in hand with unacceptable decisions over the provisional application of the commercial side of the agreement pending ratification, or at least decisions that will be unacceptable until the regulation on the bilateral safeguard clause has been clearly defined. The adoption of this clause is subject to the ordinary legislative procedure that should be considered a first step to any appraisal of the advisability … (The President cut off the speaker) Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

President of the Commission, the progressives among us are giving you a vote of confidence today so as not to leave you open to the blackmail of those who have little faith in this community of Europe and so as not to subordinate you to the governments of the Twenty-Seven. Believing in a community of Europe means breaking your deafening silence and taking up a central role in the major international issues; defending European interests in the industrial and economic arena; reinforcing social policy and investing more towards conquering world poverty; consolidating our alliance with the United States but on equal terms; reinforcing the position of the European Union in international bodies, beginning with the UN Security Council; relaunching multilateralism in world trade; and setting the agenda in the fight against global pollution. Our vote today will be a conditional vote of confidence, with no exceptions, in the Commission and in the individual Commissioners, in order fully to achieve the new Europe born in Lisbon, a political player among the major world powers, and so that it can be, above all, a community of destiny dedicated to its own economic and civil progress, and which sets itself a mission of peace, justice and freedom in the world; one that is not solely a community of memory, living in the present off its own wealth and off a past glory that is now faded.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Zapatero, thank you for the great commitment you are making during this parliamentary term regarding the items you have announced, even though this is no longer the time to list all the useful items, but to make practical efforts to revive Europe. We need to end this period of defining institutional structures and to face the major issues which still prevent Europe from being able to compete on an equal footing with its international partners. We need to know whether the European Union will be able, one day very soon, to have a seat in the United Nations, whether it will be able to have a seat, as the European Union, at the G20, whether it wants greater fiscal and social harmonisation, and what resources it wants to put into the European economic circuit so that it can truly do what its other international competitors have done. We need to come here – and I say this also to President Barroso – with concrete measures to revive Europe, because, in six months’ time, we will not see the same results as we have seen previously with other previous experiences. We would also like to know whether the time has finally come when, as Kissinger would say 30 years ago, the major world leaders know which telephone number to call when they need to speak to someone in Europe, and do not just contact the Member States. At stake is Europe’s dignity as it emerges from the Treaty of Lisbon, but also the European social model, that fundamental democracy which we Members of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament strongly demand and on which we want the future well-being of our citizens to be based.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I certainly do not intend at this time – even with the time available to me – to go back over all of the reasons behind the repeated request that we, as Parliament, are making. I would point out – and you yourself have already made this point, Commissioner – that Mrs Muscardini and I are the only two veterans of 2006, of the signing of the resolution with which this Parliament endorsed the initiative of the then Commissioner Mandelson in December 2006. We hoped that the initiative that you undertook a few weeks ago to make small changes in order to achieve a compromise could have been supported more strongly, including within the Article 133 Committee. Among other things we regret that, within that committee, many countries reiterated their opposition or misgivings, including the United Kingdom, via its representative. All that we want to do today is to remind you that this request is not about protectionism; it is not industries that are no longer able to compete on the international market that we want to defend, but consumers: we want to draw attention to the theme of health, the environment and genuine reciprocity on the world market, which is lacking today. Moreover, it is not only lacking with regard to the weakest subjects in the world: no, it is also lacking with regard to Japan, to the United States, to Australia, to Canada, to Brazil, to India, to the main competitors of the European Union, which has a duty, in these economically difficult times, to defend the Community interest, which is also behind this request. We therefore hope that Parliament will throw its full weight behind the initiatives that the Commission provides and we also hope that the commitments made a few weeks ago will be fully honoured, even if this procedure cannot be wound up by Christmas but under the new procedure introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the time has come for this House to stop the endless debate on the Treaty of Lisbon, which we have still heard going on today. I believe that we must respect the wishes of this Parliament, of the great European countries, of the 27 and of the 26 that have ratified this treaty in various forms, but democratically, and thus the offences to the treaty and its democratic content must also be rejected. I also believe that the Council meeting at the end of the month will be an important opportunity to reaffirm the need to revive the idea of Europe beyond Lisbon and to revive the economy, as well as to ensure that Europe does not back down over the major issue of climate change. From that perspective, I believe that what we have heard lately from the President-in-Office, but also what we have heard today, is insufficient. Europe beyond Lisbon is failing to interpret the strong content of the new treaty and is failing to comply with the terms of the Lisbon Agenda. Therefore, if we 500 million Europeans want to remain the world’s biggest economic power, a power that is preparing to become a major political player on the international stage, I urge the Commission to fully carry out its mandate of proposing European legislation on the major issues relating to the economy, the economic recovery and the labour market recovery, and I urge the Council to turn a long list of headings into an actual policy to help resolve the economic difficulties. This is what I believe we are lacking. We are lacking a major economic recovery plan, we are lacking in major areas such as the revival of the infrastructure policy with Eurobonds, and we are lacking a high-profile European approach. This is what we expect from the European Council at the end of the month. Gianluca Susta  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, people who seek to label as anti-Italian, subversive and communist anyone who calls for a set of rules on communication and freedom of information that respects pluralism, and which is characterised by a clear separation between the fortunes of those who assume important institutional responsibilities and the wealth they derive from entrepreneurial activities in the publishing and information fields, are making a serious mistake, which must not be forgiven, justified or allowed here in Europe. Not once in our speeches have we mentioned the Italian Prime Minister. We could have referred to the number of newspapers he owns: 150 in Italy; and around 40 television channels. That is not the problem, however. The problem is that pluralism of information – and in information – is a cornerstone of every free democracy and must be used as a defence against every monopolistic and oligopolistic philosophy and against conflicts of interest. The sovereignty of each State, the reaffirmation that the European Union is not a superstate, Commissioner Reding, must not make us forget that the European Union also has a Charter of Fundamental Rights from which stems a legislative system that the Member States cannot ignore. You know that, on these very issues, many times the Court of Justice – in the case of Italy, not on issues to do with the system, Mr Speroni – has passed sentences that are still to be carried out. Globalisation of the markets and the ever-increasing use of the airwaves now require more targeted European legislation to regulate this sensitive matter, which has such a strong influence on public opinion and therefore also on the principle of popular sovereignty – which underpins the European Union and not just the Italian Republic – and on the ways in which this principle is exercised. It should no longer be possible for anyone to invoke the sacrosanct rights of the popular majority to justify threats to freedom of the press in what was, until recently, a situation of disparity between the plaintiff and the defendant – whether in Italy or in Portugal, as we were reminded earlier – because this undermines the foundations of the rules of coexistence on which the Union is based. This is why there is an urgent need for a directive against concentrations in the field of information that will regulate the dealings of those who are involved in politics and, at the same time, control very important media.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have welcomed the work done during this period in which Mrs Ashton has been carrying out her role as Commissioner. I must say that we have had a better relationship with her than we had with her predecessor, despite their common political affiliation, which we too share, and their common nationality. However, this time I do not share the Commissioner’s enthusiasm on this issue, because too often in recent years, the Commission has taken the floor here and talked up certain initiatives, only to then pursue a different path. We are going through a particular moment in time, a major economic and financial crisis, which is also the result of a lack of reciprocity in the world, not only with developing countries – which has its own logic, its own explanation – but with the new global players and the traditional global players. Too often I seem to sense a lack of awareness within the Commission, by its President and its Commissioners, of which initiatives should be implemented to aid the recovery of European industry, the recovery of the European manufacturing industry. It seems to me that this agreement – which, admittedly, is a positive agreement and has extremely positive content – has more of an academic value; it is almost a textbook treaty, but one that is not in touch with reality. We export USD 30 billion to Korea, only USD 20 billion come back in the form of cars exported from Korea to Europe, and USD 1.5 billion will be the indirect aid that accrues to Korean cars in Europe, without mentioning the textile and other sectors. That is a definite imbalance, which I believe must be highlighted and must be corrected, before the green light is given to a free trade agreement that penalises European industry. Ours is a quality industry that has committed itself to the new requirements that innovation calls for, certainly not a bankrupt industry that cannot get to grips with the need for innovation that exists within the economy.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, like many of my colleagues, I would like to ask the Council what its real intentions are in the light of this proposal. Do you want to reduce everything to a minimum and freeze the future? And is this the same Europe that will supposedly be relaunched with Mr Van Rompuy’s document on integration? Where is the consistency between Mr Van Rompuy’s two policy documents? Where is the consistency, from the point of view of ordinary citizens, between the measures announced in July on employment and growth, those great calls for hope and for the future of the EU that we heard from the Council, and this sudden violence done in the name of realism, aiming for mere survival? With these figures and these cuts how can we implement cohesion and the agricultural reforms in terms of concrete actions? These are sincere questions that require a clear and honest answer, because there is evidence here of a type of institutional schizophrenia that Parliament and the citizens can no longer tolerate. Parliament wants consistency and credibility. The very first criticism that can be levelled is that the budget just does not add up. So much for growth and investment: this is the 2008 budget over again! Of course it must be conceded that Mr Van Rompuy, in heading 1a, overturns the quite scandalous suggestion by Cyprus. He also recognises the essential role of the budget in offering support to growth in some sectors, additional to the support offered by the national budgets. But growth and innovation – clearly – should not be achieved at the expense of other sectors that also contribute to ‘growth’ and ‘employment’, such as cohesion policy, but also agricultural policy, which has created jobs and is ever more focused on innovation and protection of rural areas. ‘Growth’ and ‘employment’ also mean culture, training, the transnational networks, the Connecting Europe Facility, as well as solidarity and international development, human rights in the world and our contribution to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. What we are seeing however is the usual Council spectacle: no vision, no leadership, a Babel of conflicting and competing national interests, an inextricable tangle of vetoes, aspirations and general discontent. Unfortunately what is mainly missing is Europe! Patrizia Toia,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today Europe is being asked to perform a new task of industrial policy coordination, and even the most ardent supporters of the freedom of private initiative are calling for this role to be carried out. Without more Europeanisation of national strategies, particularly in terms of job protection, the current crisis will not be resolved and there will be no economic recovery. The automotive crisis is not just about overcapacity: it is about widespread job losses. The crisis now seems to be structural and concerns the very future of the automotive sector as we know it today. We want to have an automotive industry in Europe and do not want to squander the skills, know-how and professional expertise that exist. We are therefore calling for a major restructuring and regeneration project to be launched swiftly so that the costs do not escalate disproportionately. Restructuring cannot only derive from fragmented decisions by national governments and individual companies. We at least need to try to join forces and guide this painful process at EU level, making the interested parties sit down at the table for a dialogue between the social partners, manufacturers, trade unions and governments in each country, offering support for research, innovation, training, upskilling and the necessary funding. I know that this will be an arduous task, because the national interests of individual companies are not the same. However, since competition within the European Union is highly ambiguous and at times risks being unfair, I believe that ultimately it is in the interests of all countries to have effective EU guidance and stimulus, so that together we can face the increasingly aggressive global market.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the energy crisis has taken and is continuing to take its toll on employment, on the thousands of short-term, temporary and permanent workers in this sector. The major steel conglomerates are increasingly pivoting towards the Far East or the American continent, which raises a question over the direction of our development model. I believe that Europe should resurrect the idea that a manufacturing sector such as ours needs a solid production base, able to supply the European internal market. We must therefore defend this sector and the role of a stable steel industry, and we must support it, Commissioner, if we want to halt the industrial decline. I think we need to move away from the dualism – which has not emerged here this evening, but which is often heard in discussions about this sector – between those who campaign to protect the environment and workers, which is misguided because it does not show us the way forward. An industry in which steel is considered to be an integral part needs the latest production systems, concrete and balanced solutions, which safeguard the various interests, the various requirements. Therefore, we need a strong European plan focusing on sustainability – on which we should never turn our backs, in my opinion – as a source of real added value, with which we can compete in the world, supporting investments, as several parties have already said, new technologies, new processes and upgrading our plants; a European economy that makes efficient use of its resources, including energy, indeed starting with energy and the search for new materials.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a budget is the programme and charter of an institution since it shows what it is, what it does and above all what it intends to do in the future. We are faced with a crucial choice between a budget for mere survival or subsistence – with a little less for everyone – or a courageous budget with selective decisions, with investment in job creation, innovation, youth, in other words in the future of the European Union and its development role. It must be emphasised that, as has been stated very clearly by Mr Kalfin among others, today Europe can do what the individual Member States cannot do for the economy, for regional development and for the regions – where social cohesion will either be strengthened or die – in other words, for the lives of the very citizens we mentioned. The great European choices are today in danger of being suffocated by accounting-based disputes – within the Council and elsewhere – between net beneficiary countries and net contributors. It should be underlined that this as a false problem, because it is easy, taking account of what happened in the past, to demonstrate with figures and numbers, rather than with words, that the contributor countries actually gained, often more than the others, from the convergence of economies and growth. The Council is currently working to add figures to the various headings. The war of positions has started: statements, stances taken by certain countries that view the budget as a mere expense item to be cut mercilessly, and even used to appease anti-European sentiment, easy to fuel at a time of crisis. This is a mistaken position that does not help the integration that we are struggling to achieve in other areas. As many of us have pointed out, our Europe is still incomplete and imperfect. We adopted a stability plan that was supposed to include development, but we have stabilised so much that we are in recession. Let us at least take the opportunity offered by this budget and this multiannual financial framework to make choices that go in the right direction. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I just wanted to add my voice to the plaudits this report has garnered from the House in relation to the need to strengthen the European Union’s standing as a place where it is possible to invest, produce, and produce in line with our conception of an economy that is inclusive as well as socially and environmentally sustainable. I think a number of parts of this measure are really helpful, while others could be added. I do think it is important to grasp this opportunity and work even harder to enhance our attractiveness through regional marketing policies and openness, which represent the region’s proposition for a productive, industrial, manufacturing and services economy that, as it originates in the region, is respectful of the environment. This regional approach together with EU policies along the same lines are what we need to attract investment and growth. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the initial comments on the European Council, now the time for simplistic interpretation has begun, which is a mistake because important progress was made. For example, the destructive link between banks and public debts has been broken and we have a plan – albeit a weak one – on employment and jobs. The European institutions seem once again to be infused with a spirit of resurgence and renewed progress towards political unity, after so much slowness and dragging of feet, and a desire for real progress towards greater integration. In this vein, yesterday saw a display of real unity between Parliament and the Commission. There were no winners or losers, but an undeniable, new institutional and political vitality compared to the diarchy of the past, which was the negation – the very antithesis – of the European spirit. Many countries showed initiative and a desire to act, not to create new, exclusive alliances, but to build a shared consensus that is respectful of all Member States. This is the path towards political unity, without which any form of banking, fiscal or monetary unity will be totally inadequate. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, water is increasingly being seen as a public asset, a precious resource for the whole of humankind. It is vital, therefore, to develop an integrated, efficient strategy for the wise use of this finite resource. Measures at EU level must address our continent’s current and future water challenges, and therefore the ‘Blueprint to safeguard Europe’s water resources’ to be published in November is more important than ever to ensure – as has been said – sufficient availability of good-quality water for sustainable and equitable use. I regard this as an important aspect of the EU 2020 strategy. Water is linked to food or, rather, water is part of food, and a small amount of food contains a huge amount of water, so a water strategy is also a strategy to ensure food security for Europe and the world. Water can lead to wars, but it can also be a factor for development and peace; I therefore strongly support the proposal contained in the report to devote 1%, for example, of water tariffs to decentralised cooperation measures and growth projects around the world. I hope this legislation, which already exists in some Member States, will spread like good practice to other countries to become law in all the Member States of the European Union.

 I support this report because it is essential to attract new investors to the EU market. This is only possible through measures such as project bonds and far-reaching reforms such as the cohesion policy reform that we will adopt in 2013. Ambitious territorial development policies will allow the EU to maintain its high-quality human capital and foster an open and fair business environment as well as investment in research and innovation for successful products and business models, for the benefit of Europe’s economy and society. The promotion of a strong industrial base needs to be put at the centre of reforms, particularly in those areas where the EU has traditionally been strong, as well as in high-tech sectors where a strong industrial base is essential to develop innovation in products, processes and services and to create new jobs. In a context of economic recovery, it is necessary to adopt ambitious legislation for SMEs by simplifying regulations and strengthening access to finance, promoting effective capital systems (venture and angel), and enhancing the role of private and public equity investments in financing long-term corporate growth. Parliament’s commitment will be maximal. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even though our budget is limited, a year’s budget adds up to a figure that can be wasted by the markets in a single day. The multiannual financial framework (MFF) is very important but only if the Member States do not see the budget as a source of expenditure to be cut like all public expenditure, but rather as a resource which can help the economy to grow – an investment – and not as a cost for citizens but as the way to produce tangible results. The figures represent programmes, projects, things to be achieved. Therefore, I say ‘no’ to short-sighted cuts and ‘no’ to infighting between countries, because growth is an opportunity for all European citizens. In addition, the European budget should not be seen as separate, but as complementary to national budgets. A new approach is needed to strengthen links between the European budget and national budgets. In some ways, our budget is the 28th budget of the Member States. This is the only way we can create the global assets that can develop effective policies. We are asking for a more coordinated approach. The European Semester can also help with this. Finally, as regards Parliament’s role, I say this to the Council: we will accept neither a fait accompli 
nor a ‘take it or leave it’ approach. We want a preliminary consultation before the formal proposal is presented for approval. Citizens, worried about the future of Europe, express themselves through us and we, as their representatives, want to play a part in taking decisions. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say a big thank you to Ms Podimata and to all those Members who have worked hard so that we could hold today’s vote. This proposal has an inescapable logic and its basis is clear, robust and fair, if it is possible to use this latter adjective in relation to the economy. Not even the objections raised today undermine this logic, and the understandable concerns voiced over the possible counterproductive or undesirable effects – if made in good faith – can potentially be answered and resolved, as shown by the debate over the last few months. Of course, solutions to avoid undesirable effects exist, as long as there really is the will to establish this tax, because sometimes one has the feeling that caution is called for just to slow or block the approval process, with predictions of economic catastrophes. On this point, I would address Ms Ford: have we not already experienced these catastrophes thanks to harmful and reckless speculation? Mention has also been made of difficulties, but today, Europeans are calling on the institutions to recover the ability to carry out their general role and to equip the world of finance with precise rules, since this is our duty and this is our sovereignty as a body with a general nature. Therefore, let us make the right choice today, one which the citizens will welcome. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, development is not a luxury but a duty. Today, growth is a universally acknowledged priority. Yet this was not the case until recently, and my group can be rightly proud of having consistently pressed on this matter, in calling for some significant changes to the focus of European policy. As has already been mentioned, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) – which are the productive backbone of the economy – need not only the urgent interventions that will be discussed later but also long-term measures to cultivate the human capital of the young men and women of Europe. These measures must send them the message that a business-oriented outlook and a spirit of enterprise mean more than a career or a question of personal success or adventure. Indeed, these attitudes are also useful to society, because they help to create – through a model of development based on widespread enterprise – the conditions for fairer and more sustainable growth, as Ms Krehl has already said. For we want to see development that is innovative, and that is both able to seize all the new opportunities and sustainable in environmental and social terms. As regards the long-term efforts, in terms of training, I would also advocate revisiting technical colleges, which are a real asset in Europe, one that we have neglected for too long. These are a great resource and a great way of learning about science and technology, and therefore of getting a taste for creating something new through your own ingenuity. As for resources, while still on the subject of urgent action – and I address these remarks especially to the Commission but also to the Council, which together with Parliament, must make a decision on the Structural Funds Regulation – it will be essential to coordinate resources. Shall we be able to use the Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs (COSME) funds (the financial instruments for SMEs), the research funds and the Structural Funds in a complementary approach? If we use these resources wisely, in a complementary fashion, then we shall be able to get the most from them; otherwise, we shall risk spreading them too thinly. The Structural Funds are indispensable, and they are intrinsically focused on this priority. Nevertheless, Commissioner, while recognising the importance of thematic concentration, I believe that it is also important that the regional authorities should be able to contribute to the planning and decision-making process, because while it is true that many regions need guidance, many others are quite capable of planning and setting priorities. The regions are key, for they are the engine room of progress, of business growth, of the spirit of new employment, and of the desire to participate, including on the part of all the economic, social and community bodies. Hence, the regions are the main resource where EU policies and the policies of the local authorities must come together. I must emphasise, then, the importance of coordinating resources. And finally, as regards the definition of SMEs – a subject on which the Member States will have their say, and therefore the Council will need to as well – in my view, what counts is not only the structural elements – employment and turnover – but also the quality of the small and medium-sized enterprises, which operate locally but think globally. I therefore ask that special consideration be given to the fundamental nature of small businesses and their support network. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, when we speak about good examples for our citizens, when we speak about the internal market and the possibility of creating genuine, concrete opportunities for changes in everyday life through the working of the internal market, we can truly use this example – and we obviously have need of many others – as a fruit of our labours. It is a good example because, as was said, it has an impact on citizens’ real lives, on their daily lives. It also helps businesses to expand their market, not because charges are high and services reduced, but because they can increase their service offering and, in substance, it also helps the economy as a whole. That is why I believe that it is, without doubt, a positive example, a good example. Yet you will have realised, Commissioner, that there is a widespread desire in this House; in particular, let us recall the speeches of two of my colleagues, Ms Riera Madurell and Mr Goebbels, not to mention many others, who would like this good example to become the best possible example, and would like us to move towards a zero-cost roaming outcome. Such an outcome is possible, and this measure partly anticipates that. Are we wishing for utopia? No. We are not, because an internal European market implies that domestic and non-domestic tariffs should be similar. There is no longer differentiation if we speak of the single market and, above all, because there is no technical justification for an increase in charges. I remember when, in 2007, we began to discuss voice roaming charges, the first of the trio that we have now tackled. There was a certain incredulity and also certain difficulties; not, however, on the part of the Commission, and here I must give the credit to your predecessor, Ms Reding. The difficulties were quite wide-ranging. They came from those who said that a true market did not allow for tariffs to be regulated, that there were political prices to pay, that they belonged to an old idea of the left, et cetera, et cetera. There were those who said it would not work and so on, that it would put a brake on the market. In the end, however, we have done it. The interests of citizens and establishing that these were not justifications for increased charges have made it possible. That is how the world moves on, and things are becoming, let us say, ever more possible. That is why I think an even more courageous outcome is achievable. A concluding remark on why it is not possible to do otherwise. Today, we had a visit from a delegation of Tunisian citizens; I do not know if they are still here. Perhaps one of its many benefits is that this extension to outside the EU will make us understand that the opportunity of using phones without the bugbear of charges will also aid democracy.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I want, first and foremost, to express my very sincere appreciation for Mr Giegold’s work on this own-initiative report. I also recall that we share with him and with others an active presence in Parliament’s Social Economy Intergroup. My political group, as you know, believes that the social model is one of the fundamental characteristics of the European integration project. Therefore, this is not just a simple policy, or one of many; it is a policy that characterises our entire project. In this day and age, with the attacks relating to the need for public spending cuts as well, we still firmly support this priority. We know that it may be as a revised or modified social model, but we believe that it should be retained, defended and reaffirmed as a priority. Therefore, I believe that, in this same vision, we must also promote business entities, such as cooperatives, which produce goods and services and have a very special role in the so-called European social economy. These businesses reassert the fact that it is possible to be productive, to do good things, to be efficient even if the goal is not profit but rather, for example, employment, welfare, labour development and contributing to the life of the local community. This is why it is important – I am finishing here, Madam President – for Europe to make the appropriate instruments available for an active policy and make a good statute – not the one that exists now, which is unusable, but a good statute for cooperatives which can be a way to help this very important sector.

 Mr President, I too applaud the positive outcome of the transitional period, and hope that a definitive solution will be found in the financial programming that will deliver a stable, definitive and rapid response to a real need, which is unfortunately growing, because the number of poor people, the new poor, in Europe is continuing to rise. New areas of the population that were formerly self-sufficient now do not have enough food to live on, and food is a primary basic right. These are poor workers, single mothers with children, and people suffering from invalidating illnesses. The spectre of hunger has once again raised its head in civilised Europe. I believe that we cannot remain indifferent, just as we cannot support the reasons of those – including many of our colleagues, unfortunately – who think the responsibility should lie first and foremost with the Member States, that we should focus on nutritional education, and so on. In my view we should first of all take this action and then abolish food subsidies, not the other way round. Luckily, however, outside Parliament, Europe is made up of young people, volunteers, associations and political groups that want this House to deliver more fairness and solidarity in Europe. This is what we are working towards. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Internet applications and services still have great potential both for the economy and for a more informed and inclusive society. Now that the telecoms package is being transposed into national legislation, there is a risk that the European framework may become fragmented. The Commission’s monitoring role will therefore be important. I would also say that the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) will have an important part to play, and some of us would have liked it to have been stronger during the drafting of the telecoms package as well. The priorities that we want to emphasise in this debate are: a guarantee of net neutrality, development of broadband infrastructure and of more open software, security of access and interoperability of systems, promotion of the use of digital technologies throughout industry and the services sector, production of digital content and new services, inclusion of people who are currently excluded – I am thinking of people with disabilities, amongst others – and support for pluralism in information provision and culture. It should also be laid down and guaranteed that operators cannot adopt blocking or throttling practices or discriminate against users and that they should ensure the utmost transparency in their commercial offers and in all their business activities. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this year and the next are crucial to the future and unity of Europe. The work programme should therefore be included more fully in this framework of exceptionality, which certainly means focusing on key objectives, giving more concrete efficacy to our actions, concentrating investments towards those bodies which can, in turn, put into action other private resources, but also, as my colleague has said, seeing the Commission – President Barroso, if I could just have your attention for a moment – playing a more active role, which is better directed towards the reality of certain countries and of the entire euro area and of the whole of Europe. We hope that the Commission will take on this role, and I say this even as a representative of a country which, at this moment, is changing its government; which is not a technocratic government but rather a technical government that demonstrates not the rejection of political forces and politics but, if anything, the generosity – and I say this as a force that was in opposition in my country – of parties that are ready to do what is useful for the country even without direct representation. I believe that the theme of stable and equal growth should regard the theme of supporting businesses in two ways: access to credit and innovation. The Commission and Europe are capable of achieving this in a concrete way. When we recapitalise and help to recapitalise banks, even, perhaps, with public support, we should demand that this credit go to the real economy – first and foremost to the real economy. When Horizon 2020 becomes one of the main dossiers, we should initiate wide-scale research on innovation for enterprises, whether these be large or small. The chapter on the digital agenda is also very important because the creation of this unique market will be of great help to society. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D
),

The favourable outcome of the vote concerning the resolution on the situation in Egypt and Syria, with particular regard for Christian communities, is confirmation of the fact that Europe continues to look after ethnic and religious minorities. Unfortunately, the situation has now become even more worrying due to a trail of blood and death, in Egypt above all, but also elsewhere in the world, which the European institutions cannot ignore. Parliament is alive to this and intends to take action to ensure that such episodes are not repeated. There is no use in denying that tension exists between Muslims and Christians, but stopping there would only afford a partial view of the situation. History teaches us that religions can coexist, as long as the climate is right. The current difficulties are worsened by hidden troublemakers, who fan the flames to deepen the conflict and impede the transition to democracy. We need to clarify the role of the armed forces in this phase, as they have all too frequently turned into the agents of repression, rather than guarantors of transition. We appeal to the representatives of all religions, philosophies and schools of thought to contribute to civil and peaceful coexistence. Europe – the home of fundamental rights and freedoms – will do its part to ensure that these principles are respected. Patrizia Toia,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis in Europe is interlinking the problems of public budgets and private capital with those of the productivity of our businesses in a vicious circle, and the spectre of recession is looming. Therefore, if small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are our top priority, I would call on the Commission, alongside Parliament, to make absolutely sure that our good principles are put into practice and that the Member States turn the legislative initiatives of the Small Business Act (SBA) into highly effective, high-quality, concrete measures. Just think, Commissioner, what would happen if the Late Payment Directive were implemented early in all the Member States, and what a great benefit to SMEs it would be! The SME tests are important, but we are still at the method stage. Of course, it is only right to check that the laws we make really are suited to SMEs and further their interests, but we would urge you to persevere and examine the issues very thoroughly when setting up this framework of opportunity that you have sketched out. We also appreciate what the Commission has been doing and we are ready with the budget and the other options that we have to support it. I would just like to say a word about credit. We have to make our position clear to the banks – I am saying this to you, Commissioner – because SMEs need help … (The President cut off the speaker) Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the preparation of the common strategic framework for research and innovation funding represents a huge opportunity for the development and economy of Europe. It is a matter of pulling the lever that can truly usher in a period of growth and also of new skilled employment, such as that done by researchers and young people who devote themselves precisely to the new opportunities in innovation and technology and associated professions. One observation in particular emerges from this work, which is that we in Europe must put increasing emphasis on the kinds of research and innovation that find practical application, originate new companies, result in new patents and do not remain pure basic research or pure knowledge, which is certainly important, but not to the extent that it actually triggers development. The second observation is the relationship with local bodies, regions and territories, which are an important tool for territorial planning and for bringing together research, universities, centres of excellence and businesses.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report looks at global food security. This means that what is at stake here is not only hunger in the world or in the very poorest countries, but that the subject of food supply affects all communities, including those in the most developed countries. I would like to pick out a few key points of consistency between European policies and this target of global food security, because we in Parliament are quite accomplished at preaching, but often we are not consistent in our decisions. I only wish to highlight three innovative areas, which I think we ought to develop further. Firstly: food supply is currently jeopardised by price volatility, caused by speculation in food markets – through derivatives and so forth – that must be contained, if not banned outright. Secondly: the subject of land grabbing, which I think needs to be addressed in some form of treaty or negotiation, because democracy and the survival of many populations are at risk. Thirdly: consistency between food supply and energy policies. In our efforts to produce new energy, we must not make it impossible to produce food for the people of the world. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, hidden behind the widespread prosperity of our continent is an often invisible Europe that we refer to in numerical, statistical and sociological terms and not as real people. These people are often women and children or the elderly – the most vulnerable population groups in other words. However, Europe will have no credibility in the eyes of the public unless it learns to be consistent, and we want to be consistent, in this Parliament and at this stage in Europe’s existence. Therefore, if we say that the Union is based upon values and human rights, I do not think we can suspend or cut so drastically a programme for people who suffer from food poverty – in other words, for those who lack the right to food or the right to access food and hence lack fundamental rights – on account of an unresolved legal issue. We are talking about an agricultural fund, a social fund – and if it is a social fund, Commissioner, it should not impinge on other social programmes, but be a new ad hoc fund with appropriate resources. We say that we want to guarantee food security for Europeans, but the most important right with regard to food security is the right to food itself, followed by the right to healthy food. We need, therefore, to be consistent. With that in mind, we must find a legal solution that provides continuity and that, with the help of non-governmental organisations in the voluntary sector, guarantees the most fundamental human right: the right to food.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is time to take some bold decisions in this Europe if we want to do more than just survive. The crisis has severely disrupted normal life for European citizens and businesses and, if we do not react, it could mean that the quality of the social and cultural life, the welfare and the future of young people and Europeans, are irreversibly affected. As well as creating valuable cohesion and prosperity, overcoming the crisis means finding solutions to the causes identified: solutions for tackling speculation, which should also be restricted where necessary through the introduction of strict rules for the financial markets; solutions for combating the recession; solutions for combating the imbalanced development model that has put individuals below profit; and solutions for combating the resurgence of nationalism, which is today preventing Europe from making the choices that it has to make. Above all, it is time to provide tools and resources – new and old – so that we can forge ahead and start the engine of growth, with research, innovation, training and support for productive investment, infrastructure and jobs, because without jobs, people have no dignity or rights. Thanks to Mrs Berès and other Members, this report outlines a possible strategy for a Europe that is proud and aware of its role. It is now up to Europe’s leaders, if they exist, to implement it.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that one point that we all agree on and have established is that this programme for frequency harmonisation and coordinated spectrum use can serve a dual purpose. I believe that this is a key point to be remembered at all times; in other words, through the programme, we can develop the great potential for economic exploitation of this field by the telecommunications sector, the audiovisual sector and new services, while, at the same time, giving a boost to economic development and to other sectors linked to the telecommunications sector. We can also develop the potential for cultural and social development that this dual purpose permits and requires. Commissioner, in my opinion this programme should also be seen as an opportunity, so that we respect and uphold certain fundamental principles through the choices we make. Firstly, the principle of media pluralism. The review of the system for managing radio frequencies at European level is very important, and I believe that we must clearly prevent the accumulation of frequency rights and the creation of monopolies and oligopolies, which unfortunately exist in some European countries and which are becoming stronger and gaining a foothold in the broadcasting sector. Secondly, the principle of balance between the liberalisation and opening up of the market to new operators, and fairness, so that the commitments entered into with those operators who have provided substantial investment can also be promoted, supported and maintained on the market. Lastly, transparency and the guarantee of well-managed and well-administered frequency allocations. We are talking about auctions not only to focus on an aspect of the market that should be reconciled with all the possible social uses for spectrum, but also to say that discretion should not be used and unfair advantages should not be given with regard to radio frequencies. This point also deserves close attention. To conclude, unfortunately I do not have the time to expand on the social aspects, but they have been discussed at great length by all the members of my group. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteurs and Mr Barnier for their generous contribution to Parliament. We support the idea of an internal market which is able to understand and meet the social expectations and the implications that the social dimension requires. It is not a pipe dream; it is realistic and also modern. It is this vision that makes the market stronger, because focusing only on the economic element, essentially reducing the market to a question of economics, has shown that it will solve neither problems of growth nor of cohesion. This means, in short, that we must now fully realise the ideal of a European social market economy. In today’s texts, we have this. There is recognition of the social enterprises, cooperatives and their role, of mutual insurance companies and of foundations, which represent 10% of European companies and many of our jobs. These are a reality with real businesses demonstrating economic pluralism and the pluralism of business. They work with capital but not for capital and want to create work, welfare, quality of life and innovation, and to demonstrate that these values should and can be part of the internal market in Europe.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I join all my fellow Members who have spoken in noting that we are at last talking about a common industrial policy again, and I hope action and also specific decisions will be forthcoming again soon. I am grateful for the Lange report, the excellent work done by our fellow Member, and Vice-President Tajani’s communication. This decision means some important things, the first of which is that the revitalisation and recovery of Europe’s economy and the resilience of employment, as has been said, depend partly, and perhaps especially, on the recovery of the whole manufacturing sector, both the more advanced and the more traditional parts of it, and on the support it is given. That is because it is still possible to push the boundaries in manufacturing, something that was not so obvious until a short time ago. Secondly, the recovery of industry in Europe also means that our competitiveness is not only in play in the financial or tertiary sector, but here as well, and it is not too late for us to take up the challenge to make Europe competitive in industry vis-à-vis
 the rest of the world. The third point, as has been said, is that the new industrial policy focuses on factors rather than sectors; it focuses on factors and instruments that can genuinely promote new companies and a new capacity for resilience and modernisation. I feel it is important to highlight once again these new factors on which we need to act: credit – we are calling for new initiatives in addition to those already announced by the Commissioner on the subject of credit – raw materials, energy prices, innovation, research, the need to enhance the capacity for the technological transfer of the results of research and innovation within companies in Europe, in new products and new ways of organising production. We must make good use of a highly unique industrial fabric in Europe, particularly in certain countries, which is that of small and medium-sized enterprises, the quality of enterprises and of their products, and the unique nature of European industry. I think we should rediscover these manufacturing traditions and manufacturing roots in many countries in order to innovate and change them. Lastly, there is the question of location, which is very important. European policies are successful if they find a region able to tackle them. We therefore thank Mr Lange and look forward to an excellent collaboration with the Commission in order to arrive at concrete results very soon. Patrizia Toia  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is not easy to find so much unanimity in Parliament This means that the work was really outstanding and Mrs Van Brempt and all the other shadow rapporteurs should be made aware of this. It has been said that the resulting instrument is very positive for several reasons. It is positive because its procedures and timeframes are fast; positive because it is aimed at highly qualified project categories; positive because it is aimed at urban contexts, in other words, at local authorities which, by making specific decisions, are able to bring about real change in the state of affairs and improve air quality, housing quality and urban transport quality; positive because it is aimed at profitable projects and can therefore yield a return of resources; and positive, lastly, because the strategy will bring many more resources into play. In the face of all this, however, picking up on an objection raised by many Members, including Mr Geier, Mr Turmes and Mr Cancian, I wish to say to the Commissioner that the sticking point will be the implementation, the choice of financial intermediaries, the relationship with local authorities and how their financial difficulties are dealt with. Commissioner, this instrument raises the possibility of opening the way to other projects, to a stabilisation of this instrument and its extension to other sectors. The topic is crucial. The same thing must not happen that happened with the Recovery Plan and with the small and medium-sized enterprises that are still waiting for the EUR 30 billion approved by Parliament and the Commission at the end of 2008.

 I just wanted to inform you that my voting machine was not working for the Hoang Ngoc report. I was voting against it. Patrizia Toia,  
rapporteur. 
− (IT) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report which we are debating this evening and on which we shall vote tomorrow is part of a major effort to implement the 20/20/20 package, which I believe is still one of the most far-sighted and significant things to have come out of the last European parliamentary term. If asked what I would save from the last five years, I would definitely place the 20/20/20 package at the top of the list. I believe that it is important to add that some very intense work went into this report, on the part of both the European Commission – a communication and a recommendation preceded this report – and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and others. They enriched the initial report and our work with many suggestions, additions and amendments. I believe that there is still a slight difference of opinion within Parliament over one point, and I hope that it can be overcome with tomorrow’s vote. It concerns the more or less binding nature that we wish to attribute to the contents of this report, which I would like to make a point of saying was drafted in a context of great understanding and great unanimity. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) represent an important sector, not least, in fact, because of the weight they carry in the European economy: they account for 7% of the labour force – of the European labour force – and 6% of GDP, thus a significant share of the European economy and of the European productive and labour force too. They are also very important not only, precisely, for what they represent, but also for the contribution they can make and for the essential, significant role that they can play in terms of trying to achieve this transition from our economy to a situation in which the economy, though still developed, produces fewer emissions and has a lower carbon content and will thus pollute less for our future and for that of the generations to come. In short, they can represent – not in words, but in concrete actions – changes that can lead to a way of producing, living, travelling and consuming in our society, and to that industrial revolution that, for many, will actually characterise the future of social and economic life, not only on our continent but throughout the entire world. How can ICTs make this major contribution to transforming our economy? Firstly, by changing the sector itself: the report is intended to demonstrate how this sector can, first and foremost, look within itself to see how it can produce communication, microelectronic and other instruments that consume less energy, and are thus inherently more efficient. Next, they can make an enormous contribution in the major sectors, in the housing and transport sectors. The latter two – I am quoting data from the Commission – are sectors in which greater efficiency, according to the European rules and the targets also laid down by the 20/20/20 package, can lead to a very substantial reduction in these emissions – since, today, the transport sector consumes 26% of the energy in Europe, and 40% is consumed in homes for heating and cooling, depending on the season – and can achieve very high levels of efficiency. This is without mentioning that the scope, in the case of the major sectors, affects our lives in very significant areas. I am thinking of the entire banking sector, of the relationships within public administration, of the entire e
-government sector and of all the services, in short, which, with the application of these technologies, will be able not only to reduce their carbon emissions but also to save time, with a consequent improvement in the quality of life of Europeans and in the quality of social life. This is, therefore, highly significant. However, I believe that this report will be all the more significant if Parliament approves its binding character tomorrow. I would like to offer just two examples, Mr President, if I may: smart meters and the smart grid, and smart cities. 
Only yesterday, 700 European mayors concluded a new agreement in this House, before our President and the European Commissioner, aimed precisely at improving the efficiency of cities, which are home to more than 70% of European citizens and which can thus make a major contribution to increasing efficiency and economic and social development.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is not just a routine debate but it is supposed to be very specific and to ask clear and precise questions – what resources are there and where to get them – and I hope that Parliament is expecting equally clear and precise answers, today and at the forthcoming Councils on 12 and 25 March. We want to tell the Commission and the Council firmly that the European Union, which has flown the flag for the fight against atmospheric emissions and climate change in front of the world, now has to be consistent if it does not want to lose credibility. It must do everything it can to achieve these goals. We must be well aware that talking about a low-emission economy means a kind of Copernican revolution for the production system; it means changing many things, having clear priorities and political will but, above all, sufficient resources and instruments. We also know that this Copernican revolution is vital for our production system, European industry, to remain competitive. In many countries, in many research centres and in many universities, the intellectual resources are ready, the capabilities are there and the will is there: it is now time to set things in motion. Everyone has to do it, as the Commissioner and the Council have said: the Member States, entrepreneurs and the private sector have to do it. I believe, however, that the vital task of putting this complex partnership together belongs to the European Union. Patrizia Toia,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the initiative that we are about to launch is very important for two reasons: the first is the subject of the research, which concerns the fight against neurodegenerative diseases, and the second is the joint programming methods for the research. Clearly, we would have preferred Parliament to have been more directly involved in the pilot project – this has been said and it is the subject of our question. While we must press on now and not bring matters to a halt, we are nonetheless asking for guarantees that our opinion will be taken into account in the Competitiveness Council’s deliberations, and that a more certain legal basis will be defined in future so that Parliament can be fully involved and there can be a greater sense of ownership in this field of research. We must now intervene with adequate means and resources to prevent and eradicate the widespread scourge of Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and the other diseases, which are destined to become more common as our population ages. We call for efforts to be focused on extensive, large-scale studies, aimed both at diagnosis and at identifying cures. Research into biomarkers, into early diagnosis methods based on a multidisciplinary approach, the compilation of vast databases, and the search for curative medicines and appropriate treatment and service models would appear crucial. I wish to make just one request in this House: that we ignore neither the individual circumstances of patients, which are too often excluded in the context of these types of disease, nor the involvement of patients’ and relatives’ associations. From a methodological point of view, we believe that joint research projects are very important because they fulfil an essential requirement: that of pooling efforts and resources and overcoming these divisions, these duplications, and therefore being able to create a critical mass that is sufficient to produce satisfactory results from this type of research. If we consider that, in other parts of the world, joint public and private efforts manage to invest tens of millions of euros, we realise how much there remains for us to do and how much we still have to do, by directing our efforts towards joint projects, towards strategic lines of action and joint programmes between the Member States and Europe and towards common programmes between public and private operators, without disregarding that international framework that puts us in contact with major scientific developments at international level.

 I voted in favour of the draft European Parliament legislative resolution on EU accession to the Protocol for the Protection of the Mediterranean Sea against pollution resulting from exploration and exploitation of the continental shelf and the seabed and its subsoil. The Protocol entered into force on 24 March 2011, following its ratification by six contracting parties (Albania, Tunisia, Morocco, Libya, Cyprus and Syria), and so far has neither been signed nor ratified by the Union. Given that, following the discovery of new reserves of fossil fuels in the Mediterranean, offshore activities are likely to increase, a potential accident could have immediate large-scale effects. For this reason I think that the EU’s ratification of the Offshore Protocol would constitute important leverage to ensure a good level of cooperation and the continued concrete commitment of all Mediterranean countries to the achievement of the maximum possible safety of offshore activities.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the legislative procedure began in November 2010 and has been a demanding task from a technical and political point of view, lasting a good two years and involving three Presidencies. It is therefore appropriate to thank all those who have been involved: the shadow rapporteurs, Parliament’s Secretariat and the political group secretariats and MEPs’ assistants – and, of course, the Commission and the Council. Agreement was reached at first reading, a fact that I consider highly significant. The objective of this regulation is to lay down harmonised rules on the manufacture of agricultural and forestry vehicles with a view to ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market and, in particular, the application of a large number of important criteria to improve operational, road and occupational safety for users, that is to say workers, and standards of environmental protection. In this context, the introduction in Articles 7 and 8 of new operational and occupational requirements may be considered a real success for the whole of the European Parliament, which has succeeded in covering risks which, at present, affect numerous operators, often with fatal consequences: one need only think of protection from electrical discharge or indeed from overturning. In addition, we must not underestimate the importance of worker health and safety, and so we have made provisions for the market surveillance of vehicles, systems and components, in order to ensure that all the provisions are implemented properly and carried out effectively. To sum up, the regulation helps to make industry more competitive, since it simplifies current legislation on the approval of vehicles, making it more transparent and reducing red tape. In fact, 24 base directives and around 25 related amending directives on technical requirements are being repealed and replaced by a single regulation. These aspects are important, because this regulation seeks to achieve other objectives, beyond helping to create a regulated internal market and to provide a framework enabling a competitive, balanced and transparent system. In addition, I believe we are also contributing to strengthening the sector, and in short we are putting in place the conditions for both widening the productive base and increasing employment. The work that has been done is therefore highly important and extremely useful: the compromises found between the political groups are the result of a major collaborative effort undertaken in the right spirit, with the desire to present Parliament with a consensus regulation.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the Vice-President for his contribution. I would not know where to put a tractor, so it is just as well that it is staying where it belongs. I do not think there is anything more to add: the debate has shown the degree of consensus surrounding the proposed regulation on agricultural and forestry vehicles. Now I hope that this consensus will be completely confirmed in the vote in the Chamber. This is what we have worked for, and so I really hope this result can be achieved.

 I voted in favour of the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2008/106/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the minimum level of training of seafarers. Training of a seafarers is an essential element of maritime safety and it is therefore of the utmost importance that crews trained in different countries in accordance with different systems have the necessary skills to carry out their onboard duties safely. The present proposal is aimed at bringing relevant EU legislation on training and certification of seafarers into line with current international standards, improving the wording of the legislative text for the sake of clarity. I therefore consider the proposal to be essential for avoiding conflict between international obligations and the EU obligations of the Member States. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 I voted for the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime. The new directive proposes to establish minimum standards on the rights, support, recognition and the widest protection within the territory of the EU of victims of crime, regardless of their legal status, whether in terms of content or implementation. Since confidence in justice is a priority for all citizens, especially for victims who feel their rights are unheard and out of reach, I think this proposal for a directive is an appropriate means of closing the many gaps and overcoming the many obstacles that currently exist in the single market and in the European area of freedom, security and justice.

 I am voting in favour of the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on administrative cooperation through the Internal Market Information System (‘the IMI Regulation’). The proposal aims to establish a set of common rules which will allow them to further exploit the IMI system’s full potential and encourage a smooth cross-border exchange of information between different authorities in the Member States, guaranteeing, at the same time, a higher level of protection than traditional communication channels. On these grounds, I believe the proposal for a regulation is an essential element to complete the single market and is clearly in the interest of citizens. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is increasingly being called upon to play an important role in the geopolitical changes that are affecting vast areas of the world. I believe that it is ever more urgent to raise the profile and quality of foreign policy, especially because many of these changes are taking place not far from Europe. To achieve this, we need to convince the Member States to invest in European common foreign policy, thereby reinforcing the choices made in the Treaty of Lisbon. Baroness Ashton, we need to move from the current activism – which cannot be denied and is manifest in the many trips you have made to every corner of the world – towards a more central role that will not only leave its mark, but will also adjust the existing equilibrium in favour of European foreign policy. It is to be hoped that it will be possible to dedicate a special session within Parliament to debate the foreign policy and the strategies to be put in place. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in reality, this debate is merely recording our powerlessness in the face of the tragedy that is unfolding in Syria, and I would like to know whether we are simply acknowledging this state of affairs or whether we intend to implement an appropriate, strong political initiative to try and restart diplomatic activity and adopt the necessary choices in the field, starting with the humanitarian corridor. Europe cannot be a passive bystander to the events taking place. Those who think that this situation should be prolonged must be aware that they are taking on a major political and moral responsibility. Is it true, Baroness Ashton, that you feel conditioned by the divisions and inconclusiveness of the Member State chancelleries? If so, this must be said. We need to call loudly upon all the European governments to support your work and your European action consistently, and I would like to hear this call clearly from yourself, Baroness Ashton, here today in the European Parliament.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the choice made by the Council on 7 June does not just concern European internal policy; as you can imagine, it also has an impact outside Europe. Everyone here has said that the free movement of people is one of the greatest European achievements in a Europe that is defined by it. However, restricting that free movement actually implies and portrays a feeling of mistrust that the Council is trying to distil among European countries and into European public opinion, which risks destroying the European project. For some time we have been calling for innovative and modern European governance on the migration issue. What you are doing, though, renationalises immigration policy. You are making rights and freedoms take a backward step, but these choices are likely to have a negative impact on another front, in that they reveal a certain schizophrenia in the action taken by Europe in its various policies. Together we have decided that one of the pillars of the new neighbourhood policy is mobility, a core element of the new European approach, for example towards a changing area such as the Mediterranean. What message are we sending out to these countries, apart from a message of distrust and lack of credibility? Pier Antonio Panzeri,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at long last we can say that the official announcement of the appointment of Mr Morsi, leader of the Justice and Freedom Party, has brought this first phase of the Egyptian political saga to a close; it was never a given, with two highly controversial judgments of the Constitutional Court sending out shockwaves in the days before the results were announced. The first judgment saw the supreme court declare the political isolation law under which Mr Shafiq was made ineligible to stand in the presidential elections as unconstitutional. The second judgment ruled that the electoral law used for the general elections was unconstitutional, thereby dissolving parliament, which could also have consequences for the constituent assembly. Just to complicate matters, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces also issued amendments to the constitution, severely weakening the president’s powers and abolishing autonomous legislative power until a new constitution has been approved. In his first speech as president, Mr Morsi sent what was, for us, a cheering message of unity and conciliation, as he sought to mollify the various sections of Egyptian society. In terms of foreign policy, he affirmed that he would make good on existing international obligations. Now we will have to see whether he is as good as his word. In any case, after a period of extreme uncertainty and instability, the election of a new president could finally open the way to a new phase that might, on the one hand, spur Egypt on to quickly consolidate democracy and rights and, on the other hand, enable efforts to be made to revive the economy and put an end to the ongoing financial crisis. We need, in this area, to make the role of the European Union clearer and more visible, including via the EU-Egypt task force. The EU must be ready to work with the new president to strengthen bilateral relations, to support and see through the transition to democracy, and to overcome the economic and financial problems that could jeopardise the country’s stability.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, it cannot be enough for political and institutional leaders to show their rightful indignation at the horrors unfolding in Syria, and I think you, Baroness Ashton, are aware of that. What is happening beyond our borders requires an appropriate response capacity, and frankly I do not think even the European Union as a whole has sufficient response capacity to meet the challenges facing us. How long must we stand and watch the massacre in Syria? We can understand all the current difficulties resulting from the fragile balance of power in the region; we can understand, yet not agree with, the positions of Russia and China, who will not allow the United Nations to take more incisive action; and we can also understand the mistrust in certain spheres in Europe towards the forces opposing Bashar al-Assad, not least because of their sources of funding. However, we cannot tolerate what is happening any longer. The European Union should go beyond its current activism and take a stronger lead. We have to disprove the idea that the Assad regime can do what it likes because the international community has shown itself to be impotent and that the European Union is too tied up in the economic and financial crisis to allow itself the luxury of intervening in the events in Syria. The decision to create a humanitarian corridor has not been put into practice. I think, though, we should make a fresh start on that and back up that decision with all the means at our disposal, bar none – and I stress, bar none – because that is a vital prerequisite for initiating the transition process and the transfer of power. We now need to turn our words into actions, and that is a task that is clearly yours to shoulder. Pier Antonio Panzeri,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Ms Lunacek has done a great job. I think that the process of consolidation of democracy in Kosovo is a very important factor. Our goal now is to encourage the government authorities in Priština and all the political forces represented in Parliament to persevere in the area of democratic reforms, reforms that are capable of modernising the country and opening a new phase in the political, civil, and economic life of Kosovo. There are still many shortcomings to address – earlier, the Council mentioned them – and they must be addressed with vigour and determination, and first and foremost they must be addressed by the Kosovo authorities with the consistency required. Admittedly, the situation is evolving. We can only welcome the historic agreement reached between Belgrade and Priština on inclusive regional cooperation and on the representation of Kosovo in regional forums. This may seriously promote stability throughout the Western Balkan region and is therefore of great importance for the European Union as well. It is in this context – as Commissioner Füle reminded us – that we welcome the fact that the Commission has initiated a feasibility study for a Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and Kosovo. We must now persevere on this path, because this path may not only bring peace and make the relationship between Serbia and Kosovo more profitable, and may bring these countries even closer to the EU, but also because it may help overcome the prejudices towards Kosovo on the part of those countries that have still not recognised the existence of Kosovo itself. There is thus a task that must be performed by Europe, but first and foremost a task that the Kosovar authorities must fully carry out in order to achieve these goals. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, there is one point on which Parliament has found a broad consensus over the last few weeks. This concerns the need to change the neighbourhood policy towards southern Mediterranean countries, particularly in view of the changes taking place which are producing significant improvements in the spread of democracy, and opening a whole new chapter in the EU’s approach to these countries. Now we need to be consistent and not oscillate between extremes when implementing this neighbourhood policy. It would be absurd and inexcusably incomplete if this policy merely called for more rights and democracy in these countries, and resolutely ignored everything else, starting with economic and trade issues. We have often stated that rights and democracy are established above all also through new economic and financial policies capable of stimulating growth in these countries. Democracy and social and economic growth are inextricably linked. The agreement with Morocco is part of this context. It aims at and must encourage mutual convenience in terms of free trade and the process of integrating the Mediterranean area. I am concerned about Mr Bové’s style of protectionism because, instead of helping the democratic process and rights in these countries, it in fact becomes an objective obstacle to them. For all these reasons it is important that Parliament should approve this agreement, and I hope that tomorrow this will happen. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, a huge effort has been made by the two rapporteurs to redefine European Neighbourhood Policy, which is necessary considering the great changes which are under way, particularly in the Mediterranean region, which is being affected by a new wind transforming a large number of its countries. The huge leap forwards which this new phase has brought about must be achieved with strength and determination, to build the conditions for our support for the transition processes taking place. However, we must be careful because the movements that have begun in these North African countries are not linear: there are and there may be increasing numbers of counter-trends and we cannot be sure or confident of how things will end. Nevertheless, we have to remain involved and not turn our backs on the situation. We should instead monitor these changes, paying closer attention and increasing our involvement. Of course, we should focus our attention on economic and financial issues, on the opening up of markets, on a process of regulated mobility, but now we also need to be more rigorous in demanding that the new laws uphold human rights, equality between men and women, and political and religious plurality. These should be the cornerstones of a new neighbourhood policy if it is to be effective and not run into the mistakes of the past. I hope that the good work carried out by Commissioner Füle continues in this direction. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, despite there still being some pockets of resistance by supporters of the old Libyan regime and even if, while Colonel Gaddafi is still around, the National Transitional Council still fears possible backlashes, it is right and proper to focus our attention on the post-war challenges. The European Union’s role in the process of reconstruction and stabilisation of Libya is extremely important. Aside from the immediate priorities of food, medicine, a plan for security, public order, border control and the highly sensitive issue of withdrawing arms, it is important to prepare for medium- to long-term action. This begins with the contribution necessary for the election process that will open up to institutional capacity building in the transitional phase, and to economic and social development. After the aggressive stage of the crisis which saw the European Union isolated, it is right to think that this is the time to strengthen Europe’s role with the right amount of determination. We do not just have a humanitarian duty, however important that may be, when thinking of the many migrants in Libya. We cannot fail to be present at the table that will redesign the geopolitical structure of the region, which now has another important protagonist in the shape of Turkey, as we are seeing at the moment with Prime Minister Erdogan’s triumphant visits to various Arab countries, just as we cannot delegate management of the post-war phase solely to the group of countries that took part in the NATO mission. There are already signs of competition on the Libyan stage between some Member States which is not subtle and will not have a beneficial outcome. In fact, in the race towards the new Libya it is not difficult to see economic and energy-related interests. The plans for building a democratic Libya are not so clear, and this is what requires hard work and dedication. This is where the importance of the role of the European Union comes in, not least because the road before us is not an easy or a short one, and above all we must bear in mind that a democratic outcome is by no means guaranteed.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow we will vote on an important and compelling resolution that shows Parliament’s will, despite many difficulties, to adopt a clear position on the events that are affecting countries such as Syria, Bahrain and Yemen, together with all the associated problems. It is true that what is happening in other countries, like Tunisia and Morocco, shows that the route to democracy is viable; it may follow a different path, but it is possible. This observation, however, does not dispel the public perception of the policies pursued by the international community and by Europe itself on these events involving the Mediterranean region. This perception questions the idea that foreign policy can apply double standards as it unfolds. In essence, we wonder why things are done one way in Libya and another way in Syria. Certainly, it is clear that different standards apply in foreign policy: from political realism, to the strategic nature of certain areas, to the reluctance of large countries to adopt more definite positions. In any case, this is a contradiction that continues to dog us and which we must be able to tackle. How? In two ways: there is a need for European policy to take more of a leading role, for greater consistency to give credibility to our presence throughout this area; there is a need to give political weight to the idea of a Euro-Mediterranean operating structure that can provide a genuine and lasting reference point for both the north and south sides and that can deal with existing problems. This work needs to be done immediately with the necessary effort and determination. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the turbulent events laden with uncertainties and hopes that are changing the political geography of the southern shores of the Mediterranean are increasingly posing a challenge to Europe and its external policy. In view of what is happening, it should be increasingly important for the European Union to be able to rely on a sound, consistent external policy capable of dealing with a difficult present and planning for a problematic future, in which international relations will be altered and the world will be profoundly changed. In view of the strategic repositioning of countries such as the United States, China and Russia, and growing shortages of raw materials and energy resources, Europe should develop a crucial, decisive role, but it is quite clearly showing itself to be unprepared for such challenges. For some time now, it has been moving too slowly towards coordination of the external and domestic policies of its Member States. There has been no substantial progress. Evidence of this is, on the one hand, the lacklustre action deriving from its external policy and, on the other, the obstinacy of certain countries that are nostalgic for a colonial period that can no longer return and insist on believing that they protect their interests better by doing things alone and not delegating anything to European authority. We need to turn over a new leaf. Baroness Ashton, you have an important role; please fulfil it to the utmost, in the knowledge that the time available is quickly running out. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the criticisms that we have heard here this morning in connection with the petition presented are understandable. I think there is still a long way to go before we can ensure that a possible general agreement on agricultural products with Morocco receives consensus approval. On the one hand, the agreement must respect the need for balance, and not cause serious difficulties for European agricultural producers. On the other, it must respect the need for clear and transparent rules of competition on agricultural markets. This is the path to follow in order to ensure that the relationship between the European Union and Morocco is a positive one. I therefore invite the Commission to look for suitable solutions that do not lose sight of the producers’ interests, but which also do not lose sight of a renewed policy of generosity towards Morocco, particularly in view of the events taking place in the Maghreb. It would be very useful to understand, and I do not want us to end up effectively importing tomato pickers, instead of agricultural products and tomatoes. It is therefore important to carry out a thorough investigation in order to create a new European policy. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, with this review of the EU’s neighbourhood policies, we are setting forth on a journey that will not end any time soon. The events in the Mediterranean signal a process of profound change and they will have lasting consequences, not only for the countries of the region, but also for Europe. We must be aware that the transition to full democracy will not be easy and that these transitions are accompanied by many risks and uncertainties. For this reason, there are numerous things we must do and these will take time. Europe’s response must be characterised by a strategy based on immediate and long-term actions. We must facilitate access to European markets and allow greater mobility. We should organise a conference to explore the possibility of cancelling or renegotiating the debt of these countries which have chosen the road to democracy; we must make adequate financial resources available and provide assistance to the democratic process by strengthening parliamentary institutions and political parties, ensuring the full participation of all citizens. This should all happen within the framework of a revitalised Euro-Mediterranean dialogue. At stake is the strategic, political future of Europe. I believe that Europe must understand that we have to work to the east and the south, but right now, there is a special priority to the south. These policies need fundamental change; we must finally open a new chapter. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, beyond the measures that have been announced, I wonder if European policy is doing enough. It naturally takes time for the European Union to establish leadership, especially in foreign policy, but as we know, certain situations arise and unfortunately do not allow us all the time we would like and actually call for fast action and far-sightedness. Now it is clear that we are still falling short of requirements as far as affairs in the Mediterranean region and particularly Libya are concerned: we need to reflect a little more to recognise that perhaps we will need stronger action to understand what has been happing and also to deploy concerted action towards the Mediterranean. It is in fact clear to everyone that if we look at Libya, there is a substantial difference between the whole of Europe taking joint action and action only being taken by willing countries, as is the case at present. No, my message to the representatives of the Council and Commission is that we are not there yet. The Council has not answered certain questions, and now must do so quickly. I wonder if beyond the humanitarian effort, we really know what to do if the application of Resolution 1973 is not enough and if some countries go beyond their mandate. Secondly, I would like to know the Council's view on the issue of operational command: NATO told us that it is performing a technical role, but not providing political guidance. Do we think we can get along like that, without seeking a stronger and more united European Union voice instead of fobbing the job off onto the few who are willing? Finally, within the framework of ongoing operations and the relationship with the Arab League and the African Union, it is essential to prevent our intervention from ultimately being seen negatively, with the risk of creating uncertainty and dangerous shifts. Are we aware? Perhaps not altogether: these are questions that do not deserve bureaucratic answers but need appropriate policy responses, starting with tomorrow's Council meeting.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the spirit of this debate enables me, Baroness Ashton, to remind you that the Union for the Mediterranean’s Parliamentary Assembly concluded its meeting last week in Rome. It set out several paths that the Commission would do well to return to, in particular, in terms of its suggestions on how to support the democratic transition processes in progress. Hence, I urge you and I urge the Commission to follow the developments in Tunisia intently. This country is objectively a driving force for democracy and is setting a benchmark for the entire region. Regarding Libya, we need to be fully aware that having decreed it part of the international community, the severance of relations with Mr Gaddafi’s regime will have consequences, particularly given that his regime is showing greater resistance than those of Mr Ben Alì and Mr Mubarak. This means that we must act on four fronts right now – and political timescales are decisive – with credibility, sincerity and consistency. We must come up with a suitable European financial plan. I understand the evocative note struck by many, but we need an Ashton Plan rather than a Marshall Plan. We also need a European immigration and asylum policy, a deterrent policy including the closure of airspace, and full support for the opponents of Mr Gaddafi’s regime. Baroness Ashton, it is up to you and your foreign policy ties with the Council to make these points count in the coming days, but also to avoid Europe’s foreign policy being caught unawares again by the events that are changing the Mediterranean.

Mr President, I voted for the motion for a resolution on the progress of Croatia’s accession to the European Union within the framework of the enlargement process, because I attach great importance to starting this process and to the progress made by Croatia. In essence, we hope that the enlargement will extend beyond Croatia and end up encompassing the whole of the Western Balkans. This is one of the key points of Europe’s neighbourhood and enlargement policies. My vote is therefore, without doubt, in favour of the Swoboda report. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the current flood of migrants is a serious problem, and it is a European one. What is needed is not complaints, however, but effective cooperation to tackle the current crisis in a constructive and far-sighted manner. We must take action at two levels, and we will need broad shoulders to bear our responsibilities. The first level concerns the immediate situation. Additional funds must be made available to deal with the crisis; we need at last to prepare a European round table, putting on the agenda the possibility of sharing out the immigrants fairly among the various countries; and, lastly, we have to meet with the provisional Tunisian Government to demand that resources and instruments be put in place to stem the current exodus. The second level is more strictly political in nature. It is absolutely vital to radically review our neighbourhood policies. Action is needed based on a renewed policy of economic, financial and social cooperation, an intelligent immigration policy, and effective support for the economic reforms and the democratic transition process under way in Tunisia. It is only by taking such action that we will be able to tackle and solve the problems now facing Italy and Europe. Commissioner, I am sure you will agree with us all that it really is time now to stop talking and start acting. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Baroness Ashton, I get the impression that you are not yet sufficiently aware of what is going on in the Mediterranean region. I have to say that the slowness of the EU institutions in addressing the Mediterranean question can only be explained by a lack of awareness of the situation and an inability to sense the changes that are afoot. We are coming to the end of a political and historical era in which Europe’s policy towards the South has been muddled and counterproductive. The economic crisis, difficulties faced in migrating and the lack of changeover among the ruling classes have created an explosive combination that is affecting Tunisia and Egypt now, but is likely to spread to other countries. To address some of my fellow Members also, I would say that we will not get away with thinking that all we need to do is to simply give our support to the demonstrations that are currently taking place. Europe needs to show greater political maturity. To do this, we need to retune Europe’s political antennae. Europe’s foreign policy needs to come out of its semi-secretive mode and take a leading role on the international stage in supporting the democratic transition processes currently underway. In particular, we need clear policies in a number of areas: a new partnership and neighbourhood policy, and a new security policy for the Mediterranean region; greater willingness from the whole of Europe to address the Mediterranean issue; and a policy of joint action so that Europe will be acting in the region alongside other players, such as the United States and Turkey. We need a major change of course and this calls for an act of considerable humility on the Commission’s part in reopening the debate on foreign policy towards the Mediterranean and taking a fresh look at the Union for the Mediterranean, whilst at the same time ensuring that Europe has a role within it. This is crucial for Europe, and we need to be fully aware of this. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, requests to debate this topic have been made several times, and commitments have been adopted each time to put the required initiatives into practice in the Sahel region, whether to stabilise the region or to ensure greater security. As we know, given the lack of borders and the huge size of the region, the Sahel is an ideal area of transit for drug traffickers and terrorist groups, specifically al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. The weakness and instability of the states in this region are the main problem and, as has been pointed out, the threats directly affect the peoples and countries in the region, particularly Mauritania, Mali and Niger. The main task the European Union has to address is to draw up a credible security strategy based on the various facets of possible European action: cooperation and development policy, regional programmes, coordination strategies for highway security, and security training policies. Hence, the European Union not just should, but must intervene as quickly as possible, and therefore we are looking forward to the Commission drawing up a complete strategy, as you announced, Baroness Ashton, as well as strong intervention on the ground. To conclude, my request is clear: we need to pay far greater attention to what is happening south of Europe, because many things are about to change and we had better not be caught unprepared. It could only do the EU good to be more far-sighted. Pier Antonio Panzeri,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the work done by Mrs Gomes in my view makes a serious contribution to what the Commission should do in defining the framework agreement. Libya undoubtedly plays a decisive role in the fight against terrorism, in peace and security in Africa, in the fight against illegal immigration in the Mediterranean, and in the energy sector. Our aim in the context of the European Union’s strategy must therefore be to consolidate Libya’s integration into an international political and economic system based on shared rules. To achieve that, a number of conditions need to be imposed on Libya, and that is what the recommendation is calling for. First of all, in the matter of immigration, Libya is clearly a transit country. This is an extremely important subject, but it cannot be seen simply in terms of security, stopping immigration and refoulement. The subject involves the need for a government ruled by the streams of economic and social policies equal to the challenge of migration, the issues of the recognition of political refugees and the ratification by Libya of the Geneva Convention and, lastly, the problem of the readmission of immigrants based on concrete guarantees to safeguard the immigrants’ living conditions. Then there is the question of launching economic and democratic reforms to make decidedly more room for democracy in this important country. We shall have to take this issue into ever greater account, as the events in neighbouring Tunisia are showing. Lastly, this recommendation calls for reflection on the issue of bilateral agreements. Such agreements can certainly make a valid contribution to defining and solving problems, but they are not the final answer. For example, the problem we have with Italian fishing boats shows that the bilateral agreement option does not address these problems. Now, however, the review of the partnership and neighbourhood policies also involves the call to rethink the Libya question in a new framework, which means including Parliament. Many of us have called for the Council’s mandate for the framework agreement to be made known. In this respect, Commissioner, there is a real need to break step and involve the European Parliament more and more in defining new policies for the countries to the south of Europe.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we share the concerns about what is happening in Tunisia and express our sadness about the many people who have lost their lives during the protests. The new and confused situation that began after the flight of former president, Mr Ben Ali, must now lead to the objective that many have asked for: the start of economic and social reforms to match the expectations of the vast majority of the population and the opening up of democratic forums, to ensure that civil society and the various opposition forces are increasingly involved in public life and in government. Obviously, all countries have the right to determine their own path, but we are keen for these reforms to be carried out and for the changes to be real and not merely window dressing. What is happening in Tunisia at the moment poses questions for all of us and poses questions for Europe, with all its delays and mistakes. In 1995, the European Union launched the partnership programme with the Mediterranean in Barcelona. This was supposed to include economic, political, military and even social and human cooperation, but not even in the two key objectives has this been achieved. In terms of the economy, there has been a drastic reduction in regional and infrastructural projects because the funds never arrived from Member States and those from the Commission remain in standby. The promised free trade zone does not exist, but the most obvious failure is on the political level, and we need to be fully aware of this, Commissioner. The Union for the Mediterranean was launched in 2008, but remains a façade. The summit that was supposed to be held in November 2010 has been postponed indefinitely. The problem is that the various European governments are not interested and do not see any interest in real cooperation. They prefer to maintain relationships with questionable regimes that are wedded to the defence of their undemocratically managed national resources, whilst millions of young people live without any future prospects but emigration, which is increasingly difficult. It is no great surprise then that, spurred on by the economic and social crisis, the protests in Tunisia have turned into a tidal wave capable of having a heavy impact on the existing power structure. European political realism is no longer useful as a result of the fear of Islamic fundamentalism, and perhaps the time has come to finally shelve that post-colonial attitude that tends to re-emerge every now and then in relations with north African countries. Indeed, taking Barcelona as a starting point, Europe needs a new vision of its southern reaches and the Mediterranean, which must be more credible than in the past. This implies a complete overhaul of the partnership and neighbourhood policies that have been followed thus far, and I would insist that you attend to this, Commissioner. We cannot hide the fact that both the Commission and the Council were even ready to start discussions with Tunisia for an advanced status agreement. On the basis of what criteria it was thought that all this was possible is still to be explained. We need to change tack – change gear – and we are telling the Commission and the Council that this can be achieved by showing more conviction in giving Parliament a role in the elaboration and application of a new idea of partnership with the countries of the Mediterranean. All of this is not solely in the interest of these countries but is, above all, in the interest of Europe. Many of the problems that Europe appears to have can only be tackled and resolved by a productive and virtuous relationship with all the Maghreb countries. Supporting economic and democratic reforms, as well as simultaneously deploying all the necessary antidotes to fundamentalism and terrorism, is a difficult road but is the only one to take. There is reason to hope that the tragic and bitter lesson being imparted by Tunisia can serve to give all of us a better understanding of what is worth doing and what is worth changing in terms of Europe’s actions.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to say to Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra that, ahead of resolving the conflict between Plato and the truth, perhaps we needed a little more time before coming up with this resolution, for at least two reasons. Firstly, we could have collected all the information to help guarantee that Parliament would take a more solid stance and, secondly, a series of meetings and hearings had got under way in the relevant committees Parliament took the legitimate decision to move ahead immediately, In any case, this does not diminish the requirement for these hearings and the need to keep the negotiations with Morocco open. I therefore believe that, after the vote, it is a good idea to apply our efforts in three specific directions: establishing a new leading role for Europe, with its diplomacy and neighbourhood policies; contributing to a positive outcome to the negotiations opened by the United Nations; and, finally, using all parliamentary instruments – beginning with the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the mixed committee – to ensure that the meeting goes ahead and helps find solutions. I think it would be helpful to work determinedly towards these specific objectives. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, someone might surely object to the reasons that have led the European Parliament to debate and pass judgment on a legislative act that a democratically elected parliament like the Israeli Knesset is adopting. Such objections are understandable, but there are at least two basic reasons why this debate is necessary. The first is the unique nature of the situation in the Middle East, resulting from a conflict that has lasted too long and does not only involve Israel. The second is the important role played by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in that area, both on the humanitarian aid side and in connection with development cooperation policies. Besides, the Israeli authorities themselves should assess that role carefully, because without the work done by all the NGOs, the tensions in the region would be greater and much more serious. For that reason, it will be perfectly natural to suggest to the Knesset, when it intends to legislate on this subject, that it should set out two clear objectives in addition to the changes already made: to ensure transparency for funding, applying without bias to everyone, including organisations like the settlers’ NGOs, for example; and to make it possible in practical terms for all the NGOs to work, since their work is important, not least for the future of the peace negotiations themselves.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I call for the words ‘all the people’ to be deleted when reference is essentially being made to the dialogue. Therefore, the final sentence should be: ‘considers that both parties should take a pragmatic approach to the dialogue for the benefit of Kosovo and Serbia’. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it has already been said that tomorrow, we will vote on the motion for a resolution on Kosovo drafted by Mrs Lunacek. Today’s discussion and tomorrow’s vote are very important and are a useful contribution to the process of stabilising Kosovo and the Western Balkans as a whole. If it is to honour the commitments it has made, Europe must work to ensure that three primary objectives are fully met in Kosovo: a stronger and more complete integration of the Albanian and Serbian communities, full implementation of the rule of law and the strengthening of Kosovo’s democratic institutions. Moreover, these are essential conditions if Kosovo is to move more decisively towards the European integration process. In this context, the European Union must be very demanding with itself and with the authorities in Kosovo, through its presence there, so that the democratisation process can move forward in the country and can embark on the road to European integration. We need to be aware that there are still many things to be done. The European Union must play an active role, which means also following the guidelines provided by the European Parliament. I therefore believe that this much hoped for process – and I do hope that this motion is adopted by the European Parliament and that all of the groups come together in some way – has a very important role, which I believe is negotiation, dialogue and opening an honest relationship between Serbia and Kosovo for two reasons: to stabilise the relationship between the two countries and to prepare the entire region in the best possible way for a European future; and we hope that this will happen in the not too distant future. We as Parliament and the European Union must assume this responsibility with the necessary determination. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, nothing can justify what happened and I am sorry to say that we are faced with an act of rank amateurism by the Israelis. Perhaps the Israeli leadership is not yet properly aware that Israeli security will be achieved only if the peace process goes ahead and not by raising the tension. Against this background, the resolution tabled to Parliament is an important response by this institution to the difficult question of Gaza. This affair, with all its dramatic overtones, nevertheless forces Europe to step up the quality of its dealings with the Middle Eastern question. Mrs Ashton, I think you are aware that today, we need new leadership within Europe; stronger action with the aim of setting the indirect negotiations on the right path. Stop this senseless settlement policy and lift the blockade on Gaza. By adopting this resolution, the European Parliament offers an important benchmark. Make use of it so that European action can make a serious contribution to overcoming the conflict and winning over all extremist positions, while also achieving the goals of the two states.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we are taking an extremely significant step forwards by adopting this report, and it will be very useful with a view to the Barcelona Summit of 7 June, a summit which, as we know, is set to be difficult given the deadlock in negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians, and also owing to various uncertainties and difficulties regarding the definition of the administrative set-up of the new secretariat structure. Faced with these problems, the Peillon report has been drafted in the only way possible, highlighting, on the one hand, that the conflicts must not hinder tangible progress towards multilateral cooperation in specific sectors, while acknowledging, on the other, that the Union for the Mediterranean will not be fully successful unless these conflicts are settled. Therefore, the real challenge now involves a clear, robust political commitment which must come out of the Barcelona Summit, finally enabling the structures of the new institution to function and commit to providing the funds necessary for the major projects that are its main objective. Europe must realise that it needs to turn its political and economic efforts and its own interests southwards, because it is here that it can find the solutions to many of the problems currently plaguing it.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are aware of the differences that exist between the various regulatory frameworks of the individual countries, and we also know that various interpretations of European and national case law are currently leading to a large number of infringements and disputes within the Member States. The lack of a European Union policy is no longer sustainable in the light of the challenges posed by the cross-border nature of online gambling services. Moreover, the rapid spread of the Internet and of electronic trade in recent years has given rise to an increase in the supply of online games and to the consequent emergence of cross-border issues, which remain unresolved. For this reason, I am convinced that the European institutions should rise to the common challenges, such as the protection of consumers – and more specifically of children – and the prevention of crime and fraud, but also to the challenges concerning the fight against the illegal and unauthorised supply of services, which the national governments alone cannot cope with. The Commission must therefore respond to Parliament’s requests and strive to obtain a European regulatory framework. It must do so by showing the necessary determination. Commissioner, your good will is not in question, and that is why I say to you that the consultation is a good idea and that the green paper is also a good idea, provided that it is used to identify the correct legislative framework and is not just an end in itself. The old Commission very often drafted too many green papers and white papers without any decisions being taken. However, I believe that you realise, Commissioner, that we need decisions and not just words. Pier Antonio Panzeri,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we had to give an opinion on the existing relations between the European Union and Tunisia, it could only be a positive one, including as regards the stabilisation of the region. It is true that important progress has been made in economic terms, and there are also encouraging signs from a social point of view. However, in political terms, following the presidential elections on 25 October, we are faced with the problem of supporting the journey towards democratic reforms with greater concrete action. As we know, the European Union’s objective, in pursuing its foreign policy, is to develop and consolidate democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Tunisia has made some important commitments in the context of the Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan on democracy, governance and human rights. The action plan lays down a series of priorities and, amongst these, particular attention must be paid to implementing and consolidating reforms, and to strengthening political dialogue and cooperation, particularly in relation to democracy and human rights, foreign policy and security. It is within this framework that the institutions must be strengthened. The latter allow the increased participation in political life of the various members of Tunisian society, greater development of the role of civil society, continued support for political parties to broaden their participation in the democratic process, and greater respect for freedom of association, freedom of expression and media pluralism. We are convinced that these objectives can be achieved, and it is reasonable to expect tangible progress to be made. Our commitment is to safeguard the friendship which binds the European Union and Tunisia while consolidating the existing relationship, including in view of the conflict which could arise concerning the idea of an advanced status for that country. However, concrete steps really must be taken by Tunisia itself. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I consider the resolution that we are discussing today in Parliament to be genuinely positive. To dwell on part of this, I consider that the topic of European enlargement to the western Balkans is, and must remain, one of the linchpins of European action in the coming months. I would like to compliment the Swedish Presidency and, above all, Commissioner Rehn on their work. We must nevertheless feel more involved in the process of enlargement. Some countries must undoubtedly step up their action on the legal front in terms of the fight against crime and reforms. Yet we must not lose sight of the political aim, which is to consolidate democracy in those countries and have them follow the European path in economic, social and infrastructural terms. I am thinking, for example, of countries such as Kosovo – and in this regard I agree with the amendment tabled by Mrs Lunacek with regard to the Roma issue – because this is a country we cannot sideline merely because five European countries have not yet recognised its independence. To sum up, we need the right amount of courage and a far-sighted policy that is up to the challenge that the process of enlargement sets all of us. Pier Antonio Panzeri  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, believe that this cooperation agreement with Tajikistan really is very positive and can help to achieve what I believe are some important and precise objectives. The first objective concerns the strategic position of that country, which can genuinely be of use in promoting an area of peace, security and stability. The second objective, I believe, is and must be to encourage the growth of that country from an economic and social point of view, because we know that it is one of the poorest countries in the region. Lastly, we must ensure that freedom, democracy and rights are the fundamental elements that govern the application of this agreement. Leaving aside any limitations that may be found, I believe we should welcome the report on which we are voting in this House. Pier Antonio Panzeri (S&amp;D).

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when debating foreign policy issues, such as today’s issue involving Iran, there is always the risk, as we know, of lagging slightly behind the events taking place. However, there is no doubt that the European Parliament, if it wants to, can play an important role in urging Europe and the international community to take the current events seriously and to implement all of the initiatives needed to ensure that the process of introducing a democratic system in Iran can actually take place. Following the close attention paid by the international public to the post-election period in Iran and the street demonstrations that the Iranian regime sought to repress with the use of violence, it is important to ensure that silence does not descend on the situation in the country. Being realistic about things does not mean taking the Iran issue off the agenda. It is also up to us to keep this level of attention high, and it is also up to the Swedish Presidency – which I thank for the points it has made today – to promote a strong initiative, together with the United States, Russia and other countries, in order to change the way in which issues in Iran, from democratic rights to the nuclear issue itself, develop.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry that I do not agree with your optimism; based on what I know, I would call it Rio -20, because we have gone back about 20 years. No binding document, no definition of the future we want, but of course, without Mr Obama, Mr Cameron and Ms Merkel – who alone represent more than 30% of the entire gross domestic product and who were, in fact, in Mexico at the G20 summit – what could have been decided? Only safe ideas for those who want business as usual, such as the green economy, masterfully represented as one of the instruments available in order to achieve sustainable growth, and for the adoption of policies, which should not, however, be subject to rigid rules. The divisions, inconsistencies and injustices will therefore remain and the separation of economic, social and environmental spheres will continue to cause disasters. Yes to recognising climate change, reducing natural disasters, energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions, and yet nothing concrete – as if to say, the house is burning and we are not doing anything to put out the fire. Other evident sticking points: that the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) did not become a real environment body and that no High Commissioner was appointed for future generations. What can we do now? Only be aware that interdependence can help us cope with the crisis we are experiencing and therefore that a new governance is absolutely necessary in order to move forward. The Commission could set an example: get the financial institutions responsible for a large part of this crisis around a table and ask them to commit to a plan of growth, inclusion, fairness and development, which respects and protects the environment and people. For its part, Parliament can come up with a universal statement of interdependence and democracy, which also guarantees right of access to natural resources and then ask the biggest States in the world to join in. For once, it would not be up to the young people or banks or large corporations, but the democratically elected representatives to decide the future we want. Vittorio Prodi  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, I have been defending the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) programme since I arrived in Parliament and I now feel the need – after letters, oral and written questions, resolutions, meetings, debates, hearings and newspaper articles – to remind those who seem to have forgotten what the benefits of this programme are, as listed in a publication written, among others, by the NEREUS Network of European Regions Using Space Technologies. Here are just some of the areas that the EU will put at risk without GMES: air quality, monitoring of climate change adaptation, EU water policy, the INSPIRE programme for geospatial information, civil protection and emergency services, agriculture and forests, services to the marine environment, monitoring of illegal activities, energy management and urban mapping. To these I would like to add the support, in particular to African countries, for all the technology currently needed to manage the environment. Given this non-exhaustive list of the merits of GMES, could Commissioner Barnier – who I am sure is an advocate of the benefits of GMES – explain who it is that does not wish for the GMES programme to operate as it has done so far, and why? Why is the Commission hiding behind Council decisions, when we have evidence that at least eight major countries have asked to put GMES back into the multiannual financial framework? Who is insisting (and why?) on adopting an intergovernmental approach with an agreement that would make Parliament’s control of one of the most important space programmes much more difficult, rather than facilitating it as required by the Treaty of Lisbon? Let it be known that we are friends of GMES: the Commission seems to agree, and claims simply to be following the orders of the Council, the Council itself substantially agrees, and the regions are clamouring for GMES to be fully implemented. It must also be noted that, at this time of crisis, GMES is one of the few sectors where jobs are not being slashed and in which European companies can still boast a competitive edge. Parliament has repeatedly expressed its full support for GMES. Commissioner Barnier, please tell those in the Commission and its services who are against GMES that it is time to stop. We have to work for Europe and for its young people, so as to make their future less hopeless. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Vittorio Prodi  (S&amp;D

Mr President, it is clear that this is possible and is also one of the types of data that Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) can consistently deliver. In any case, I was referring to Africa as a whole continent that needs these supports. The additional costs are tiny for us, but for Africans may hold the prospect of great progress and participation. Vittorio Prodi  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, these are truly European items of infrastructure that are vital for implementing European policies. Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) is specifically for security, the environment and the management of mitigation policies, of global warming and the review of extreme meteorological events. It must be included in the European Union’s multiannual budget. If that is not possible, this may be the time to make use of project bonds, which also have an anti-recession function. I am convinced that this is an investment in our future and that it will pay dividends in a very few years’ time. Commissioner, let us go forward along this path. Vittorio Prodi,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution on the Rio+20 summit highlights the crucial principle of fairness. Fairness on an international scale that guarantees developing countries their right to development; intergenerational fairness that does not make those who come after us pay the price for our decisions; fairness that thus develops into genuine solidarity and a vehicle for a new kind of sustainable development. We must reject the old concept of the three independent pillars – economic, social and environmental – and instead recognise the interdependent nature of these elements, because they are indivisible. Determining the conditions for genuinely sustainable development requires us not only to develop new standards, such as the Beyond GDP project, but also to guarantee the active involvement of all parties at all levels of governance. It is precisely by focusing on the indivisible nature of fairness, solidarity and global governance that we can break out from behind the barrier of false freedoms and return to social models based on the individual and the common good. Rio+20 is therefore an appeal for a noble ethics and it is in such a context that both the financial and the technological proposals made by the European Parliament gain value. These span the tax on international financial transactions, support for environmental conservation projects, a broader horizon of comprehensive fiscal reform replacing taxes on labour by taxes on resource use and assessment of the impact that production of biofuels can have on food supply and biodiversity, with the focus on global assessment of impact of technology on the environment and society. Our proposals are intended to prepare the ground for an international conference that would mark a true political turning point in planning the development of our planet. Vittorio Prodi  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, overall the report by Mrs Andrikienė report is an excellent report, which the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists &amp; Democrats in the European Parliament have worked hard on to provide ideas of the utmost value. Human rights have constituted one of the fundamental pillars of the European Union since its creation and respect for them is an essential point that the European Parliament must encourage every day. Wider acceptance of human and fundamental rights, globalisation and changes in our society require a new and different outlook that does not fit any of our existing canons. It therefore becomes essential to guarantee equal access to natural resources, as one of the fundamental rights of each individual. In the coming years, climate change will lead to an enormous number of refugees fleeing the poorest areas of the Earth and it is our duty to begin to take note of these potential migratory flows so that we can establish appropriate policies that will enable respect for the dignity of these people to be guaranteed. The expression ‘climate refugee’ has not yet entered the vocabulary of current international law. Naturally, we remain committed to the fight against desertification, just as we do to adjusting to climate change. These are the topics I have attempted to add to the text of the report, so that a serious debate can be opened on the issues. Vittorio Prodi  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to the Commissioner and to the entire EU delegation, who have helped to keep the process alive. However, we have not solved the real problems: firstly, we need to give political expression to the Bali Declaration – in particular, with regard to what we in Parliament have already called climate justice – and we need to generalise and simplify the emissions trading system, because it is inconceivable to have a market mechanism where half of the emissions quota is given away free. Secondly, I would like to stress the need to promote instruments for monitoring, reporting and verifying, in particular, those of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) range of services, of the satellites that will provide absolutely vital data in this area.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Vice-President Ashton, the defenders of human rights play a crucial role throughout the world, often putting their lives on the line. Respect for human rights is one of the basic values of the European Union and has always underpinned its construction. This is why it is now important to keep focusing attention on compliance with these rights as a whole. The work done in Parliament on this subject is crucial in ensuring this and I therefore thank the rapporteur Mrs Hautala for her excellent report to which the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament made a crucial and constructive contribution. We must, in fact, seek to look beyond. I believe the time has come to take clear responsibility, in other words, to begin to treat respect for human rights as a complex phenomenon; we must now seek to achieve a higher and more comprehensive acceptance of these rights. I am firmly convinced, Mr President, that fundamental rights should include the right of equal access to natural resources, to water and also to food, the right to health care, the right to education and the right of access to information. With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, I also feel we are bound to make the most of the new External Action Service by making sure it encompasses organisations and figures distinguished by their respect for human rights. This morning, in fact, Mrs Ashton mentioned the Russian Federation and our dealings with the Federation in this context. Such challenges, which we face a daily basis, are often underestimated. The European Union can and must continue to play a leading role on the international stage in taking up such challenges. Vittorio Prodi,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, climate change is a real threat that we must be ready to face despite the varying impact it will have on our countries. The degradation of ecosystems will cause a severe blow to the health of our economies and of European citizens. We have already in the past called for climate diplomacy and justice: now we have to build it, speaking with a single voice. I am convinced that the European Union must maintain the lead in the battle against climate change and that any delay in implementing that action will increase environmental, social and economic costs out of all proportion. We must first of all recognise the central role of local and regional authorities and the need to work with them to coordinate environmental and economic innovation facilitated by technological progress. By adopting the White Paper, we call on the Commission and Member States to promote public-private partnerships to help finance all of the initiatives tied to the adaptation policies. Each square metre of our territory has to be cared for to preserve the soil and retain water so as to prevent erosion and to supply the aquifers, including through direct reinjection of surface waters. In order for adaptation to be possible, a systemic approach which includes renewable energies will be necessary. I would like to warmly thank all of my colleagues who contributed to the success of this report. (Applause

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the 13th session of the UN Human Rights Council is an extremely important occasion. I would simply like to mention one or two cases that are not addressed very often. Specifically on the subject of prisons, but not those for terrorists, I would like to point out the truly inhumane conditions of the prisons in Rwanda and in Libya, where totally innocent people held in detention are sentenced to death. Furthermore, I would like to mention the issue of the Sahrawi people, which has remained unresolved for so long now, and I would also like to mention the rights of climate refugees who are driven from their countries by dramatic forms of climate change. These are all factors that must be taken into account, precisely because they are also the foundations of our society. Vittorio Prodi  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Mr Carlgren, Mr Dimas, ladies and gentlemen, this morning I would like to talk about an 84-year-old missionary, Father Ettore Turrini, who has spent 59 years in the north-west of the Amazon. He has always fought to protect the indigenous people and their forest from anyone seeking to destroy them in the name of short-term interests. In travelling round the forest, Father Ettore has had seven air accidents, but he has carried on and has obtained tens of thousands of signatures through his activities, which he will submit to President Lula, to many ministers and to the Italian President, Mr Napolitano. He has been indefatigable. We met last Sunday and I told him that I fully shared his position, but that perhaps the world is coming to its senses and reaching the conclusion that these forests are essential as the world’s lung, for the local climate and also for carbon capture and storage. I told him that in Copenhagen, we will also find resources to compensate those countries that keep the forests intact. I told him that we are setting up monitoring instruments – GPS and INSPIRE – to measure how governments behave and that by 2030, we will put a stop to deforestation. In Copenhagen, we will be able to do all this and I will participate in the summit on behalf of Father Turrini as well.
