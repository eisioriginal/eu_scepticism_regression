Dear colleague, I do not have any doubt that those who can speak, will speak, but it is not a convention. The Rules of Procedure stipulate that it is up to the chairing President to decide when and how it is allowed. Excuse me, but that is for clarification. Alexander Alvaro  (ALDE

Mr President, this is turning into groundhog day. Every seven years, we have renewed squabbling over money. As Jutta Haug has rightly said, the Member States bicker like children. Once again, we are becoming embroiled in discussions over whether there should be 5 % more or 5 % less for agricultural subsidies and essential investment in research and development, instead of talking about the priorities and where the European Union should be going in future. The fundamental problem is becoming increasingly obvious. Our Member States are all egotists. The question is always: ‘What can I get from the European budget?’, not ‘What can I contribute in terms of added value to this budget?’. Instead of shared European interests, the EU is dominated by 27 sets of national interests.  Unless we manage to formulate some shared interests for the European Union, we will set the course for its ultimate demise. That is something that no rational Member of this House could possibly want. The multiannual financial framework must be seen as an opportunity to define these European interests. President.  
− That concludes this item. However, I gather – the later the evening, the more welcome the guests, as the saying goes – that we can fit in Mr Watson, who is still on the list, for one minute before we move on to the next agenda item. President.  
− That does now conclude this item. President. −

I voted in favour of this report because I believe that the discharge decision for the European Medicines Agency (EMA) cannot be based upon additional requirements, such as the guidelines of the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development), when the implementation of those requirements has not been officially requested by either the EU legislator or specific arrangements within the Agencies during the respective discharge procedure. The European institutions are therefore invited to examine whether it is advisable to incorporate and to commit to additional guidelines in a possible common framework for all European institutions and bodies. On the basis of the data available, I agree that discharge can be granted to the Executive Director of the European Medicines Agency in respect of the implementation of the EMA’s budget for the financial year 2010.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time we have met to discuss this issue, although it may be the first time that we have met at this hour. The question now arising, slowly but surely, is this: when will our debate about data retention finally be at an end? A great many Member States and their constitutional courts have decided that it is not compatible with national constitutions. The Irish High Court referred the matter to the European Court of Justice, and countless citizens in the Member States have not only expressed disquiet and incomprehension about data retention but reject it outright.  I hate to say it, but our assessment all those years ago, when this issue was first discussed in 2005, was correct. We have legal issues which are unresolved; we have economic issues relating to data retention which are unresolved; and we have technical issues which are unresolved. Above all, we have social issues which are unresolved. The Commission’s evaluation report clearly showed the extent to which the approach to data retention, procedures and use vary between the Member States. In some countries, for example, the coastguard can access dossiers of retained data; in others, authorities can make a verbal request. The evaluation report also showed that everything has been achieved, except for harmonisation on issues of data retention. The question whether it is needed at all is still unanswered. In that sense, the authors are rightly asking when we can expect a new initiative from the Commission. It is time to stop flogging a dead horse, which is what data retention is. I would hope that we will have the opportunity to discuss a reform before the end of this legislative term and, in particular, to hear the Commission’s proposals during this debate. I hope we will find out more this evening. I do not want to speak for too long, so let me finish by saying this: I am sure you will have noticed from my comments that we are all getting very tired of this issue. I personally would greatly welcome it if we could find a solution to this sorry state of affairs at European level and perhaps even deal with the issue in an objective manner. Alexander Alvaro,

Mr President, many thanks, Mr Voss, for your input, which is very interesting, especially as regards the role of the Justice Minister. Would you not say that it is the Justice Minister’s responsibility, if she sees that an item of legislation is incompatible with the law and, furthermore – as noted by the Irish High Court, which would not have referred the matter to the European Court of Justice otherwise – possibly incompatible with EU law as well, to suspend the legislation until the matter has been clarified, rather than transposing what is possibly bad law?

There will be one speaker from each group and two each from the two larger groups, which is due to proportional representation. Catch-the-eye procedure President.

Madam President, Mr Lewandowski, the draft budget for 2013 includes funding of almost EUR 150 billion for commitments alone. These commitments are directly related to the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy and they have increased by 2.7% to EUR 64.5 billion in total. The figures under Heading 1, sustainable growth, in particular, have risen by 3.5%. The central programmes for growth and investment, small and medium-sized businesses, employment and young people and new initiatives, for example, the planned pilot phase for the project bond initiative in the fields of transport, energy and ICT, should help to resolve liquidity problems and, therefore, to promote investment and growth, which Europe currently needs more urgently than ever. The payments in the draft budget amount to a total of EUR 138 billion. In the last year of the current financial framework, the draft budget includes higher funding for payments than in 2012, in particular, in the Seventh Framework Programme, where the increase is around 28%, and in the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, where the increase amounts to about 12%. These correspond exactly with the estimated payment applications from the public and private partners, which are responsible for projects in these areas. The proposed increase of 6.8% in the total payment appropriations is the result and the inevitable consequence of the EU’s commitments under the terms of the Treaties to enable all the larger programmes to continue and to take into account the outstanding commitment appropriations from the current year and from previous years. This is conscientious and responsible budgeting. We are also setting priorities, such as the programme for supporting ICT policy, which will be concentrating in 2013 on increasing the spread of these technologies and ensuring that they are used as effectively as possible, in line with Europe’s digital agenda. Overall, this programme will support Europe and the draft budget is a positive approach which we will hopefully be able to adopt together with the Council. Incidentally, if you will allow me to, I would like to conclude by saying that we would have saved a significant amount of money if we had held this debate in Brussels and not in Strasbourg.

(The sitting closed at 20.45) President.  
− I would be happy to oblige, Mr Pirker. Firstly, perhaps you will have noticed that I did not preside over this debate from the outset. Accordingly I regret that I did not realise that you did indeed have the discipline to be here from the start. The Rules of Procedure themselves state that if we have a five-minute ‘catch-the-eye’ procedure, then five speakers are permitted. It is basically a matter for the President to decide how to handle this. I do not know the eight colleagues from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) (PPE) who requested the floor. I actually made what I thought was the fairest choice. I chose a woman so that there would be a balanced representation of the genders, because the other groups were all represented by men. I am not sure if my answer will satisfy you, but I have to follow some rationale in making a choice. With eight members of the PPE Group requesting the floor, I freely admit that my choice was not based on who had been here for how long. As I was not presiding at the start of the debate, but only took over the chair at a later stage, I was not aware of this. I can assure you, however, that I will take this into consideration the next time, particularly in your case. If a Member has had the discipline to attend a debate from start to finish, then he should be given the opportunity to speak. I apologise that this was not the case this time.

 – (DE) 
Mr President, inevitably, we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe find it difficult to reach a decision on issues like this. For us, this is a matter to be pondered and we follow a rational path, weighing up the arguments rather than being swayed by dogma. We are the only group in this House to follow such practice. We are aware that legal certainty, legal clarity and the question of the clarity of the wording are decisively important, in other words what is contained in this agreement and what the decisive points will be for us. There are deficiencies with regard to the question of further usage and retention periods, as well as with regard to the area of application, which is open to interpretation. The wording is not clearly defined. As a group we are known for our attachment to freedom, specifically the freedom of the individual. Security is always the servant of freedom. It is never the other way round. Responsibility is an essential element in this context. It is our responsibility to protect and balance the interests of our citizens. In our view this agreement does not achieve that and I believe that our rejection makes it clear that we shall oppose this erosion of freedom and responsibility. President.

 Mr President, thank you, Mr Lewandowski, for the proposal you have submitted. It is not easy to present a budget when so many different interests are involved and Mr La Via has succeeded in highlighting the majority of Parliament’s priorities. In my opinion, there are three decisive aspects to the budget guidelines: the budget must be balanced, it must be sensible and it must be responsible. Mr Lamassoure has just referred to the fact that we have had two austerity budgets in a row. This is absolutely the right thing to do in this situation. During this period, the Member States have only been able to provide limited resources. At the same time, as the previous speaker rightly pointed out, we need to make investments. These are, of course, complementary measures. First of all, we need to create the necessary structures, which are based on a responsible approach to the use of taxpayers’ money, so that we can make investments. Otherwise, we will be throwing good money after bad and this cannot be in our interests. Therefore, I believe it is important that we remind ourselves of this in the guidelines from the parliamentary side. We played a significant role in ensuring that the Member States agreed on automatic sanctions after the summit on 1 and 2 March and this must now be put into practice. I would like to see the Commission and not the Council taking responsibility for this, because then we could be sure that it would be implemented. At the same time, however, we need to give the Member States support with regard to European added value. The issue of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) has been mentioned. They form the backbone of the European economy. It is not the large organisations and the multinationals that create jobs. It is the medium-sized companies which ensure that Europe’s engine for growth and employment continues to function. Therefore, we need to make targeted and sensible use of money. More funding does not necessarily mean better policies. Finally, I would like to express my full support for what Mr Lamassoure said about the need to resolve the problem of the outstanding commitments or reste à liquider
. Most importantly, as far as the budget is concerned – and it is a pity that the Member States are not represented – it would make sense for us to draw up a sensible budget right from the start, so that we do not find ourselves in a difficult situation because amending budgets are required. President.

 Mr President, since 14 of the 15 blue cards have unfortunately gone by the board, I would like to ask Mr López Aguilar whether he can explain to me why Mr Weber, who represents the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), supports law and order, but is not prepared at least to take the group in the direction of carrying out a serious legal test under Article 7(1) which would be a proper solution to the case. You are a former minister of justice and an experienced person. Perhaps you can explain to me why Mr Weber is not in favour of this. Alexander Alvaro  (ALDE

Madam President, Commissioner, good morning. It is good to see you in this last week of business in Strasbourg for this year. As Mr Fernandes has rightly said, 2007 was the year the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund was established, since which – it is unfortunate that my fellow Member from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is no longer listening – EUR 307 million has been distributed – out of a fund of EUR 2.5 billion. Money alone is not the solution when it comes to tackling economic crises and the consequences of globalisation. Structural reforms in the labour market, economic reforms, taxation reforms and social reforms are the elements that can be used to take control of globalisation. Do not be fooled into thinking that money is the horn of plenty that can be used to solve all problems in the long term. If we see the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund as a way to reward the conduct of companies like Nokia, which has moved from Bochum in Germany to Romania and, ultimately, out of the European Union, receiving monetary support on two occasions, that is the wrong approach, and we will certainly not allow that to happen. Mr Fernandes is quite right and I share his views on the prospect of the European Parliament becoming the field where national election campaigns are fought. I note what has happened in France. I also believe, however, that this is a matter for France and does not need to be discussed here. That is why my group will reject the oral amendment if tabled. There are still more than 40 Members of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in this House. This means that we can also reject this oral amendment. I would much prefer it if we were to sit down together and work out how we can integrate the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund intelligently into European budgetary policy within the parameters of the Multiannual Financial Framework, ensuring more growth and more jobs, rather than perpetuating unemployment with the money we have.

 Mr Rübig, I believe that these are precisely the kinds of proposals that we can build on. If we work together – for example with the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), although I am also certain that it would be possible to collaborate with the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance – to produce suggestions for how we can finance and support medium-sized enterprises, young entrepreneurs and start-ups, as well as encouraging quality in the existing business community, then I believe we will arrive at a common denominator, which is precisely the path we should take. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Alexander Alvaro  (ALDE
),  
Blue-card answer. 
–
 Madam President, actually this is the problem, and we in the Committee on Budgets have asked, in the reports dealing with EAGGF – especially through amendments – for evaluation mechanisms to be put in place, because we as a Parliament do not know exactly how many people have been reintegrated into work with the help of the European Globalisation Fund (maybe Commissioner Lewandowski knows). We know how many workers we have helped and how many redundant workers have been receiving money out of the Globalisation Fund, but we do not know how many have actually been reintegrated into work. Just to correct one thing: I did not say that companies are doing good; I said that the European Globalisation Fund is actually taking away the burden from enterprises to elaborate specific social plans. This is something which worries me probably as much as it does you. Alexander Alvaro  (ALDE
).

 Mr President, I am pleased that the Polish Presidency was able to conclude its term in office so successfully. When you receive more praise from all the groups for your Presidency than I, like Mr Schulz, have ever heard in the 15 presidencies that I have had the good fortune to experience, then it is clear that the ‘P’ in Poland stands for ‘professional’. We would like to thank you for the work that you have done in that area. Unfortunately, a lot of what you have achieved in your Presidency has been overshadowed by the general focus of attention on the euro crisis and the debt crisis in Europe. However, you did something very important that has not yet been mentioned. In the preparations for the multiannual financial framework of the European Union, your Presidency involved Parliament at a very early stage for the first time. I had the pleasure of leading a European Parliament delegation in Sopot. We in Parliament were involved in these discussions at an earlier stage than we have ever been before. That is important to us. We hope that the same thing will happen in future, too. In the areas of justice and home affairs, in which I have also been working for many years, you have achieved a significant amount of success in connection with combating child abuse as well as in other areas. I could say that you are concluding your Presidency with a results sheet of successful action that I would like to see followed in a similar way by other European states and companies. I would like to thank you, and I look forward to our continued cooperation in a different context in the Council. Alexander Alvaro  (ALDE

 Mr President, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Council Presidency, Mr Lewandowski and, in particular, the two rapporteurs who, together with the Chair of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Lamassoure, have done an excellent job. The tough negotiations that formed part of the conciliation procedure lasted for 17 hours and the European Parliament spent two hours of this in discussions with the Council. Perhaps it would be sensible next time around if the Council did not hold its negotiations during the conciliation procedure, but instead reached a common position first. That would make the job easier for all of us and would extend the Saturday morning slightly. Nevertheless, we have nominally agreed on a sensible budget. We have accommodated the Council’s requirements. At the Council’s request, the payments were limited to EUR 129 billion and the commitment appropriations were set at EUR 147 billion, which is what Parliament wanted. We should not be under any illusions, however. We are pushing a very dangerous avalanche along. The Council is prepared to finance the commitments that have been entered into by means of supplementary budgets, but I would prefer a commitment to establishing a budget from the beginning with a clear financial basis, so that we do not need constant amending budgets. This simply postpones the problem. Another problem that has emerged is the fact that the European Union needs more investment in research and development. Everyone, including the Member States, clearly supports this. However, this will not work with a capped budget, unless we are prepared to abandon our dogmatic approach to preserving the status quo and our subsidy mindset. If we do not restructure the budget in favour of research and development and the Europe 2020 strategy, we will not be able to meet these priorities. At the same time, we have also shown that, at a time when citizens have to tighten their belts, the European Parliament can do the same. I would like to thank Mr Fernandes in particular, who has made an excellent job of initiating this process. We have achieved a good result and we will be able to vote in favour of this budget. However, we still have to discuss whether this is the right approach in the long term. Alexander Alvaro  (ALDE

 The representatives of the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament will only vote in favour of the Hübner report on amending COM(2011)0482
 on condition that, when raising the applicable cofinancing rates by ten percentage points, there is an exception for those Member States explicitly affected. This exception must not be able to act as a precedent in any way and should be revoked in respect of the Member States in question once the severe financial and economic crisis and its liquidity squeezes have been overcome.

Mr President, I would like to recall that about three years ago Franziska Brantner and I set up what we called ‘Friends of the European External Action Service’, a temporary platform where academics, NGOs and future diplomats of the EEAS could come together and discuss how this should be structured. Some of the things that we came up with are on the agenda today. One is political deputies. We recommended this, but at the time it did not find favour with those who initiated the service. It became clear very quickly that ubiquity is not something that one can expect of the High Representative in what we always called an impossible job – three hats at the same time is simply impossible to fulfil without serious political deputising. Today this is the first point in the recommendation that we are writing as a Parliament. The second issue that we discussed – and which was indeed realised – was to have a broader leadership structure rather than one all-powerful General Secretary. If it was Pierre Vimont we would not have a problem with that of course, but we did not want to have an éminence grise
 behind the scenes who would not appear in Parliament etc. We wanted to have the opportunity to give you as much information from as many sources as possible in your leadership functions. We believe that, even if this is modified, the principle is still valid.  A last point – and my colleague here the Earl of Dartmouth just mentioned this  – is that our Member States are indeed closing down embassies and consulates and that this is where the External Action Service can provide added value because our Member States will continue to be represented by a service that is their own.

I actually have two questions. Firstly, you complain about a lack of solidarity, although aid of about EUR 10 billion has been given to Cyprus, a country of less than one million people. I think that is proof of solidarity. Do you agree with me? Secondly, are you aware of the Council of Europe’s report that has just been leaked, concerning money laundering and the lack of effort on the part of the Cypriot authorities to combat money laundering effectively? We are seeing some pretty dramatic figures online right now. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Mr President, the Taoiseach is here; Chancellor Merkel was here; Prime Minister Monti was here; President Sarkozy, when still in office, was here. David Cameron is hiding in Holland. He seems to be afraid of a real debate about the future of Europe with the elected representatives of the peoples of Europe. I would like to say to Martin Callanan of our Tory friends to invite him to come here to have this debate here rather than in The Hague. Your being here earns you our respect and loyalty but not only that. Sie haben sechs Sparhaushalte nacheinander verabschiedet. Sie haben alle Auflagen von IWF und Europäischer Union erfüllt. Sie sind am Kapitalmarkt zurück, Sie haben wirklich viel getan! Aber Ihr Schuldenstand wird in diesem Jahr ungefähr 120 % des Bruttoinlandsprodukts erreichen, und Sie wollen deshalb die irischen Schulden europäisieren. Ob das richtig ist, sei dahingestellt. Es ist allemal legitim, es zu versuchen. Es wirft nur eine Frage auf: Kann Irland wirklich ein ehrlicher Makler sein, wenn die Last der nationalen Interessen so schwer auf Ihren Schultern drückt? Vergessen wir nicht, in zwölf Monaten wird hier der griechische Premierminister sitzen. Welche nationalen Interessen wird er mitbringen? Das ist ein großes Problem. Sie haben eben in Ihrer Rede gesagt, Sie wollen eine erneuerte und umgebaute Europäische Union. Das klingt bei Ihnen erheblich glaubwürdiger als wahrscheinlich bei David Cameron am Freitag. Ich habe einige Vorschläge, was man machen könnte. Zum Einen: Lassen Sie uns die rotierende Präsidentschaft abschaffen. Sie werden sehr gute Arbeit machen. Das ist Ihre siebte Präsidentschaft, Sie haben eine hervorragende Europaministerin. Aber das System ist ein Problem. Zweitens: Gestern hat hier der österreichische Bundeskanzler, der auch hier war, um über Europa zu debattieren, gefordert, dass alle Rabatte abgeschafft werden sollen bei der Finanzierung der Europäischen Union. Lassen Sie uns das System erheblich einfacher machen! Beim dritten Punkt geht es an Ihre Glaubwürdigkeit: Sie haben gesagt, Sie wollen eine Europäische Union, die weniger komplex, weniger institutionell ist. Der erste wichtige Schritt dahin ist eine kleinere Kommission. Wir haben jetzt 27 Kommissare, es werden immer mehr. Das ist der erste wichtige Schritt, und hier spielen Sie eine ganz besondere Rolle!

Mr President, I second the last remark. It is good to have you here in this job, Stavros, it is good that we have you as an EU Special Representative for Human Rights. I think that is very good. Die Menschenrechtspolitik der Europäischen Union war ja eine Zeit lang wirklich in der Kritik.  Die Stunde der Wahrheit war der Arabische Frühling. Wir haben in den Spiegel geschaut, und was wir gesehen haben, das hat uns nicht alles gefallen. Wir haben darauf reagiert, mit einer Menschenrechtsstrategie, mit einem Aktionsplan – das ist gut. Mit einem Sonderbeauftragten für Menschenrechte – auch das ist gut. Wir unterstützen die Zivilgesellschaft und Nichtregierungsorganisationen – auch das ist gut. Wir wollen uns koordinieren und wir wollen an einem Strang ziehen – auch das ist gut.  Aber hier habe ich eine ganz konkrete Frage an Frau Kozakou-Marcoullis, mit der Bitte um Antwort: Wir wollen uns koordinieren, wir wollen uns abstimmen, wie machen wir das praktisch?  Sollten wir uns nicht – Sie haben den Europäischen Demokratiefonds erwähnt – in unserer Politik und in unseren Instrumenten wirklich darauf verpflichten, dass die Demokratieförderung von EIHDR und EED eng abgestimmt wird, dass miteinander geredet wird, um Doppelungen zu vermeiden? Ich bin sicher, Sie werden mir da zustimmen.  Und Sie haben auch Diskriminierungen auf der Basis von Kastenzugehörigkeit erwähnt. Wir werden morgen hierzu eine Dringlichkeitsentschließung haben. Würden Sie mir auch zustimmen, dass die Europäische Union in ihrer Politik und ihren Instrumenten kastenbasierte Diskriminierung aufgreifen und bekämpfen sollte? Herzlichen Dank für Antworten auf diese beiden Fragen. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Mr President, we are voting on quite a large number of amendments tabled by one particular group that usually attaches great importance to strict compliance with the Rules of Procedure. In this House, roll-call votes are generally reserved for issues of particular and major importance. It would therefore be sensible for the EP’s Services to contact the group concerned to establish whether each of these roll-call votes is, in fact, necessary. In my view, what the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group is inflicting on us here is completely unnecessary. (Applause) Alexander Graf Lambsdorff,

 Mr President, Prime Minister, Mr Barroso, we have heard a great deal about how the house of Europe is built of the bricks of solidarity, but houses must be built on solid foundations. That has been the distinctive line of the past six months: the link between solidarity and solidity. I would therefore have liked you to have said a bit more about solidity, Prime Minister, and to have talked about how we can exert better, stricter control over the situation that we are in – the debt crisis in the Member States that has dragged our currency down with it. You mentioned the ‘two-pack’, and that indeed took place during your Presidency. In the case of the ‘two-pack’, we, as the European Parliament, called for a debt redemption pact. I believe we need to take a brave step forward if we want to be successful here. However, the Council’s decisions of last weekend leave a lot of questions unanswered. Mr Swoboda mentioned the growth pact. I know that it is something he is particularly concerned about. Der Spiegel
 called the whole thing a sham. A total of EUR 50-55 billion is supposed to come from the Structural Funds, but even Commissioner Hahn says he does not know how such figures are arrived at. I am not convinced that it is genuinely solid, that it will restore confidence among our citizens. Liability and control go together; that is the really crucial thing. We want to liberate forces for growth, we want the European patent. However, and in this Mr Swoboda is absolutely right, what the Council has decided is completely absurd. A court that sits in three different places – London, Paris and Munich – is downright grotesque, and it shows that quite clearly the Member States are not capable of coming to sensible decisions on such an important, innovation-driving matter. I have one question. A new system of banking supervision is now to be established on the basis of Article 127(6) of the Treaty. I thought we had a European Banking Authority. Are we now going to have a banking supervisory authority with two seats as well? Are we going to get two different banking supervisory authorities? Precisely what form does the Council imagine this is going to take? You will find it pretty difficult to explain the proliferation of seats of various organisations to this Parliament and get support for it. In other respects, I would like to offer my sincere thanks for your committed Presidency. There are some other matters that you have progressed with real success. I have not mentioned Schengen, which was undoubtedly a sore point in your Presidency. However, the enlargement policy in respect of Serbia and Montenegro is undoubtedly one of the positive aspects.

Blue-card question.

 Mr President, I should like to ask Ms Harms whether what she describes as a comfort – the prospect of joint liability, common risk – does not necessarily also entail shared political control, or should be viewed in parallel with this. After all, the debts for which we are jointly liable today are the taxes of tomorrow. No taxation without representation. That is a very important point. My second, very specific, question is as follows. You said that bank risk should be separated from sovereign risk, and that we have now succeeded in this. However, the European Stability Mechanism, which is currently recapitalising the banks, is borne by sovereign states. In other words, sovereign risk is being distributed differently, but it is still there. What is your assessment of this? I take a very critical view of it, and where the conclusion of the Euro Group is concerned, I am decidedly sceptical as regards how vague it has been kept and what impact it will have in practice. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, firstly, congratulations to Mr Lewandowski. However, the person I really want to wish all the best is not you, but rather your namesake, Robert, of Borussia Dortmund – I hope he manages to score to take Poland into the quarter finals. That really would be something to celebrate. We have just heard a few things about the Council and the future of Europe that this Council is to decide on, that are to be debated. Listening to what Mr Bokros has said here, I believe this to be very important. The crucial thing as regards everything that we are debating in relation to the multiannual financial framework, in relation to the budget, is whether the private sector is going to invest again, whether the private sector will regain its confidence in the European economy and its prospects. This is the decisive factor. Public budgets can only provide incentives at best. The Social Democrats sometimes need that explaining to them. You cannot buy growth; you can only enable growth. That is why it is crucial that the structural reforms that President Barroso mentioned come about. The second really crucial thing is the debt redemption pact; a clear, effective debt redemption pact linked to clear conditions which will relieve the burden on the budgets in the Member States, which at present, despite all their efforts – in Italy, for example – simply cannot emerge from the constraints of their refinancing. We therefore need a clear and effective debt redemption pact. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff, Britta Reimers and Michael Theurer  (ALDE

 The German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament has spoken out clearly in favour of the introduction of a debt redemption fund. However, participation in such a fund must be associated with clear and strict rules, such as were contained in the proposal made by the German Council of Economic Experts to the German Government in autumn 2011. Watering down the criteria for participation is neither productive nor effective. Linking the introduction of a debt redemption fund with the eurobonds project and the treatment of economic imbalances is unfair, and is rejected by the FDP in the European Parliament in the strongest possible terms.

 I have two very specific questions. One is whether Mr Rouček is aware that the Czech Government has granted political asylum to Mr Danylyshyn, the former Ukrainian Minister for the Economy. This is only granted when the person is suffering from political persecution. I would also like to know what he thinks of this fact. My second question concerns whether it is relevant that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament or the Social Democratic Party of Europe has a cooperation agreement with the Party of the Regions. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, as Mr Siwiec has just said, this is not the first debate that we have held on the subject of Ukraine and, as has so often been the case before, large parts of this debate have been unproductive and predictable. Why is this? The answer is quite simple. The Batkivshchyna is a party which follows the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and, as we have just heard, the Party of the Regions has an agreement with the Socialists. In other words, the PPE group is now making a big fuss, puffing out its cheeks and running a poster campaign to create a good photo opportunity, while the Socialists are giving speeches about the situation in Ukraine which they ought to be ashamed of. This is a softly-softly approach which glosses over the reality of the situation. This type of debate does not do justice to the strategic or the humanitarian dimension of the problem. Ukraine is a large country with a population of 50 million. It lies between Russia, the European Union and the Black Sea. For 20 years, it has been stagnating in economic, democratic and social terms. Of course, that was also the case under the Yushchenko/Tymoshenko government. I believe that we now need to put the focus on the political and humanitarian dimension. We must ensure that democracy has a chance at the elections in October. However, Mr Füle, the electoral campaign is already under way. I would like some very precise information from the Commission and the European External Action Service about how they plan to implement the measures that you have just described, in other words, the close monitoring of the electoral campaign and the elections themselves. I would like our two guests, Hryhoriy Nemyria and Yevgenia Tymoshenko, to take away more from today’s debate than just the usual disputes between left and right. To Ms Tymoshenko, I would like to say in particular that I hope her mother receives the medical treatment she needs. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

The subject of our debate today is the case of Ms Tymoshenko, a political and humanitarian case which gives rise to the most serious concern, and Members who I otherwise have a great deal of personal respect for, such as Mr Rouček and Mr Vigenin, are giving speeches which do not in any way do justice to the severity of the case about the various minor reforms that are taking place at the moment. The situation would be exactly the reverse if the government in Ukraine were different. That is what I mean. We must be open and clear about this. Regardless of who is in power in Ukraine, the country is too important for us to discuss it here from a party political perspective. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr Schulz, I hope you have noted the fact that I did not express a naïve hope, but that I called on the Commission to make it entirely clear how it intends to monitor the election process.

 Mr President, there are three important issues for the summit tomorrow. The first is to continue consolidating the national budgets. That is not an end in itself, Mr Bullmann. If investment levels are currently low or even at zero, as you say, then there is a reason for this. We are paying interest on the debts that we have accumulated in the past instead of building schools. We are paying interest instead of building roads. We are paying interest instead of investing in innovation and research. We need to continue consolidating the national budgets so that we can begin investing in these areas again. The second important topic is structural reforms. Productivity, efficiency, competitiveness, entrepreneurship and an appropriate level of taxation for businesses will all help to ensure that the Member States and their markets are competitive. It concerns me that the labour market reforms in Italy have come to a stop. We need to abolish Article 18. I do not understand how anyone can be opposed to that. The third point is growth. How do we intend to finance it? The UK is not prepared to go along with the financial transaction tax. This amounts to false accounting. The European Investment Bank is a much better solution. In addition, the Commission must finally submit proposals as to how we can mobilise the available money in the Structural Funds for use in Greece and the other countries, because we have already been talking about this for two years. We gradually need to introduce some concrete measures. We have been talking about this for two years without anything being done. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

I simply wanted to ask Mr Lamberts whether he might consider assuming that the Members of the House, whatever their nationality and whatever their political affiliation, pursue honest motives in their political activities, and whether he might refrain in future from slanderous and belittling remarks.

 Mr President, what do Düsseldorf and Dortmund, Herten and Essen, Arnsberg and Würselen have in common? They are all places where the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) Members of the European Parliament for North Rhine-Westphalia live. The people of North Rhine-Westphalia hear from Ms Kraft that the SPD’s aim is to protect and promote both industry and the region as an industrial heartland. At the same time, these Members from Dortmund, Düsseldorf, Essen and other places are now about to vote for a massive increase in the price of diesel, this despite the fact that Germany and Europe lead the world in this energy-efficient and environmentally friendly drive technology. The consequences of this price increase are clear: rising prices, a decline in internal demand, a threat to technological superiority and to the survival of the industrial base. If this really is the Social Democrats’ industrial policy, then we can say good night to North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany and Europe. The truth is that this makes no economic or environmental sense. If we consider rising fuel costs, which have already reached record levels, then we must recognise that we are inhibiting internal demand, despite the fact that the Social Democrats are always looking to stimulate growth in this area. This makes no sense from an environmental perspective either. We all know that diesel-powered vehicles travel further on less fuel than petrol-driven vehicles. That is why I would call on the Social Democrats to reconsider the consequences for the people, the consumers and the drivers of Germany and Europe of their vote tomorrow. It is high time that the SPD espoused an economic policy that targets success, not just on election posters, but also in specific political action. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I support the motion tabled by Mr Swoboda to remove this report from the agenda. Some points in the report are so incomplete that it needs further debate. The current wording of the report makes it clear that diesel would become considerably more expensive. This is definitely not the sort of economic policy signal that car drivers and industry want to see. Therefore, I believe it is right to discuss this report further and to focus on the uncontroversial areas when it is next referred to Parliament. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 – (DE) 
Madam President, my group tabled the original amendment. We regret that it is not possible to name the Zaman
 newspaper here, because this was the only paper to suffer attack in Cologne, Paris, London, Rotterdam and Zurich. As a group, we intend to vote in favour of Mr Obiol’s amendment nonetheless in order to show clearly that the freedom of the press is a central objective for us. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, my report appears in the voting lists as an own-initiative report. However, according to the Rules of Procedure, it is, in fact, a recommendation to the Council. That is a different matter. We would not need to vote on the report because, according to the Rules of Procedure, it is deemed adopted if there are no amendments tabled by the groups. I would ask that the documents be corrected in order to put this right. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 – (DE)
 Mr President, we all agree that we want a stability culture in Europe. That is at least what we are constantly hearing. We also need to assess what has been achieved with the fiscal compact, which represents an important step towards the stability culture. It is not a turning point and it is not the solution. It is also not a universal remedy. We can all agree on that. However, I believe that it is an important step forward, and this needs to be said for the sake of truth. We want balanced budgets with very low primary deficits, if these cannot be avoided. We want a debt brake in the euro area countries. We want automatic sanctions for offenders before things go wrong. We want old debts to be reduced and the results to be reported to Brussels before new debts are incurred. We want the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) to come into effect earlier. We must also make sure that only those countries which join the fiscal compact have access to the ESM. These are all important elements of a stability culture in Europe and, with the ‘two-pack’, we are attempting to implement this under European law, including a debt redemption pact, which is something my group is specifically calling for. We want to stimulate growth in Greece and the money to do this is available. Between EUR 16 billion and EUR 18 billion – the numbers vary – can be provided from the Structural Funds. I believe that we finally need to get started with this. Everything that Mr Reichenbach and the Troika have so far achieved in Greece is not enough to give a real boost to growth. Then, today, there was a debate in the German Parliament which surprised me, because the Social Democrats are threatening to vote against the fiscal compact unless it includes a particular tax, which would justifiably be controversial. I believe this would be a huge mistake. I also think it is important for the Social Democrats to become aware of their responsibilities in terms of stability policy and to vote in favour of the compact without playing party political games. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the central issue for us is to make progress on the road towards a stability culture. I would like to finish by congratulating you, Mr Van Rompuy, on your reappointment. Everyone agrees that you are doing an excellent job. However, I am still of the opinion that your position, as it is enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon, is a mistake. I would prefer to have a President of Europe who, if possible, was also directly elected. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff,

 Mr President, as Mr Wammen has just said, the Spring European Council meeting is traditionally the European Union’s rendezvous with social and economic reality in Europe. However, we have all heard that the finance ministers yesterday cancelled their meeting in Brussels at which they intended to approve the second aid package for Greece. What does that mean? What does it mean for Greece and for Europe? I believe that our common goal is to keep Greece in the euro area and I would like to respond to Mr Daul on this subject. I do not agree with what Ms Kroes has said about Greece remaining in the euro area, but the reason why she has said it and why so many people are so impatient, is the behaviour of her sister party, Nea Dimokratia, in particular. If they could just call Mr Samaras to order, it would be very helpful. I believe it would be better for all of us. We want Greece to stay in the euro area, but it is important to make one thing clear. In the past, the Greek Government has made a lot of promises, but has delivered very little. The introduction of another austerity package does not by any means indicate that what is being promised will actually be put into practice, and that is exactly what this is all about. It is about structural reform, which will lead to further aid being made available. If it takes the right course, Greece can count on our support. However, we no longer need preliminary work; instead, we are looking for action. It has been said here that the situation in Greece is genuinely dramatic. In addition to the savings which are needed, Mr Swoboda, from 1991 to 2007, in other words, before the crisis, Greece had an average annual national deficit of 6.6%. Greece is now having to pay the bill for its poor policies in the past. Of course, we do not envy the Greeks. That is absolutely clear. We want to get the country and the economy going again and the trade unions will be an important part of this. Trade unions have played a constructive role in increasing competitiveness in Germany over many years. Economic performance has fallen by 7% over the last three months. This is why we now need genuine structural reforms, in other words, a tax reform which is worthy of the name. Progress must be made with privatisation in important sectors such as energy generation, ports and lotteries, every area where the state is too heavily involved. The proposed cuts in the bloated civil service are also needed. Parts of the Greek political system have been based on this. People simply found positions for their supporters in a ministry, a public authority or a public company. In other words, the state sector is completely bloated. I would like to remind everyone in this context that it was the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe which called for a sort of Marshall Plan some time ago. We call it the Hercules Plan and we will be happy to work on it. However, after the last Council meeting, our group also made three very specific proposals for measures to promote growth and create jobs. These proposals are addressed to the Council: the implementation of the European patent, the deployment of unused funding from the European Union budget and a plan to reduce the risk of infection within Europe. We want a debt redemption pact for the whole of Europe. We expect the Council finally to tackle this problem.

 Mr President, I am looking around and I do not want to exclude any of the Members who are sitting behind me. It is important to make it clear that we must not attach too much importance to these remarks. It is obvious that many people really have run out of patience. We want to see something happen in Greece. We are prepared to help and to show solidarity, but the phase of promises must be replaced by a phase of taking action. I believe that this is what lies behind these remarks. They are made on a pars pro toto

 Mr President, I would be very grateful if Mr Cohn-Bendit could explain to me what he believes the Taliban are. I am not familiar with the phrases ‘liberal Taliban’ and ‘neoliberal Taliban’. Mr Daul has just outed himself here as a liberal. I do not believe that he is a member of the Taliban, not even the neoliberal Taliban. We should stop all this nonsense. What is really important, and I would like to say that Mr Cohn-Bendit is right about this, is that we should all treat each other with respect. That also applies to the different peoples of Europe, including the Greeks, the Germans and the others. Treating each other with respect within the European Union should always be more important than wonderful rhetorical flights of fancy which are actually rather disrespectful.

– The FDP Delegation has abstained in today’s vote on the motion for a resolution on the feasibility of introducing stability bonds. We believe that the introduction of Eurobonds would set the wrong incentives. Since the introduction of the euro, low interest rates have led to a substantial increase in debt levels in many eurozone countries. Eurobonds would take the pressure off highly indebted eurozone Member States to consolidate their budgets and introduce much needed structural reforms. Therefore, we believe that Eurobonds would aggravate, rather than alleviate, the current crisis. However, we did not vote against the resolution as many of our concerns have been taken on board by the rapporteur. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Mr President, Mr Swoboda, I would like to ask you to take note of the fact that the same states which are currently in particular difficulties in the midst of the debt crisis are also the states with the highest youth unemployment levels. Please also take note of the fact that labour market policy is the responsibility of the Member States and that imposing sanctions in areas where companies have to hire people definitely does not make sense but simply aggravates the situation. Please also take note of the fact that the citizens of France will elect their own president. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, I was particularly pleased about the Council’s decision to impose sanctions and an oil embargo and to increase the pressure on Iran. I consider this to be the sensible and right thing to do and I am amazed to hear many fellow Members saying that there is no proof of military intent or that it is not possible to distinguish between civil and military use. We only need to look at the facts. Iran has 5 000 kg of uranium that is enriched to 3%. That is what is needed for energy production. However, it already has 75 kg that is enriched to 20%, and the only explanation for that is that it is planning to use it for military purposes. The enrichment needs to be pushed to 90%. That is technically complex, but by no means impossible. All of the facts, including the most recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), indicate that military use is intended here. In other words, we have a predictable period here in which the whole scenario will enfold, and it is therefore right for the European Parliament to now increase the pressure. The same applies with regard to the delivery systems, commonly known as missiles. The Iranians are obviously working on medium- and long-range missiles. This brings the urgency of the situation even more clearly into focus. It would have been better if the oil embargo had been put into effect immediately – although I fully understand the need of some Member States to find means of diversification. However, that will also give Iran the opportunity to find ways round this. I am pleased that the joint parliamentary resolution received broad support. I am also pleased about the particularly constructive role of the IAEA, in particular since Yukiya Amano took over the position of Director General. That is extremely helpful, and I am also pleased to see the positive and constructive role that Turkey has been playing recently with regard to this matter. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, Prime Minister, I would like to start by thanking you. Immediately upon entering office, you reversed the snap decision of the previous regime to reintroduce border controls between Denmark and Germany and Denmark and Sweden. I believe this was a very good decision. My group favours an open Europe. This was good news for those citizens living in the border regions. It was also good news for business, particularly the transport companies on either side of the border. Thank you for what is a really positive step. In my second point I find myself agreeing with Mr Langen: please defend the Community method. You have already seen what happens when we revert to the intergovernmental patterns of the 19th century and the attitudes associated with them. At least this is what has been reported in the media in relation to what Mr Sarkozy had to say to you. If this is the new tone we can expect from the intergovernmental method, then this is another argument in favour of the Community method. There is one important point to make, however. In setting out your priorities for the Presidency of the Council you state that you want the European Union to have a strong, consistent external profile. I believe it would be good if you could use the opportunity afforded by this Council Presidency to initiate a debate on whether you really wish to maintain your opt-out from the Common Security and Defence Policy. It is strange that every country except Denmark is a member of the European Defence Agency. I would be extremely grateful if you could take advantage of this opportunity. Finally, my group, together with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, is pursuing a procedure against Hungary under Article 7(1) of the Treaty. It is then up to the Council, however, to make any recommendations. Article 7(1) only provides for recommendations. I would encourage you: place this on the agenda and organise the necessary four-fifths majority of Member States. This is the only way we will make any progress with regard to Hungary.

 Mr President, Mr Weber, I have absolutely no doubts about your commitment to the rule of law. However, today I do doubt your political judgment. There is a new national justice agency in Hungary. It is responsible for appointing judges and for allocating cases to specific courts. This national justice agency has a director. It is managed by a lady. Perhaps you would like to tell us who she is, if you know. If you do not know, ask your neighbour. She is the wife of Mr Szájer and I find this very strange in the context of discussions on the independence of the judiciary. (Applause) Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mr Orbán, I would like to make one thing clear straight away: Hungary is not Belarus, you are not Mr Chávez and it is possible to live a good life in Hungary. Nevertheless, we do have serious concerns. I am intending to link my criticisms to specific points, as Mr Weber has called on us to do. You said that no one had criticised the constitution. There are now 25 ‘cardinal laws’, which raise some issues to the level of the constitution because a two-thirds majority is required to change them again. One of these is the flat tax. I am a Liberal and I think a flat tax is an excellent idea. However, it is not acceptable to take a tax policy issue out of the political debate and include it in the constitution. This undermines and impairs the citizens’ democratic right to vote, to choose a different government at the next elections and to bring about comprehensive change. Tax law is a question which must stimulate central political debate and democratic disputes. This situation is unacceptable because it undermines democracy and that is why it is so serious. Incidentally, you have said, and this was the point which concerned the judicial system, that this is all about the independence of the judiciary and about facts. The Prime Minister has said that he has done everything possible to consolidate the budget. How can he then reduce the retirement age for around 300 judges from 70 to 62? That will cost the state a lot of money. Of course, new judges will have to be appointed to fill the vacancies. That is all well and good. We have our own ideas about who they will be. I think we understand that very well. A year ago we expressed our criticism of the media law. We were told that the pluralism of the media was not at risk. Now Klubrádió is being closed down. It has already been closed in Budapest and the frequencies are now being shut down in the countryside. Mr Orbán, you have said that you have written a letter to Mr Barroso in order to discuss the situation calmly and objectively. In the BILD newspaper today you explained that you are yielding to power. (The President cut off the speaker) Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, I am rather surprised. This morning on the German radio station Deutschlandfunk
, Mr Schulz was celebrating the agreement on the ‘six-pack’ as the hour in which the European Parliament demonstrated its importance and I completely agree with him about this. However, he failed to mention that the left wing of this House did, of course, vote against the ‘six-pack’ and has now also taken up a position opposing the results of the summit, balanced budgets and effective sanctions. This does not add up. I am sorry, but we have a debt union. We must have balanced budgets. We need sensible mechanisms which will allow us to achieve this. That is what was decided at the summit. In overall terms, the results are an effective way of allowing us to move from being a debt union to becoming a stability union. However, on one point I agree with him and my other fellow Members: this will become a government agreement. As a result, the risk of a democratic deficit and of a lack of acceptance by the citizens is very real. Therefore, it is very important that the parliaments, both this House and the national parliaments, are very closely involved in this process. My third point, Mr Barroso, concerns something that is important to me. Of course it is essential that what is decided in this fiscal compact is transferred into the Treaties. To do this, we just need the agreement of the United Kingdom at some point. However, it may possibly be the case that we will be forced to do things the other way round. We may need to see this fiscal compact as the founding of a new European Union, as closer integration and as the starting signal for a new project. Nevertheless, I would like to make it clear that we want the British to be involved. Mr Daul, the countries where Liberal parties are in government are those where the public finances are largely in good shape: Estonia, Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and Sweden. These are the countries where the Liberals are in government. In the countries where the Conservatives are in power without Liberals to apply corrective measures, such as Italy, Greece and Portugal, things look a little different. The Liberal position is very clear in that respect. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, I take every appropriate and inappropriate opportunity to praise Ms Wortmann-Kool. To put it simply, no one disputes the institutional point. Of course, this was one of the European Parliament’s finest hours. However, we are not only discussing institutional questions here today; we are also talking about overcoming the euro crisis and about the route towards a stability union. (Heckling from Martin Schulz)
 This is an important point. I am amazed by the tough stance taken by the entire left wing of this House in opposing the results of the summit, including Mr Steinmeier, who described the whole thing as a fiasco. With the best will in the world, I cannot understand this. It is in our common interest that the Member States in the euro area have balanced budgets and that they are monitored. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, before I come to the topic in question, I would like to mention that our former fellow Member and Vice-President, Mr Lambrinidis, is here in the Chamber. He is holding a conversation at the back and we are pleased to see him. He is not listening, because he does not understand German, but that does not matter. When I attend events in my constituency, I always ask my constituents: Which has more soldiers, the European Union or the United States? People generally give the wrong answer. The Member States of the European Union have 2 million soldiers under arms, while the United States has 1.4 million. We are armed to the teeth, but we are only spending on these soldiers one-third of what the Americans are spending. That is plainly nonsense. For this reason, pooling and sharing makes perfect sense. However, it is also clear that we cannot leave this to the armed forces alone. The process must be under political control. In this respect, this report makes a major contribution to the political debate and I would like to thank Mr Lisek. However, I would like to express my criticism of one point and that concerns offsets. The opinion expressed in this report cannot replace the legally binding provisions of the directive on defence procurement in the European Union. I have read the Commission’s guidelines on the use of offsets and it is essential that we follow them. Regardless of whether they are civilian or military, direct or indirect, they always have the effect of distorting competition and, under the terms of Article 346, are only permitted in very few exceptional circumstances. Therefore, I believe it is important for us to emphasise this once again, to stick to it and to vote accordingly.

 Mr President, as I know how excellent our interpreters are, it cannot have been due to the interpreting, so it must have been down to you Mr Van Orden. I clearly said that the Member States have 2 million soldiers and that we are only spending on these soldiers in Europe as a whole one-third of what the Americans are spending. It is obvious that this does not make sense. Even the United Kingdom is very happily pooling and sharing strategic transport aircraft, nuclear testing and aircraft carriers with the French. I believe that this debate is important and I would like to thank Mr Lisek for his positive report. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Madam President, I believe there is cause for concern with regard to this summit. The role of the US in the global economy is far from agreeable. While we here in Europe have learnt from the debt crisis to be responsible with our public finances, we see the American Central Bank continuing to open the floodgates and flood the American market with dollars. Easy money was one of the causes of the crisis in 2008. The whole affair is, unfortunately, continuing along the same path, just like the US public debt situation. The risk of inflation must not be ignored. I also think it is regrettable that the US has still not managed to carry out any permanent reform of its Medicare, Medicaid and social security systems. In this context ahead of an election year in 2012, a weaker dollar is, of course, not what the US wants. A revaluation would absolutely not fit in with President Obama’s jobs programme. The advice to Europeans to please stabilise the euro should also be seen against this background. After all, if the euro loses value against the dollar, US exports will have a harder time on the global markets. At the same time, there is a rise in protectionist efforts in the US – this is also a trend that we absolutely must counter, and therefore it is good that the Commissioner for Trade has spoken here today. I consider this to be extremely important. We Europeans and Americans still have the most significant trade and investment relations with one another. A second point that is important for my group is the fact that, with Google, eBay, Apple and Amazon, so-called information empires have arisen. With regard to the handing of the data, it is important for us, together with the US, to find a new approach for these private players too, and I believe that this is of great interest to our citizens. This matter must be addressed seriously. I forgot to mention Facebook, which should clearly also be included here. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr Rübig, I wish I could give you an encouraging answer. My fear is simply that if the Republicans actually manage to remove President Obama from office, we will not see any particular improvement in the US public finances in terms of revenue, whereas if things were to go on as before, the Democrats will continue their irresponsible policy in relation to expenditure. Therefore, I do not believe that the macroeconomic situation in the US will take a turn for the better. We will have to humbly wait and see who the Americans ultimately vote for next November. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 – (DE) 
Madam President, Ms Schaake is one of our most competent Members when it comes to issues relating to the Internet, freedom of information and data protection. I would like to take the opportunity to ask you whether you think it would make sense to draw up an action plan with the US that would ensure the protection of data and the privacy of users of these major providers. Could this be an objective for this or another EU-US summit? In my view, it could be. I would like to hear your opinion on this and perhaps a few elements that could be agreed on in such an action plan. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what we are now experiencing is something we have warned about for many years in soapbox speeches. We are leaving the coming generations an impossible debt burden. This is irresponsible. All the political parties have said so for many years. We can see from the example of Greece that the problem is no longer waiting for the next generation – it is now confronting this generation and we can see what this means. Tightening one’s belt is painful, however we need to move towards a stability union. There have been some good developments that are going well and where things are working. Ireland is heading in the right direction. We have introduced a budgetary control watchdog, the European Semester. We have agreed a stability pact with teeth – something also to be welcomed. Last night marked an important step along the way to stability union. We agreed that the banks need to do business on a more solid basis. They are to be forced to fulfil their responsibilities and will be recapitalised, however they must have a solid 9% of equity capital. Greece is to have the haircut. It was clear that this would have to happen. We will also have permanent monitoring of the reforms in Greece. Italy has announced pension reforms. We must be clear about the fact that we are still on the path to stability union. All of these things must be implemented in order for us to move forward. I would like to close by congratulating Mr Rehn, the new Vice-President. I am certain that he will play a key role in taking us along the path to this stability union. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I have to say that the wishes of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have never been met so quickly by the Commission. The chair of our group has only just requested the documents that describe the proposals in detail and here they are. We have asked for the documents because I would like to reassure myself that I have correctly understood one point which is particularly important to me. The Commission proposals, which, on the whole, are excellent and far-reaching, include the following statement:  Deciding a sustainable solution for Greece within the euro area, through an effective second adjustment programme.  (DE)
 We need a lasting solution for Greece within the euro area and we can achieve this by making Greece’s debts sustainable. In other words, this is the famous haircut. It is insolvency or, if you prefer, ‘re-solvency’. That was precisely our position. This is why we were accused of being populists a few weeks ago when we said that debt reduction would be needed to allow Greece to emerge from the crisis. The Commission is rightly combining this with robust implementation and supervision mechanisms. This is the right thing to do. We want solidarity, we want to keep Greece in the euro area, but we also want solidity and we want to be able to monitor it, because solidarity cannot be a one-way street. That is extremely important to us. I am pleased that the European debate is now moving in this direction. I am also pleased that our position, which all the experts have long since confirmed is the right one, is now also being confirmed in the political arena. I always get a warm feeling when I hear the Tory Members of this House, like Mr Kirkhope, calling for strong European solutions to recapitalise the banks. Issues like national sovereignty and the United Kingdom and its special position always come to mind in these circumstances. However, I am pleased that there are occasions when even London believes that Europe is useful. I would just like to see this happening more often. I have one final point to make, which is that the news agencies are already reporting that the opposition and the governing parties in Slovakia have agreed to support the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the increase in its scope. This also pleases me. The spectacle of the last few days clearly shows that the requirement for unanimity is a means of setting up blockades. We need majority decisions, including when it comes to stabilising the euro. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
).  
– (DE)
 Mr President, the interpreter, at least, did not word it as a question, but nevertheless, I am happy to provide an answer. No, the solidarity between the Member States of the European Union and of the euro area makes various demands on us and on our voters. However, we are prepared to meet those demands because we want a stability union for Europe and, within this stability union, solidarity is a two-way street. This means that we are prepared to take on these guarantees. As far as the question of the banks is concerned, I am unhappy about the developments in the banking sector, just as everyone who takes a close look at it is. It is true that some of the things which were being done before the crisis are still going on now. However, one thing is absolutely clear. Without a functioning banking sector, we cannot develop a strategy for growth in Europe. As a result, the actions that we have just taken – paying the next tranche to Greece and organising a haircut which does not completely cripple the banking sector – are necessary to allow us to emerge from the crisis by means of economic growth. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Ms Harms, are you aware that the Prime Minister of the Netherlands has proposed a Commissioner – Mr Rehn, to be specific about it – as a sort of European finance minister? We believe that this is a good idea. My second question to you is as follows. You have spoken here about imbalances and about the investments that need to be made. How do you explain the fact that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will be voting here today against a better, tougher, stronger Stability and Growth Pact, which will stabilise the eurozone, while we in Berlin are being given wonderful advice by the Socialists and the Greens? (Applause) Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, you have made a very good speech, Mr Barroso. What is important now is putting it into practice, in other words, the follow-up, as Mr Verhofstadt has said, and ensuring that something really happens here. I believe that we agree almost unanimously that we need more Europe in order to be able to overcome this crisis. However, we need the right Europe and for us that means that we want a stability union rather than a debt union. We need to include a ‘debt brake’ in the national constitutions. We still need, and here my opinion differs from that of the Chair of my group, different interest rates, because they act as an economic ‘debt brake’. We also need an organised process for national bankruptcy. We need rules which determine what happens when a country becomes unable to pay its debts, so that we can keep it in the eurozone. That is the crucial point. We need a stability pact with teeth and with automatic sanctions. I would like to say one thing. The plan by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to vote against this tougher stability pact here today is a continuation of Gerhard Schröder’s policy of 2003, which aimed to destroy the stability culture of Europe. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, some excellent work has been done in a difficult field. I am a little surprised by Mr Cohn-Bendit, who spent five minutes berating you, describing your role as that of a blackmailer and calling on you to resolve the problems immediately, before leaving the Chamber. He could at least have waited to hear what you had to say in reply. The fact is that some excellent work has been done in this field. There is one thing that we must not forget: what were our fears? We were afraid that the European Union would once again create an impression that our Member States would not pull together, just as we failed to act cohesively in the war in Iraq or as we are doing now in Libya. Germany and France had already made their positions clear in individual statements. On the contrary, the European Union is pulling together. You have earned the trust of both sides in the region, the Israelis and the Palestinians. This is a diplomatic feat in itself and it is true to say that we can only play a constructive role through trust. It is also true that we, the European Union, can only play a constructive role if our Member States are united. Both of these points are on a good footing thanks to your work. Overall, you have done a good job. There are three more important things I would like to mention: we want a united European Union – you are making good progress in this direction. As Parliament stated in its resolution, we want a negotiated solution in the United Nations. We do not want a vote with winners and losers. We regard this as vitally important. Thirdly, we must have a timetable. We say that the Palestinians should get their upgrade during the 66th General Assembly, in other words, they must be recognised. We should allow the Palestinians this moment of joy, Mr Swoboda. However, I should say, whenever reference is made to 1947, that immediately afterwards, in 1948, Israel found itself under attack from all its Arab neighbours. If we achieve recognition for Palestine as a peaceful state and secure borders for the state of Israel, then this will be a reason to celebrate for the Palestinians, for the Israelis and for us here in Europe who played a constructive role, thanks to your efforts. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
).  
– Madam President, just a short question to Mr Davies. Would he concede that, on the Palestinian side, it is fair to speak of two faces as well? Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE) 
Mr President, Mr Tusk, Mr Barroso, you have been quoted, Mr Tusk, as saying that the Polish Presidency will primarily be characterised by the way it reacts to crises. It seems to me that your speech today showed that you have more than just crisis management on your agenda. You want to give Europe a direction. I believe this is a good thing, and my fellow Members on all sides of the House have emphasised this. You delivered a great speech. I would like to thank you warmly for that. You mentioned the debt crisis in Europe, calling for European solidarity. We, in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe give our emphatic backing to such solidarity. However, I would remind you of the other side of the coin. For us, this clearly means solidity. It was a lack of solidity and dubious lending policies over many years that led to this crisis. That is why our key demand is for a stability pact that genuinely has teeth. It is ironic that in 2003, the German Chancellor and the French President watered down the Stability and Growth Pact and that the present German Chancellor and French President decided while strolling on the beach in Deauville that the pact for the future should once again be toothless. Mr Tusk, do not let this discourage you! Set to work – as Mr Verhofstadt has pointed out, the direction is clear. A second area where I would encourage you to press on boldly is one of the focal points of your Presidency: progressing the common security and defence policy. You will hear some sceptical, reluctant reactions from the capitals of Europe. Do not let this discourage you. The Americans are withdrawing. We have Libya, we have Syria, Eastern Moldova and Georgia – we Europeans have a lot on our collective plate. Strengthen the European External Action Service, promote democracy and human rights, continue to develop security policy instruments and the European Defence Agency. Push for progress in the interest of Europe! There is much to be done. I wish you the best of luck. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, you have mentioned that you will be holding Quartet negotiations on 11 September and I am very pleased about that. I am equally pleased, although perhaps also a little surprised, because you are setting your sights very high. You have already clearly stated that you expect this meeting to result in a statement that will bring the Palestinians and the Israelis back to the negotiating table. You have publicly set yourself a very challenging objective and I very much hope that you achieve it. Why am I hoping for this? On the one hand, for the sake of the people in the region and, on the other, because I am concerned once more about the common foreign and security policy. Mr Sarkozy has announced that he will behave in a certain way and the German Government has said that it will do something quite different. If we then find ourselves in a situation where the Palestinians present their concerns to the General Assembly, I am again worried about the unity of the Member States on a central foreign policy question and it is you who will bear the brunt of the criticism. Therefore, I wish you every success in these Quartet negotiations. My second point is that you have said that democracy is important and that the people in the region want democracy. That is certainly true. However, I believe that we should not lose sight of the fact that what the people really want is dignity and we should focus all our attention on this issue. They want to be able to live in dignity under the rule of law, with no arbitrary confiscation of property. They want habeas corpus and they want to be free from constant threats by the secret police. They want jobs and the prospect of a positive future, so that a free trade agreement with us really will bring results. Of course, they also want democracy and the option of shaping their own political system. However, that is one part of a bigger picture. Finally, they also want peace and an end to this terrible violence. I would like to emphasise once again that we should take the measures proposed by Mr Verhofstadt here in relation to Syria. It would be very good if we could work closely together with Turkey and make genuine progress. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.
 – (DE) 
Madam President, I, too, wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs De Keyser, for her excellent report. This report has a normative section and an operative section. In the normative section, we try to establish a European consensus on what, from our point of view, constitutes democracy, what it absolutely must encompass. The Council has been unable to come to such agreement for years, because the Member States have very different traditions. Nonetheless, I believe that we can all agree that what we have included in recitals C to O are clearly elements of democracy which must be taken into account when promoting democracy. The operative section deals with the instruments. What instruments are available to us? The EIDHR has been mentioned. We find that it is often too slow, too bureaucratic, too complicated and has scope for improvement. The Instrument for Stability could also be faster. The report states that we always react in an immediate and integrated manner to situations; however, it took weeks before election workers could be sent to Tunisia to provide technical assistance under the Instrument for Stability. There is still a lot of work to do here. That is why the European Endowment for Democracy is being discussed, because we want a faster, more flexible instrument. I believe – and this is important and applies to all the groups – that there are some who are more enthusiastic, while others are somewhat more reticent. We need clarification from the European External Action Service, from the Commission and from the Polish Presidency of the Council, which considers this an important project. Where are the boundaries between the instruments that we have and what a European Endowment for Democracy is supposed to do? Who does what with which instruments and when? Mr Howitt addressed the question of election observations in this context. I believe that this is very important. Please look at paragraphs 60 to 63: they contain this House’s view on election monitoring. We want stringent criteria for selecting countries; we are of the opinion that they are not always stringent enough. We want comprehensive political concepts. We want recommendations to be followed-up. I think these are some of the points that need to be highlighted. What happens next? This report contains numerous calls for action, by the EEAS and by Parliament. How can we make sanctions more effective? How can we make the instruments more effective? What are we doing for women and democracy, for gender equality? What are we doing in the EEAS delegations across the world? There are numerous calls for action to be drawn from this report. Let us get to work. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

Mr President, Prime Minister, President of the Commission, my group is of the view that the Hungarian Presidency has achieved some truly important successes. This was a difficult presidency, with the financial crisis, Fukushima and the developments in North Africa. We have your government to thank, Mr Orbán – particularly your foreign minister, Mr Martonyi, who is sitting alongside you, and also your Minister of State for EU Affairs, Mrs Győri – for the fact that really outstanding work has been done here. This is particularly true as regards economic policy. What has been achieved in terms of stabilising the euro has undoubtedly been a great success, although it remains an important task. The adoption of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and also the Treaty establishing the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) – these are great and important achievements. The implementation of the first European Semester, the coordination of Member States’ budgetary policy – this is progress par excellence
 when it comes to preventing the indebtedness that has been commonplace in the past. There is one outstanding matter, which you yourself have mentioned: the so-called ‘six pack’ – the economic governance package. Our group will insist on this and we will continue to insist that we strengthen the Stability and Growth Pact, and consequently we will also stand firm on the issue of the reversed qualified majority. I believe it was right to postpone the decision for the time being and to continue the negotiations. Joseph Daul has said here that we need a convincing economic policy package if we are to have a stable euro. We feel that the Stability and Growth Pact is key to this. It needs teeth, and that is why the negotiations should continue. There are a few other policy areas in which you were very successful during your Presidency. Croatia has been mentioned, and the conclusion of the accession negotiations. I can only endorse what Mr Swoboda has already said: this is a most significant step forward for the whole region. After three years, the directive on consumer rights has at last been finalised. Progress has been made on the energy efficiency plan. One further very important matter from our point of view, and also in the view of Europe’s small and medium-sized enterprises, is the European patent, which President Barroso has just mentioned. A whole raft of really noteworthy successes achieved under your Presidency. Prime Minister, when we met in Budapest we said to you that we would assess your Presidency fairly, but that naturally we would also look at what is going on in your country. From the point of view of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, we regret that your Presidency has been overshadowed by the controversy surrounding the media law. We would have liked to have seen a different media law. Although the Commission brought about some amendments, to our way of thinking these were not in the key areas. We would also like to have seen the Constitution being drawn up by the process proposed by the Venice Commission. I believe that this watchfulness of each Member State – including my own, by the way – by the rest of Europe must continue if the European Union is to make progress. Freedom dies little by little – whether it is freedom of the press or freedom to travel. In a quarter of an hour customs officers will take up their places on the German-Danish and Danish-Swedish borders in order to reintroduce border controls. That is a development against which we might have wished the Presidency to have spoken out more strongly. This whole area – freedom to travel, asylum policy, revision of the Dublin II Regulation, the attack on the freedom to travel within the Schengen area – is where we would have liked to have seen greater commitment from your Presidency. Overall your Presidency has been a successful one, but we would have preferred it not to have been overshadowed by the criticisms that I have mentioned. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
).

Madam President, Mr Weber’s motion makes good sense. We have completed a truly enormous programme with some major, significant reports. We now no longer have any legislative reports to vote on. It is already after half past one. It would be best to postpone the non-legislative reports to the July part-session. This would be no great loss. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, following the confidence vote yesterday in Athens with the result that we are all aware of, the Bild
 newspaper in Germany printed the headline ‘Greek leader has survived – Europe can breathe a sigh of relief’. I have to say that I was also pleased with the result of this vote, but I think it is far too early to breathe a sigh of relief. This is because we now need to put the substantial austerity package successfully in place in the next week. That is the next big test. Even then, we will be a long way from being able to breathe a sigh of relief. Further steps and measures will still need to be taken before this crisis is overcome. I believe that what has been said here is right. The people in Greece need a light at the end of the tunnel. However, I would also like to make it quite clear that the people in the countries from which most of the aid is coming also need a light at the end of the tunnel. They have the feeling that they are giving and giving and giving and there is no end to it. In Greece the people have the feeling that they are saving and saving and saving and there is no end to it. That is why a growth strategy is so important. That is why privatisations are crucial to break open and liberalise this encrusted economy. That is why it is right for us resolutely to promote and support the reduction of public debt in Greece. Democracy has to endorse this. What is happening with respect to Mr Samaras is totally irresponsible. However, it is right for us to give guarantees for investments, for example. It is also right for us to draw out unused EU funds, Mr Barroso, and make them available to Greece, because ultimately it will not only be Greece but the whole of Europe that will benefit from more growth. If we look ahead slightly, one thing is also important: the Stability and Growth Pact must be strengthened. We must prevent future crises. This is where this reverse qualified majority comes in. No ordinary citizen will understand what that actually means. To put it plainly, either the Stability and Growth Pact has this strange technical element that I have just mentioned, and then the Stability and Growth Pact will have teeth, or else it does not. Then we will not be able to support this package. Reverse qualified majority voting in the preventive phase of the Stability and Growth Pact is absolutely essential as far as we are concerned. Mr Barroso, I am extremely pleased to hear you explain once again that the Commission is of exactly the same opinion. I would like to see substantial support for this project from this House.

Madam President, it is hardly conceivable that our relations with Russia are based on an agreement dating from 1994. We have not succeeded in resolving anything new since then. We alternate between cooperation and confrontation with Russia. Where the neighbourhood is concerned, we deplore the war with Georgia, the pressure brought to bear on Ukraine, the recognition of President Lukashenko in Belarus and the split in the Republic of Moldova as a result of the conflict in Transnistria. At the same time, our cooperation with Russia in the Security Council on the issue of Libya or on Iran’s nuclear programme is pleasing. As regards Russia itself, the new paradigm is what is known as the Partnership for Modernisation. Yet what is modernity without democracy? In the list of priorities that you have just given, Commissioner Füle, human rights came after cucumbers and the rule of law after tomatoes. Is that the best we can expect in this area? Do we expect nothing more of Russia’s democratisation? I believe that as Parliament, we must make it clear that we do expect something; for example, fair elections – there must be progress there. There is, though, one thing that I would like to say quite clearly: such progress is often to be achieved at expert level. Two summits a year is too much. Let us have one summit, as we do with America. We have enough exchange with Russia in the specialist areas. Otherwise, we will have summits with no real content, and that would not be good either.

Madam President, Baroness Ashton, we are still a long way from a common foreign policy which is really worthy of the name. You are being criticised for this, but it sometimes seems to me that you have been made the scapegoat in a situation which is outside your control and which is caused by the fact that the Member States do not have the political will to agree on a common approach. Let us take the example of Libya. First of all, Italy blocked the imposition of sanctions, then France recognised the transitional council in Benghazi without any consultation and, finally, Germany abstained during the vote on the resolution in the UN Security Council. There is nothing you can do to change this, but it gives Europe a negative image. In Syria, we should have imposed stronger sanctions, but here, we also needed unanimity. There are some Member States – Greece, Italy and Spain have been mentioned in the press and Germany may also be one of them – which are opposed to this. In this case, you must stand up here and say: ‘We have only been able to put 13 on the list’. The need for unanimity is paralysing us. It no longer works with 27 Member States. We must make the next quantum leap forward in our common foreign and security policy. I would like to make this quite clear to Mr Tannock and his Tory friends. What can you do? Make public the fact that European cooperation has failed and identify who is responsible. Make use of the community instruments, in particular, to promote democracy. I was surprised to hear you speaking here so openly about the European Endowment for Democracy. We are in the process of drawing up a report on the subject with Mrs De Keyser as the rapporteur and we are evaluating what the requirements are. I must make it quite clear that we do not want a second European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR), which is bureaucratic, slow, over-complex and unpolitical. We need a solution that is unbureaucratic, fast, simple and political. If you can bring this about, you will have our full support. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Madam President, Mr Le Hyaric, I see things in exactly the same way as you do. The unity between Hamas and Fatah really is an historical step forward. It may now perhaps be possible to make progress in the process of reconciliation between the Palestinians and the Israelis. Baroness Ashton has made it very clear that the second flotilla will be a completely unnecessary provocation which could harm this process. Would you and your group now distance yourself from your support for this flotilla in the same way as happened yesterday here in Parliament with the substantial involvement of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left? Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, spring has arrived in the Mediterranean, but in the Gulf and in Syria, winter still reigns. The images of violence which we are seeing are horrifying. Several hundred people have been killed and Amnesty International and the United Nations have produced alarming reports. The calls which the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are making are clear. We want a special session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva to be held as quickly as possible. The Council of Europe and the Member States of the European Union which are represented on the UN Human Rights Council should take up this call. The UN Council is always very quick to act when it comes to taking one side in the Middle East conflict. It is now time for it to face the real challenge presented by these extreme violations of human rights. We need reform, we need a move to democracy, and we need an arms embargo. All of these things have already been mentioned here. I watched the speech made by President Assad of Syria live. This is a medieval-style dictatorship which uses western PR agencies to present its representatives as pseudo-modernising influences in glossy magazines. The agencies and the magazines should be asking themselves whether this is really the right thing to do. Now to Yemen. This is where there is, in my opinion, the greatest danger: the risk of a split between north and south, an active al-Qaeda cell and the danger of a failed state. We already have a failed state of this kind in the case of Somalia and our Atalanta mission is in operation in the Gulf of Aden. Europe has a direct interest in the area and we need to hear more than what the representative of the Council has said here today. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Madam President, it has been said here that it is not the euro that is in crisis, but the Member States that have got into debt. That is the nub of the crisis – irresponsible indebtedness that has been carried on for many years. That is what we must now stop. That is why it is right that the European Stability Mechanism must be strict. That is also why it is right that this has been the case in the bail-outs that have taken place. That is also why it is right that Ireland is not given an interest rate reduction. This indebtedness must end. Once again I am hearing the social democrats talk of a distinction between good and bad debt. Of course investment is different to consumption, but at some point too much good debt becomes bad debt too. We need to be fair to future generations, we need sustainable public finances – and then the euro will become stable again. The pact for the euro involves too little Community method. That has been said here, and quite rightly so. I share this view. I would like to say a final word about Libya. The Council has supported resolution 1973. We must now look to the future. I agree with Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra when he says that France has played a very good role. However, had Turkey been invited to the Elysée summit then we would not be having these problems in NATO and the situation would be considerably easier for us all. Moreover, I hope that the newly appointed head of the transitional government in Libya will soon be visiting us here in Europe. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff,

 Mr President, we have been addressed specifically here. Of course, we have confidence in Commissioner Kroes’s work. Her examination of the secondary law was exemplary. We wish the Commissioner examining the primary law had done her work in the same way, as this is where the problem lies. (Applause from the left)
 The reality of the situation includes those things just mentioned by Mr Swoboda, namely that, in the opinion of both the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the amendments are inadequate. Hungary’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Public Administration and Justice, Mr Navracsics, has himself admitted that this was not a significant amendment of the media law. I could mention the protection of journalistic sources, which still remains unregulated, or the composition and powers of the media authority. All of these are matters that still need to be discussed. I would therefore like to state, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, that we will not withdraw the motion for a resolution, but rather request that the vote take place. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, this debate here in the European Parliament makes one thing clear, and that is that we are not neutral when it comes to this conflict. We are on the side of the democratic revolution. Gaddafi must go and Europe must play an active role in bringing that about. There is a sharing of the workload here at the international level. We are discussing a no-fly zone, something for which – as Mr Schulz correctly identified – the backing of the UN Security Council is required. What do we do if Moscow and Beijing do not grant their assent? Well, then we would have to close this loophole in international law. We would have to take on the responsibility of protecting the unarmed population regardless, with the aid of the Arab League and the African Union, but also with the aid of an active role on the part of the European Union. Military implementation would then be the responsibility of NATO and its partners, but politically and economically, the European Union would continue to also have the key role to play, long after, in such a scenario, NATO and the United Nations had finished playing their major roles. There is one thing that I would like to say quite clearly, and that is that I was very pleased, Mr Schulz, to hear you say that we need a free trade zone. This is because, if we do not allow these people’s products into the EU, they will continue to come across the Mediterranean in coracles and in their masses to overwhelm Lampedusa. We certainly do not want that. Let us, therefore, create the free trade zone, let us allow the products into the EU, so that the people there also have an economic future in their democratised countries. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, the contrast is striking! The revolution, the change taking place in the Arab world is fascinating for all of us. We are trying to help. We have discussed Libya today. In recent days and weeks, we have discussed Egypt and Tunisia. Yet, at the same time, we have a standstill in the peace process. Against this backdrop, we must say quite clearly here, Baroness Ashton, that you did us a service when you managed to convene a meeting of the Quartet. To produce movement now, at this period of profound insecurity in the region, and profound insecurity in Israel, was an extremely positive service. I should like to make this very clear. You occasionally have to endure criticism from this House, too. For this reason, some praise is perhaps also in order. As far as the contents are concerned, I should like to make it clear that I do not believe that Israel is sceptically disposed towards democracy in Arab countries. It is merely that these changes have not yet come to an end. When and if there are democracies there, I agree completely with Mr Pöttering and with you too, Mr Swoboda, then there will clearly be a great opportunity finally to get the Middle East peace process going too. Settlement building must stop, that is clear in any case, as must the sophistry with which it is defended. There is a consensus among all groups in this House on that point. Connected to the uprising in the Arab world, we also have experienced protests against the Hamas regime in the Gaza Strip. The situation in the Palestinian Territories is in no way simple. Democratisation must succeed here too. For the time being, we fortunately have a moderate and conservative partner in the West Bank, but that is absolutely not the case in the Gaza Strip. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

Madam President, Mr Füle has just made it completely clear that Turkey and the European Union need one another. We are important neighbours, we are allies in NATO, and many people of Turkish origin live in Member States of the European Union. We must show respect for one another. I very much support visa facilitation for businesspeople and students, just as you have said. I am also in favour of integrating Turkey much more closely into the structures of the common security and defence policy. I would like to see Cyprus bringing an end to its blockade in this area. When we look at North Africa, it is clear that Turkey is a role model for many countries in the region. All of this is very good. Then we come to the accession process and we find that many chapters are blocked. It is extremely difficult to open new chapters. There are only three chapters left and the competition chapter is almost at the stage of opening. What will happen when the last chapters are opened? Will Turkey and the European Union no longer have anything to say to one another? That surely cannot be the case! Therefore, we must consider very carefully how to progress with the accession process and whether or not we can retain the current procedure, which involves Parliament commenting on the Commission’s progress report by means of a resolution. Our 2010 report is highly critical, but also constructive. It deals with fundamental rights which are self-evident, particularly for Liberals: freedom of the press, freedom of speech, expression and assembly, student demonstrations, trade union rights and freedom of religion. For years, we have been calling for improvements in freedom of religion, but far too little progress has been made. The arrest of Ahmet Şık and Nedim Şener and the interference in the work of political foundations in Turkey are giving us great cause for concern. This is covered by the first Copenhagen criterion. It is a central issue, because it is the political criterion. If Turkey cannot move forward with its internal democratic constitution, I believe that we will still have serious problems in some areas, quite apart from the deadlock in the Council. In diplomatic terms, we need Turkey and Turkey also needs us. In democratic terms, there is still a great deal to be done in Turkey. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, the Treaty of Lisbon makes new demands of European Union foreign policy and development policy. One has been mentioned here: coherence. In other words, our various instruments, the European External Action Service, the European Investment Bank and the Commission must act in a consistent manner. The Treaty of Lisbon also provides for greater parliamentary control, greater transparency and joint decisions on these matters. All of this will enhance the quality of the debate on foreign policy, particularly if we have greater transparency as a result of the participation of the relevant committees – primarily the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Development – in this House. One result of this transparency is that this Parliament has resolved to remove Belarus from the list of countries in which the European Investment Act can act without first having another debate here in this House. Are human rights being respected? Have opposition politicians been released? Does the state respect the property of its citizens? Is there freedom of the press? Are entrepreneurs able to act freely? Are there free trade unions? In our relationship with such an important neighbour – one which is located directly on the border of the European Union – these are all matters which need to be debated first, before the European Investment Bank becomes active there. I am very pleased that the House has taken up this suggestion and I call on the Council to do the same. Yesterday we had a debate on Egypt. We debated the instruments and what we could do. Baroness Ashton called for the ceiling applied to the European Investment Bank to be raised. Parliament is happy to pursue this. We need to improve how we work together with Egypt and Tunisia, with North Africa. That is only right. It is also a good example of how this Parliament can react quickly. The same is now required of the Council, which must act accordingly. I believe that our foreign policy instruments, especially if they are market-oriented, together with the loans from the European Investment Bank can do a lot to assist with development and economic growth in North Africa. That is precisely what is needed. If there is growth there, if there is democracy there, then we will also have fewer migrants arriving at our borders. If I may specifically address our fellow Members from the extreme right, I would like to say that your arguments are really far too rudimentary and simplistic – if not primitive. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the course of a revolution is seldom predictable. That was the case with the American and the French revolutions, as well as the major revolution in Europe in 1989/91. It is important for us to be clear about one thing: this is and remains the Egyptian revolution. It is not a European revolution that we would be able to steer. Instead, what Baroness Ashton is doing there is right, namely to listen and not to try to dictate events there as Europe would wish. However, one thing is key: there should not only be an election in Egypt in August, the Egyptians must have a genuine election. It is good that the Muslim Brotherhood has involved itself in the process to amend the constitution, has founded a party and will take part in elections. However, the secular powers must be equally involved so that the Egyptians will have a genuine election in this revolution for freedom. I would like to say a few words about adaptation of the instruments. That is jargon and hardly anyone understands what it means. What does it mean? Firstly, it means providing more money to enable the European Investment Bank to do something. But what else does it mean? We need a European foundation for democracy to enable us, in future, to work more efficiently, more quickly and more democratically with these civil societies. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
).

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, I would ask you to be more courageous. Go to Cairo before the Council of Foreign Ministers. Speak with the government representatives and with the opposition there. Come back to Brussels and tell your colleagues what you have seen and heard. Set the agenda and do not listen to 27 different opinions, with which it is then very difficult to actually do anything. When Mr Mingarelli goes to Tunisia – something that I view very positively – inform us so that we are aware and so that the public is aware that Europe has a presence there. I first found out that the American was there and only then did I hear that Mr Mingarelli was also there. You are the foreign minister for Europe and I would earnestly advise you, on the one hand, to be our foreign minister. On the other hand, as foreign minister for Europe, you must not jump through every hoop that people put in front of you. Comparisons have been made here today with 1989, and I think that is right. I believe that Tahrir Square in Cairo in 2011 is equivalent to Alexanderplatz in Berlin in 1989. A revolution is taking place there. However, if we recall the revolution of 1989 for a moment we will remember that we had the same dilemma then. We wanted freedom, stability and democracy, and we overlook the fact that this process, the transition from a stable dictatorship to a democracy, is rarely peaceful, orderly and stable. From this point of view, diplomacy, organisation and caution also have their place. That should not distract us from the fact that we are extremely pleased about this revolution. It is a revolution against the dictatorship and for freedom. I do believe that Europe can dictate the setup in these countries. However, our joy needs to be apparent, but one thing is also clear, and that is that, even with limited influence, it will certainly not be possible to build a state with Mr Mubarek. With the violence today in Tahrir Square, the last vestige of legitimacy for this ruler in Egypt has been lost. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Madam President, Mr Orbán, in an article which appeared yesterday in a major German newspaper, you cited Otto Graf Lambsdorff as one of your role models. We last met at his funeral service in December 2009. You attended as a private individual and we very much appreciated that. I would like to ask you to honour his memory by respecting, following and defending the principles of the liberal constitutional state in all the measures that you take. You have responded to the criticism of the media law with two arguments. You have said that this is a campaign against Hungary and against you personally and that the campaign is unspecific. I would like to make it very clear on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe that this is not a campaign. It is an issue for Europe if fundamental freedoms are interfered with and called into question in a Member State of the European Union. I would like to say to the Commission and to Mr Barroso that a legal assessment must be carried out by Mrs Kroes. However, the Commission is not just a solicitor’s office; it is also a political body. The assessment must take a political form and it must be completed quickly. Your second argument is that the criticism is unspecific. Mr Orbán, I would like to make a few specific points: slander, defamation and incitement to hatred are against the law in Germany and in other democracies. That is what the criminal law is there for. Please let the criminal law take effect in this case. You need to improve the legal protection in Article 163, change the composition and the powers of the media authority in Articles 123 and 183, together with a great deal of other things. There are many specific points. I suggest that you postpone the application of the law until the Commission’s assessment has been carried out and this must be done as quickly as possible. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, there is one thing that it is important for citizens, too, to understand: the European Union is not in debt. We are talking here about a debt crisis in our Member States. The European Union is the only political level in Europe that is debt free. I would also like it to remain that way. However, we are joined together in a shared destiny by the euro. In this regard, Mrs Harms and Mr Schulz rightly lamented the lack of European spirit. Deauville was a mistake. Germany and France have been blackmailed by the United Kingdom. The Commission must impose the sanctions, not the finance ministers. Mr Van Rompuy, the automatic nature of the sanctions during the preventive phase was sacrificed in Deauville. The finance ministers must take the decision again here. These are the ones who were previously responsible for triggering the financial crisis and the debt crisis in the Member States. What is economic governance? Everyone is talking about economic governance, but what does it actually mean in specific terms? Do we really want the European Union to interfere in the details of our labour market and social policy? There is a big question mark here. Setting the legal framework for entrepreneurship, stimulating growth, they are all well and good, but above all putting public finances in order once again in the Member States – that is the challenge. That is why the European Semester is so important, and that is why it must be implemented. (

 Mr President, of course I am happy to answer that. Mr Schulz is, of course, also a member of the Bureau of the Social Democratic Party of Germany and will also occasionally make statements here which are probably not entirely congruent. There is, however, one thing I would like to say, and it is that, if Mr Schulz can show me who from the FDP was present in Deauville, I would be grateful to him. We made a relatively clear statement on this at the end of the summit. I believe that the key point, namely actually relinquishing the automatic nature of the sanctions in the preventive phase, was criticised by us in no uncertain terms. If we get the change to the treaty, this will be rectified retrospectively. However, the decision made in Deauville was clearly a mistake. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, the European External Action Service is one of the most important decisions in the Treaty of Lisbon. It is now only six weeks until Baroness Ashton will no longer primarily be the Minister responsible for establishing an EU foreign ministry; she will instead be the Foreign Minister for Europe, and that is a good thing. This will commence on 1 December and we wish you every success in this regard. We have had many debates and we have achieved a great deal. It was a fruitful political battle. The lack of democracy associated with the old common foreign and security policy has been eliminated, there is a greater degree of accountability and the quality of the public debate has improved. There will be more stringent budgetary control, the prerequisites for a genuine team spirit have been created and national diplomats can, if they so wish, remain in the European External Action Service. There will be no geographical quotas – you could sometimes get the impression that this is the most important issue here, but it most definitely is not. Germany, in particular, would benefit greatly from a quota, but I am nevertheless against this. A common form of training will be provided. I believe that the prerequisites for a successful EEAS are in place. In other words, the European Parliament is almost happy. We would be really happy if you were now to take advantage of the opportunity and actually establish the appropriate structure for conflict prevention and crisis management that has been promised. Then we would have European added value right from the start. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, this, of course, was a European Council meeting that focused, among other things, on foreign policy. At almost the same time, in the United Nations General Assembly, China and numerous developing countries voted against granting special status to you, Mr Van Rompuy, and also to Baroness Ashton. This ought to be addressed with China at the summit on 6 October and it needs to be discussed in no uncertain terms. However, it demonstrates quite clearly the reality of the situation: the European Union still has a long way to go to achieve political power. We are currently an economic power and, for that reason, citizens expect us to do something in this area to combat the economic crisis. That brings me to the task force. Mr Van Rompuy, you said there was broad consensus. At the end of the month, this consensus will be put to the test. On 29 September, the Commission will present its documents. You have already said that you will present a draft on 27 September. I hope that these will be in line with each other to some extent. Incidentally, I would recommend that you speak Dutch more often; I very much enjoyed your statement on the Community method. As regards macro-economic surveillance, there is apparently consensus in the task force – great! Monitoring of national fiscal policies within the European Semester – that is a good thing and something that we expressly welcome. As regards the sanctions, you say that more work is needed. We all know what that means: there is no consensus. The test will therefore come at the end of the month. Why, as Parliament, do we insist so strongly on the Community method? Mr Schulz has just mentioned this. We are still in the process of weighing up the Lisbon machinery. However, the crucial point is this: the European Council is now a European Union body. What that means in terms of its understanding of itself, we do not yet know exactly. If often appears to us to be a gathering of Member States representing only their national interests. One national interest is very clear: that of the United Kingdom, which is to have as little regulation as possible in the financial sector. The Community method represents our only chance of getting the interests of Europe as a whole to prevail over individual national interests. That is why this House insists on the application of the Community method. In light of your Dutch statements, I am pleased that you view this in the same way. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mr Hughes, we have worked together before and I have high regard for your work. However, in your analysis of the economic crisis and of the measures that are now to be taken, you are seriously wide of the mark, just like the majority of your group. Would you not agree that it was excessive debt – in other words, too much expenditure in pursuing so-called policy objectives – that triggered the current crisis? Would you not also agree that, for that reason, precisely the right thing to do now is to focus on stability and a sound fiscal policy in order to overcome this crisis? Holger Krahmer  (ALDE

 Madam President, a comment on the Rules of Procedure: where are the Greens when environmental associations organise exhibitions in Parliament and confront elected MEPs with the words ‘we are the voice of the citizens’?

blue-card question
. – (DE)
 Mr President, Ms Lepage, are you therefore willing to accept that it is a question of physics rather than a lobbying question; that if you burn gas more efficiently than coal, there are fewer CO2 
emissions than with coal-based power generation? This means, for example, that if we ultimately shut down our coal-fired power stations in Europe – a development that is already taking place in the United States – and bring gas-fired power stations on stream, CO2 
emissions will fall. That is my question. My second question, which follows on from the first, is as follows: are you willing to accept that mining less coal possibly also has less of an impact on the environment than shale gas exploration may have, in other words that coal mining has a greater environmental impact than shale gas exploration? Holger Krahmer  (ALDE

blue-card question to Sabine Wils

Mr President, Ms Wils, my question is along exactly the same lines: what impression do you have of freely elected MEPs – to think that we are at the beck and call of industry interests, that we are not smart enough to form our own opinion and that we need exhibitions and lobbying before acting as stooges for some lobby or other? Why do you assume that Parliament is being overrun by the interests of lobbyists? Why do you not assume that there can be a fair and open debate on all issues, particularly in connection with the environment, climate and energy? Holger Krahmer  (ALDE

 – (DE) 
Mr President, Mr Groote, there is no technology without risks! The perfect energy generation technology does not exist. I believe the same applies to what we are discussing here today. I am very much in favour of a rational discussion. What we are currently experiencing is a new arrival on the energy markets in the form of unconventional resources, applying mainly to gas, but also to oil. It is neither appropriate to get carried away with euphoria about the great future of gas, nor, as some of my colleagues from the Greens and Left have done here, to paint a picture of terrifying scenarios which bear absolutely no resemblance to reality. I think we should bear in mind that these unconventional resources have the potential to change all the familiar energy supply relationships between suppliers and consumers, and that economic efficiency calculations for existing energy sources are also called into question. We should face up to this development. We should acknowledge that it could also be an opportunity for Europe and not only a risk, and we should prepare ourselves to take up and use new technologies in a positive way, to weigh up opportunities and risks fairly and not to fall into ideological debates. Holger Krahmer,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.
 – (DE) 
Mr President, my role in this great financial market regulation process is limited to the issue of the extent to which industry is affected by financial market regulation – here I speak on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy – since there is a need for financial market regulation, which we are addressing with this directive and regulation package. However, there is a lot of activism involved in financial market regulation and the Commission’s first proposal on the subject would simply have led, through questions of definition and interpretation, to companies in the real economy – here I am thinking of smaller industrial enterprises such as German public utility companies and agricultural cooperatives – suddenly being treated like banks, for example when they hedge delivery relationships with suppliers and customers on the futures markets. This would have been the collateral damage of financial market regulation and would have been in no one’s interest. In my view it is clear that industrial companies must be treated differently to banks. The majority of futures transactions made by these companies are for hedging purposes, not speculation. Even where these transactions do involve speculation, it must be said that I do not know of a single industrial company or energy supplier that is of systemic importance. The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy was very clear in its opinion on this subject and I must say that I am pleased that these aspects managed to appear in the final package. To that extent, in the end we certainly did well to include this ancillary aspect. Holger Krahmer,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, firstly, I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur. We have recently enjoyed very constructive cooperation on this subject in particular. The result that we have before us today is a compromise, and it is in the nature of compromise that everyone is both satisfied and dissatisfied with it at the same time. Overall, it is a step in the right direction when it comes to the quality of marine fuels in the European Union. We have been making policy on air quality in other areas for years and, in my opinion, we often overshoot the mark and pass measures that are not particularly efficient. In this case, we are on the right track. Nonetheless, I have certain objections here. In reaching agreement so quickly at first reading, we have disregarded some of the arguments and concerns of some players in Europe’s internal market. In 2015 at the latest, when it becomes compulsory to use what are, in fact, sulphur-free fuels in the Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs), which is essentially in the North Sea and the Baltic, there may be consequences of this legislation that can already be foreseen today but which, at the end of the day, we are completely ignoring. It cannot be in the interests of this legislation if more expensive fuel for goods transport by ferry in the North Sea and Baltic results in goods vehicles turning around at the ferry ports and going by road instead, where this is a possible alternative to short sea crossings. We have given no thought to that, and it was not considered when the Marpol Convention was concluded either. We have simply disregarded this argument. Consequently, I fear that we will have to look at this situation again in the northern regions in two years’ time. I think it is important to harmonise things in Europe, but we also have to be clear that this cannot happen at the very highest level. I can quite understand some of the arguments from southern Member States, particularly those bordering the Mediterranean, which are dubious about this idea and feel that they have other priorities than the introduction of sulphur-free fuel. It costs money, and you can only ever spend your budget resources once. Consequently, I see this as a step in the right direction but, in the end, unequal competition within the EU has been written into the legislation here. My final point is that compensating Northern Europeans for their hardships by means of State aid cannot be the way to go since, in the end, this would distort competition between the countries of Northern Europe. Some countries will pay, while others will not. Holger Krahmer  (ALDE

 Mr President, I, too, would like to thank Mr Gerbrandy for the sound piece of work that he has presented here. I can also support much of what is in the report. I consider it a good thing that we are making the effort to say that we have to overcome the obstacles in the internal market when it comes to removing barriers to the exploitation of resources and the exchange of resources. I also feel, however, that a lot of things that have been said here are not quite correct. I feel I must briefly mention these. Jan, the price of copper is not going up because copper is becoming more scarce, neither are the costs of raw materials at AkzoNobel and Unilever going up because the raw materials are becoming scarcer. Instead, it is because we are printing so much money, and because a lot of money is looking for safe investments and increasingly it does not find these in government bonds – which is why much of it is ending up in the commodity markets. That is one reason why prices of raw materials are rising; not so much because we are about to completely run out of some raw materials and they will no longer be available. I think we need to look more carefully at the causes here. It generally has little to do with a scarcity of resources. There are two things in the report that I find hard to stomach and that I consider to be sending out completely the wrong signals. The first is the call to extend the scope of the Ecodesign Directive. We should stick with the principle that we will find the best solutions through competition and not by political edict – we have already heard the term ‘eco-diktat’ used in this context. The second point is that we in Europe, which is no longer growing and is facing catastrophic developments, should call for new taxes in order to manage our resources.

 That is a matter of political judgment. I would simply remind you that the central bank – this has nothing to do with this debate, but I have been asked the question so I must answer it – printed EUR 1 billion in the months of December and February in order to ease liquidity bottlenecks in the countries of southern Europe. In my opinion, it is apparent that we are on the way to losing price stability. I also think that this policy risks exacerbating the situation in the commodity markets, because a lot of money is flowing into precious metals and commodities there, since some investors see them as safe havens or want to make speculative transactions there too.

 Mr President, Mr Davies is aware that I am a fundamental opponent of the plan we are about to decide on. Political plans – particularly ones with very long-term goals – have always existed. These plans always had one thing in common: they were superseded by reality. The fact is that it makes absolutely no sense to plan how the world will be in 2050. This presumes too much knowledge. A great many things are bound to happen to us before then that we have not planned and that we cannot know or predict. The targets we set ourselves are, in the final analysis, arbitrary. We find ourselves comparing years and percentages that actually only have one constant feature, namely that they end in zero. Their relevance in terms of climate cannot really be explained in objective terms. We could just as easily deduct five years from the dates or add 5% to the percentage points. This would be just as arbitrary, but a little more ambitious. Why do we not do this? I would suggest that any of us still alive in 2050 should meet once again as venerable ladies and gentlemen to discuss the reality of these plans as part of a night’s entertainment. I have the feeling that would make a very entertaining evening indeed. It is also high time that we realised that European climate policy is a failure in global terms. Our pioneering role is not accepted and no one pays much attention to our standards. I would simply remind you of the inclusion of the aviation industry in emissions trading. We must take a much more reasonable approach. We will only achieve success in climate policy if the rest of the world comes on board. (Applause) Holger Krahmer  (ALDE

 Mr President, I believe that our decision today marks a black day for the European internal market. We are giving up on the concept of the internal market as a result of what is simply a reflex opposition to technology. This is obviously the latest fashion in the EU. We have criticised Denmark today for wanting to leave the Schengen Agreement for populist reasons. Essentially, we are now behaving in the same way. We must be fully aware of what we are doing. We are allowing the European Food Safety Authority to continue authorising genetically modified organisms (GMOs) on the internal market, but, at the same time, we are giving the Member States the legal means to deviate from these authorisation criteria. I hope that this will not set a precedent for other internal market decisions which are due to be made in future. We should pull ourselves together at this point and remember that we must not give up on the European idea at every opportunity. Holger Krahmer,

 Mr President, in the discussion about whether or not it is sensible to come to an agreement during the first reading, we should not stick as closely to our principles as some Members have recommended. This should depend on the dossier. How are the discussions going? How controversial are they? In the case of the regulation of CO2
 emissions from light commercial vehicles, it is clear that the positions of the institutions were not very far apart. Therefore, it would not have been worthwhile to start the second reading process, except in the case of an issue which is the subject of heated discussions, in other words, the long-term target. The European Commission has never explained properly and it is also not clear from the impact assessments how a reduction in emissions from 203 grams today to 135 grams within 10 years – these are the figures just mentioned by Mrs Hedegaard – can be implemented in an economically viable way. This represents a cut of 34% and goes far beyond our other climate targets. Parliament’s most important job was to bring this target back to reality and to make it feasible in economic terms. This is what we have done. I am pleased that Mr Groote took up my argument, because a fleet average of 147 grams is a long way from what the Commission originally proposed, but it is also by far the most ambitious target set anywhere in the world. We should not try to persuade ourselves that a CO2
 limit for light commercial vehicles will save the world’s climate. I would like to thank everyone, including the rapporteurs, for their hard work. I am pleased that we have achieved a large majority for this compromise. Holger Krahmer,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

Madam President, Europe is rightly regarded as having the safest medicines in the world. With this legislation, which we have been discussing for a long time, for two years I believe, we will further improve levels of safety. I would like to thank Mrs Matias very much for taking on such a complex report as a new Member of Parliament. This was a huge task and she has done very well. It also involved a great deal of teamwork and I would like to thank everyone involved for this. We have produced some very good results. However, we must not lose sight of the fact that we can never achieve complete safety by means of regulations. This is true in every area, not just in the case of medicines. We have rightly concentrated on the essential issues, on the distinctions between different types of packaging and on traceability in the distribution chain. By differentiating between prescription and over-the-counter medicines, we are taking the right approach, because we must remember that every piece of legislation and every attempt to make products safer costs money. Therefore, it is reasonable not to include every pack of aspirins or every over-the-counter medicine automatically right from the start. Instead, the Commission or the agency must be given the task of monitoring the market and investigating developments. I believe that we can be proud of what we have achieved. We have produced a piece of legislation that brings real benefits. Most patients will probably not be aware that they are the result of EU law and, therefore, we must make this very clear.

 In overall terms, the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament supports the waste disposal directive. However, the subject of photovoltaic modules remains a problem. There is no understandable reason for excluding the entire sector from the regulations. We have a wide range of legislation governing waste streams. Therefore, it is not clear why a complete industry, which is expected to produce significant waste streams, is being exempted. For this reason, some of the FDP Members of the European Parliament have abstained from voting on the report. Holger Krahmer,

 Madam President, Commissioner, with this directive, we have before us legislation that has come about surprisingly quickly. I am very surprised that we have reached a compromise already which I and my group – and I expressly underline that – consider acceptable. When all is said and done, this piece of legislation has had a very difficult passage through Parliament. We expanded its scope, only to restrict it again straight away. We have quite incidentally attempted to declare certain substances highly dangerous; perhaps we should ask ourselves whether this legislation is really the right forum for such a debate. Personally, I did not think it a good idea to include PVC and nanomaterials in a directive on ‘hazardous substances’. I therefore think it sensible that this is no longer the case in the compromise. The previous speaker has just said so already, but it really is remarkable that we consider each gram of polluting substances so carefully and are then sometimes very irrational in our debates. Apparently, there are industries in Europe which we are ring-fencing for political reasons. This seems to be the case for enterprises in the renewable energy sector. The fact that we instantly exempt them completely from the scope of this legislation by saying that we have to put up with environmental pollution for the sake of climate protection and our objectives in the area of renewable energy is incomprehensible. It does not add up. I only hope that we do not do the same thing in the case of electronic waste – the decision on which is also imminent here – because that would be even more astonishing. Holger Krahmer  (ALDE

 Mr President, it is good that we are looking at biocides, because they are hazardous, toxic substances. However, I am wondering why we do not base every piece of chemical legislation that we implement on the same system as that of REACH. We have passed the most comprehensive piece of chemical legislation in the world. The principles have been laid down: collect the data, evaluate it, authorise the product. Why are we using a different system for subsequent chemical legislation and defining new exclusion criteria, which ultimately also results in chemicals that we need and that, in some cases, do not have alternatives, being withdrawn from the market? I think that we will end up in a blind alley if we draw up our policy on chemicals purely from the perspective of toxic substances. Pest infestations can be much more dangerous, in particular, for small children because of the risks of disease transmission, than the few milligrams of biocides which we use to combat them. I would like to see the situation being put into proportion and, most importantly, I would like to see regulations that can be used not only by large companies which have the resources to enter into a discussion with the authorisation bodies, but also by smaller companies which supply useful products for niche markets.

 Madam President, I regret to say that we are debating a failed strategy here. Even at the time we adopted the directive, some voices of warning could already be heard asking whether including third countries in emissions trading without any consultation had really been thought through. Even today, we are ignoring the international situation. We imagine that we only have to grit our teeth and then everything will work out in Copenhagen, subsequent conferences and ICAO. However, it is not that simple. Nonetheless, we have an EU directive that has to be implemented. I would like the Commission to tell me how it intends to do this. I have four specific questions on this and I eagerly await the answers. Firstly, what steps is the Commission planning to take if third countries or third country airlines refuse to participate in the EU emissions trading system? Secondly, what measures are planned to bring about the inclusion of airlines in emissions trading? Thirdly, is it correct that the Commission is investigating or planning the withdrawal of EU flying rights from those airlines or third countries that refuse to participate in the EU emissions trading system? Fourthly, if such flying bans are imposed, how does the Commission expect the third countries concerned to react? May I remind you that the European Court of Justice has received actions from third countries that are simply refusing to be included in the EU’s emissions trading system. It is high time that we took a careful look at the day of reckoning that will come in 2012. I want to know what will happen then. What will we do then? Debating what position we are going to take at ICAO is of secondary importance to me right now. When it comes down to it, ICAO is nothing more than an assembly of the governments of the world that are acting from exactly the same vast differences in interest as they were in Copenhagen and, I suspect, as they will be in Cancún. My question to the Commission is therefore as follows: how are we going to get out of this dilemma? We are trying to implement a law that already exists, but which, in fact, cannot be implemented.

The FDP is basically in favour of positive labelling, or process labelling, for GMOs in food at European level in order to bring about the necessary transparency for consumers. In this case, however, we cannot agree to the fact that unequal treatment of different sectors is being demanded. While labelling is requested for the field of animal production, this is not the case for plant production. Unfair labelling of this kind for products of animal origin could distort the market to the disadvantage of one side. This counteracts our efforts to ensure fair competition, and is clearly in conflict with the principle of equality enshrined in our legal system. Holger Krahmer,

 Mr President, this debate was timed badly. I would like to have seen the Dutch team win, even if for the last time in this World Cup. This is perhaps a bad omen, because we are no longer allowed to watch, so they will probably not win after all. Commissioner, today – or more precisely tomorrow – we are completing a legislative package that we have been discussing for more than two years. It is not just controversy that is responsible for this, but also the European elections that have taken place in the meantime, and also the entry into force of a new EU Treaty which has meant that we have had to adjust a few things. However, I think that, if we can draw a conclusion from today’s debate, it is that we are voting on a compromise which completely deserves to be approved, even if, in some areas, we might do so with gritted teeth. I would like to emphasise two aspects. The first is the environmental requirements in industrial plants. What we are talking about here is the better implementation of best available techniques in Europe. I think that we have found a paragraph of exceptions in the compromise which is currently before us which gives the European Commission – Mr Potočnik, here I am addressing you directly – the tools to ensure over the next few years, better and more firmly than has been the case up to now, that the approximately 52 000 industrial plants in Europe which are affected by this finally make better use of best available techniques than they currently do. I have heard many arguments in this debate. I would like to take up one of these and deflect it, because I cannot comprehend it at all. It has often been said to me that the use of best available techniques is too expensive and that we will thereby endanger the competitiveness of European industry, and even more so in the crisis. I do not like to remember my past, but I come from the former GDR, East Germany. The economic and ecological collapse of the GDR was attributable to the fact that for decades, we neglected to invest in up-to-date technology. I think that every industry and every industrial enterprise, for its existence, needs to invest in up-to-date technology, because otherwise it will become less competitive, and this naturally means also reducing emissions of pollutants. Today, we have the opportunity to bring in a law which will improve this situation from which we are starting. The second part of the directive – and here we have some of the gritted teeth that I mentioned – deals with large combustion plants. We are talking once more – as we did before with the last directive – about renewing exceptions up to 2020, and in some cases 2023, for large combustion plants which do not have to achieve the environmental obligations and, in particular, the limits on air pollutants. Here I call on the Council, but also perhaps all of us here, to consider very carefully how sensible it really is that we regularly bring in ambitious environmental targets, and we discuss them and welcome them here, but always, whenever it comes to implementing them and transforming them into concrete legislation, then a tragedy begins in Europe. Then it suddenly becomes clear to the Member States how much it costs, which bills we have to pay, and then, as a rule, the ones who have done this in advance are punished. There are a number of Member States which now already meet the obligations, and which will, in the end, be left out in the cold. I will say it here once again: whether we are talking about industrial plants or large combustion plants – which essentially means coal power stations – we are not dealing with science fiction. We are not talking about things which are not available; on the contrary, this is up-to-date technology. Best available techniques – what is available on the market given competitive and cost factors – can be incorporated into these plants, and today, against this background, we are completing a legislative package which I think is better than what is currently in force, and therefore I would encourage us all to approve it. I would also like to thank my fellow Members, who, while sometimes pulling no punches, have worked with me on this for the last two years, for their support, their legwork and, above all, for the fact that almost all of the main groups have subscribed to this compromise. Holger Krahmer,

 Mr President, three relevant things have happened while we have been debating: first, it is clear that Europe will be the football world champions. A good omen, I think. Who exactly it will be, we will see. I do not want to express any preference now. The second is that Germany is receiving compliments from the United Kingdom. Chris Davies, many thanks! That also does not happen every day. It is certainly worth noting. Thirdly, all is still well with the world; even the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance finds football more important than environmental protection. Regrettably, our fellow Member, Mr Eickhout, has left us again. However, congratulations to our Dutch friends, of course. I wanted to talk about two aspects of the debate to which I have just been able to listen. The first is that I understand all the worries and woes of my Eastern European friends only too well. As an East German, I am also half-Eastern European. I understand that Eastern Europe cannot immediately catch up on every step of environmental policy that has been taken in the Western European countries in recent decades. In order to get high-level environmental protection, one has to be able to afford it. Yes, that is true. However, I think that – even if we allow for this – it is worth approving this compromise, because it will do justice to the different starting positions that many Member States find themselves in. Secondly, the argument that the use of best available techniques will endanger competitiveness, in particular, with respect to China, is not only false; it is also dangerous. We must deal with the fact that industrial processes in Asia are always cheaper than here. However, we will only meet this challenge if we implement best available techniques in as many branches of industry as possible. Those which do not do this will become less competitive. No one, including this law, is demanding that an industrial enterprise should be switched off tomorrow. No one is demanding a leap from 0 to 100 in order to achieve a particular pollutant limit within a week. We have enough transitional periods, but to say that we must go without for competitive reasons is false. I also think that with this directive, we have set a course not only for environmental policy, but also for industrial policy, a course for which it is worth working in the next few years. Holger Krahmer  (ALDE
).

 Mr President, I think that we are making good legislation today. It is good and right that we are taking steps to avoid illegal timber being placed on the European internal market. However, what holds for all environmental laws also holds for this law: we cannot just put in what we want, but we must also always check whether what we put in and prescribe is feasible in the end. Therefore, I think it is right that we have, in the end, come to the compromise that due diligence only needs to take effect at the first instance of placing on the market, and also that only then can the import ban be issued. It would be much too bureaucratic to provide documentary evidence of origin throughout the entire supply chain within Europe. This was on the table at the beginning of the debate. I think that it is not realistic here to constantly keep new accounts and provide documentary evidence, from the timber yard and the sawmill right up to the furniture factory. This produces bureaucracy which, in case of doubt, produces more paper and thereby may even accelerate legal felling. Therefore, we must be moderate in this area and ensure balance. We have succeeded in doing this. I am not in favour of the approach that Mrs Hassi has just spoken of, namely that we can bring in a zero-risk policy. This is not only applicable to felling, and it will not work. Zero risk is not feasible. It produces bureaucracy and, above all, produces new risks. We must ensure that the laws remain balanced and feasible. In this sense, this compromise is a good one. I am pleased that we will be able to approve it with a large majority tomorrow.

 Providing consumers with information about food is undoubtedly important. However, the debate in Brussels has become a lobbying battle between large companies from the food industry and consumer protection organisations. There was no place in this debate for the reality of everyday life for consumers. The representatives of the German Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament are in favour of a minimum of labelling. Consumers should be able to make their purchasing decisions on the basis of transparent, legible information. Colour coded labelling influences consumers and does not form the basis for transparent information. The so-called guideline daily amounts (GDAs) also have their weak points. Instead of having neutral information about the amounts of nutrients per 100 grams or millilitres printed legibly on packaging, Parliament discussed whether the daily requirements of a 40-year-old woman could be used as the point of reference or whether the colour coding of nutrients was a useful decision-making tool. The proposed, far-reaching, mandatory requirements for the origin labelling of ingredients cannot be implemented in practice. We also rejected the idea of special national provisions, because the labelling system should, as far as possible, be standardised. For these reasons, we were not able to vote in favour of the proposed report. Holger Krahmer  (ALDE

 Commissioner, I have two specific questions for you. Firstly, in your paper, I see no analysis of the European negotiating position at international level. Have we really taken note of the fact that Europe’s influence in climate policy has diminished? Have we taken note of the fact that the political and economic weight in this world has shifted sharply in the direction of Asia? Is it possible that we completely overestimated our influence here? Secondly, your paper is remarkable. In the twelve pages that you have completely filled, there is not a single reference to the IPCC Panel. Is that a subtle attempt to distance yourself from this body? I would like to remind you that this panel formed the basis for all the political decisions relating to the directives that we have drawn up here in recent years. Is it not time to call for a broad scientific approach that gives us real scientific statements, not political ones?

According to the resolution of the European Parliament on the draft general budget for the financial year 2010, adopted on 17 December 2009, a vote was taken today on the amending budget for the European Parliament, following the revised calculations made by the Parliamentary administration. The FDP in the European Parliament abstained, because there was a paragraph in the package of amendments concerned that we could not reconcile with our convictions. The FDP had already expressed its opposition to an increase in the secretarial allowance to EUR 1 500 during the discussions in committee. It is out of the secretarial allowance that MEPs’ assistants are paid. The FDP considers that the argument that more money is needed due to the additional work that MEPs have to do with the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is unsound, as there is nothing in past experience to support this. Certainly, due to the Treaty of Lisbon, which has just come into force, Parliament will overall need extra capacity for legislative work, but with the introduction of the Assistants’ Statute from the beginning of the current parliamentary term, there is still no proof that MEPs actually need more assistants. For this reason, there are grounds for concern that further demands and supplementary increases, or an extension of office capacity, will follow. For this reason, the FDP in the European Parliament abstained. Holger Krahmer,

Madam President, it seems to me to be a little symptomatic for the EU in general, but also for Parliament in particular, that we should have knee-jerk debates about situations in certain countries that are in no way new. Unfortunately, it is very often the case that overnight events lead to us here in Parliament spouting out waves of political demands that I sometimes find somewhat dubious. I think that it does not give a good impression of us if a failed bomb attack on an aeroplane only leads us to a general debate on Yemen. We should be clear that it would be fitting to consider a strategy for how to deal with this situation. I also think that the situation in Yemen requires a precise analysis, specifically with regard to the fact that this is a failed state in which the government does not have control of large parts of the country We should analyse for ourselves what risks this involves for Europe. The risks appear to be that terrorists are trained there and the risks also appear to relate to the Yemeni coast, where piracy is clearly taking place. We – and perhaps Baroness Ashton, also – must consider what we can do to counter these risks. As I see it, the main question might well be: how can we bolster the Yemeni Government so that it can regain control of the country and thus contain these risks? All the other debates about the long-term building-up of the country also need to be held, of course, but I do not think that there is really any point in us putting forward a catalogue of demands clean across all political areas – from the freedom of the media to women’s rights – here in Parliament at this point, or that we will be taken seriously if we do so. Doing so will not achieve our goal in Yemen, so instead, we should concentrate on what tangible assistance we can provide in the current situation in order to solve an urgent problem.

 The German Free Democratic Party members of the European Parliament have abstained from voting on the Copenhagen resolution for the following reasons. The resolution contains statements about financing for climate protection measures in third countries without defining the specific criteria or purpose of the financing. We cannot justify this to taxpayers. In addition, we believe that blanket criticism of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) is wrong. The ICAO is the organisation which deals with aviation matters at an international level. Both the criticism and the statement about the alleged failure of ICAO negotiations are incorrect and inappropriate. The call for specific arrangements for a CO2
 trading system for the aviation industry goes against current EU legislation and overburdens the EU’s negotiating position in an international climate agreement with unrealistic demands. Holger Krahmer  (ALDE

Madam President, European climate policy should leave its reverie behind and take note of the international realities. First of all, Kyoto was a failure. It was very symbolic, but delivered no reductions in emissions. Secondly, on the eve of Copenhagen, it is clear that important states in the world are not prepared to accept binding targets for reductions. Thirdly, politics must take note of a debate emerging in science. The same scientists who signed the conclusions of the IPCC panel two years ago today talk of natural influences on the climate – something that the IPCC categorically ruled out two years ago. We should already know how sure we can be of what influences climate change when we make political decisions. I therefore call for a change of strategy. First of all, we need to adapt to inevitable changes to the climate, while we should also move beyond all the ideological discussions about CO2
 and look for international allies in order to accelerate research into new energy sources and clean technologies. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Madam President, it has been an honour and a privilege to be the rapporteur for the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) on the proposal for a directive on the accessibility of public sector bodies’ websites and websites operated by entities performing public tasks. This piece of legislation is long overdue and eagerly awaited both by citizens with disabilities and by our increasingly ageing population who find themselves more and more isolated and excluded from a world where information is accessible primarily online. In Europe this amounts to 80 million citizens with disabilities and another 87 million aged over 65. 167 million European citizens is too great a number to be ignored. Throughout my involvement with this dossier, I have seen what these people face when trying to navigate their way online. I was particularly struck by the difficulties faced by the blind, which was exemplified at an IMCO Committee hearing held in April 2013. Ioanna-Maria Gertsou, a blind woman who owns a school for guide dogs in Athens, came to Parliament for a web accessibility demonstration and got visibly lost on traditional websites. However, despite the fact that assistive technology already exists, Europe has been lagging far behind. We are the European Union. We should be setting the agenda, not struggling, or even failing, to keep up. Less than one third of Europe’s public sector and government websites, and even less than 10[nbsp ]% of Europe’s websites in general, are fully accessible. Making websites and their content useable for all should already have become a priority at EU level. The Commission’s initial proposal was limited in scope and not fully in line with the goals promised in the digital agenda for Europe. The IMCO Committee was more ambitious, and made a number of significant amendments to the text. The directive now covers all EU public sector bodies’ websites and websites providing public services, as now laid down in a new annex. It now covers mobile web and apps and includes a robust enforcement mechanism. The specifications for accessibility are technology-neutral and based on the international Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0, also known as WCAG. This directive is essentially a forerunner in the planned European Accessibility Act, which I know is also being eagerly awaited by our citizens. The scope, along with the enforcement mechanisms and monitoring systems, reflects the binding obligations set out in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the commitments made in the digital agenda for Europe. In addition, with the implementation of a harmonised European approach, making these websites accessible also has the potential to be a highly profitable business. The financial benefits are currently estimated at EUR[nbsp ]2 billion.  Members of this Parliament will vote tomorrow to deliver on their commitment to uphold the rights of disabled people. However, this is only the first step in the legislative process. We regret the lack of engagement by previous presidencies on this dossier. However, I thank Commissioner Kroes for having openly supported our legislative work using one of the most modern ways of rapid communication, Twitter. I thank her for that.  I am sure the Greek Presidency will follow up the good work on this file and it is completely feasible that the Italian Presidency will be able to bring this dossier into legislation. In our increasingly digital world, accessibility is very much a human right. All people are entitled to use the internet in order to exercise their fundamental rights. I hope tomorrow’s vote will cement Parliament’s commitment on this.  Lastly, I must emphasise that cooperation with my shadow rapporteurs last year was both consensual and produced a directive that should be acceptable to all and I thank them for that.

 Madam President, my thanks go to all colleagues, especially to Adam Kósa, the Intergroup Chair, who really contributed to this piece of legislation.  This is both an ethical issue and a commercial issue. It is about basic and fundamental human rights and it is about jobs. Yes, the report is ambitious and I will admit that it has been made more ambitious by Parliament, but it is a feasible report, this is a feasible issue.  The ball, as many colleagues and Commissioner Kroes have said, lies now in the court of the Council of the Member States. Yes, and with our vote tomorrow we will take an important step. And I am very confident that the next Parliament will take up its work where we end it now and will bring this to an end together with the forthcoming Italian Presidency. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

Mr President, as Co-Chair of the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) of the European Parliament and the Sobranie, let me congratulate you on yet another positive report. For the first time our colleagues from Skopje are here in Strasbourg to attend the 11th JPC at the moment and to follow this debate on Richard Howitt’s report. I would like to welcome especially my Co-Chair Kenan Hasipi. Last December, only two months after the positive Commission progress report, we experienced a major political crisis in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The opposition was kicked out of the plenary, journalists had been expelled previously, and voting took place without their presence. The whole political process was disrupted due to parliamentary blocking for many weeks. We have been following the developments very anxiously in Brussels and in Europe, and the EU has made tremendous efforts to act as a mediator between the parties. On 1 March 2013, an agreement was achieved thanks to an EU mission by Parliament’s former President Jerzy Buzek, Richard Howitt and Commissioner Füle. Congratulations, especially to the Commissioner for his commitment and his tough tone, which led to the 1 March agreement and calmed the situation. Our rapporteur Mr Howitt postponed the vote on his report as he feared that the vote could turn out negatively for the country. I respect his decision. Moreover, the JPC was also postponed. This was a sign of mutual respect. Parliament, I think, and our colleagues were extremely tolerant in allowing us to use this time-out instrument, but this measure can only be an exceptional approach. Let us continue to work hard, keeping the country on the European track. It is in our common interest. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

Mr President, when I entered politics one of my biggest idols, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, defined as one of the cornerstones of the European Union respect for the right to sovereignty, especially for the small Members of the European Union. The Eurogroup did not respect this small Member State, Cyprus, and its sovereignty, nor the Cypriot economy and society. The Eurogroup should stop putting in danger this fundamental value of the European Union, namely respecting the sovereignty of the small. That is why we should respect Cyprus in order to safeguard the European Union. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,

Madam President, President Caldeira, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the Court of Auditors for the important work that it undertakes on behalf of the European taxpayer every year. Mr Caldeira, you and the Court are and will remain a valued partner for us as Members of this House, the representatives of the European Union’s discharge authority. A year ago, as we sat here discussing the Court of Auditor’s previous report, I said that the Court’s report presented a positive picture, but there were some grey areas. The picture is becoming steadily brighter, but there are still some spots of grey. The sum of EUR 130 billion was available in 2011, and of this figure, EUR 5 billion should never have been disbursed. That is an error rate of 3.9 %. Compared with previous years, that is an improvement, but it is still much too high. I am at a loss to explain how these figures can possibly be justified in view of the budget constraints throughout the EU. However, there are some positive aspects. The instruments that Parliament, in its discharge reports, has given the Commission, especially in recent years, are being utilised at last and are working. This is happening to an exemplary – extremely exemplary – degree in the field of employment and social affairs. The Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion and its Commissioner, Mr Andor, have since 2008 applied a consistent policy of suspending and discontinuing payments if current projects simply do not work. As a result, the error rate here has fallen to 2.2 %. I would like to congratulate you, Commissioner Andor, on these consistent efforts, which show how it should be done. I would like to extend these congratulations to Commissioner Šemeta as well, for he is of course involving in overseeing these efforts.  I myself, as one of the previous rapporteurs for the budget discharge, together with my parliamentary colleagues, reminded the House that funds that have been disbursed without justification must be recovered. This measure is also being used to an increasing extent, and I would like to congratulate you on this as well. My perusal of the Annual Summaries, which we Members are now permitted to inspect, has convinced me that this instrument is working. As regards efficiency, there are still some problems here. The evaluation report has rightly been criticised by the Court of Auditors for being too vague. I would like to offer Mr Geier, who is reporting on the budget discharge this year, the support of the House as a whole in order to ensure that the procedure is improved. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

The EU single market is one of the most worthwhile European achievements. Between 1992 and 2008 it created about 2.77 million jobs and increased GDP by 2.13 %. These figures clearly show the potential of a smoothly functioning EU single market. The 20 years of its existence that we are now celebrating is an anniversary of which all Europeans should be proud. However, past achievements should motivate us to remove any remaining obstructions. As the rapporteur has clearly shown us, some things in the single market are still in dire straits. The Commission has also produced a working paper containing the 20 main concerns of citizens that they consider impede the everyday smooth operation of the single market to no purpose. The problem areas identified must be solved using an integrated approach. Another problem concerns the issue of how we can ensure that every European citizen can benefit from the achievements of the EU single market, no matter where they live. The trade balance deficits within the EU may in the long term create difficulties for the Union. European policy must steer us in the opposite direction. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, 20 years of the internal market are indeed a reason to look back on this track record. It is exactly as Ms Gebhardt said: the internal market has brought the European idea, the European philosophy, to the fore, there is no doubt about that. It goes without saying that, externally, the internal market is seen as a success. However, if we look inside the European internal market, we will discover that some have benefited more than others. Germany has a very healthy balance sheet. The German Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau
 has calculated that, in Germany alone, the internal market effect represents an annual amount of EUR 30 billion in relation to the euro. On the other hand, we see that productivity in the peripheral countries is declining. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let us take the Single Market Act II and these 20 years of the internal market as an opportunity to consider how we can get to grips with this imbalanced development, these current account differences, within the European Union. If we do not succeed in this, unless everyone sees an advantage in the internal market, the internal market will lose credibility and legitimacy in the long term. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Busuttil, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I warmly welcome this own-initiative report by Mr Busuttil. It is further proof of how important it is that Parliament sets the agenda on important matters. Thank you, then, Mr Busuttil, for this very balanced report. The subject is more relevant than ever, for alongside the things that we imagined would be the engine of European integration when the internal market was established 20 years ago, we can also see that there are imbalances in the internal market. The imbalances where the balance of payments is concerned are also one reason why the euro area has run into such difficulty. The single European market as a whole is also at risk of losing its legitimacy, its role as an engine, if we do not devote particular attention to what has happened now, on its 20th anniversary. The internal market scoreboard could be a useful instrument for indicating where things are going wrong at a very early stage, as a kind of early warning system. It would be a significant first step towards economic policy that is at last coordinated. That is why I also welcome the European Commission’s plans to publish this internal market scoreboard annually. We need to square the circle here. On the one hand, the economies that have nursed their labour markets back to health by making appropriate reforms – those that are more prompt with transposition – must naturally not be punished for their achievement. On the other hand, however, even the best in class will be affected if its neighbour gets into excessive debt in order to buy its products. As an initial step, it would be sufficient for the EU’s internal market regulations to finally be transposed in a more timely manner. In reality, what we need here are realistic transposition and implementation targets – as this report also underlines. Then there is the varying speed of transposition. In May 2011, the Member States took, on average, 5.5 months longer than the transposition deadline to transpose EU directives; today, the figure is nearly 8 months. This time period needs to be reduced, for the sake of equal opportunities alone. In short, the Member States must meet their obligations better and must demonstrate greater commitment to and make greater efforts towards implementing European legal provisions. At the same time, it can be seen that 20 years of the internal market have resulted in a drastic increase in the differences between the competitiveness of the national economies in the European Union. There has been a radical shift in the balance of payments between the strongest economies and what are now the weakest economies, in favour of the strongest. The low interest rate policy conducted since the launch of the euro has reinforced this trend, acting rather like an accelerant. We Europeans have trusted in the healing powers of the internal market, while ignoring the fact that competitiveness has not necessarily improved across the board as a result of this internal market policy. Commissioner Barnier, we need to take action to counter this. The scoreboard provides one way of doing so. The 20th anniversary of the single European market also gives us an opportunity to look into drawing up a plan for more equal balances of payments at national level, and possibly even at regional level in a further step, alongside the completion of the internal market. Only then will we achieve overall economic equilibrium in even the marginal regions of Europe, and particularly in the southern parts of the euro area. Europe’s sovereign debt crisis shows that the surpluses in the north and the deficits in the south will have a blocking effect on each other unless we can resolve this problem in the medium term. I would therefore urge Europe’s economists to give us new theories that reconcile the internal market with reciprocal balance. The internal market scoreboard could provide a decisive starting point for this, but it must not be allowed to become a paper tiger. Let us use the internal market week as an opportunity to think about these things. Let us also use the 20th anniversary of the internal market as a chance to make all of us in Europe – not just the strong countries of the north, but everyone as a whole – fit for the future.

 Mr President, Mr Rehn, I wish to congratulate Werner Hoyer on his brilliant debut in his new job. Mr Hoyer, this is not an easy time for the European Union. This economic and financial crisis calls for adroit economic and political expertise. You have both in good measure. The European Parliament is happy to see you at the helm of the European Investment Bank (EIB). I would also like to thank the outgoing Vice-President, Matthias Kollatz-Ahnen, however, as he has also achieved a great deal. As an example, I would mention the establishment of the European Energy Efficiency Fund. Mr Hoyer, the role of your bank is decisive in overcoming the crisis. We are all aware of this. You have also proven this. I would cite the example of how you overcame the crisis in the automotive sector. Thanks to the scrapping premiums, which were mainly paid for by your bank, we managed to do something good for the environment, while also providing a stimulus for the economy. We are now facing new challenges. We have heard several references to the issue of project bonds. We are constantly talking about the innovative financial instruments we expect from your bank. We need clear rules, however; we expect your bank to issue clear rules for all Member States. We wish you every success in your efforts to obtain a triple-A rating for the bank. As stated in our report, for which I would like to thank Ms Ivanova, we would like to see the EU becoming a shareholder. This may perhaps be a step in the right direction. I wish you all the best for the work ahead. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, Jürgen Creutzmann, Britta Reimers and Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 The representatives of the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament will vote in favour of the Hübner report on amending COM(2011)0482
 only on condition that, when raising the applicable cofinancing rates by ten percentage points, there is an exception for those Member States explicitly affected. This exception must not be able to act as a precedent in any way and should be revoked in respect of the Member States in question once the severe financial and economic crisis and its liquidity squeezes have been overcome.

 Mr President, this year’s report from the European Court of Auditors presents a positive picture, but there are some problems. The good news is that many areas are satisfactory, in particular, the major area of agricultural spending, as Mr Fjellner has already said. The bad news is that the predicted deterioration in the area of cohesion has taken place and 49%, in other words half, of all the payments audited in the area of cohesion had errors. That is a great number. A total of 90% of all the payments with problems are made in the Member States. In our committee, we were critical at the time of the fact that the Council was not present. I am looking at the Council bench and the Council is once again not represented. The Council really should be here for this debate. Two-thirds of all the errors occur in three Member States. I would like to congratulate you, Mr Šemeta, for having the courage to name these Member States in the committee. You have said that they are Italy, Spain and the Czech Republic. You have our support for this new policy of naming and shaming. You have followed up another call by the European Parliament and I would like to thank you for this too. You have interrupted payments amounting to a total of EUR 2.4 billion. This is the only way that we will be able to introduce discipline in the Member States. After the process of damage limitation, we must identify the errors and name the culprits. The key words here are effectiveness, efficiency and economic viability. There is also a new chapter where you, Mr Caldeira, make it clear in your report that the Commission often does not achieve the goals which it sets itself. Mr Šemeta, we will be interested to see the evaluation report from the Commission, which is expected in December. However, we would also like to say that in times of financial crisis, we must use taxpayers’ money in a way which is even more effective, more precise, more carefully targeted and more efficient. That is our job. I would like to thank the Court of Auditors for helping us to do this. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,

 Mr President, Mr Korolec, Commissioner, energy is the lifeblood of our national economies. We therefore want price developments to remain transparent for consumers. I regret to say that there are still too many deals and agreements being made behind the scenes. In the end, it is consumers who foot the bill, in the form of severely inflated energy prices. This is not just annoying; it also has real effects on growth and employment. We want a better internal energy market. Europe needs transparent energy markets that are protected from abuse. This is precisely what the regulation on energy market integrity and transparency aims to achieve, and that is what we are talking about here. I would specifically like to thank the Commission and Commissioner Oettinger for their positive cooperation. This is exactly how European legislation needs to be made – in the way that we have brought it about here. I am particularly pleased that the European dimension of energy trading is stressed in the text that will be put to the vote tomorrow. One of the main issues was whether or not we need a special law on this. Do we need a sector-specific approach or could energy trading simply be subject to the general regulations for financial markets? When it comes down to it, however, energy markets have different rules; energy traders are not banks. I am particularly grateful to Commissioner Oettinger for having done all he could to ensure this matter was put to the House quickly. That was essential for a sector-specific approach. The negotiations with the Hungarian Presidency were tough and we succeeded in getting a result at first reading. Parliament – my fellow Members – introduced seven new points into the Commission’s text. The first important point was the introduction of an approval system for a register of electricity traders. This regulation now sets out the requirement of a national register of electricity traders. It also provides for the establishment of a European register which is to be organised by the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER). The Commission is to evaluate the registration system in the future and propose further instruments to improve it. Secondly: there is a link-up with CO2
 emissions trading. The regulation gives the ACER access to existing databases relating to trading in emissions certificates. Although Member States are not required to keep such records and the ACER is not being given the rights of control, the Commission is asked to present a legislative proposal to deal with the deficits in the CO2
 market system. Thirdly: there will be penalties, and we have worked to harmonise these penalties and to achieve minimum standards. Following pressure from Parliament, the damage caused to consumers is to be given particular consideration when deciding on sanctions. In addition, the Commission has been given the opportunity to table a proposal on minimum standards for penalties. Fourthly: the role of the agency and the national regulatory authorities have been strengthened. Parliament wanted to strengthen the ACER, which is why we have pushed for the director of the ACER to be more independent. The director of the ACER is to consult national provisions, but should not be bound by these. A fifth important point: there is a revision clause in respect of staffing and resources. Parliament would like the ACER to be provided with the appropriate financial and human resources to be able to perform its new tasks. This is emphasised in a new recital. The ACER needs to be better equipped if it is to be guaranteed a strong presence in important organised market places. Sixthly: naturally, insider trading is banned, but we have agreed one exemption when it comes to insider trading. This exemption may be applied only in the event of a direct physical loss resulting from unplanned outages. This exemption is allowed in order to provide security in the system, since otherwise players in the market would be unable to discharge their contractual obligations or to act by agreement with the competent transmission system operator. Mr President, I should like to continue speaking now rather than saving two minutes until the end. The seventh and final point concerns delegated acts versus implementing acts. This was a tough one in the negotiations – it was a central issue, and, in part, we were breaking new ground as a result of the Treaty of Lisbon. Parliament has conceded some of its demands concerning delegated acts in favour of a stronger role for the ACER and in favour of more detailed directions in the section on penalties. This was a trade-off that we made. One important element of the final package is that all the aspects relating to data collection will be laid down by an implementing act rather than a delegated act. This also applies to the setting of a de minimis
 threshold for the definition of reporting obligations. Nonetheless, the Commission will reserve the right to make a proposal ahead of any legislative proposal on such a threshold. This is also enshrined in the text as part of a declaration. Overall, we have achieved a good result. I am very satisfied. The Hungarian Presidency was a tough negotiating partner, but with the assistance of my colleagues from all the other groups, we succeeded in achieving a genuinely satisfactory result. I would like to express my warmest thanks to everyone, especially to my Hungarian colleague, Mr Gyürk, because he naturally had a particularly direct line to the Presidency; however, everyone was involved in the trialogue negotiations. We achieved near unanimity in committee. I would be pleased if we could do the same in plenary. Thank you for your cooperation. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, it only remains for me to thank everyone and, in particular, once again to wish Mr Pototschnig, the director of the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER), who is with us today, every success with his work. He only assumed responsibility for this area in March and it is already becoming clear that the resources available to him may be inadequate, as the two previous speakers and many other of my fellow Members have said. Therefore, we will soon be in the position where we have to provide the ACER with additional resources. I would like to give Mr Pototschnig and his team my best wishes for their work on an issue which is important to consumers. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control
. – (DE)
 Mr President, from the perspective of budgetary control, the European Union is often accused of taking a sloppy approach to spending. Who is responsible for this? In 80% of cases it is actually the Member States, which have joint responsibility for the expenditure. It is often the Member States. We all remember how the British Prime Minister, Mr Cameron, said to the President of the European Parliament that instead of asking for more money, we must first of all make sure that the money is spent more effectively. Which country was the biggest offender in 2010? The United Kingdom. All the British programmes were stopped in 2010. Why is that? It is because the rules are too complicated. Therefore, I would like to ask my fellow Members and, in particular, the Commission to campaign together with the Member States for simpler rules, for more effective and simpler monitoring systems and for the introduction of new components. For example, if research policy were to include an award or a prize for a particularly successful, innovative project, this would make it much easier to monitor. The same applies to cohesion policy, where we could create a leverage effect by providing project-related loans. There are a lot of opportunities open to us for innovation. We should take a brave step forward. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,  
rapporteur. 
– (DE)
 Mr President, Commissioner Šemeta, ladies and gentlemen, the process we are dealing with today – that is, the discharge for the expenditure of the European Commission – is an essential process. In recent years it may perhaps have been taken rather lightly, but in fact granting discharge for all the expenditure of the European Commission for the year 2009 is an essential task of the European Parliament. We are aware that 80% of these funds were spent as a shared responsibility between the Commission and the Member States. Nonetheless, the overall responsibility for this process lies with the Commission. I would therefore like to address you quite directly, Commissioner Šemeta. Firstly, I would like to thank you. I would like to make that clear at the outset. I would like to include my fellow Members who have worked very well together and who have supported Parliament’s position very strongly. However, the discussions that we had were very intense, Commissioner Šemeta. You have only shared responsibility for 2009, yet you have thrown yourself into it. In some cases we have had heated arguments and have gone into very great detail. I should like to emphasise, however, that you have put the discharge at the top of the agenda in the College, in the Commission. The President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, spent over an hour negotiating with us on the details. You yourself played a major part in changing the attitude of the Commission to the discharge and the attitude of the Commission officials to this whole process. I am grateful to you for having said quite openly that the pressure that Parliament has exerted this year will in the final event help you to improve transparency. You now have in your hands a means of exerting pressure not just on the Member States, but also on your own administration – which has until now been a little lax in dealing with these matters. However, I also think that we need to utilise this momentum that we have created together, Commissioner Šemeta – and I would ask you to pass on our thanks to President Barroso – and this dynamism for the other discharge reports. For there is one thing that must be clear to us, which is that for the 16th time in succession the European Court of Auditors has not given a positive statement. That is not insignificant, as it means that you have not actually met the criteria for 16 years running. Nonetheless, we have set key criteria that I would like to mention briefly and that you have met. I am pleased to have Mr Fjellner, the forthcoming rapporteur on the budget discharge, at my side. I hope that he will continue the work with the same impetus. The Commission has begun – and this is crucial, because we are after all talking about 80% shared responsibility here – quite clearly to state erroneous expenditure in the accounts of the European Union for 2009. It has listed these items openly. Building on this new transparency, therefore, we have set five key requirements. The first is a long-running issue – an old favourite – that Parliament has been dealing with for a long time, and that is the national management declarations. As a representative of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I am also pleased to be able to point out that this has been brought about by Dutch members of the ALDE Group in particular. We are talking here about the confirmation by the finance ministers that EU funds have been spent correctly in their home countries. We do not yet have these national management declarations, but we want to get them. In this respect I will be building on my cooperation with Mr Fjellner in the future. Commissioner, you have promised that we will look into whether stricter conditions can be introduced by the next financial perspective in 2014. It is important that you have drawn up guidelines – we are grateful to you for that – that you have shown which countries have actually provided national management declarations – it is not many: basically, only the Netherlands meets the requirements in full – and that you have instructed the Directorates General to show for the first time in the activity report for 2010 what components will be present in a future national administrative declaration, even if this will only take place at working level. The second key requirement is that the commissioners must also accept greater responsibility. You have proposed that the Directorates General be obliged to inform their commissioners of irregularities and I want to thank you for that. The third, and essential, requirement was for the instrument of stopping or suspending payments to be used to a greater extent. You have listed clear criteria for when you will do that. You have shown us clearly how you have already done this in the last couple of years. Thank you for such openness and transparency, which helps us exert pressure on the Member States. Thank you also for the guidelines that will help the Member States. In addition, you promised that when evaluating the performance audit you will set clear standards; this is an obligation that you have anyway under the Treaty of Lisbon. Thank you also for involving us to a considerable extent in the performance audit process. You have also promised to make simplifications, because often the material is so complex that people hide behind the rules and indulge in abuse. Thank you also for having set very specific requirements for the next financial perspective. I advocate that we continue along this path. I believe that Parliament can make a great contribution towards raising the Commission to another level. I wish Mr Fjellner all the best and would like to extend my warm thanks to my parliamentary staff, particularly Bent Adamsen and Dominykas Mordas. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the Commissioner once again on behalf of Parliament for his excellent cooperation. You have now raised certain points once again. We should take these as a starting point for our continued work. However, I would also ask you to pass on our thanks to your colleagues, because we had a very intense exchange with many individuals – I should particularly like to mention Mr Cioloş and Mr Hahn – and both were very cooperative. Please would you pass this message on to them once again. I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Becsey, for his clear words. He spoke very clearly; we may not like what he said, but at least he was clear in what he said and we are grateful for that. I consider it only right that you are here. I do not think there is particular cause to mention it. Nonetheless, it is good that you are here. I have saved my final thanks for the President of the European Court of Auditors, Mr Caldeira, with whom Parliament always enjoys genuinely open and positive cooperation. We very much appreciate that. Our work would not be possible without your background work. Our discharge is based mainly on your contributions. We would like to see you playing a greater role in the future assessment of the performance audit, Mr Caldeira. The future of the European Union depends not just on the funds being spent legally and correctly, but also and above all on their being spent usefully; in other words, effectively and efficiently. That will form part of the performance audit under Article 318 of the Treaty of Lisbon. As Parliament, we would like to see an annual debate on the performance audit of the Commission and we would like you to be invited here to debate it with us as a representative of the European Court of Auditors. My sincere thanks to my fellow Members and to everyone involved. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 In the vote on the Lange report, I am abstaining on paragraph 31 because of the ambiguous wording, which refers to Eurobonds as well as project bonds. However, taking it as a whole, I am voting for the report, as I have nothing against project bonds in themselves. Project bonds serve as finance for extensive innovation, infrastructure and reindustrialisation projects. This is not a question of instruments for the communitarisation of debts, as would be the case with Eurobonds. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,

 Madam President, Mr Tajani, thank you very much for your strong commitment to a European industrial policy. I have been looking over at Mr Lange and thinking that there has been a lot of commotion about an own-initiative report. A total of 500 amendments and 50 compromise proposals have been tabled with the aim of making industry in Europe a world leader again. We can only achieve this by means of an integrated and sustainable policy. We need to ensure that research and innovation are at the heart of our strategy. Therefore, we must put in place a regulatory framework which will support innovation and sustainability at the same time. The major challenge faced by your report was finding the right balance between environmental goals and economic competitiveness, while also avoiding protectionism. I am looking at Mrs Grossetête, because the French always want to introduce a touch of protectionism. At the same time, we need to support small and medium-sized businesses, promote the European patent and prevent knowledge theft, particularly with regard to China. We also want to see fewer regulations being imposed on European industry as a result of red tape. This means that we need to focus on reducing the amount of bureaucracy. Mr Lange, you have succeeded in covering this quite well in your report, so I would like to thank you for your hard work. However, this report can only represent the first step. We need to link the concept of industrial policy, which people in many Member States find it hard to discuss and which the Germans, in particular, have always been unwilling to talk about, with the competitiveness pact, which will be presented to the Heads of State or Government over the next few weeks in order to safeguard the euro area. If we do not manage to do this, then we will have a problem. We must coordinate areas such as cohesion, industry, trade, research and innovation, but also social issues, the climate and the environment. The current example of E10 in Germany demonstrates that this is not happening. This is all about adding bioethanol to petrol. The EU has put in place an important strategy, set itself the 20-20-20 targets, and we have said to the Member States that they must implement it. The Member States, and Germany in particular, were part of the decision-making process and supported everything that was decided. However, when it came to putting it into practice at home, they suddenly cut back the tax incentives and the consumers stopped cooperating. If we fail to convince consumers, as was the case in Germany with E10, then we will not be able to implement climate policy in combination with industrial policy. We need to have the consumers on our side. That is the central message. For this reason, I wish the industrial policy project every success. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

There is no understandable reason for excluding the entire sector from the regulations. We have a wide range of legislation governing waste streams. Therefore, it is not clear why a complete industry, which is expected to produce significant waste streams, is being exempted. For this reason, some of the FDP Members of the European Parliament have abstained from voting on the report. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Mr President, the Communication and the report are very good, and I would therefore like to express my thanks to Commissioner Dalli and Mrs Matias. Alzheimer’s is a plague of our times, and our biggest problem is that we simply know too little about Alzheimer’s. That is why we need research, research, and more research. We need to pool our strengths and I therefore welcome the Commission’s initiative to create an innovation partnership on the subject of healthy ageing; Alzheimer’s fits in with this perfectly. Many years ago, the US Government designated the fight against cancer as a lighthouse project. They have not conquered cancer, but a great many medicines and a great many therapies have emerged as a result. That is the kind of thing that we need here, and I therefore welcome the fact that we are to concentrate on Alzheimer’s. We need to know how to take preventive action. What can we do in the future to combat Alzheimer’s? That is why we cannot continue to adopt the watering can principle in European research policy. We need to concentrate on specific areas. Alzheimer’s could be one of the major themes that we get to grips with. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

Mr President, Commissioner, energy efficiency has always been the biggest resource proffered to us. It is the sleeping giant with the hidden but enormous potential for the European energy economy. All that is true, and the nice thing about it is that it is so free of ideology. Above all, the approach to this issue can be technology-neutral. All that interests us here, and it is a point that is clearly also a little divisive, is the issue of whether or not the targets are binding. I have to say, Commissioner, in this regard, that I like your two-stage approach whereby you start by trusting in the Member States and by building voluntary agreements and then, if we observe that we will not achieve the targets by 2020, we perhaps get the thumbscrews out. That is the right approach to take. This report, by and large, moves in the right direction – there is little to criticise. There is one issue that I would like to raise, however, which is the role of the regional funds. You mentioned this issue, Commissioner. In the regional funds, together with the Cohesion Funds, we have an immense instrument in our hands in the European Union that we are not making use of. In this field of energy efficiency, we could finally create European added value which we could put to use in an innovative way to get to grips with energy efficiency in a way that has not happened in the past. As the current rapporteur for budgetary discharge for the Commission, I can see just how badly we have wasted money in the sphere of cohesion. Let us put a stop to that waste! I endorse the focus that you are giving to this issue, Commissioner Oettinger, and the fact that you are seeking to bring about greater use of these funds, including for this energy efficiency instrument. That is the only way that we will ensure that there really is cohesion, at least in the energy sector. I feel I must warn against smear campaigns, as we saw with light bulbs and with shower heads. Such campaigns are the kind of things that alienate the citizens. We must thus ensure that we aim to achieve energy efficiency in general and that we keep this objective in mind without pursuing ideological smear campaigns that ultimately lead to the citizens losing their positive impression of the EU.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to congratulate Mr Almunia on the open debate that has taken place in the Commission. There are good reasons why you and the Commission President, Mr Barroso, took part in the debate in the College of Commissioners with a very different year in mind. I am pleased that the Commission is able to discuss issues so openly from a regulatory perspective and then to reverse its decision. That is both admirable and remarkable. It is a good thing that you are supporting the new decision here. There are a number of good grounds for this decision. Nevertheless, the Member States which are affected have been making plans. There are plans in place and I can only say that I am pleased that the review clause has been removed, which stated that we would have to open up the whole can of worms once again from 2012 onwards in the largest Member State affected, in other words, Germany. This means that your debate in the College of Commissioners has also had a very successful outcome. I know that 2018 will eventually come around. I am also pleased about the fact that the mining industry has the security to plan ahead and I will vote accordingly. However, I can see that regulatory policy is the winner here.

 Mr President, Mr Šemeta, Mr Caldeira, I would like to thank the Court of Auditors for this report. Your organisation, Mr Caldeira, provides an essential service for European taxpayers. It is a good thing that the reduction in the error rate has continued this year. This is the result of the reform of the Commission which was pushed through by the liberal Commissioner, Mr Kallas. There are major improvements over the previous year in the area of cohesion and only a slight deterioration in agriculture. However, the Commission should not now simply sit back and do nothing. We must make it clear that the huge improvements are based on a very lucky choice of samples. Therefore, I am concerned that the positive trend will not continue next year. We should make use of the momentum from the first budget discharge under the Treaty of Lisbon to introduce a decisive paradigm shift. I would like to make it clear once again that this year’s report from the Court of Auditors is the sixteenth in a row which does not have positive overall results. How can we finally bring an end to the inefficient and wasteful allocation of funding and to the political connivance in this area? My proposals as rapporteur are as follows: Firstly, the Commission must intervene more strongly in the case of obvious errors and, where these errors are repeated, it must suspend the funding. How is it that a Member State of many years standing like Greece is not subjected to sanctions over a period of 10 years, despite the fact that it is in obvious breach of the provisions of the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS)? Secondly, we must no longer impose double penalties on taxpayers. The beneficiaries of EU funding which has been allocated illegally are only required to repay 10%. In accordance with the 50:50 rule, the Member States contribute half of the amount from their national budgets. This is an insult to taxpayers. Let me give you a few figures. Between 1994 and 2006, the Member States have been wrongly allocated a phenomenal EUR 7.7 billion in the area of cohesion policy. The Commission itself has just made this fact public. Only EUR 709 million has been paid back, which demonstrates very clearly the difference in these circumstances. This is probably correct, because the Member States are not in a position to come up with accurate calculations. The Court of Auditors has confirmed this. Thirdly, all the Member States must finally sign and submit national management declarations. Fourthly, the Commission must be politically accountable. This is why we want signatures at least from Mr Barroso on the synthesis report on annual activities. We also want an evaluation report, which is provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon. There are still some things that are in need of improvement. All in all, I would like to thank the Court of Auditors very much for this report. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,

 Mr President, what exactly does European innovation policy do? What does European research policy do? If we ask ourselves this question and if we were to ask the citizens on the street, we would just get a blank look. This is because it is not clear what added value European research and European innovation brings. For that reason, we welcome the fact that Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn’s proposal begins by providing a definition of innovation. What is innovation? Innovation involves making money, a product or a licence from knowledge. That is something new. I am pleased that the Commission is going down this path. However, we also now need ‘man on the moon’ or ‘woman on the moon’ projects which are understood by the man on the street, so that EU taxpayers understand what we are doing here with their money. In this regard, I see great potential in the issue of increasing the number of healthy life years by two. That would be a project that everyone out there would understand. I am therefore pleased that the first innovation partnership proposed is being devoted precisely to achieving this goal. Two additional healthy years of life – that will be understood by everyone and it is something we should do. In this regard, you have our support. However, I would like to point out, and Mrs Merkies has already mentioned this, too, that if we simply look at the instruments that already exist, there is the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), the Joint Technology Initiatives (JTIs), the so-called Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP) – these are all programmes that already exist. If we add yet another programme, then we will make the whole area difficult to get to grips with. This is something we must not do. The innovation partnerships are intended to make a real contribution to bringing order to this situation and combining everything in a single system. That is why we will only accept this if it is all made clearer for taxpayers. We must always know the answer to the question: what brings more European added value? If that is the case, we will give it our full support. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Mr President, there is an error in the Dutch version of the resolution on the Gallo report. I am listed there among the signatories to the resolution by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left as a member of the GUE/NGL Group. In this regard, I would like to say that, firstly, I am not a member of the GUE/NGL Group, I am not a Leftist and I am no Communist. Secondly, I remain a member of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe – a Liberal – and will vote for the ALDE resolution, as will many members of the other groups in this House. Thirdly, I call on the GUE/NGL Group to also vote for the ALDE resolution. (Laughter) Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank Mr Oettinger and congratulate Mr Vidal-Quadras on his report. With the help of the Spanish Presidency, it has been possible to produce a very good document. Natural gas is important and its importance is increasing. In his speech, Mr Turmes said that we must change our perspective on the situation. In the country which I represent, half of all households are dependent on natural gas, but 40% of this comes from Russia. This is why adding legislation to the existing directive is important. It is also the right thing to do. It will give us prevention plans, preventive measures and emergency plans with three crisis levels. We do not want a repeat of the pictures which we saw in the gas crisis winter of 2009. We do not want to see our European partners and Europe’s neighbouring countries freezing. For this reason, this report forms part of our common European responsibility, which covers not just the EU Member States but also the neighbouring countries. Ladies and gentlemen, the legislation is good, but we also need to take other routes. For this reason, I welcome the announcement by Mr Oettinger that all the infrastructure measures, some of which have been mentioned here, including Nabucco, Nord Stream and South Stream, will receive support. This will allow us to diversify and will ensure that we are not dependent on a single supply. What we need is storage facilities. We definitely need more storage. In Germany, we have 70 days’ supply and that is not the case in every country. We must raise the standards in every country in this respect. The other issue is the energy mix. That remains our greatest challenge, which we must work together to overcome. Thank you very much and I hope that the new legislation will be successful. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Mr President, firstly, I would like to express my gratitude to and respect for Mrs Jeggle, who has been working on this report for years. However, Mrs Jeggle, there is one thing that I must say. As Europeans, we cannot take pride in this report. It is too vague and it permits too many things which a country or a continent that plays a leading role in animal welfare throughout the world should not allow. I foresee a worsening of the situation, in particular, as far as the reuse of experimental animals is concerned. Previously, this was more difficult, but I believe that the regulations have now been watered down. You are shaking your head, but it is true that when you look at this carefully, the small print and the nuances in the wording are the things that make the difference. The severity of the tests is also an area where, in many Member States, things are likely to get worse. Some Member States, such as Germany, the United Kingdom and Sweden, had already gone further than this. We have introduced a pain threshold and the Council has watered it down by permitting exceptions. In addition, the power of the Commission has been reduced with regard to inspections. Nevertheless, I will be voting in favour of this report, Mrs Jeggle, because it represents an improvement on the 1986 directive, which is now 24 years old. The authorisation mechanisms are in place. A licence is needed in advance for three stages of testing, which is a good thing. The procedures have been simplified, which is also a positive step. Personally, I am proud of the fact that we have been able to rescue the subject of alternative test methods from the last parliamentary term. However, we will need to provide more funding for this. This directive will have to be revised within the next seven years. It represents quite a good foundation, but in seven years, we will need to improve it so that we can live up to our reputation here in Europe for having the highest levels of animal welfare in the world.

 Providing consumers with information about food is undoubtedly important. However, the debate in Brussels has become a lobbying battle between large companies from the food industry and consumer protection organisations. There was no place in this debate for the reality of everyday life for consumers. The representatives of the German Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament are in favour of a minimum of labelling. Consumers should be able to make their purchasing decisions on the basis of transparent, legible information. Colour coded labelling influences consumers and does not form the basis for transparent information. The so-called guideline daily amounts (GDAs) also have their weak points. Instead of having neutral information about the amounts of nutrients per 100 grams or millilitres printed legibly on packaging, Parliament discussed whether the daily requirements of a 40-year-old woman could be used as the point of reference or whether the colour coding of nutrients was a useful decision-making tool. The proposed, far-reaching, mandatory requirements for the origin labelling of ingredients cannot be implemented in practice. We have also rejected the idea of special national provisions, because the labelling system should, as far as possible, be standardised. For these reasons, we were not able to vote in favour of the proposed report.

 Combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography is vitally important. We must use all our strength to combat the availability of child pornography in communications networks. The permanent and effective control of child abuse is both a political responsibility and a precept of the rule of law.

 Mr President, Commissioner thank you for your statement. I am very grateful for the initiative by the Spanish Presidency – and this is a very Spanish event as far as I can see – in adopting this series of proposals and leading the way in this regard. Electromobility must play a key role in future. However, as we all know, we are still a long way from achieving comprehensive electromobility. For that reason, we should also not make the mistake of allowing electric-car hype to arise, the claims of which we are not able to fulfil in political terms. Therefore, we should not abandon our focus on improving conventional means of locomotion, as crude oil will probably continue to fuel our mobility for a long time yet. The following points are crucial, however. Firstly, as you and all of the other speakers have said, we need a European strategy for the development of standards. The United States and China are working jointly on conductive charge couplers. We must not lag behind in this regard. We ought to lead the way and should not allow European vanity to take hold. Are the French quicker, or the Germans or the Spaniards? We should all pull together and the Commission should certainly take the lead in this. We need to develop cost-effective, high-performance batteries. Secondly, we need to extend network-infrastructure coverage to all areas. For us, that means that we have to focus our subsidy options on this in a more targeted way in the area of cohesion, in the regions and also in the development of rural areas. Citizens must be able to use electromobility across borders, otherwise they will not use this form of transport. Thirdly, we must also take electric cars into account in our CO2
 emissions calculations. Car manufacturers that are currently carrying out fleet calculations cannot yet include electric cars. We need to be able to take these into account in future. Fourthly, we must provide tax relief on electric cars throughout Europe. This applies to batteries in particular, which are still the most expensive part. We need to carry out research in this regard, but we also need to harmonise our taxes. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

Thank you, Mr President, that was very kind. Commissioner Šemeta, the adoption of the reports on the budgetary management of the European bodies and institutions is one of our most important obligations as representatives of the European people – it is our sovereign duty. The question of what Europe has done with taxpayers’ hard earned money is crucial for the acceptance of the European integration project. I would first like to thank all the rapporteurs for their efforts. However, I see light and shadow in the reports. I see light in budgetary management overall. Meanwhile, it is the case that everywhere the EU controls and manages funds itself, it runs things in accordance with the rules. Whether or not it is efficient is another matter altogether. As the European Parliament, we should pay closer attention to the efficiency of policies, political issues and implementation, in particular, with regard to the 2020 agenda. There is shadow in the area of cohesion policy. Eleven per cent of things do not comply with the rules and this percentage is too high. Therefore, it is very important that the EU tries harder to recover funds paid out incorrectly. The Committee on Budgetary Control has therefore adopted an amendment tabled by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. We want 100% of the money back. For 2010, I have the honour of being the rapporteur for the European Commission discharge. Due to the delayed entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, this will be no easy task. We must monitor very closely whether the new responsibilities of individual Commissioners lead to even less transparency and more concealment of responsibilities. We must and will examine this very closely. Allow me to single out two areas: firstly, the so-called non-governmental organisations and secondly, the gentlemen’s agreement. Between 2008 and 2009, the European Union paid NGOs over EUR 300 million in funds. These include honourable organisations like the Deutsche Welthungerhilfe
. However, there are also some that want to destroy the reputation of the European Union, namely Counter Balance, which has attacked the European Investment Bank. This is not acceptable and we must deal with it. We need a register and a definition of such non-governmental organisations, as they receive a lot of tax money. With regard to the gentlemen’s agreement I would like to thank Mr López Garrido. I would like to thank you for coming. I would also like to point to the historical element: questioning and revising the gentlemen’s agreement after 40 years is a huge step. Given the importance of Parliament due to the new Treaty of Lisbon, it is also a necessary step. We must ensure transparency, here and in the Council.

According to the resolution of the European Parliament on the draft general budget for the financial year 2010, adopted on 17 December 2009, a vote was taken today on the amending budget for the European Parliament, following the revised calculations made by the Parliamentary administration. The FDP in the European Parliament abstained, because there was a paragraph in the package of amendments concerned that we could not reconcile with our convictions. The FDP had already expressed its opposition to an increase in the secretarial allowance to EUR 1 500 during the discussions in committee. It is out of the secretarial allowance that MEPs’ assistants are paid. The FDP considers that the argument that more money is needed due to the additional work that MEPs have to do with the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is unsound, as there is nothing in past experience to support this. Certainly, due to the Treaty of Lisbon, which has just come into force, Parliament will overall need extra capacity for legislative work, but with the introduction of the Assistants’ Statute from the beginning of the current parliamentary term, there is still no proof that MEPs actually need more assistants. For this reason, there are grounds for concern that further demands and supplementary increases, or an extension of office capacity, will follow. For this reason, the FDP in the European Parliament abstained. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Mr President, as the head of the delegation, I would like, first of all, to congratulate Mr Thaler on his very balanced report. Skopje has carried out reforms and is on the way to joining the European Union. We welcome this very much and are very pleased about it. The visa liberalisation was perhaps the clearest and most visible sign. It was a milestone in our cooperation. This objective has only been achieved as a result of close collaboration with the EU Member States. It represents openness, interaction and cooperation. However, we must not forget that Macedonia was granted the status of accession candidate four years ago and since then, we have constantly been asking ourselves when it would finally join the European Union. I would like to call on all the parties to ensure that the name conflict, which is currently the focus of attention, is resolved. We must make use of the momentum generated by the Council decision in December and by the new Greek Government. This momentum is diminishing day by day. I would like to explain to the parties that if we concentrate now on other topics, such as the financial crisis, the goal of Macedonia’s accession will be pushed further into the background. We surely do not wish this to happen and this is why we must continue to make every effort in this area. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mr Kallas, Mr Caldeira, I can see both good things and bad things in the presentation of the Court of Auditors’ annual report on the EU budget. First of all, I would like to thank the Court of Auditors for a clearer, bolder and more political report which is easier for us to understand. The good areas include the management of the budget as a whole. In contrast to recent years, this has improved. This is, above all, the result of better management of funds in the area of agriculture and natural resources, which has been our biggest headache over the last few years. For the first time, Mr Caldeira, you do not give an adverse opinion in your report and that is good news. The report highlights the fact that wherever the EU itself controls and administers the funds, there is proper budget management. Whether it is efficient is another matter. I would like to congratulate Mr Kallas warmly in this respect. It is to your credit and during your period of office that this visible improvement has taken place. Congratulations! However, it is now the responsibility of the Member States in particular to improve their control systems. If there is continuing cause for criticism of budgetary management in the EU, this is not at an EU level – as we have now seen – but at the level of the Member States. This is where the problems lie. Cohesion policy, for example, which is implemented by the Member States and which receives around a third of the funds, is the major problem area. You say that 11% is irregular and the non-attached Member said that the figure was EUR 4 billion. That is not correct. It is over EUR 2.5 billion, which you specifically state is taxpayers’ money that should not have been spent. We must say this quite clearly and we must introduce clear controls. However, the consequence is that the European Commission must continue to exert pressure on the Member States and we will support you in this area, Mr Kallas. We must implement a policy of naming and shaming. We must publicly shame the wasteful Member States, which continue to exist, and describe the situation clearly. Overall, you come to the conclusion that the regulations must be simplified. We would like to support you in this and we would like to add one other request. There must be an increased focus not only on regularity but also on efficiency, to ensure that taxpayers’ money is spent correctly. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am speaking as head of the delegation to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and I will be concentrating on this country. I would like to offer my very warm thanks to Mr Rehn for his courage. His report and his green light for this country represent a bold step forward which has generated momentum. At the same time, elections have been held in Greece and there is a new government in Athens, which gives us a situation and a window in which we can achieve something. However, I would like to ask my fellow Members to react calmly. A meeting is being held on Friday between Mr Papandreou and Prime Minister Gruevski, and if we set expectations too high, we may increase the pressure so much that the whole thing falls apart and we do not want to risk that. We must encourage all sides to continue in friendship along the path that has already been taken. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Thaler, for describing this route so accurately. I would also like to wish my friend, Mr Rehn, a successful future in the Commission. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Madam President, thank you very much for the question. I believe that both sides need to change their spots and it is clear that both sides are ready to take a step forward. We are now expecting a lasting solution. For this reason, I expect the name issue to be resolved clearly and definitively in the course of a five-minute discussion. That is not the problem. The application of the name, the so-called scope, is the major issue and both sides obviously need time to resolve it. I would like to see a lasting solution because the alternative is a short-term solution which could lead to disaster. For this reason, all of us must give both sides friendly encouragement to find a long-term solution with a broad scope and a broad application. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner Kallas, first of all, I very much welcome the fact that the Swedish Presidency of the Council is present, and I would also like to personally thank Mrs Malmström for having made the procedure more transparent. Everything that my fellow Members have said is true – the procedure is more transparent, and even if she expressed herself in a somewhat more cautious manner today, we can still say that we will be granting discharge. There is still a very long way to go. We ask the Council to follow this first step with further steps, especially given that the Council’s competences in the field of foreign and security policy have been much more clearly defined under the Treaty of Lisbon. In future, this policy will also have a face, in the shape of Baroness Ashton. The citizens, however, did not previously know Baroness Ashton, and they, the European taxpayers, will still not know, in future, exactly how much money she has at her disposal and what she does with it. We must change this state of affairs. This, indeed, is an absolute must in a time where we are actually fighting for a transparent, democratic Europe. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Søndergaard for having applied pressure in our – Parliament’s – name, and we will maintain that pressure. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,

 Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, today we are debating a motion for resolution on neurodegenerative diseases. The intention is actually for this to become a directive, and so next time, we should also be debating a directive on this subject. The diseases that we are discussing today – Alzheimer’s disease, although Parkinson’s disease is also referred to in the text – are diseases of the brain which constitute a major challenge for Europe. The long-term costs are set to soar and there is still a lot of research to do. Unfortunately, there is a lot of duplicated research and bureaucracy in Europe. Thus, with this motion for a resolution, we want to eliminate the duplicated research, bureaucracy and fragmentation. The Group of the United European Left – Nordic Green Left has tabled a motion for the research results to be made publicly available. I think this motion is a good one. Unfortunately, the wording is wrong, and I would therefore ask for it to be reworded so that it can be incorporated better. Essentially, there is a problem with regard to European patents. It would be good if the Commission, and the Council, too, could take up the subject of European patents in the areas of pharmaceuticals and bio-research and make it clear that we need this. In any case, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports this motion for a resolution. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

Madam President, I'm delighted to be given the opportunity of taking the floor in the first meeting to be chaired by you. I am very pleased, in fact! Most of all, however, I would like to thank Commissioner Špidla for having spoken German, and I would like to express my heartfelt congratulations to Commissioner Kroes. Many people believe that the Opel-Vauxhall case is a German issue. It is not – it is a European issue! It relates to jobs all across Europe, and special treatment here for Germany would not be right. I am therefore particularly pleased to see that the Commission is willing to examine this case. The issues at hand are questions under European law in relation to competition law and State aid. We do want to save every job, but at what price? As counsel for the citizens and taxpayers, it is unclear in the Opel-Magna deal what long-term commitments will be laid at taxpayers’ doors. The Opel case is also questionable from an industrial policy point of view. It is always only the biggest who receive help. The smallest and those in the middle are left to look after themselves, yet they are the backbone of the economy. The fixation on one investor was clearly a wrong move. Better and more favourable offers were turned down early on – and by politicians, in fact. The Opel case has more to do with electioneering than with economic and industrial policy that is pure and above board from the point of view of EU law. To restate the point, it is important the Commission now plays an active role, even if the German Government does not approve. The Opel deal is a sham. That is becoming ever more obvious. It could mark the most expensive election campaign in the history of Germany. We want Opel to survive, we want it to be healthy and we want to fight for every job, but we do not want there to be costs involved, nor do we want a solution at the expense of our European partners, on whom Germany, as the biggest exporter in the world, is also dependent.

Mr President, Commissioner, dear colleagues, thank you for the opportunity to raise the issue of non-preferential rules of origin with you in plenary today. ‘Better late than never’, I feel compelled to say, as we already tabled this question about a year ago. This was at a time when the internal market and the Committee on International Trade were drafting their report on the modernisation of the customs code. Nevertheless it is still important to have this discussion on the proposed introduction of the ‘list rules’, as my colleague already mentioned, for the non-preferential origin of goods, and hear the Commission’s answers to our questions. This is all the more important as business and customs officials fear the rise of new bureaucratic burdens if these rules for the determination of the origin were to be changed. My colleagues from the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection have been working intensively on the recast of the Union Customs Code and adopted their report with a broad majority at the end of last year. The report states very clearly that the current concept for the determination of non-preferential origin of goods should be maintained. This is, and I quote, ‘when they underwent their last substantial economically justified processing or working’. This definition is very clear and has served as a solid basis in international trade for decades, so why change it? The Commission says the introduction of list rules would bring greater legal certainty for the determination of origin and in anti-dumping cases. Well, in my view this is quite a theoretical approach. Practitioners have been complaining that the legal certainty is not improved, and anti-dumping cases only involve 0.7% of all imports into the EU. So I think we should stick to the saying: ‘If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’. From the perspective of international trade, the proposed changes are particularly sensitive. They would have obliged EU importers to comply with the new EU rules instead of applying the domestic laws of origin as is currently the case. We should be very careful with such requests to our trade partners as it would also mean that EU producers would have to apply the multitude of rules of origin of the multitude of destination countries to which we are exporting. Knowing you, Commissioner De Gucht, I think it is not your intention to make trade more complicated for EU producers. So I would like to thank you for being here tonight and I am looking forward to hearing your answers on the questions we have raised. Silvana Koch-Mehrin,

 Madam President, while Russia and the European Union enjoy a very intertwined and intense relationship and today we are not only neighbours, but fortunately we are friends, the Liberals and Democrats also welcome the accession of Russia to the WTO after eighteen years of negotiations. It was high time indeed. I think it is good news for Russia but also for the European Union. Why? Because we can hope for a relationship based on clear rules and clear applicability. If we look at what happened to China after it joined the WTO, we can see that the growth and the success story of China really began with that date a few years ago. So I hope this will happen for Russia as well and that Russia can also envisage an extreme success story after the significant date in August this year. But I would also like to raise two concerns, two challenges. One has already been mentioned by Mr Sefčovič and other colleagues, and that is that Russia does not seem to be willing to live up 100 % to its obligations which come with the accession to the WTO but is instead undertaking some extensive and potentially restrictive trade measures like the examples which have already been mentioned. The second point I would like to make is that we have to look at the business environment in Russia. Russia has always been a very proud nation with a rich culture, with inventions and esprit
; Nobel Prize winners and astronauts have come from Russia. We all know about these important landmarks in Russian history. But why is it that today – apart from maybe vodka, caviar and Gazprom – we do not really know of any Russian brands? Why is it that they do not really thrive? Why are there not Russian success stories? I think this has to do with the applicability of the rule of law and human rights, and I think it is good that it has been raised in our resolution. It comes in a timely manner, because next week we go to Moscow and can discuss it there. Silvana Koch-Mehrin,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, every aspect of European trade policy has changed. The policy has a completely new legal basis and it is particularly obvious that the new Treaty has had major consequences for the European Parliament. The subject we are currently discussing concerns what at first sight are technical questions and these involve complex concepts, such as the introduction of delegated acts and the adoption of implementing provisions. However, behind these concepts lie tangible trade policy interests. We only need to think of the time limits for anti-dumping procedures or for the regulations on anti-subsidy instruments. In these cases, time really is money. The new requirements for transparency in the case of non-confidential information are also of great interest to the general public. Ms Quisthoudt-Rowohl has already mentioned the subject of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). If we had had more transparency in this area right from the beginning, who knows how many of the discussions could have been avoided. I think that at this point, I simply need to give my thanks to the rapporteur, who has guided us confidently through this subject and has managed the cooperation with her fellow Members very well. I hope that we will very soon reach a conclusion in this area. Silvana Koch-Mehrin  (ALDE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, who in Europe is still talking about votes for women? The answer is that nobody is nowadays, as we take women’s right to vote for granted. How was that situation brought about? It was done through legislation, through compulsion, in other words. I therefore think it is important that we should also introduce gender quotas today through legislation. The result would be that we would not have to talk about it any more, as it would be just as self-evident as women’s right to vote. Voluntary self-imposed obligations either do not work or are not even entered into, and this applies just as much to the economy as to politics. In a representative democracy such as Europe, the majority of the population, which is to say women, must actually be represented accordingly in politics. Yet the reality in the parliaments and in the parties is something quite different. When it comes to the economy, numerous studies have shown that an equal distribution of women and men in executive positions considerably improves the economic success of a company. Moreover, it is also the case that the decision on whether or not to buy something is taken by women for nearly every product. As a liberal, I stand for competition, and I stand for a free and fair market economy. However, both of these only work when basic conditions are in place that permit that very freedom and fairness. Those conditions are not in place for women when it comes to executive positions. I therefore look forward, Ms Reding, to the proposals that you will be bringing forward in May on the participation of more women in executive positions. It is, I would say, high time for that to happen. Silvana Koch-Mehrin,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Petitions

 Mr President, in the Committee on Petitions we are concerned with ensuring that the European Ombudsman receives adequate funding. The office of the European Ombudsman is an important European body. It provides assistance to citizens and resolves problems and errors in the institutions. It also brings the EU closer to its citizens. In the 2012 budget there is very moderate increase of 0.47% for the European Ombudsman. For example, no new posts have been requested and no new employees will be appointed. Nevertheless, the Council wanted to make some cuts. Therefore, I would like to thank the Committee on Budgets for reversing these cuts and I hope that we can confirm the committee’s position today. This would send out a signal that the EU needs to move closer to its citizens. Silvana Koch-Mehrin,

 Madam President, this is certainly an important subject; we are all aware of that. Before the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, the national parliaments were constantly complaining that 80% of the laws they passed were actually decided by Europe; that they were simply rubber-stamping it as a kind of agent of the EU. The Treaty of Lisbon has changed that. The national parliaments play a leading role and can exert an influence. The Treaty of Lisbon has made the EU more democratic because it has given greater power to the representatives of the people. This applies to the European Parliament just as much as to the national parliaments. The national parliaments then continued to complain nonetheless; this time, about the increased workload, the mountains of documents constantly landing on their desks with just a few weeks for them to respond. The important thing, however, is that the representatives of the people in Europe’s capitals now have a means of exerting influence over the European Union’s initiatives – and I get the impression that the national parliaments are increasingly realising this and making use of it. Almost two years have now passed since the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force on 1 December 2009, when these procedures also took effect. I and a few of my fellow Members therefore felt that the time was right to ask how the Commission sees the situation now. Is it satisfied with the quality of the response from the national parliaments? How does the Commission deal with this? Does it have sufficient resources – including human resources – to deal with it? Moreover, in some Member States, the regions are important, such as the Bundesländer
 in the case of Germany. How is input from this political level dealt with? Does it have sufficient resonance? Is there also adequate cooperation with the Committee of the Regions? These are the questions put jointly by Andrew Duff, Alexandra Thein, Michael Theurer and myself. I look forward to hearing your answer. President.

 In the vote on the Lange report, I am abstaining on paragraph 31 because of the ambiguous wording of the vote, which refers to Eurobonds as well as project bonds. However, taking it as a whole, I am voting for the report, as I have nothing against project bonds in themselves. Project bonds serve as finance for extensive innovation, infrastructure and reindustrialisation projects. This is not a question of instruments for the communitarisation of debts, as would be the case with Eurobonds. Silvana Koch-Mehrin,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the equality of all human beings is enshrined in the first two articles of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This states: ‘All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood’. What a wonderful sentence. However, even one hundred years after the first International Women’s Day, we still have not achieved this: there is still no sign of true equality between men and women. Granted, we have achieved at great deal in Europe. Today, our primary concern is no longer the legal freedom of women. We have largely achieved this freedom. I would like to express my gratitude to the feminists, both male and female, for their work in the past. Today, our main concern is freedom in action, that men should take ownership of the issue of the compatibility of work and family life, and that seeing women at the top in business or politics is something that should become commonplace. It is fantastic to see how the liberation movements in North Africa look to us, the women of Europe. They look to us to play a pioneering role. It is vitally important that we do not lose sight of our goal: the freedom to live our lives according to our own conceptions. That is when equality will become something we take for granted and when International Women’s Day will be transformed from a day of remembrance to a day to celebrate freedom. President.

Madam President, Mr Oettinger, it is good that you have commissioned the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks to look at this issue again. I am pleased about this. However, the question remains: How can we explain to the citizens of Europe that they have to allow something into their houses under EU regulations which represents a health hazard for their children? You have children and you know how it is. Things often get broken. Mr Leichtfried from Austria and I are very concerned about this. How can we make it clear that this is something dangerous? We do not seem to be able to learn from past mistakes. However, you were not responsible for the original decision, so you can show a willingness to learn without losing face. You could have said that we will withdraw this ban, at least for private households. Would you be prepared to reconsider your decision? President.

 Mr President, competition policy is one of the most important, central policy areas of the EU. Good competition policy enables markets to function properly. Good competition policy also allows consumers to benefit from a wide variety of products at reasonable and affordable prices. Good competition policy also contributes to creating growth again in Europe. That is why it is so important, Commissioner, to include all the areas that you have mentioned in competition policy. It is also important to strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises, as they are the driving force behind growth in Europe. Market barriers must be abolished, which also means doing away with the excessive costs that still pertain where competition is not working, such as roaming charges on mobile phones, where competition still does not exist – something that needs to be changed. Finally, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Eppink, for his excellent work, and to the Commission I would say: be ambitious in your goals. (Applause) President.

 Thank you very much. As you can imagine, as President of the High Level Group on Gender Equality and Diversity, equality is very important to me. We have a list of speakers and we did try to make it balanced. Who gets the opportunity to speak during the debate is, of course, also dependent on who is actually present. That concludes this item.

– Blue card questions on a personal comment under Rule 151 are not permitted. Your request to speak on this point therefore cannot be accepted. President.  
– Many thanks. We will now continue with the debate. I allowed the personal explanation because the previous point of order referred directly to Mr Martin. We will now go on with the debate and also devote our full attention to it. President.  
– We had a technical problem here, so it was somewhat longer than a minute. However, the clock is now working again, and hopefully everything should now go according to the set timetable. President.

– The next item is the one-minute speeches in accordance with Rule 150. Rule 150 states that we may spend a maximum of 30 minutes on this item. We had more than 74 requests to speak under this item. That will clearly not be possible. Thirty minutes and 74 speakers for one minute will simply not work. Therefore, we have, for the first time, selected in advance the Members who will be granted speaking time using clear criteria, namely that those who requested speaking time in another debate with one-minute speeches but did not get chance to speak will now be granted speaking time where possible, whereas those who have already spoken in other debates will not be granted any speaking time. All of those who have not been granted speaking time were informed of this in advance by e-mail. Therefore, they do not need to be here to wait in vain for their speaking time. I hope that you understand that. This was the only possible way to enable the debate to proceed in an orderly manner. Therefore, those who have been granted speaking time can now begin straight away. President.  
– That concludes this item. Thank you all for your understanding and for the disciplined proceedings. I hope that all of those who did not have an opportunity to speak this time will get the chance to do so next time. President.

According to the resolution of the European Parliament on the draft general budget for the financial year 2010, adopted on 17 December 2009, a vote was taken today on the amending budget for the European Parliament, following the revised calculations made by the Parliamentary administration. The FDP in the European Parliament abstained, because there was a paragraph in the package of amendments concerned that we could not reconcile with our convictions. The FDP had already expressed its opposition to an increase in the secretarial allowance to EUR 1 500 during the discussions in committee. It is out of the secretarial allowance that MEPs’ assistants are paid. The FDP considers that the argument that more money is needed due to the additional work that MEPs have to do with the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is unsound, as there is nothing in past experience to support this. Certainly, due to the Treaty of Lisbon, which has just come into force, Parliament will overall need extra capacity for legislative work, but with the introduction of the Assistants’ Statute from the beginning of the current parliamentary term, there is still no proof that MEPs actually need more assistants. For this reason, there are grounds for concern that further demands and supplementary increases, or an extension of office capacity, will follow. For this reason, the FDP in the European Parliament abstained. President.

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Spain is now taking on the Presidency of the European Union for the fourth time. You know what it is to cooperate with the European Parliament in a very wide range of situations. We now have the Treaty of Lisbon, which means that the European Parliament is now your key contact partner. In your programme, you say that you want the EU to take root in the will of those who render it legitimate, namely European citizens. That is a very ambitious aim. The path to achieving it can only be found via the representatives of European citizens, in other words the parliaments. I am therefore very pleased to hear you say that cooperation between the national parliaments, the parliaments of the EU Member States, and the European Parliament is the cornerstone of such a path. You want to bring the parliaments closer together in order to bring citizens closer together. That is a good thing. You have a great responsibility in this regard, as you are the first Presidency following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. Other Presidencies will use you as an example. You are therefore creating the blueprint, so to speak. I would like subsequent presidencies to have to measure themselves against you where cooperation structures are concerned. I wish you much success! Silvana Koch-Mehrin  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Reinfeldt, your calm and steady Presidency was a success. You had difficult political issues to resolve and overall you did a good job. The people chosen by you for the important new EU posts can now define these without any preconceived ideas, as they are as yet largely unknown to most European citizens. As an aside, if I may say so, your best decision is sitting on your right. Nevertheless, Mr Reinfeldt, I cannot give your Presidency full marks. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, you increased the development towards making the European Council into a kind of EU ‘supergovernment’. Its comprehensive jurisdiction is increasing, from the environment to financial policy. At the same time, you are closing the doors ever tighter. This is not what transparent debates by representatives of the people look like. The second reason is this: the fact that you pushed SWIFT through the Council just hours before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon demonstrates a clear disregard for the European Parliament and hence a lack of respect for the citizens. Nevertheless, I would like to thank you for the last six months. President.

 Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would also like to thank our colleague Ms Thyssen for her extremely detailed and largely balanced report. We have known for some time that the euro area can only be successful in the long term if it achieves greater integration and actually becomes a genuine economic, financial and monetary union. What that means in detail and what measures need to be taken emerge from the report put forward by Mr Rompuy this summer. This report was drawn up by four Presidents. There is one President missing, however, namely President Martin Schulz, the representative of our House. To me this demonstrates the little esteem in which our House is actually held by the Council. This is also made clear by the fact that the Council is now trying to rush through a very important issue, namely the introduction of a powerful supervisory mechanism for the banking sector at the European Central Bank, with Parliament once again having been assigned nothing more than a role on the sidelines. I do not consider this to be compatible with the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon and I believe that the Council’s ‘sink or swim’ policy towards Parliament is doomed to failure in the long term.

 Mr President, … am not satisfied with the collaboration between Parliament and the Council on this point. The Crisis Committee’s proposals, some of which the Council is now taking up, were hardly commented on by the Council in any way at the time the report was presented, let alone adopted. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

Mr President, Commissioner, two years ago the European Parliament came to the conclusion that the European internal market for financial services also needs European supervision and it proposed establishing this supervision with, but not in, the European Central Bank, so as not to put the Bank’s independence at risk. The Commission now suggests establishing such supervision within the ECB and first focusing its work on the financial institutions of the euro area. The European internal market for financial service providers involves more than just the euro area, however. For this reason I believe it is crucial for us to act as quickly as possible to place not only the financial institutions of the euro area under this supervision, but also the entire European Union. The first step should be at least to place all the countries that have committed themselves to introducing the euro, in other words all countries except Denmark and the United Kingdom, under this supervision. It is important that this supervision should not become a bureaucratic monster. That is why it is crucial that the share-out of tasks between the ECB and the national supervisory bodies should be clarified quickly. It is also necessary to clarify the share-out of tasks between the ECB and the European Banking Authority (EBA). Democratic legitimation has been mentioned more than once here. The key is that the accountability of this supervision is assured without putting the independence of the bank at risk. One more point: the project must be implemented in such a way that citizens have no reason to be even more Eurosceptic. Be careful in your use of national rescue, resolution and deposit guarantee funds. Our citizens see this as their money and want it to be used in their own countries. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have a massive crisis of confidence, and therefore expectations of the last summit were relatively high. The summit was scarcely any different from earlier summits, with one exception: seldom have the negotiating tactics – which sometimes bordered on blackmail – and the differences between the negotiating partners been played out so clearly to the outside world as this time. In the end, agreement was reached on Friday morning. However, it turns out that, when it comes down to it, the consensus reached was only a formal compromise, which was then called into question again just 72 hours after being reached. The Dutch and the Finns have already announced that they do not support the buying of government bonds on the secondary market. The markets, which had, until then, reacted positively, are now also beginning to question and smear the result. I expressly welcome the fact that it was decided at the summit to get serious about creating a real banking union. If we have a common economic area and currency area, then we also need a genuine functioning internal market for financial services. Naturally, that includes bank supervision, but it also includes a banking resolution and rescue fund, and ultimately it also includes a deposit guarantee system. All that will take time, and I hope that the European Parliament will be adequately taken into consideration at least in the first step, the construction of supervision at the European Central Bank, and things will not continue as they have done recently. This summit was definitely not the great breakthrough. It was not a great act of liberation. The citizens are just as uncertain as before, and I fear that we will continue to muddle along. I can only hope that we have enough time in which to find the ultimate solution. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 The German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament has spoken out clearly in favour of the introduction of a debt redemption fund. However, participation in such a fund must be associated with clear and strict rules, such as were contained in the proposal made by the German Council of Economic Experts to the German Government in autumn 2011. Watering down the criteria for participation is neither productive nor effective. Linking the introduction of a debt redemption fund with the eurobonds project and the treatment of economic imbalances is unfair, and is rejected by the FDP in the European Parliament in the strongest possible terms. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis goes on. The measures adopted in recent months, or even years, have failed to convince the markets on a durable basis. There is an urgent need for the Member States to take seriously a disciplined, balanced budgetary policy. The ‘two-pack’ can help to make progress in that direction. It can provide the basis for stability and growth. However, a whole series of amendments are once again being tabled, with the aim of watering down the proposals. We do not need a watered-down ‘two-pack’, however. What we do require is a genuine act of release. This act of release could consist of two elements. The first element would be the debt redemption fund already mentioned by a number of speakers, which would help to consolidate the inherited debts and spread them out over a period of 25 years. The second element would be that we have to achieve real progress in the conversion of the euro area into a true internal financial market, in other words, into an internal market with cross-border banking supervision, a cross-border deposit guarantee fund and a uniform cross-border banking rescue and resolution regime. Wolf Klinz,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, all products and services are taxed, so one might well ask why financial transactions should not be taxed also. I can therefore fully understand the idea behind taxing such transactions. The financial sector has, after all, caused considerable damage in recent years, and is not exactly without blame for the difficult situation that we currently find ourselves in, particularly in Europe. The speculative losses of JPMorgan Chase that recently came to light bear witness once again to the fact that the financial industry really has not yet learnt from past mistakes. It seems that the greed of some players has still not been assuaged. The Commission has tabled a very creative proposal, and the residence principle that it has proposed has been supplemented by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs with the issuance and the ownership principles. Together, these should actually ensure that the risk of financial transactions being shifted out of the EU to other regions of the world can be relatively well averted. Nonetheless, naturally, there are still issues outstanding. Unlike the Commissioner, I feel that we should, in fact, exempt pension funds, because I do not see why savers who are putting aside money for their old age should be penalised. Moreover, there are naturally a few questions regarding the practical implementation of how the tax is levied that have yet to be clarified, and last but not least, how the revenue is actually going to be used. What will go to the EU and what will go to the Member States? In our approach to resolving this, there are two things that we should not lose sight of. Firstly, we must not weaken Europe. Secondly, we must ensure that we do not fragment Europe further. We have to achieve the exact opposite – not fragmentation, but as much progress as possible on the harmonisation of our taxes. A global introduction of the tax is not feasible at present; we know that. Regrettably, we cannot introduce it EU-wide either. It appears that the British veto cannot be broken. The rapporteur’s suggestion that we proceed now by means of enhanced cooperation does not seem to me to be sufficient. If we were to push ahead with only nine or ten Member States, we would actually be contributing to further fragmentation in Europe. That is not what we want. That is why I feel that as a minimum, we must have all 17 euro area members plus a couple more on board. We therefore have to look for alternatives that would enable all countries to participate. I feel that we could even take the UK’s stamp duty as a starting point, and then of course expand it and include not just shares, but also bonds, derivatives and professional dealers. If we content ourselves with the current proposal and the mechanism of enhanced cooperation, then I believe we will be going down the wrong route.

 I did, in fact, say that the matter of how the resources will be used has not yet been finally decided. How much will go to Brussels and how much will remain with the Member States is still a matter of debate. Even among the Member States, it has not yet been settled which Member State would receive the funds. Once we have fundamentally settled this issue and know how much is going to the EU budget in Brussels, then we can think about the question that you have raised. At the moment, it would be purely speculation. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I subscribe to your opinion that the highly indebted countries will only be able to extract themselves from their predicament through a combination of growth and austerity. Some of what you propose – such as European Investment Bank (EIB) financed infrastructure projects – could indeed make them more competitive and thus contribute to growth. However, much of what you say reminds me of what Christine Lagarde of the International Monetary Fund is proposing – namely, taking on more debt in order to stimulate growth. At the end of the day, such additional financial injections would be just a flash in the pan, and there would be nothing to show for it afterwards other than even higher levels of debt, even higher unemployment and even higher inflation. We experienced that in Germany in the 1970s, when Helmut Schmidt tried precisely that. What we are dealing with is not a cyclical problem, but rather a structural weakness. If we are to overcome it, we need courageous structural reforms. Unfortunately, we are seeing little of that in the countries concerned. We need to complete the internal market, including the services sector. We need to open up protected markets, we need to make the labour market more flexible and we need to get rid of red tape. All that can happen without taking any more money, and it would still lead to growth. Wolf Klinz,

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of February, I had the opportunity to travel with several Members of this House to Burma, or Myanmar, as it now calls itself. To me, it was like a small miracle when President Thein Sein, a former member of the military junta, gave us a relatively credible explanation of his desire for reform. The critical test came at the beginning of this month, when the by-elections took place. It was very impressive to see how the opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who previously had to operate in secret, achieved an overwhelming victory, despite the fact that obstacles were occasionally placed in the way of her election campaign. However, one thing must be clear to us. Her party, the National League for Democracy, is still a very small party. It currently has only just over 40 seats. Therefore, the way in which it develops over the next few weeks, months and years will be decisive. The crucial landmark will be the 2015 elections. This is when it will become clear whether the citizens of Burma really have the opportunity to elect their members of parliament and their government freely, fairly and without outside influence. Until then, the reform process must continue at a rapid pace. It is essential that those who are currently in power make genuine progress and go on with the work that they have started. They must release the remaining political prisoners, as Mr Belet has already said. They must come to a ceasefire in the feuds that they are having with different ethnic groups and ultimately bring about peace. They must offer their citizens full democratic rights, such as freedom of expression in speech and writing, including on the Internet, in schools and in universities. They must ensure that there is a free and independent press and an independent judicial system. They must begin the systematic process of establishing the structures of a social market economy. We, together with our private sector, can and must help them to achieve this. As Burma introduces more democracy and freedom for its people, so the West can reduce its sanctions or even lift them altogether. It is in all our interests for Burma to free itself from China’s embrace and to overcome the mass poverty among its citizens. Wolf Klinz,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when the Lehman Brothers Bank in New York collapsed in March 2008, the global financial crisis reached its first high point. For small-scale savers and depositors, this crisis began a year earlier, when Northern Rock in the United Kingdom ran into difficulties and long queues of depositors suddenly began to form outside bank buildings, with customers waiting to withdraw their money. This was not just limited to Northern Rock, but was also evident in other banks too. The uncertainty among savers, in particular small-scale depositors, was enormous, which was why national governments found themselves forced to guarantee investments above the contractually guaranteed minimum level. Some states, like Germany and Ireland, actually guaranteed deposits to an unlimited extent, something that could not be sustained in the long term. The divergence between the deposit guarantee schemes in Europe came at a price at the time. That is why the Commission rightly said that we must ensure order and we must present a uniform deposit guarantee scheme for all 27 Member States of the European Union. It did this in an extremely convincing and acceptable way. The gaps were closed, depositor security was strengthened and a broad degree of harmonisation was established. As representatives of Parliament, we support this proposal. We had thought that we could have tabled one or two improvements. Unfortunately, as Mr Balz has already explained, our negotiations with the Council have been unsuccessful to date. Nonetheless, we are not giving up hope, but believe that we may still succeed in the coming months. The following is an important point, however: a deposit guarantee scheme protects depositors and is therefore necessary. However, it is even more important that it should not run out of money. Even more important again is that insolvency, or even difficulty, should be avoided, and that we should have preventive measures in place. That is why we urgently await the Commission’s presentation of the crisis and process management dossier. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union stands at an absolutely crucial crossroads. We need to deepen integration, especially in the fields of financial and economic policy. We need a strong Commissioner who combines the functions that are currently spread between the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Euro, the President of the Euro Group, a different Finance Minister every six months and the regent of economics Herman Van Rompuy into a single role and who represents the EU and the euro area to the outside world. If that does not succeed, we will not even be able to defend the status quo
, we will then inevitably find ourselves in a disintegration phase. We do not want a union of debt. We need a union of stability, and that is why the solution does not consist of issuing Eurobonds. Only today, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) had to pay 200 basis points more for its bond issues than Germany. The situation is getting worse – the bonds already issued are quoted far below face value. We need to attempt to also raise reserves that we still have in every Member State. The whole issue of the subsidies must be approached. In my country alone this is certainly a high two-digit, maybe even a three-digit, figure in billions that thus can be adjusted in the budget, with the effect of raising taxes. Mr Trichet hit the nail on the head today when he said that time is of the essence. The reality is that we must act fast or else the markets will continue to set the course for politics. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis was established in autumn 2009, many observers commented that it was too late. It should have been launched a year earlier and the crisis was almost over, they said. Today, we find ourselves not in the first or second year following the crisis, but rather in the fourth year of the crisis. The problem is still ongoing. Fukushima has shown that, one day, everything that can possibly go wrong will go wrong. It was a similar story with the global financial crisis. Numerous negative factors coincided and, if it were not for the decisive action by the European Union and the USA, things might have hit a new low, leading to economic melt-down and a repeat of the great depression of the last century. Happily, this has been avoided. However, we now have the so-called debt crisis or the euro crisis in Europe. We have been in the grip of this problem for eighteen months now. I get the impression that Europe’s decision makers have not been providing active leadership for the last year-and-a-half. They react to market distortions and turbulences in the market, but they do not act with foresight on the basis of a clear vision of where they want to take Europe. That is what is missing. There is a lack of vision, and our citizens have the impression that it is business as usual for those who caused the crisis: profits are privatised, losses are socialised and the actual issues are side-stepped. That is where our report has its starting point. It makes proposals for the overall direction of the future development of the European Union and the euro area. Mrs Berès explained these proposals in detail and Mr Karas also discussed them. I do not need to go into further detail at this point. There is one important point to note, however, which is that Europe has reached an extremely critical turning point. If we do not choose the right path now, we will not even be able to maintain the status quo of the integration already achieved, and will instead find ourselves taking a step backwards. It is important that all of us who believe in Europe and who want to shape Europe’s future should support these ideas, addressing our citizens and the representatives of the national parliaments and trying to win them over to our cause. (Applause) Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we do not know precisely what role short selling or naked short selling played in the bankruptcies of Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers, but we do know that they made at least a substantial contribution to the collapse of these institutions. Claiming that naked short selling is useful for the market is as hard to prove as saying that it will be the end of the world if we do not prohibit it. We are dealing here with a highly complex, extremely technical area and I would not dare to claim that one thing or another was definitely right. However, it seems to me absurd to want to sell something that you do not even have, and moreover to want to do this on a speculative basis. It goes against my basic understanding of how one should behave in business. If I do not have the title to something then it is difficult for me to offer it for sale. Whether this is genuinely useful for the market is something that I am not in a position to judge. Perhaps it is – but my instinct suggests it is not. I would therefore suggest that we should deal with it by saying that shares, debt instruments and credit default swaps (CDSs) can only be offered for sale if you either hold the title or – if you do not hold the title – a loan agreement has been concluded or at least an agreement that says that the title will be available the next day or in a certain number of days’ time if the transaction is actually concluded and settled, so that no risk arises. I thought that the Council and Parliament had already agreed on this when they agreed the intraday rule. I regret to say that the Council has since moved away from this position, and I hope that it may find its way back to it. One thing is certain: in the final event, these are international transactions and it is therefore important for us to have very clear supervisory rules. It seems to me that the recently established European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) is the ideal institution to have a sole mandate to intervene in serious cases and to establish what needs to be prohibited, what needs at least to be recorded, where we need a repository, where we need a reporting requirement and so on. In this respect we have an ideal opportunity to use ESMA productively. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for a long time we believed that the internal market and the introduction of a common currency would automatically result in economic convergence and convergence of the Member States, and that the Maastricht criteria were sufficient to ensure discipline. Reality has now caught up with us. The management instruments have proved to be inadequate and in the past they have been grossly transgressed. A single currency and a single monetary policy are not feasible in the long term unless the rules have teeth in the area of fiscal, budgetary, economic and social policy. The EU is now trying a new approach. To speak metaphorically, it has one last shot. If this last shot fails to hit the target, the damage could be severe. The EU could find itself in a regressive phase, we could see the return of renationalisation and protectionism, and the first signs of disintegration in the euro area. The new package attempts to prevent this and to lay a new foundation. I am in favour of this package, even though I consider it rather half-hearted in view of the problems that I have just outlined. There is a risk that the European semester will turn out to be a centralist, bureaucratic exercise. The pact for the euro may possibly be toothless. What we need are binding recommendations from the Commission. What we need are automatic initiatives and sanctions which the Council can only stop by means of reversed qualified majority voting. This is undoubtedly necessary if the disgraceful, opaque wrangles by Council members in back rooms are finally to be brought to an end. What we urgently need is a clear resolution mechanism for the financial sector so that it can work again. Wolf Klinz, 
 rapporteur.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, credit rating agencies certainly did not cause the global financial crisis, but, in my opinion, they were responsible to a significant extent for its severity. When the so-called structured financial products were developed in America on the basis of the subprime mortgages, the credit rating agencies supported this process by rating dozens, if not hundreds, of products each day in an almost conveyor-belt fashion. In so doing, they also accepted conflicts of interests, in that they supported the issuers with advice and help in designing these products. They continued to claim that they were only expressing an opinion, although they knew very well that their ratings were, in fact, being used as a seal of approval. My report deals with numerous deficiencies and puts forward proposals in the hope that the Commission will perhaps be able to include some of them in its legislative proposal that it will be tabling in the autumn. I put forward five proposals. The first is that the reliance on ratings must be reduced. In practice, we have found that the regulatory environment has led to the use of ratings being absolutely essential, by banks, insurance companies, pension funds etc. which invest their money. Basel II made this very clear and, in fact, the credit rating agencies have become regulatory certification bodies. We need to make it possible once again for market operators, particularly institutional investors, which possess their own expertise to actually take responsibility themselves and not outsource the responsibility for investment decisions. It needs to be made clear that investors should only invest if they actually understand the product and cannot use the excuse that they can, to a certain extent, automatically make a triple A product the goal of their investment strategy. Secondly, we must ensure that the information on which credit rating agencies base their decisions is made publicly available, that it is understood, and that the models used are also known. That will lead to transparency and will also make it easier for institutional investors seeking to invest to make their own decisions. It will also help to enable unsolicited ratings to be given. In this connection, we should also consider whether the proposal that the United States is considering is a sensible one, namely, that where only one credit rating agency is chosen by issuers, a second, independent body could be encouraged to give a rating and this second body could be allowed to work on the basis of the information that is publicly available. Thirdly, we need more competition. We have a de facto oligopoly. The three credit rating agencies that exist and operate worldwide control 95% of the global business. They have a so-called monopoly income of 40% return on turnover, and therefore I am proposing that we set up a European credit rating agency. It should be based on a foundation model and the start-up financing should be provided by the finance sector by means of interest-bearing loans. After five years, we will know whether it is working and then this credit rating foundation will also have to pay back the funds that it has received. However, I am sure that there are also other options. It would also make sense to perhaps allow national and regional credit rating agencies to operate in the form of a European network. Fourthly, we still have an outstanding matter with regard to the payment model. Currently, we have an issuer-pays model. That is the model that essentially works throughout the world. Thus, the issuer pays, but clearly there is a conflict of interests here that we could reduce if there was no more advising of issuers and if the staff of the supervisory bodies was genuinely independent. Other possible models include a subscriber-pays model. Here, there is obviously the risk of conflicts of interest as well as of this being an invitation to freeloaders. Therefore, this needs consideration. The third option would be a performance-based payment, in other words, an up-front payment and then the final payment only once it is clear how good the rating is. The last, but important, point is that we must introduce liability. Credit rating agencies must accept responsibility for what they actually do, and therefore I believe that we should make them liable, obviously not for the rating as such, but for failures and negligence in their work. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

Madam President, Mr Barroso, Mr Van Rompuy, listening to you carefully one gets the impression that everything is ship-shape: the euro is secure, we have a new Stability and Growth Pact, we have an ESM and we have a Euro Plus Pact. I would say this quite clearly: ‘While I have heard the message, I am not sure I believe it.’ We should not lose sight of the starting point for all these deliberations and measures, namely the run-away debt of some euro Member States, the loss of competitiveness, economic distortions and, as a consequence, an increasing current account deficit that has to be financed. It is already obvious that many Member States will not be able to meet the conditions of the new Stability and Growth Pact with the best will in the world. The ESM will not help to overcome economic distortions because no one has seriously faced up to the idea that a euro Member State could become insolvent and because the prospect of financial aid from the ESM will lead to further laxity. The so-called stringent regulations will prove to be relatively lightweight in practice. The need for unanimous resolutions is resulting in the horse-trading that was a familiar fixture in the past. Finally, the pact for the euro is much too non-committal to cause destitute countries to implement far-reaching real economic reforms. Overall, therefore, I fear that we will not succeed in eliminating the root cause of the problem. We shall have a permanent overdraft facility whose credit parameters will have to be increased at regular intervals. This will turn into a bottomless pit and the citizens in the states that will have to foot the bill will find themselves duped once again. Public confidence in Europe will decline even further as a result. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, Mr Schulz is right. We are in the midst of a huge crisis of confidence and the members of the Council are pulling the wool over the citizens’ eyes. They are telling them that everything is under control, we just need to make small changes to the treaty by introducing a permanent stability mechanism and then the problem will be resolved. In fact, the situation is not under control. The Member States are reacting rather than actually taking action. They are desperately firefighting, but they cannot put out the flames. The markets are asking themselves: Who is actually in control in Europe and in the euro area? The EU has reached a critical turning point. If we do not choose the right path now, we will not even be able to maintain the status quo. Instead we will take a step backwards. What we need are further moves towards integration. We need more Europe. We must finish establishing the internal market, including the service sector. Alongside the monetary union, we need an economic, budgetary and fiscal union. We also need a strong Commission which has the right and the power to control and monitor this economic union and to impose sanctions automatically, in cases where this is justified. If we take these steps towards more integration, then we can talk about the introduction of eurobonds. Then we will have laid the foundations for them. However, during all of this we must ensure that we have the long-term investment funding that we need, despite all of the justifiable austerity measures, to secure the European Union’s competitive ability in the medium and long term. We must finally tell the citizens the truth. We need solutions without blinkers, we must discuss the issues without bringing in ideologies and we must stop trying to muddle through. What we require is action for the long term, rather than short-term reactions. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in a few weeks’ time, we will have a new supervisory structure in Europe, which has been shaped to a considerable extent by the European Parliament. Among these three new supervisory authorities will be one that is responsible for markets and securities: the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). ESMA will have the last word in connection with the registration and oversight of credit rating agencies and be responsible for ensuring that the credit rating agencies actually comply with the new regulations. If it so wishes, ESMA can delegate this cross-border responsibility to national supervisory authorities if these supervisory authorities are small and only operate nationally. This proposal is therefore nothing more than an adaptation of the regulation of April 2009 to the new circumstances, but it strengthens the role of ESMA. It gives the new supervisory authority more powers and – something that is completely new – it gives ESMA the power to punish non-application of the regulation. I very much welcome this, because I believe that strengthening the position of a new supervisory authority of European mould will genuinely increase its credibility on the market. I just have one point of criticism. When drawing up the regulation in April 2009, we took a political decision with regard to how we should deal with ratings from third countries in Europe. We said at that time that they can be used in Europe if they either comply with the equivalence procedure or are supported by a credit rating agency that is registered and approved in Europe, the so-called endorsement procedure. The Commission has now changed this at level 2 and said that endorsement will no longer be possible. Therefore, only the equivalence procedure actually applies. I consider this – as it was undertaken unilaterally – to be an undemocratic way of going about things, and I believe that we should stick to the decision that we made at the time in April 2009. As the Commissioner also mentioned, there are still a lot of outstanding issues where credit rating agencies are concerned, namely, the lack of competition, insufficient transparency, the business model as to whether the issuer or the investor should pay, which need to be looked at critically. There are questions with regard to the payment system and also with regard to excessive dependency, because in reality, it is the case that, as a result of regulatory provisions, many ratings agencies have become de facto regulatory certification authorities. I am taking this up in the own-initiative report, and I am pleased that the Commission is going to table a legislative proposal on this matter in the next year. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 Madam President, Mr Almunia, we need to bite the bullet now, rather than prolonging the agony. This is what comes to mind when I think about the subject that we are discussing today. I support the Commission proposal to phase out State aid in 2014 for the pits which are not competitive by that date. The cost of each job in the coal mining industry is much higher than the average. This money is not being spent on developing sustainable and competitive employment for the future. Therefore, I believe it is right to phase out state subsidies for uncompetitive mines in 2014. We must invest the money which becomes available in research and development and in education and training. This is the only way in which we can maintain our technological head start and remain competitive in the global economy as a whole. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

Madam President, Mr Trichet, we all know that the main task of the European Central Bank is to ensure monetary stability and that you can best achieve this aim by being politically independent. We have always supported you in this. The crises of the last two years have shown that you have a further task, and that is to ensure the stability of the financial markets and of the financial system. This task, too, you have performed very professionally and convincingly. However, to do so, you have had to accept being yoked together with the governments concerned. In other words, you were not able to act with complete political independence here; instead, you had to work together with the governments. I would be interested to know how exactly you would like to arrange this role in the future to ensure firstly, that you are independent, and secondly, that you can continue to perform this task properly without governments exploiting this opportunity to in fact undermine your independence.

 Mr President, after lengthy rounds of negotiations, Parliament, the Council and the Commission have finally agreed on a joint text for regulating alternative investment fund managers. I welcome this, and I have to correct Mr Goebbels: We wished to send the original proposal back because we believed that the alternative investment funds were so different – hedge funds, private equity funds and property funds – that they each need to be regulated separately. Nevertheless, we now have a text that we can fully accept and support. The all-embracing approach that we found disturbing at first has been amended in respect of key elements. As a result, we no longer have a problem with it. The goal of the directive was to create greater transparency for the supervisory bodies but, above all, for the investors, in order to be able to identify systemic risks in due time and at an early stage and so to be able to deal with them accordingly. Personally, I am in favour of rules that all fund managers operating in the EU have to abide by. At the same time, however, I do not like the idea of us turning Europe into a fortress or even a prison or of European institutions seeking to invest not being able to do so outside Europe. We were therefore initially unable to support the proposal as presented in committee. The compromise that has now been found solves this problem. It promises to keep the markets open. Another reason for our initial rejection was the regulations relating to the area of private equity, which would, in fact, have led to distortions of competition in this area. The requirements for private equity, as they were initially formulated, would have placed even listed companies under a definite disadvantage. The compromise that we now have before us eliminates this shortcoming and it prevents asset stripping, which is something that we expressly welcome. Overall, therefore, we are very pleased with the proposal. It creates clear framework conditions and rules for alternative investment fund managers. It will ensure greater transparency for identifying systemic risks. It will therefore ensure greater stability. It will strengthen the internal market because it introduces the EU passport, which, following a transitional period, will also be introduced for managers outside Europe. It will ensure clear, undistorted competition. Finally, it will establish a clear, new task for the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). To conclude, I would like to thank not only my fellow Members but, above all, the Belgian Presidency, which has brought this matter to a successful conclusion with its untiring efforts.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the height of the financial crisis, the G20 countries promised joint action to stabilise the financial markets. Today, two years later, we are still a long way away from a global answer. In many instances, the measures adopted pursue national interests and considerations. The initial energy has dissipated and all too often we are back to ‘business as usual’. Mervyn King of the Bank of England put it succinctly when he said: ‘The need to act in the collective interest has yet to emerge’. In its interim report, the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis makes it clear that Europe is at a critical crossroads. We need to intensify our integration, we need to harmonise our economic and budgetary policies more, we need European infrastructure projects in the areas of energy, transport and telecommunications. We need a functioning internal market and labour market, and we need the resources required in order to achieve the demanding growth targets set out in the EU 2020 strategy. We need innovative sources of financing if we are to be able to exploit the potential of the SME sector. We need more Community method and less intergovernmentalism. A standstill here is a backward move; it will not preserve the status quo
. The debt crisis in Europe clearly demonstrates that stability and confidence are not achievable without discipline. The proposals made by Commissioner Rehn and by Mr Van Rompuy’s task force are intended to ensure that the Member States act in a disciplined manner. I regret to say that in Luxembourg the other day, the finance ministers cast aside these proposals at the behest of our Franco-German couple – a missed opportunity and a bad day for our citizens, who quite rightly feel betrayed by politics yet again. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if banks have to hold more capital for loans and financial instruments, that increases their ability to bear losses. The most recent proposals from the Basel Committee take this stability-based approach as their basis. Unfortunately, the Basel Committee has not, as yet, satisfactorily addressed the problem of system-relevant banks. I therefore welcome Mr Karas’s call for the requirements for the liquidity standards to be made independent of system-relevance. In other words, appropriately tougher requirements need to apply to banks that, due to their size or interconnectedness with the global financial system, need to be bailed out using taxpayers’ money in crisis situations. We should take a more differentiated approach to the factor of debt leverage. Only when it is empirically proven that this instrument does not lead to arbitrage and distortions of competition and actually counters the overheated granting of loans should we consider permanently incorporating it into the first pillar. There is a need, in any case, for these proposals to be implemented at the global level. We cannot allow the US authorities to have a decisive influence on the Basel proposals only to not then implement them. The G20 summit in Seoul next month will show whether, and to what extent, we can achieve this objective. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 I support the European Union’s initiative to refocus the current remuneration policy on long-term success and more liability for decision makers. However, this must not lead to salary levels being set by politicians. This task should remain the responsibility of the existing structures within the banks, such as the supervisory board and the general meeting. Therefore, the proposed remuneration policy should not replace existing structures, but should supplement them where necessary, ensuring that this helps to improve the quality of financial decision making.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, even the members of the Council realise that the weaknesses of the supervisory system are or were one of the causes of the biggest global financial crisis experienced since the 1930s. They are also aware that national measures alone are not sufficient to deal with the consequences of this crisis, but that we need to look for global, or at least European, solutions. The Council should know that the European Parliament does not want an independent European supervisory structure and systemic risk board to be set up out of dogmatism or stubbornness, but from a deeply-held, cross-party conviction. This is the only way of guaranteeing transparency and protection for investors, based on a uniform regulatory framework and a uniform interpretation and application of this framework. One clear message from the crisis is that we need not less, but greater involvement from Europe in the financial sector; if we do not go forwards, than we will go backwards. Member States should drop the hypocrisy they display when calling for global solutions at G20 meetings and demanding at least European regulations at home, but actually refusing to make any compromise in the trialogues.

 Combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography is vitally important. We must use all our strength to combat the availability of child pornography in communications networks.

 Mr President, Commissioner, rating agencies have played an appalling role in the global financial crisis and in the euro difficulties and are far from deserving of praise. Lack of transparency, conflicts of interest, financing through contracting entities and the publication of ratings at questionable times with a procyclical effect, or shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted, speak for themselves. Rating agencies have been, and continue to be, oblivious to this and do not see these problems. I personally have proposed that the EU should act now and I am pleased that you, too, feel the same. We should establish a European rating agency on the basis of a foundation model. Obviously, this foundation model must be financially independent. It must not be subject to any political interference, either from the European Central Bank, the Commission or any Member States. As an independent foundation, this European agency could become a serious competitor to the oligopoly, or indeed the monopoly, of the three rating agencies we are discussing now. It should be the case that any product offered in Europe and all issuers operating in Europe be required to give two ratings, one of which must come from this European agency. In order to be independent, this foundation must also be financially independent. This means that we need seed-funding that could be provided by the European Investment Bank or perhaps the Commission, and from that point on, this European foundation would have to finance itself. The question of whether such financing should come from contracting authorities or users remains to be clarified. This was raised earlier on by Mr Giegold. We have to reach a decision on this as well. On a general note, we should also consider whether we could restrict our reliance on rating agencies somewhat because it seems to me that we are much too dependent on them at present. Wolf Klinz,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, if I take a little more than four minutes, I will make my concluding remarks shorter so that I do not overrun my six minutes. The Prospectus Directive was originally put together in 2003 with the condition that it be reviewed in September 2009. That has been the case. The Prospectus Directive concerns the completion, approval and publication of prospectuses as a prerequisite for the public offering of securities or their emission into a regulated market within the European Union. In general, the current review concerns technical aspects and is intended to eliminate legal uncertainties and unjustifiably onerous requirements. First of all, I would very much like to thank all the Members who have worked together with us on this, as well as all the shadow rapporteurs. We have had very good cooperation, and that includes with the Commission. Without such good cooperation, we would not actually have been able to see this package through to a successful conclusion at first reading in less than ten months. I would now like to present briefly the agreement we have forged – and this includes the tripartite talks – in the form of eight principal points on which we were able to reach agreement. Firstly, one of our objectives was to facilitate access to capital in the market for small and medium-sized enterprises. You know that in the US, there is a much higher percentage of companies, including SMEs, that obtain finance through the market, whereas in Europe, the common practice, especially amongst small businesses, is to obtain finance through bank loans. What we want to do here is open up the opportunity for small businesses to use the market more often than before. We have therefore raised the threshold for exemption from the threshold requirements, which ultimately saddle SMEs with red tape and costs, from EUR 2.5 million to EUR 5 million. My second point concerns investor protection: we want to make sure that, in the course of such facilitation, we can provide sufficient safeguards to the small private investor. This is why we have raised the threshold for exemption from the prospectus requirements for securities denominated in 50 000 to a denomination of 100 000. The third point I would like to raise concerns the issue of how to enable employees to participate in a company’s share capital without that company needing to bear the relatively high costs of launching a prospectus. So, this is about relaxing the prospectus requirement when offering employee participation programmes. Here, we have introduced a proportionality clause in that we have eliminated the unnecessary disclosure requirement. At the same time, however, we have made sure that we have a document detailing basic information so that those employees who benefit from this form of participation can have an idea about what it is they are getting. We have also made sure that companies listed in a third country, that is, a country outside the European Union, be exempted from the prospectus requirement as well – just like European companies – where they offer their employees shares, on the condition that they are able to prove equivalence with the disclosure requirements. The fourth area we discussed and on which we have reached agreement concerns what is commonly known as a ‘prospectus summary’. You can look at it this way: typically, a prospectus is a thick and voluminous document frequently containing several hundred pages. However, there is also the summary which frequently contains another 50, 60 or 70 pages. What we want Parliament to do is to shorten this to what is known as ‘key investor information’ or a document with essential information for investors of the kind provided by traditional investment funds, the UCITS. The Commission did not, in fact, consider this, wanting merely to ensure that key information really is contained in the summary. We have now agreed that, while keeping the summary in its present form, we should also ensure that it does indeed contain key information which will eventually be set out through directive requirements and a level 2 elaboration. This will help shorten the summary considerably, cutting it down from the current 60, 70 or 80 pages to some 20 or 30, perhaps, and help make it an easy read, especially for the small investor. This is important, because we do not want to leave the small investor out of the picture. Fifthly, the issue of liability: when a prospectus is drawn up, who is it that guarantees the accuracy of the contents? In particular, if an intermediary uses this prospectus, if he makes arbitrary changes to the contents, then the liable party is the intermediary. The prospectus requirement expires either when the offer period has expired or when the trading has begun, whichever is the later date. Seventhly, the review clause: as with the previous one, this directive will also be reviewed in five years’ time. My last point is that, in this document, we have the first piece of legislation that has been brought into line with the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon. Last but not least, allow me to point out that the Chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has managed to ensure that Parliament is given sufficient time. We have three months to respond to the Commission and another extension of three months, if necessary. Having said that, we have undertaken, in the event that all other options fail, to grant early approval, that is, to push this piece of legislation through within the shortest time. This satisfies all parties. Wolf Klinz,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, I will make just a few brief comments. First of all, I wish to thank the Commissioner and all the Members for their friendly comments. I am pleased that you share my views. Our cooperation has actually enabled us to balance out various objectives, namely easier access to capital for SMEs and the removal of administrative hurdles, on the one hand, and improvement and securing of investor protection and making progress in terms of creating a genuine European internal market, on the other. I hope that, when this new version of the Prospectus Directive comes up for review in a few years’ time, we will be able to establish a link between the Prospectus Directive and the Market Abuse and Transparency Directives, and that we might perhaps go so far as to choose, in terms of non-equity securities, not the home market, but another Member State of the European Union as a starting point for emission.

Madam President, I am delighted to be able to welcome Estonia as the 17th member of the euro area from 1 January 2011. Our Baltic neighbour, as previous speakers have already said, is actually one of the very few countries that meet the Maastricht criteria, and indeed with enthusiasm! In the current climate, we can be certain that the Commission, Eurostat and the European Central Bank have looked very closely at everything and made no allowances in their evaluation of the figures. The Council will also take its decision without any political benefit. Ten years after its introduction, the euro is, as we all know, currently facing its greatest test and challenge. It is testimony to an enormous degree of commitment, an unbelievable will and an extraordinary amount of effort that Estonia has succeeded in actually meeting the accession criteria under these circumstances. I believe that it is also evidence of the fact that it wants to meet these criteria as laid down in the Treaty. Estonia knows that, as a Member of the European Union, it is also obliged one day to become a member of the euro area and the fact that it wants to do that so quickly makes me, personally, very happy. It shows that there are still countries that have real confidence in this European project. It is fortunate that the Estonian Government did not have to put this accession decision to the people in a referendum, as we are well aware that citizens are to some extent very concerned. If they follow the media, they will view the euro as a soft currency and the euro area as a transfer union, and they are scared that the introduction of the euro will lead to large price increases. Slovenia and Germany are examples of this, and in Germany it is not without reason that the expensive euro has been referred to using the play on words as the ‘Teuro’ (‘der teure Euro
’ – expensive euro). The fact, then, that all of this is just perceived inflation, as the European Central Bank says, is surely something of an understatement. As a member of the euro area, Estonia will also have to deal with the problems facing the single currency and thus also sign up to the euro area rescue plan. What impact that might have on the budget, we do not know. I would like to ask the Commission to provide some clarity in this regard. I hope Estonia continues its excellent development and I hope that its achievements, particularly with regard to budgetary discipline and combating inflation, will prove to be sustainable in future, too.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European governments are being driven by the markets. At last they are reacting, but they are reacting after the event and not in advance. It is scandalous that the governments and the Commission only react when the real weaknesses appear in the markets. They should have identified these weaknesses themselves at an early stage. When the euro was introduced, we knew that we would not have a single monetary and fiscal policy, as is normally the case in individual states. For this reason, we have taken measures to find a substitute for this, but we have not adhered closely to these measures. The rules were broken very quickly and right at the start, even by the larger Member States. We need another effective set of rules with sanction mechanisms, including a name and shame policy, the loss of voting rights and suspension of payments from the European funds until the fines have been paid. Secondly, it has become clear that there are internal tensions within the euro area which are on the verge of putting its strength to the test and which take the form of differences in competitiveness. The Commission must take action in this area. It must investigate the budgets of the individual Member States to determine whether they represent a risk for the euro area. Of course, we know that the right to draw up a budget is a central right of the national parliaments. However, that is no reason for failing to develop a common European approach. This is urgently needed. We need more Europe and not less Europe. This may well be our last chance. If the Commission and the Council do not negotiate with Parliament, I am afraid that the result will be a major disaster at some point in the future. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from my economic experience I know that strategies are only as good as their specific implementation measures and the means of monitoring them. The Commission is yet to provide an answer in this regard. We listen to the goals, with which we can thoroughly identify, we hear the lofty intentions, but we hear next to nothing about how these goals are to be achieved in concrete terms. I had actually assumed that the financial and economic crisis – the largest we have experienced since the Second World War and which has now deepened on account of the additional problem of the national debt crisis – would have been at the top of the Commission’s list of considerations. In my opinion, that should have been the logical starting point, as both crises have changed the situation significantly. If we do not just stop at lofty intentions but actually want to achieve something in the next ten years then we will have to address a number of points in very concrete terms: Firstly, we need to review our finances – not only in the EU, but in each Member State, according to uniform criteria – so that we know where we really stand, what our financial leeway is and what we can actually afford to do. Secondly, we need to develop a crisis resolution mechanism to prevent us being thrown out of kilter again in the future should there be further storms on the markets. Thirdly, we need to complete the internal market in areas where it is not yet complete – I am expecting a great deal from Mr Monti’s report – including for services. Fourthly, we need to convincingly set out how we are to supplement the common monetary policy with a common, closely interlinked economic and finance policy and even a fiscal policy. Fifthly, we need to set out very specifically how we can replace the divergence that we have observed between the Member States with increasing convergence by concentrating on economic projects that are truly European in nature. There are very many of these: energy policy, energy interconnections, high-speed rail and road networks, navigation systems and many similar projects. Wolf Klinz,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the partnership between the EU and Canada works very well, not only in the area of the economy, but also on questions of foreign policy, such as Iran, Afghanistan, Haiti and other similar cases. Despite this, we are faced with a number of serious challenges. I am sure that we can overcome them, because we have such a close friendship and partnership. I am thinking about five points in particular. Firstly, we must do the job of regulating the financial sector properly. A great deal was promised by the G20 and I believe that it is important for it to be clearly shown at the G20 summit in Toronto, which is hosted by Canada, that the G20 countries are taking concrete measures and not just making promises. My second point has already been mentioned. We have very similar objectives with regard to climate policy. We in Europe can definitely learn from Canada about carbon capture and storage projects and other developments in this sector. We hope to be able to agree on joint standards for reductions. My third point concerns the need for a new trade agreement and I believe that our objectives are very similar in this area as well. I would like to highlight two points where action is needed and where we intend to move closer together, but still remain some distance apart. One of these concerns visa-free travel, which you, Baroness Ashton, have already referred to. I hope that it will be possible to treat ethnic minorities from EU Member States in the same way as all other EU citizens. My last point relates to the passenger data agreement which expired in the autumn of last year. It is de facto still in force, but no longer has a basis in law. We need a new legal basis, so that we can produce a new agreement. This new legal basis must ensure that civil rights are respected. Modern technological opportunities for networking should not be used to make all the information on names, dates of birth, flight details, credit cards, and so on, readily available in such a way that this information can be misused. We hope that we can work together to create a legal basis which corresponds to our European concept of civil rights. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, VAT fraud is not a mere peccadillo. It is a criminal act and a problem which either escalates or diminishes over time. According to the latest estimates, citizens, and thereby taxpayers, lose up to EUR 100 billion every year, perhaps even more. At a time of accelerating public debt and crisis, citizens have no sympathy for the fact that the European Union has so far not been able to tackle this problem successfully. This is why I welcome a fresh attempt to introduce the reverse charge procedure, on which we will be taking a vote the day after tomorrow. What we are trying to do with the reverse charge procedure is effectively eliminate the problem of VAT evasion or at least reduce it. We have to wait and see, however, whether or not this procedure will generate the desired increase in VAT receipts and deter new cases of fraud. However, it is certainly worth the attempt. We will monitor closely the results of the procedure, the application of which is currently limited to 2014, and carry out a critical assessment. However, I would have liked an amendment to one specific point: I am in favour of enterprises which duly discharge their duty of care in the context of a review of their VAT registration numbers, being exempted from any liability, even if the recipient commits fraud. I explicitly regret that my amendment to that effect did not command a majority in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the fast and decisive reaction of the G20 to the global financial crisis. A great deal has happened. The fire appears to have been put out, but the foundations of our financial system are still shaky. The citizens are unsettled. Profits are being ploughed back for the benefit of shareholders and losses are being socialised, that is how the citizens see it. In the meantime, it is back to business as usual for more and more market players, who are making big moves, rather than focusing on what they should really be doing as service providers, namely supporting the real economy. Financial ethics and responsibility appear, as ever, to be foreign words to many of them. I am expecting specific – and fast – measures from the G20. I hope that the EU Member States will all pull together. In addition to new supervisory structures, we also need bigger equity bases, which increase in line with the risk, long-term – not short-term – incentive systems, a coordinated exit strategy from State aid, contained protectionism, congruent regulation, rather than regulation arbitrage, an end to pro-cyclicity and a solution to the ‘too big to fail’ problem and, above all, we must abide by the tried and tested social market economy.Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the democratic structure of the European Union is the subject of much discussion at the moment. The Commission’s report on monitoring the application of EU law makes it clear that this is a complex topic and also involves the Member States. Citizens have a right not only to European legislation being drawn up in accordance with democratic principles, but also to European laws being transposed so they – the citizens – as well as businesses can benefit from them. Member States are also under a democratic obligation in this respect. They are obliged to transpose the legislation. If they fail to fulfil this obligation, they are infringing the European legal order and therefore the rule of law. Observing this rule of law is, however, a necessary condition for the legitimacy of any form of democratic governance. It is a guarantee for citizens that they will be able to benefit from the rights provided for in law. The Commission’s reports show year on year that many Member States frequently flout the transposition deadlines for Directives. As guardian of the Treaties, the Commission is therefore forced to institute costly infringement proceedings, which are embarrassing for the Member States. Here the Commission must keep a particularly close eye on those Member States with very poor transposition records. As Parliament we are also required to do this. Our citizens are turning to us with increasing frequency with petitions and in this way drawing our attention to transposition infringements by Member States. We must therefore make sure that communication between Parliament and the Commission is improved, so that infringements can be identified and remedied as early as possible. We owe it to our citizens!

Mr President, I do not wish to advance any political arguments against the ACAA Protocol, such as the idea that we are rewarding Israel for its human rights violations and sending out the wrong signal. Instead, I shall present some legal arguments. The Protocol states that the territorial competence of the Israeli Responsible Authority for pharmaceuticals, in this instance the Ministry of Health, is to be defined by Israel – in accordance with its own national law, of course. However, under Israel’s national law, the settlements in the West Bank, which are illegal under international law, and the illegally annexed areas of East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights are deemed to be Israeli territory. Due to the absence of any provision to the contrary in the Protocol, the worry is that Israel will extend the jurisdiction of the Responsible Authority to the Occupied Territories as well. When implementing the Protocol, the EU would thus be forced to recognise, for the first time, Israel’s claims to sovereignty over parts of the Occupied Territories. I therefore urge the Members of this House to vote against the ACAA Protocol today. As democratically elected Members of this House, we have an obligation to respect and uphold EU and international law as part of our set of values.  The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the EU because we apply rule-of-law and democratic principles – not only in relation to the EU itself. How can we ... this important ...

Madam President, legal, cross-border online access to orphan works is fundamental to the fostering of our diverse cultural treasures in Europe. The directive to be adopted will finally enable public institutions in Europe – libraries, museums, archives and the like – to dig out orphan works from their cellars, digitise them and thus make them available to the general public. After long and also difficult discussions in Parliament and with the Council, we have found a solution that serves both the individual rights holders’ interest in the reasonable protection of their works and the public interest in the distribution of such works. We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, in particular, insisted that there must be a truly thorough and effective search for the rights holder whose rights are to be protected before a work is published. If the rights holder makes himself/herself known at a later date, he/she should be due at least reasonable compensation. It is also important that we have put a stop to purely commercial use of such works. On the other hand, public institutions, especially in times of tight purse strings, depend on private bodies to assist them with the digitisation. Public-private partnerships are exactly the right approach to take in order to make as many works as possible accessible to the public. It is high time that the European Parliament finally made hitherto unused cultural heritage available to the public. I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, as these negotiations were truly difficult and we had proposed various different ways forward at the outset. I do not share the view of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance that there is, to all intents and purposes, no value in this directive. I take the view that, if that were the case, the review clause makes it possible to overhaul the directive after two years. I am, however, quite sure that digitisation can get under way straight away now, and also that the necessary funds for that are available. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, only simple and comprehensible law is good law. We issue European legislation in the public interest and for the benefit of the citizens. It is therefore essential that European law should be simple, easy-to-understand and accessible to everyone. As European legislators, we need to constantly monitor and optimise our work. That is what our citizens expect of us. It is important that we should have an ever more intensive exchange with the national parliaments in order to give shape to laws and act together as guardians of the principle of subsidiarity. In that way, we can ensure, together, that we really do only legislate at European level what is too much to deal with at national level. Good law making also includes not putting in place regulations that could be at least as well dealt with at national level. Particularly in these difficult times for the European Union, it is absolutely critical that European legislation should be accepted by everyone, including by our national elected representatives. The early warning mechanism established in the Treaty of Lisbon, which many people have labelled a paper tiger, showed its potential power for the first time yesterday. After reprimands about subsidiarity from 18 national parliaments, the Commission decided to withdraw its proposed regulation on collective striking law. There is cause to criticise the fact that there has still been no updating of the existing interinstitutional agreement on better legislation from 2003 to fit in with the Treaty of Lisbon. The Treaty of Lisbon brought in changes in respect of secondary legislation. Given the immense practical importance of such legislation, the agreement needs to be updated. Alexandra Thein,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are about to vote on two technical reports on the European Court of Justice. I would like to make the following non-partisan comments: the European Parliament expressly regrets the fact that the increase in the number of judges at the European Court of Justice, the necessity of which has also been accepted by the Council, has failed simply because the Member States were unable to agree on the Member States from which the extra judges were to be drawn. This is despite the fact that there were several possible solutions on the table. Thus, in procedural terms, we have an absolutely exceptional case here that is almost without precedent in Parliament, as we are about to vote on the proposed regulation and the first part today in order to relieve the Court of Justice of at least some of its workload, while leaving the second part hanging; it will hopefully be possible to bring this more important part to a successful conclusion by summer 2013. On behalf of our citizens and businesses, I once again call on the Member States not to play their usual power games with the third estate and to afford it the respect it deserves. Alexandra Thein,  
rapporteur

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg is overstretched. Tomorrow’s decision may seem technical and non-political at first glance, relating to the internal reorganisation of the three courts that comprise the Court of Justice of the European Union; however there is more to it than that. The European Union has been, and continues to be, invested with more and more powers and responsibilities, most recently through the Treaty of Lisbon. Accordingly, the responsibilities of the Court of Justice of the European Union have also gradually expanded. Thus, the excessive workload cannot be attributed solely to the increasing number of cases – in common with many Member States – quite apart from the accession of 12 new Member States. In fact, the number of cases concluded has lagged behind the number of newly received cases for many years. In this context, it becomes clear that the reform of the internal organisation of the Court of Justice will have a major impact on the functioning or the European Union as a whole and, in the final analysis, on the lives of Europe’s citizens. For this reason it was important for me that all of the participating legislative bodies – including the Court of Justice, which we included in the trilogue negotiations – should cooperate from the start and find practical compromises. We have only partly succeeded in doing this. Let me begin with the part for which we have actually found reasonable compromises, which make the work of the Court more efficient and which will reduce the length of court proceedings. The key points are as follows: the office of Vice-President is to be established at the suggestion of the Court itself. In future, the Vice-President will relieve the President of some of the burden involved in representing and administering the Court and will attend all Grand Chamber sessions. In addition, personnel structures are to be changed in the Chambers and in the Grand Chamber, which is to consist of 15 judges, so that the Presidents of the Chambers with five judges will also have their workload reduced and it will be possible to share the workload of all judges more evenly. The proposals in relation to the Civil Service Tribunal are also easy to explain. This Tribunal has always had seven judges. The small number of judges means that, in the event that a judge is absent, for example, due to lengthy illness, the Tribunal as a whole is seriously impaired in its judicial functions. In order to prevent this, an option is to be established whereby judges can be appointed to this technical tribunal on an interim basis. The judges in question are former members of the Court of Justice and they are to be appointed from a list in a particular order, so as to satisfy the requirements in relation to legally eligible judges. These judges can then replace individual judges should they be unable to fulfil their duties. So much for the positive and rational compromises which we have hammered out together and for which I wish to thank all those involved. As was stated at the outset, however, we have not been able to bring all the necessary proposals to a conclusion. I wish to emphasise clearly that the reason for this lies not with the European Parliament, but with the Council and the national vanity of the individual Member States. It was suggested that the number of judges in the Court of First Instance should be increased by 12, rising from 27 to 39 judges. This is the right decision in view of the increasing workload of the judges, although the precise number of additional judges required might be open to debate. Parliament is certainly convinced that increasing the number of judges will, in the final analysis, contribute to better jurisprudence for individual citizens and businesses alike. From which the Member States the additional judges are drawn should not really matter and appointments should be made solely on the basis of qualifications. After all, the principle of impartiality among judges also applies in the European Union. This, however, is something for the future. We have proposed a fair system for the appointment of judges, with numerous suggestions for how they could be selected. The Member States however, were unwilling and unable to agree to any of these solutions in the Council, which is why we shall not have an agreement to increase the number of judges for the foreseeable future. The motives behind this are purely national in character and cannot be justified in objective terms. I find this extremely unsatisfactory. In the future too it will be necessary to ensure that European jurisprudence follows a reasonable timescale. Our citizens and businesses are entitled to that. Excessively long cases, sometimes lasting over five-and-a-half years, represent a violation of our Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. That is why it is vital that, in view of the present, well-balanced proposals in relation to the selection of additional judges, Member States should finally consider their position and avoid any loss of confidence in the European legal system. Alexandra Thein,

Mr President, I would like to thank all my colleagues and I am particularly pleased that we have cross-group agreement that the number of judges must be increased, as Ms Regner has also indicated how many there will eventually be. This still has to be discussed. The third estate is often neglected because it is unable to make its voice sufficiently heard in politics. It is reticent by nature. It is essentially important, however. Mr Häfner has underlined its importance for the public at large, while Mr Karim has explained its significance for the business community. I hope that the friendship group established by the Council will not only deal with further internal reforms of the Court of Justice of the European Union, particularly because it has already achieved a major reform that has also contributed to a drop in case numbers and concluded cases. It is extremely important that the principle of the separation of powers should be followed here, and the system as a whole must not be overburdened. The work on the two dossiers has shown that some questions remain outstanding and that we must take a closer look at the Court of Justice in our Committee on Legal Affairs when it comes to the issue of divergent opinions, even though these are not required by the Court, or the establishment of special chambers and technical tribunals. A number of questions have arisen during the negotiations and need to be clarified. We were under considerable time pressure because 14 new judges must be appointed in October and I hope that we will have concluded the negotiations on the additional new judges to be appointed before the next appointment of 13 new judges in September 2013. Mr President, as we have saved some time because a number of colleagues have failed to attend, please permit me to present once again the various options for appointing the additional judges. We tabled a cross-group resolution that was never adopted, despite unanimous support, because Parliament changed its Rules of Procedure in the interim. The following proposals are on the table: Firstly, the selection takes place in strict rotation and involves all 27 Member States. The second option: six judges are drawn from the most populous Member States, while the remaining six are drawn from the other 21 Member States in strict rotation. Alternatively: six judges are drawn from the most populous Member States, while the remaining six are drawn from the medium-sized Member States in strict rotation. Yet another option: six judges are drawn from the most populous Member States, while the remaining six are selected using the same system as that used to appoint advocates-general. Another possible interim solution would be to appoint temporary judges for approximately five or six years, as suggested by the Danish Presidency of the Council. Thus, there are plenty of solutions available, but the Council needs to agree. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 I was unable to vote in favour of the Ferreira report because of Amendments 68, 27 and 67. In its proposal to the German Government in autumn 2011, the German Council of Economic Experts demanded clear and strict rules on participation in a debt redemption fund (Amendment 67). Whatever one’s general position on such a debt redemption fund, which was not even foreseen in the Commission proposal, these participation criteria have been greatly watered down in the report that has now been adopted. Moreover, linking the introduction of a debt redemption fund with a road map for eurobonds or stability bonds and the treatment of economic imbalances is unfair and inappropriate.

 Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, as a liberal, I, too, welcome the hearing instigated by the Commission on the future of European company law. This is a key element of a functioning internal market. There are particular problems in respect of the mobility of our enterprises – in other words, the outstanding 14th company law directive on the cross-border transfer of company seats without having to establish a new company. The Commission has been slow in presenting draft legislation because the Member States are unable to agree on a common line, and negotiations are therefore likely to be difficult. Similarly, it is scarcely possible for shareholder rights to be exercised across borders and we are still awaiting harmonised framework conditions in this area. There are also problems with the European private company, where the Member States are again blocking progress, being unable to agree on, among other things, the necessity of cross-border aspects, the level of capital stock and worker codetermination. My final point is that in the current proposed directive on accounting, the Commission has, in my view, made a technical legal error. In principle, the idea of making payment flows from the commodities industry in developing countries transparent is to be welcomed. In terms of legal technicalities, however, this topic does not belong there. If we want to help fight corruption, EU accounting law is not the right place to do it. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, it was only on 8 June that you condemned settlement building in the occupied territories. Today, you referred for the umpteenth time to the fact that settlement building is illegal under the terms of international law. Furthermore, on 14 May, the Council reaffirmed in its conclusions on the peace process the fact that we must maintain the viability of a two-state solution. Therefore, it is incomprehensible that we in the European Parliament are now being asked to vote in favour of the additional protocol to the association agreement with Israel on conformity assessment and acceptance of industrial products (ACAA). I think it is particularly important to make the following point. We have not yet had a clear explanation of the precise way in which products manufactured in the settlements are handled in the agreement between the EU and Israel. These products are still finding their way onto the EU market. Before we conclude any further trade agreements with Israel, we need to resolve this problem. We must investigate whether there are any effective mechanisms for monitoring this which can be introduced and implemented. In the meantime, Israel continues to disregard its obligations under international law. More settlements are being built, enlarged and even relocated as Israel sees fit, while the EU stands helplessly by. A two-state solution is quite literally being buried under the settlements.

 I spoke against the report because two amendments tabled by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe did not receive a majority in plenary.

 Mr President, Mr Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome this discussion about the European corporate governance framework. Normally in the Committee on Legal Affairs, when it comes to own-initiative reports, in other words, non-legislative proposals, we try to bring all the political groups on board by means of compromises. On this occasion we did not succeed and that is a good thing, because in the case of corporate governance there are fundamental differences in the political perspectives of the Social Democrats and the Greens on the one hand and the Liberals, the Christian Democrats and the Conservatives on the other. For example, we believe that the comply-or-explain system is a useful tool in corporate governance. Any deviation from the code of conduct should be justified in an appropriate way and the alternative corporate governance measure that is taken should be described and explained. Calling for binding rules in this area, as the Social Democrats do in their alternative motion for a resolution, involves intervening to an excessive extent in companies’ freedom to do business and this is unacceptable, particularly when it is not dependent on the size of the company. Listed companies, some of which are small organisations, must not be lumped together with non-listed companies and small and medium-sized enterprises, especially given the additional call for sanctions to be imposed whenever there is a well-justified deviation from the code of conduct. This is pure socialism. We cannot simply force companies to accept the German or Austrian codetermination model in the light of the different corporate cultures in other Member States, even if this would perhaps prevent a few unnecessary strikes of the kind that often take place in southern Europe. I would now like to discuss the quotas for women. We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have tabled a far-reaching amendment concerning the representation of women on boards. We are not fully in agreement within our group and we have heard the same thing from speakers from other groups. Nevertheless, I hope that this issue will receive broad support. In future, I would like to see the Commission giving more consideration to the dual structure that we have in Europe and not focusing solely on the system with a single board. Alexandra Thein,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as a member of both the Palestine and Israel delegations, I welcome the fact that Parliament has decided to speak out on these unacceptable Israeli raids on two television stations in Ramallah. I would remind you that Ramallah is located in Zone A of the West Bank, in other words in the small area that the Palestinians are permitted to administer for themselves. This means that there is no legal basis in any agreement for such action by the Israeli authorities, particularly since it was unannounced. In addition to the fact that this action ran contrary to the right of free expression and freedom of information, what we have here is the illegal destruction of Palestinian property by the Israeli occupying powers, something that is stereotypically defended by Israel as necessary on security grounds, which does not make it any less illegal under international law: we witness the destruction of drinking fountains and energy sources, the almost weekly destruction of agricultural land and olive trees, as well as the continuous demolition of hundreds of Palestinian homes, including in Jerusalem itself. What is particularly galling is that the Israeli authorities do not even baulk at the destruction of infrastructural projects financed by the EU or its Member States. According to a recent report in Der Spiegel
 and elsewhere, solar energy systems funded by German taxes are once again being torn down. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Madam President, I welcome the fact that Parliament has taken up the issue of human rights violations in Bahrain. According to the list kept by the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, the number of fatalities since 14 February 2011 is much higher than indicated in the resolution. The number quoted there is 63. The debate is made all the more important by the fact that a large number of Member States were very quiet and indecisive about the events in Bahrain, when they actually should have made their voices heard. If one compares the way the Member States reacted to the very first killings in Syria, then it is apparent that the response was quite different. In the final analysis, this is what leads me to hope that the standards applied in the European Parliament at least will be the same, whatever country is under consideration. We cannot use a different yardstick here simply because Bahrain is the location of a US naval base rather than a Russian one, because it receives supplies of US weapons rather than Russian ones and because our trade relations with the country are better than with Syria. The same standards need to apply in Bahrain and in all the countries of the Arab world when it comes to compliance with human rights. Alexandra Thein,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are in the process of re-regulating succession and family law in respect of which law is to be applied, which courts have competence and the recognition and enforcement of judgments from other countries. We have done so already in respect of the arrangement of child support and divorce law. Tomorrow we will be voting on the law of succession, and marital property law will follow. As Mr Lehne has already said, in the plenary today we are not discussing any old abstract political issues. Instead, we are helping our citizens in a quite tangible way to solve what are currently in some ways irresolvable problems. In the worst case scenario it can happen in a cross-border succession case that the heirs appeal to the highest instance of the courts in different Member States, spend a great deal of time and money and that there are then two contradicting decisions because each of the courts applies the law in that Member State. The aim is for such situations to be avoided in future. We are on the verge of a change of system when it comes to succession law. In future, the entire succession will be in the competence of the courts of the Member State in the territory of which the bequeather was habitually resident at the time of their death. This is because we are working on the basis that people have a stronger relationship with the country in which they reside. However, someone who, by way of example, as a German permanently resident in Strasbourg, regards him- or herself as having a closer connection with Germany, can choose to have German law apply to their succession. In order to avoid a French court having to apply complicated German succession law, there is, in such circumstances, also a provision for the succession to be brought before a German probate court. Meanwhile, those who like to winter in Mallorca need have no fear either, as, wherever you go on holiday, it does not constitute habitual residence in the country in which you holiday. Furthermore, this regulation will not affect inheritance tax. Denmark, the United Kingdom and Ireland, as we have heard, will not initially be involved as a result of their opt-outs. That is a shame, as so many Britons, in particular, have holiday homes in southern Europe and these would then also be subject to the common law and not, as up to now, to the law of the Member State in which the land is located. A major information campaign will be necessary. I would also like to thank Mr Lechner once again for his comprehensive work and for the solution that he reached. His work shows how important it is that this Parliament should contain not only career politicians but also professionals from other walks of life. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, I welcome the fact that trading relations are to be established with a view to creating a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area in response to the Arab Spring, and that the over 100 bilateral protocols are to be brought together in a single regional agreement. I would, however, like to draw attention to one critical point, namely, products that purportedly originate from Israel. There have been some serious flaws in the implementation of the association agreement between the EU and Israel concluded in 1995. We in this House are all aware of this. I recently drew attention to precisely this flaw in a written question to the Commission. We know from several sources, including our customs authorities, that Israeli settlers have intentionally falsely labelled goods produced in the occupied Palestinian territories, including fruit and vegetables, also issuing these goods with falsified certificates, declaring the country of origin of these products to be Israel. This was in order for this produce to gain access to the EU’s single market at preferential conditions, including lower tax rates. We cannot have a situation whereby this new agreement will also be misused in further extending this illegal practice. Mr Barnier, I believe it is extremely important that the aforementioned list of the designations of origin of the various Palestinian villages and towns should be published. Our delegation has long been of the view that this list should not be kept secret, but should be published in the interests of greater transparency and clarity and to help restrict abuses.

– The FDP Delegation abstained in today’s vote on the motion for a resolution on the feasibility of introducing stability bonds. We believe that the introduction of Eurobonds would set the wrong incentives. Since the introduction of the euro, low interest rates have led to a substantial increase in debt levels in many euro area countries. Eurobonds would take the pressure off highly indebted euro area Member States to consolidate their budgets and introduce much needed structural reforms. Therefore, we believe that Eurobonds would aggravate, rather than alleviate the current crisis. However, we did not vote against the resolution as many of our concerns have been taken on board by the rapporteur. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

Mr President, Commissioner, in 2009 the European Parliament resolved to set up a European Observatory on Counterfeiting and Piracy in order to capture reliable objective data on the actual number of counterfeit and imitation products, rather than being solely reliant on the data made available by producers and the trade. The Observatory, which in the end only commenced operations in 2010, was a complete success. It has become a centre of excellence, collecting information and data on all the counterfeit products – such as drugs, toys and car parts – that threaten the lives and health of our citizens. This Observatory, which was co-managed by the Commission – the bottom line is that it was actually only co-managed – now needs to be restructured, and given additional human and other resources to deal with the increase in its tasks. To bring this about, we have decided – for reasons of costs and efficiency – not to establish a new agency, but to utilise an existing agency and, in effect, to transfer the Observatory’s tasks to the existing agency, the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market in Alicante. This agency in fact employs 650 people, and they are already responsible for the registration of Community trade marks and designs. May I therefore explicitly repeat to the Member from the United Kingdom – who has, unfortunately, already left – that this Office is therefore able to work on a cost-neutral basis, because it finances itself from the fees received for the said trade marks; in other words, we are merely imposing additional tasks on an existing agency and are benefiting from the agreement on fees. I would also like to repeat that analysis of the problem of data theft is mentioned only in the recitals, and that it is stated there that the Observatory will primarily deal with counterfeiting and product piracy.

 The obvious answer to that question is yes. I think that was the point of the question. I find it genuinely regrettable that comments are made here without any detailed knowledge of the facts. I, too, come from a liberal party that is extremely concerned about costs and efficiency, and naturally I hope that the people working there are performing their duties properly. Above all, however, I hope that this agency will continue to work on a cost-neutral basis by continuing to finance itself from fees and requiring no subsidies of any kind. Alexandra Thein,

Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, the interconnection of companies and commercial registers is a further milestone along the way to creating a European area of law. I am pleased that this matter, which is so important for our small and medium-sized enterprises in particular, and which I advocated and promised to work for during my electoral campaign, has now – following trialogue negotiations – been successfully incorporated into a directive. There are two aspects to this. Firstly, it gives citizens and companies easier cross-border access to commercial registers. Until now, if you wanted to access, say, a Greek commercial register, you had to instruct a Greek lawyer – who of course also had to speak your language, or at least a language that you had in common. The end result was extra costs and wasted time. This should now be able to take place via a platform. What is special about this platform is that I can make an enquiry in my own language and get an answer in my own language. Secondly, the commercial registers will now cooperate in a more institutionalised way, rather than on a voluntary basis as they have until now. Moreover, I regret to say that in the past one could not always rely on the entries in commercial registers of other Member States, particularly where the registration of branches in other Member States was concerned. We have now incorporated a requirement stating that, in future, entries must be made without delay or at latest within 21 days – provided, of course, that the conditions are met. Every company and every branch is to be given an identifier. The existing national commercial registers are not just kept only in their national language, but they also differ in many respects de facto
 and de jure
; for example, as regards their legal significance and the reliability of the data recorded. The directive aims only to interconnect the national registers in technical terms, not to harmonise the national systems. Nonetheless, for practical business life it is an extremely helpful measure that will encourage further integration of the internal market and will improve legal clarity and legal certainty for companies and citizens. I hope that the considerable technical work and software work that will be required for this can be achieved on time, by the year 2014. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

I abstained from voting on paragraph 6 of the motion for a resolution on the meeting of the European Council of 30 January 2012, calling for a road map for the introduction of stability bonds. I believe that such a road map would be wrong at present because it would simply ‘reward’ the excessive indebtedness of some Member States and lead to the morally unjustifiable joint and several liability of other Member States. Naturally, in the distant future, the euro area is interested in a joint liquid bond market as an alternative to the market for US dollar bonds, making the euro an internationally secure currency and replacing the dollar in this respect. The right conditions for such a move are still very far off, because, at present, some southern European Member States have no understanding of reasonable budgetary, fiscal and stability policies.

 The representatives of the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament will vote in favour of the Hübner report on amending COM(2011)0482
 only on condition that, when raising the applicable cofinancing rates by ten percentage points, there is an exception for those Member States explicitly affected. This exception must not be able to act as a precedent in any way and should be revoked in respect of the Member States in question once the severe financial and economic crisis and its liquidity squeezes have been overcome.

Madam President, securing better access to justice is one of the main objectives of the European Union’s policy of creating an area of freedom, security and justice. In a modern, globalised and digital economy, the confidence of the citizens in justice is a crucial factor. The Mediation Directive represents a milestone in this connection. Now, every judge in the EU has the opportunity to ensure, in every phase of the process, that two parties to a dispute voluntarily and on their own responsibility strive, with the assistance of a mediator, to settle their differences amicably. The directive ensures that utilisation of the mediation process will prevent the expiry of limitation and prescription periods. Moreover, the agreements reached as a result of limitation and prescription could be given the status of enforceable official documents. Also important are sound training of the mediators in the field of quality assurance and the strengthening of citizens’ trust in this system. Most Member States announced transposition after the deadline for transposition had already passed. However, it is not only the fact that transposition takes place that is important – how transposition is effected is the most important thing. To that end, specialists and legal practitioners must be consulted in order to ensure the greatest possible improvement of the directive. Alexandra Thein,

 Madam President, Mr Duff, first and foremost, on behalf of our group I would like to thank you most sincerely for the many years of work that you have put into this project and for the energy and enthusiasm with which you are trying to persuade us to support it. We all know that we will have to get to this stage at some point. You, yourself, asked earlier on whether now is the right time. I think that, first of all, we really must adopt a report in September. We all know that it will still probably take years, perhaps even decades, until this is actually implemented. However, if we do not start now, we might not even succeed in putting it in place in the next few decades, either. Personally, I would like to still be around to see us become a real Parliament with a single transnational list, because even the German Federal Constitutional Court has called for this and observed that we will only have true legitimacy if we are able to be elected by any citizen of the Union. However, in order to still reach a compromise, I would recommend that – in order to accommodate the small States – we extend the group of people who are allowed to stand as candidates on the transnational list slightly, perhaps to 10%. Our group Chair, Mr Verhofstadt, mentioned this somewhat light-heartedly in his speech yesterday. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 The German Free Democratic Party delegation in the European Parliament assumes that the inclusion of Romania and Bulgaria in the Schengen area will further improve freedom of movement within the EU. Now that both Member States have achieved positive evaluation results in all areas of the Schengen review, there should be no more obstacles to delay inclusion further. There is no denying that technically securing borders will not automatically make them secure as long as problems persist in combating corruption in the justice and policing system. However, this challenge also concerns Member States already in the Schengen area. For this reason, the German Free Democratic Party delegation believes that criteria such as the fight against corruption must receive greater attention when evaluating the Schengen mechanism, and any misdemeanours must be punished appropriately.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it will be an important step in the right direction when we vote on the transparency register tomorrow, but no doubt this will not be the last word on the matter. Firstly, I am pleased that we have chosen a new name for the lobby register of the European Parliament, which dates back to 1996 and which is now to be known as the transparency register. I find it regrettable to see who will be required to register in order to obtain a one-year building pass – the list includes public institutions and bodies. As I have stated before, I can understand why it is necessary for a law society to register, but I find it harder to understand why public bodies which have never been active on a party-political level, and never will be, are also required to register. In the final analysis, irrespective of all the transparency achieved, it all comes down to the moral compass of each Member of this House, as this dictates what he thinks is right, whom he meets and whom he decides not to meet, whom he listens to and whom he decides not to listen to. After all, people also contact us using many other different communication channels. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, very few of our citizens are aware of the existence of European parties and foundations. Until now these have simply been umbrella organisations for their national member parties, established according to national laws, mainly Belgian laws in this case. What is it that these European parties do? They discuss European issues, hold party conferences and play an indispensable role in reforming the European Parliament’s electoral system. According to the Treaty of Lisbon, they are required to help establish European democracy – a political forum at European level. The own-initiative report to be voted on tomorrow calls on the Commission to reform the legal basis for these European parties. In future, these parties will be based on a European legal statute and will have a European legal personality. As liberals, we have campaigned to ensure that a clear distinction is made between recognition as a European party and an entitlement to funding, as there was a certain greed in evidence. It is also important that European parties should follow democratic principles in their internal workings, something that cannot be taken for granted. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 In the vote on the Lange report, I am abstaining on paragraph 31 because of the ambiguous wording of the vote, which refers to Eurobonds as well as project bonds. However, taking it as a whole, I am voting for the report, as I have nothing against project bonds in themselves. Project bonds serve as finance for extensive innovation, infrastructure and reindustrialisation projects. This is not a question of instruments for the communitarisation of debts, as would be the case with Eurobonds. Alexandra Thein,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we will pass our third resolution against the criminalisation of homosexuality in Uganda. Within a short space of time gay people have been declared fair game in Uganda. Even children or minors are affected. This is all due to the irresponsible actions of a US-based Christian sect and the call by local newspaper Rolling Stone for a hundred people whom it named as being gay to be hanged. Now David Kato – one such person publicly named as being gay – has been hammered to a pulp on a public street; this is, in fact, what we were hoping to prevent with our last resolution. We call on Uganda firstly to hold an independent investigation into the murder of David Kato and not to arrest just anybody for the crime. Further, we call on Uganda to prosecute those who call for the public murder of gay people. We also call on Uganda to revise its legislation. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I come from Berlin, and the whole world rejoiced with us Berliners when the border in our city fell and the borders opened everywhere in Eastern Europe. Now, in the case of Egypt, we reacted too late, too cautiously and, above all, too unemotionally. Where was our joy? Every other word from us was simply about ‘maintaining stability’. However, freedom is the most important thing for every person in the world. We Germans in particular know what we are talking about. What we had in Egypt was not stability; it was oppression. Freedom and stability can go hand in hand any time. Therefore, we should not dictate to the Egyptians who they should elect. Provided the elections proceed in a fair and democratic way, we will have to recognise the result and must not be so arrogant – as we were at the time in Palestine or even in Algeria – as to decide whether or not we will recognise those who are elected. We must recognise the choice that is made. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 In overall terms, the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament supports the waste disposal directive. However, the subject of photovoltaic modules remains a problem. There is no understandable reason for excluding the solar industry from the regulations. We have a wide range of legislation governing waste streams. Therefore, it is not clear why a complete industry, which is expected to produce significant waste streams, is being excluded, particularly as the solar industry is likely to be responsible for a large amount of waste in the near future, when the first solar cells installed on large numbers on European roofs have to be replaced. Solar cells may contain toxic substances which can be reused. For this reason, I have abstained from voting on the report. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, today we are discussing a motion for a resolution on the situation of Christians throughout the world in relation to freedom of religion. The European Parliament supports fundamental freedoms and human rights all over the world. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is one of the driving forces behind this support and this distinguishes us from the conservatives who are focusing specifically on the situation of Christians. In general terms, this is not just about the position of Christians. From a liberal perspective, this concerns freedom of religion as a whole. By this I mean all the religions throughout our entire world. It is about protection for religious minorities and the obligation of every state to protect to the best of its ability the members of those religious minorities which are under threat. We also have problems in Europe. I come from Berlin, and there alone, we have had six arson attacks against mosques within the space of six months, fortunately not resulting in any deaths, following the uproar sparked by a social-democratic former central banker. However, the German state is attempting to provide the best possible protection for religious buildings. In the same way, Egypt is also increasing the measures it is taking following the second major terrorist attack against Christians. Of course, we cannot have a policeman standing in front of every church, mosque or synagogue. I very much regret the fact that in many countries, including my own, Jewish buildings have come to look like high-security institutions. For this reason, it is important that we as politicians take responsibility for the attitude to religious minorities in our countries and that we promote an open, friendly approach to all religions.

 Madam President, Commissioner, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union ban discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union and Article 19 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union oblige the bodies of the EU and all the Member States to fight discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. Lithuania is a Member State of the EU and has thus undertaken to share these common values of the 500 million citizens of the Union. Firstly, I welcome the fact that following our first resolution in 2009, the planned act entered into force in Lithuania in a less severe form and that we have not yet become aware of any instance of this law having been applied, and that its application in respect of the ban on the Christopher Street Day Parade failed and the parade took place. I am all the more astonished, therefore, that new legislative measures are now being proposed under which speaking publicly about or providing information on homosexual relations could effectively result in fines of up to EUR 2 900 and there will no longer be equal opportunities for homosexual people – but at least for women. I therefore welcome the Commission’s strategy to combat homophobia and would particularly like to thank Commissioner Reding for emphasising the importance of protecting these fundamental rights through her attendance here in plenary when the time is nearly midnight.

 Mr President, only recently, we held an international workshop in the large plenary chamber of our Parliamentary building in Brussels on Parental Responsibility and the Protection of Children, which I had the honour of leading. In Europe, there are more and more vulnerable and abandoned children who should not be living permanently in orphanages. It is therefore our duty as legislators to strengthen the right to international adoption within the EU in order to help these children. Article 24 of our Charter of Fundamental Rights also demands this when it states: ‘Children shall have the right to such protection and care as is necessary for their wellbeing’. Although we have the Hague Adoption Convention and a Council of Europe convention, these are not enough. In practice, major legal problems still arise in connection with international adoptions. In these cases, only international regulations which eliminate the differences in national regulations that still exist and replace them with clear and simple principles can help. In this regard, and with all our legislative zeal, we must not lose sight of the fact that the EU must cooperate with the Hague Conference on International Private Law in order to ensure a coordinated procedure. Thus, the EU should not reinvent the wheel in this area. I welcome the Commissioner’s statements in this regard. Alexandra Thein,

 Mr President, the United Nations Convention on Human Rights, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as well as the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, ban discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. The European Union not only has obligations in relation to human rights within its territory, but also an international duty to insist on compliance with these rights and to criticise abuses when dealing with third countries, particularly when we provide financial support through the European Development Fund to third countries like Uganda, which have entered into partnership agreements with us. Accordingly, we actually have the right to comment when these third countries fail to meet the human rights requirements set down in such partnership agreements. Hence, Uganda must respect international human rights standards because it was party to the Cotonou Agreement, which sets down our organised development aid to the ACP countries. Just one year ago, we called on Uganda not to follow through on its plans for a law to criminalise homosexuals. One year on, the situation has deteriorated. There is still the threat of long prison sentences or even the death penalty. With others, I myself demonstrated in front of the Ugandan Embassy in May of this year. This had no effect. We wish to emphasise once again that the EU is generally opposed to the death penalty and to homophobic legislation of this kind. Alexandra Thein,

 Mr President, what is meant by better lawmaking? We want to make simple and transparent laws that EU citizens and companies can understand. In this regard, it is important, above all, to respect the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. We want to regulate at European level only what cannot be regulated at national or local level. An important element of better lawmaking is, above all, having a clear idea of the impact of the planned regulations. Only with this can we achieve the best possible effects and, at the same time, keep any negative impact to a minimum. The impact assessment must therefore be prepared by the Commission with the greatest possible meticulousness. It is right, therefore, that, under pressure from the European Parliament, an independent board was set up to monitor the quality of impact assessments. However, this board is intended to be accountable to the European Parliament. For companies, authorities and citizens, the regulations are associated with costs, whether it is in relation to providing information, labelling products or complying with monitoring obligations. If the costs are too high, it cancels out the benefit of a policy. We therefore have the ambitious goal, which is also the right one, of reducing administrative costs by reducing red tape by 25% by 2012. To achieve this goal we need to act at European level, and the chances of achieving it are good. However, at this point it should also be mentioned that a good third – some people say two thirds – of the administrative burden that is derived from the EU is due to the fact that the Member States simply enact too many unnecessary administrative and bureaucratic regulations when transposing EU law. EU bodies and Member States should therefore actively work together to prevent unnecessary red tape. The transposition of Community law must also be fundamentally and actively scrutinised. Above all, the national parliaments should also fulfil their obligation for involvement in accordance with the Treaty of Lisbon. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Israel for taking seriously the many concerns about its proposed legislation and for at least watering down the provisions slightly. Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have, for many years, been required to disclose their sources of funding in a completely transparent way and even to publish this information on their websites. The planned legislation, even in its watered-down form, is ultimately aimed only at specific NGOs: firstly at human rights organisations and secondly at those which receive public funding. This includes, for example, public money from the United Nations or the European Union. In contrast, far-right groups or non-governmental organisations which are privately funded and which, for example, support the building of illegal settlements, are not subject to any legal restrictions and do not have to make their funding sources public. The problem with the proposed legislation lies in this unequal treatment. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, firstly I want to reject the numerous accusations from outside and, in some cases, from within Parliament, claiming that we are discussing this subject at the wrong time, after the peace talks have begun. The parliamentary question which I helped to draw up was tabled at a time when none of us thought that direct peace talks would start up again. I have been involved in this area since the early 1990s and this subject has been under discussion in Parliament for a long time. This is ultimately all about preventing the Lower Jordan River from finally running dry. The lower part of the river has already been reduced to a mere trickle. It consists only of waste water and contains no fresh water at all. All the scientists are agreed that the Lower Jordan River will be as good as dead in one or two years. I find it disturbing that the resolution addresses Israel, Jordan, Syria and the Palestinian Authority on equal terms. The Lower Jordan River area is located entirely in zone C, which means that the Palestinian Authority does not even have a right to access the area, never mind any administrative rights or any influence at all over it. It has already been said that the Palestinian Authority can do nothing in this area. Therefore, this resolution should be aimed at other countries. When a country, in this case Israel, uses 75% of the water available in the Lower Jordan River, although part of the water has already been taken by other countries, and leaves almost no water for the Palestinians to live on, this is a political issue. This problem was supposedly resolved in the Oslo II Agreement and we have not made any progress since then. The specific difficulty at the moment is that the Palestinians are constantly attempting to drill wells, which are immediately destroyed, and also that the Israeli water authority, which is a monopoly, is not drilling wells for the Palestinians, but only for the illegal settlements.

Madam President, Commissioner, the financial crisis has highlighted that a uniform financial supervisory authority is an absolute necessity for the European Union. The three EU-wide supervisory authorities which are envisaged for banking, insurance and securities should thereby be provided with the right to intervene directly in national institutions, such as Deutsche Bank. These intervention rights are restricted to absolutely exceptional cases and will hopefully never be used. As a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I regret that the committee responsible has not given any consideration to our constitutional objections regarding the envisaged intervention rights, both at European and national level, especially in the wake of the Lisbon judgment of the German Federal Constitutional Court. A recommendation from the Committee on Legal Affairs, whereby the Commission, as guardian of the treaties, would act as the final decision-making authority within the framework of a set procedure, or, in other words, have the last say, was not followed. On this point, the Committee on Legal Affairs recognises that the technical expertise required to make judgments is indisputably available in the national and European supervisory authorities and not in the Commission. I hope that during the current negotiations, too, a solution will also be found to this constitutional problem. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

Along with the majority of Members in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I have decided to vote in favour of the Sommer report. It is true that the Liberals were not able to achieve their goals in every area. The adoption of origin labelling for meat and milk in processed products is a regrettable move, because it imposes significant costs on producers and seems almost impossible to implement in practice. However, for me, the positive results of the vote outweigh the negative ones. For the first time, we have uniform regulations on food labelling throughout the entire internal market, with no possibility of individual countries going it alone. In addition, one of the decisive successes of this vote for me is the fact that the misleading traffic light model was rejected. A mandatory colour coded nutrient declaration will not be permitted either at a European or a national level. Uniform Europe-wide labelling rules will bring clear advantages for companies and consumers. The cost of manufacturing and selling products will fall because manufacturers will only have to follow a single regulation. Consumers will benefit from uniform nutrient labelling when comparing products that come from within Europe. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mr Vice-President, our plenary sessions are public and this gives a very poor impression. I would like to add my voice to what has been said. I am not asking for an email; instead I would actually like it to be officially presented and explained on Parliament’s website, because one statement at least must be incorrect. 168 cannot have been the threshold. If 621 votes were cast, then the threshold must have been 310 – if I have understood things correctly. I would therefore ask for a written explanation on the website so that every citizen can also understand it. In view of the large number of people who were watching, we have really given an extremely poor public impression. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography is vitally important. We must make every effort to prevent child pornography being made available over the Internet.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the security and law enforcement authorities are working ever closer together to improve the cross-border prosecution of crimes in order to protect the safety of citizens in the European Union. In this regard, I could mention the European Arrest Warrant, for example. In return, however, the fundamental rights of citizens accused of crimes are being left out of the legislation. Up to now, all attempts to secure the guarantees afforded by the rule of law in criminal proceedings throughout the EU have failed to achieve the requisite unanimity in the Council or to receive mutual recognition. With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, we now have new opportunities for protecting the basic procedural rights of citizens in criminal proceedings. Now, for the first time, the European Parliament has the power of codecision, and only a qualified majority is now required in the Council. As you know, we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are in favour of protecting and continuing to extend citizens’ rights. Therefore, we have also worked to ensure that, in future, all EU citizens will have the right to an interpreter and to a written translation if they are arrested by the police or brought before a court as an accused person in a Member State whose language they do not speak or understand. It is vital not only that criminal proceedings be better coordinated across borders, but also that the rights of citizens in criminal investigations and proceedings – for example, the right to a fair trial – be adequately available to citizens throughout Europe.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I simply cannot understand how anyone can be against freeing micro-entities – and I stress micro-entities, not small or medium-sized businesses – from annual accounting obligations. Here we are not talking about the export-oriented medium-sized company from Baden-Württemberg with a hundred employees, but small craft enterprises, the flower shop, the baker around the corner, the newly founded IT start-up business. For years, politicians have been repeating over and over, both at national and European level, that precisely these micro-entities must be relieved. Relieved from unnecessary costs, in this case, unnecessary costs for a tax advisor, not from the otherwise essential costs – in Belgium it is lawyers who complete these annual accounts, in France auditors – and relieved from an unnecessary amount of work and administrative burdens, now more than ever in the current financial and economic crisis. Now that the Commission has finally tabled the proposal, which Parliament has called on it to do for so long, all of a sudden, the sceptics and nay-sayers express concerns. Only seven per cent of the micro-entities that we are talking about are involved in cross-border activities. Therefore, with regard to the principle of subsidiarity, there should not be any regulation at all at European level. To make matters worse, the accounting rules have continued to be oriented towards the needs of large and medium-sized businesses, and have been totally inappropriate for the micro-entities we are talking about here from the outset. I hear the arguments of the opposition, firstly, that the micro-entrepreneur might need a loan and then not be able to present his bank with anything. I say to you, anyone who is familiar with Basel II knows that for the bank, the annual balance sheet is at best a nice bonus, but nothing more. Secondly, the supposed creditor protection: creditors who depend on the annual balance sheet are in the minority. In all my time as a lawyer, when a business of this size is sold, I have never experienced a buyer depending on the significance of annual accounts in whatever form. Thirdly, the southern Member States of the European Union – yes, precisely those that right now are the subject of constant inglorious reports in our newspapers – want to maintain the old regulation. They can do this as the regulation is optional. However, states that demand annual financial statements from micro-enterprises because they do not have effective tax administration and exercise no control, apart from the receipt of the annual financial statement, should hardly be surprised if they have missing tax revenue or tax fraud. I therefore call on all MEPs, in particular, the Social Democrats, to approve this sensible regulation, especially as Mr Lehne from our Committee on Legal Affairs took all concerns into account through compromise regulations, subsequent to which no further relevant arguments were put forward.

According to the resolution of the European Parliament on the draft general budget for the financial year 2010, adopted on 17 December 2009, a vote was taken today on the amending budget for the European Parliament, following the revised calculations made by the Parliamentary administration. The FDP in the European Parliament abstained, because there was a paragraph in the package of amendments concerned that we could not reconcile with our convictions. The FDP had already expressed its opposition to an increase in the secretarial allowance to EUR 1 500 during the discussions in committee. It is out of the secretarial allowance that MEPs’ assistants are paid. The FDP considers that the argument that more money is needed due to the additional work that MEPs have to do with the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is unsound, as there is nothing in past experience to support this. Certainly, due to the Treaty of Lisbon, which has just come into force, Parliament will overall need extra capacity for legislative work, but with the introduction of the Assistants’ Statute from the beginning of the current parliamentary term, there is still no proof that MEPs actually need more assistants. For this reason, there are grounds for concern that further demands and supplementary increases, or an extension of office capacity, will follow. For this reason, the FDP in the European Parliament abstained. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, neither party to the conflict has so far met the demands of the United Nations for a credible and independent investigation into the accusations of the Goldstone report. This is regrettable, particularly on Israel’s part, because, however controversial the Goldstone report might be, any state that calls itself a democratic state based on the rule of law is obliged to allow such serious accusations to be subjected to an independent investigation. An internal military investigation by the Israeli army, which is itself under suspicion, is not sufficient. If the EU takes its own principles of respect for human rights and international law seriously, it must increase the pressure on both sides, including in the context of its bilateral relations, and insist that the investigation that has been called for into possible violations of international and humanitarian law is carried out according to the principles of the rule of law. War crimes must be punished under international law, as has been said here many times. If necessary, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court will have to carry out the investigations on the basis of Article 12(3) of the Rome Statute. However, irrespective of the Goldstone report, there is currently no reason to continue the siege on Gaza. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mrs Malmström, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I am a member of the delegation for relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council, in other words, the Palestinian parliament. Last week, our delegation was refused entry to Gaza by Israel. The situation in Gaza is very disturbing, particularly now that winter has come. Only 10% of the population can obtain the supplies they need by smuggling goods through the tunnels and this is exactly why the tunnels are tolerated by everyone. Before operation ‘Cast Lead’ the situation was exactly the reverse and 90% of the population of Gaza could take care of themselves. As an occupying power, Israel should be responsible for providing for the population in all the occupied areas. Israel is shirking its responsibility under international law, which means that the international community and, above all, the EU have to step in. If we are supplying food to 90% of the population of Gaza, we have a right to see where European taxpayers’ money is being spent, whether it is being used appropriately and whether it is reaching the people who need it.

 The German Free Democratic Party members of the European Parliament have abstained from voting on the Copenhagen resolution for the following reasons. The resolution contains statements about financing for climate protection measures in third countries without defining the specific criteria or purpose of the financing. We cannot justify this to taxpayers. In addition, we believe that blanket criticism of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) is wrong. The ICAO is the organisation which deals with aviation matters at an international level. Both the criticism and the statement about the alleged failure of ICAO negotiations are incorrect and inappropriate. The call for specific arrangements for a CO2
 trading system for the aviation industry goes against current EU legislation and overburdens the EU’s negotiating position in an international climate agreement with unrealistic demands. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

I voted for the Protocol as I believe that it will benefit the European Union. The Protocol is not the right instrument to address the issue of human rights abuses. Such considerations should be included in the human rights clause of the agreement itself. It is sufficiently clear that Israeli settlements in Palestinian territories should not profit from this Protocol. The Protocol does not imply recognition of these settlements under international law. Britta Reimers,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we now have three years of discussions and negotiations under our belts in a process that occasionally stalled and sometimes got quite tough. We set ourselves the goal of simplifying the quality systems, ensuring the reliability of quality and also establishing a way to get better prices for farmers. We did not succeed in controlling marketing standards or the regulation of supply. We now intend doing this in the common organisation of the markets. Overall, however, it must said that we have taken a first step towards a uniform quality policy. The long time spent in negotiations also shows how much we have struggled among ourselves to reach an agreement and that it is not always easy to make progress at first reading. The agreement has now also been confirmed by the Council. Speaking on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I have no choice other than to support the compromise before us and to ask you to support the amendments. We have failed to achieve a lot of what we wanted. The ALDE Group was not happy with the introduction of another new quality characteristic like the mountain products, however when one considers what has been achieved overall as a package, then we can support this. I think our colleagues will also be satisfied with this. Britta Reimers,

 Mr President, Ms Reding, ladies and gentlemen, the last reform of the sugar regime was a very positive development and the industry adapted to the market as a result. However, the complaints from all sides show that we need to go further and that we must continue to develop the sugar market, because the Commission’s forecasts were not accurate. The African, Caribbean and Pacific States have not been supplying Europe with sugar. Instead, they have sold it to other countries, because markets all over the world have changed. They have undergone huge changes in recent years, but not in the way that was predicted. Demand has grown in many third countries and we were not able to foresee this. This means that demand for sugar has increased all over the world and, therefore, that there have been reductions in supplies to the European market. The problem is that sugar is not the only product of the agricultural industry, and so farmers have also had to adapt increasingly to the requirements of the market. They are considering alternative crops. For example, in my area of Germany, energy crops are being cultivated and they are genuine competitors for sugar beet. In the course of the market reform, we should discuss whether it is time to abolish the quota regulations that apply to the sugar market and to give it more freedom in future. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we need to take note of the fact that we are discussing two subjects here. I will not, at this point, say anything about the voluntary labelling of the meat; I will stick mainly to the electronic identification of the animals. In that connection, Mr Schnellhardt, I need to disagree with you quite stridently. Sheep farmers are telling us very clearly that they have major problems with electronic identification, as there are technical shortcomings with it. The tags are not coming out of the animals, but the technology is malfunctioning. The fault that occurs as a result is blamed on the farmers. That is not acceptable, and it is a situation that we must avoid in the case of cattle. It is therefore right that we should leave this system as voluntary in cattle in future, too, until the system has matured. As a farmer, I am not saying that the system should not be developed or introduced, but allowing something to mature takes time. Moreover, it is important – for public health in particular – to call electronic identification into question if it does not work. As regards public health, it is quite clear that we need certainty. As long as that certainty is not in place, we should stick to a voluntary system. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Since a postponement of the vote on the ACTA in order to be able to evaluate and take into account the pending ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union was not possible, I abstained from voting. With regard to tackling product piracy and strengthening copyright, ACTA is something that I could support. Nevertheless, the fears and concerns of a section of the population, which feels its freedoms will be restricted by ACTA, must be taken into account.

We welcome the fact that the compromise we reached on retaining the existing exceptions has not resulted in any unnecessary interruption to the payments to farmers. It is important that we take up a clear position in this transitional year. I would also like to emphasise that I welcome the constructive way in which we have worked together and I hope that we can continue to work even more constructively in future, because in the past, we were often only able to make progress on agricultural reform in fits and starts.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, ever since it was decided to abandon the milk quota, people have been watching you closely, Commissioner, to see how you behave and what action you are taking to exit the scheme in a rational way. Is there really any pattern discernible here? We have had a year of regional over-production and a rise in global production, which is hardly surprising since there was previously a shortage on the market, leading to higher prices. In addition, over the last two years there has been a rise in operating costs of about 20 %, principally due to direct and indirect rises in energy costs. The market reacted in the normal way to the increased supply and came under pressure. This caused prices to drop. The market is now stabilising again because the farmers are displaying an ability to manage the market and are slowing their production more than is usual for the season. The criticised price decreases have led to a rise in demand in the market. The decline in the euro exchange rate promotes marketability in the global market, making European dairy produce competitive. In the case of cheese, stocks have been reduced to such an extent that more milk is now needed for cheese production. In other words, this is a normal market cycle. Now we come to the Commission: if the market is working, why do we need a super levy? Is its sole purpose to acquire funds for the EU? Has the time perhaps come to put the super levy on a European footing, finally transferring it from a national administrative level?

 The German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament has spoken out clearly in favour of the introduction of a debt redemption fund. However, participation in such a fund must be associated with clear and strict rules, such as were contained in the proposal made by the German Council of Economic Experts to the German Government in autumn 2011. Watering down the criteria for participation is neither productive nor effective. Linking the introduction of a debt redemption fund with the eurobonds project and the treatment of economic imbalances is unfair, and is rejected by the FDP in the European Parliament in the strongest possible terms.

Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, it is utterly astounding that we are to decide here on the future of the common agricultural policy, but have had essential criteria for this decision withheld from us. There is nothing to prevent a new delimitation of less-favoured areas being carried out. It is also acceptable to try to base this on fewer criteria than is currently the case. However, if these are to be limited to eight criteria, made up of climate-related and geological criteria, it is unacceptable for MEPs to be denied the opportunity to scrutinise whether these criteria are indeed appropriate. We need maps of the new distribution of less-favoured areas in order to be able to examine whether this new distribution based on the eight criteria makes any sense at all. However, the withholding of the map material will obviously arouse distrust as to whether there really is any desire at all to enable Parliament to exercise its right of codecision. As a farmer, I have serious doubts from a purely professional point of view as to whether these simple criteria will enable this sort of area classification to be made appropriately. There are, after all, other criteria that could convey disadvantage, such as a lack of infrastructure, labour market access or general historical farm structures. Moreover, different combinations of various criteria could lead to very different results. It is high time that we were able to evaluate the Commission’s proposals in an objective way in order to be able to improve them if necessary. Otherwise, I would agree with my fellow Members who wish to leave less-favoured areas out of the current agricultural reform discussion. Britta Reimers,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, within the last year, a new viral disease has been discovered in sheep and cattle that leads to deformity or even still-birth among lambs and calves. The disease is apparently communicated by midges, which also seem to have been responsible for carrying it into the EU. The affected farms have suffered serious damage, in some cases even fighting for survival, and have been left to fend for themselves until now. We are all agreed that technically correct monitoring is essential for new diseases so that it is possible to determine, on a scientific basis, whether or not it is a new epizootic. This requires time, however, and time is precisely what the affected parties at local level do not have. They need help. Funds based on mutuality, such as an animal disease fund, require mandatory notification in order to be able to distribute financial assistance. When will the Commission finally develop a standard strategy for new diseases that clearly defines when remedial measures and assistance can be provided to those affected by new diseases, in addition to the monitoring services? We are running out of time. The disease is continuing to spread. Trading partners outside Europe are responding with export embargos, so that the damage is also spreading to non-infected farms. The insemination and breeding livestock trade is restricted, despite the fact that the disease is spread by midges and direct infection seems unlikely. How does the Commission intend to proceed in relation to export embargos? Climate change and increased trade and mobility in society will lead to a rise in diseases entering our territory. We need a rational concept to reduce the consequences. We need answers for those affected that will help them and us all. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 I have voted against the motion for a resolution on the feasibility of introducing stability bonds because I am of the opinion that the creation of Eurobonds would send out the wrong signal. Since the introduction of the euro, low interest rates have led to higher debt levels in many euro area countries.

Therefore, I believe that the introduction of Eurobonds would make the current crisis worse. Britta Reimers,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Nicholson for his successful handling of the negotiations. We have decided on the abolition of the existing cost-intensive and market-distorting milk quota system and analysed the findings of the high level group for milk. The dairy package that has resulted from the negotiations is an important first step towards a market and competition-oriented dairy sector. The formation of inter-branch organisations is being promoted, with these organisations to be given the ability to negotiate contracts on behalf of their members. The negotiating power of milk producers is to be bolstered – in future they will be able to negotiate on an equal footing, if they so wish. It is also good that we will not be overshooting the mark. These contracts will not be permitted to make up more than 33% of the national and 3.5% of the European market. This ensures that there will be no new imbalance and that the necessary market freedom is retained. As there is no general requirement for contracts, farmers’ individual commercial freedom to make decisions remains secure. This is an important element of a functional market. We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will support the dairy package, and I ask you all to vote in favour of this package in tomorrow’s vote in plenary.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we need functioning markets with scope for competition in Europe. We will only achieve this, however, when everyone has equal rights. The role of farmers in the market is that of relatively small sole traders. Upstream and downstream of them, by contrast, we often see quite large business structures. I therefore welcome the fact that the Commission is, for once, looking into the market not only from the consumer point of view, but also from that of producers. If we have imbalances, we need to find ways to tackle them without giving rise to excessive bureaucracy and without creating new imbalances elsewhere. We all know how sensitively markets react. In these times of the debt crisis, in particular, that is something we see day in, day out. It is therefore important to test the waters carefully if we intervene. Markets need sensible frameworks in order to facilitate a minimum level of balance. However, they also need enough freedom to act and to be able to do so. Agriculture cannot be excepted from this principle. Only a balance of freedom and responsibility will enable all market participants to make the most of their advantages and thus help bring about long-term growth and prosperity.

The European Union must be able to continue to fulfil its role in the fisheries sector. We want to promote dynamic growth.

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since their discovery, antibiotics have played a major role in the treatment of infectious diseases in human and veterinary medicine. However, the super weapon seems to be losing its effectiveness. I agree with the authors of the motion for a resolution that we need to be more prudent and more careful with antimicrobial agents. The aim must be to limit the use of antibiotics to the essential curing of infections. We also need incentives for further research and development of new agents and alternative solutions. However, it is vital that we all pull in the same direction. I call on manufacturers, medical professionals, consumer organisations and farmers to leave behind their prejudices and finally work together. We need to act at the same time and take measures that will encourage the restrained and targeted use of antibiotics. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 I am 100% behind Mr Duff’s resolution. It is right and important to draw attention to the situation of the population of Western Sahara. The Moroccan authorities must provide information on the extent to which its economic activities relating to the natural resources in the territory of Western Sahara are for the benefit of the population of the territory and in accordance with their wishes. The status of the region under international law must be clarified. A court ruling on the territory of Western Sahara would bring about clarity in respect of relations between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco. Nonetheless, this resolution comes at the wrong time. Had it been passed, the resolution would have de facto
 blocked the EU’s fisheries agreement with Morocco, since this expires on 28 February 2012, and it is unlikely that the European Court of Justice would have passed a ruling by this date. Had this resolution been passed, it would have sent out the wrong signal to our Moroccan partners. Morocco is the only country in North Africa to have succeeded in initiating reforms to bring about democracy by peaceful means. This process should not be disrupted. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 In terms of social and economic policy, I believe it to be fundamentally right to increase the proportion of women in management positions. However, I have deliberately voted against the report, because paragraph 16b calls for the Europe-wide introduction of quotas for women. This is going too far. A mandatory quota will interfere on a large scale with companies’ freedom to do business and is therefore questionable from a constitutional perspective. In addition, an across-the-board quota does not take into consideration the specific circumstances of each company and industry. For example, it would not currently be possible to impose a standard quota in the construction, engineering or IT industries in Germany. In this area, it is essential to focus initially on training and study opportunities in order to bring about a significant increase in the proportion of young women employed in these traditionally male-dominated industries. In addition, we need to improve conditions for working parents, in particular, by introducing family-conscious, flexible work models and developing the child care infrastructure. Against this background, I would rather see a voluntary undertaking by companies and cooperation between the worlds of politics and business instead of an inflexible, mandatory quota.

 After long considerations and weighing up all the information, I have decided to vote against the report. In my opinion, it exacerbates the problem of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), rather than resolving it. We need a standard, EU-wide solution. We do not need renationalisation, which will prevent us from achieving our internal market objectives. In addition, it will weaken the position of the EU in future World Trade Organisation negotiations.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his persistent and positive work. Where the future of agricultural policy after 2013 is concerned, we have to decide the direction in which we want to go. Do we want an agricultural sector that faces up to the challenges by acting in an innovative, modern, courageous, self-aware, responsible and independent way in the market? Or do we want an agricultural sector that continues to be drip-fed by Europe and which needs its hand to be held and encouraging words from Mummy with each step it takes into the future? That is the course we are currently setting. To cope with the challenges of the future we need to promote modern technologies in the agricultural sector instead of having endless debates on ideologies. If farms are to be enabled to plan with certainty then we cannot keep changing course every couple of years. It is too much of a strain on our farmers’ finances. Everyone here must surely be aware that each political change of direction results in new laws and directives, which in turn demand investment by farms without at the same time increasing their incomes. We should not care whether a farm is large or small; instead we should be concerned with whether it is run in an economically sound manner. We should not care whether it produces conventionally or organically, so long as it handles resources responsibly. We should also not care how many animals are kept, so long as those animals are treated well. The important thing for us must be that we have sufficient good quality food in the future at affordable prices in Europe. After all, Europe is not alone in the world. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 The German Free Democratic Party delegation in the European Parliament assumes that the inclusion of Romania and Bulgaria in the Schengen area will further improve freedom of movement within the EU. Now that both Member States have achieved positive evaluation results in all areas of the Schengen review, there should be no more obstacles to delay inclusion further. There is no denying that the technical securing of borders will not automatically make them impermeable as long as problems persist in combating corruption in the justice and policing system. Accordingly, this challenge also relates to Member States already in the Schengen area. For this reason, the German Free Democratic Party delegation believes that criteria such as the fight against corruption must receive greater attention when evaluating the Schengen mechanism, and any misdemeanours must be punished appropriately.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for many companies in the European Union, the continual rise in fuel prices represents an additional burden. European fishermen in particular are suffering as a result of this price rise because they cannot simply compensate for the additional costs by increasing their catch or by charging better prices. The current political situation in North Africa and the Middle East has exacerbated the problem. We therefore need to investigate the effects of the rise in fuel prices on the economy and employment in the EU. Which sectors are particularly at risk and what sort of support could be provided without it distorting competition? We therefore call on the Commission to look into this. It is important that we support the European fishing industry, among other things, in order not to increase our dependence on imports from third countries. We are on the verge of reforming the common fisheries policy and therefore, we are under a particular obligation to be cautious and not to act prematurely with regard to this matter either.

 Mr President, Mrs Damanaki, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that Parliament is finally to vote on this issue and would like to thank the rapporteurs for their work. The amendment to the Council regulation on the financial measures in the Community is one of the main tools we need in order to implement the common fisheries policy. This is true in particular for the areas of international fishery relations, data collection and scientific studies. The control systems of the common fisheries policy and their implementation are particularly important. The rapporteur has made every effort to convince his fellow Members of the need to increase the co-financing rate to a maximum of 75%. We have been unable to acquiesce to his wishes. The existing regulations have proven themselves in practice and already allow for some exceptions. The Member States already make use of the opportunity to avail of co-financing and there is no need for any further incentives. It is important that the amendment to the regulation should clear the way for a coherent legal framework. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

Madam President, market fluctuations are important for the proper functioning of markets in order to create incentives for the buying and selling of goods. For us farmers, commodity futures trading is a basic component of the buying and selling of harvested crops. It provides an important opportunity to achieve planning certainty through the early setting of prices and quantities. In contrast to the situation in our prosperous industrialised nations, rising food prices are a particular problem in the poor regions of the world where people have to spend a large proportion of their income on food. We must not intervene in the markets every time the prices change in an attempt to combat natural fluctuations. However, without internationally applicable framework legislation for the financial markets, we cannot even start to think about regulating the commodities markets, because if there is too much money in the financial market it will find suitable equivalents, and commodities are currently highly regarded. Therefore, we should not be surprised if agricultural commodities are now also a sought-after trading objective. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the current dioxin incident is more than just a scandal. The people of Europe have been shown their reflection. How long have we been complaining that there is an extreme fight for prices and survival going on in agriculture, fuelled by the insatiable demand for ever cheaper food. For a long time now, this fight has been more than simply a trial of strength. Individuals are increasingly resorting to criminal means and methods. However, we will all lose out in the end as a result. We can enact more laws and directives, we can carry out more checks at even more cost, we can impose more severe penalties – none of these things will succeed against the criminal energy fuelled by such a tough fight for existence. We must finally tackle the causes of this problem. We must at last put an end to the constant demand for more and cheaper food. As a farmer, I have experienced the powerlessness against the criminal activities of certain individuals – as in this case – on my own doorstep. Together with my professional colleagues, I have shuddered at the thought of who will be next in line and innocently drawn into this maelstrom. I would therefore like to ask the Commission: what do you and your colleagues intend to do to restore the value of food? I welcome your proposals, but with these you will not solve the main problem.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have known for twelve years that battery farming practices would be banned in the EU from 1 January 2012 onwards. How can it be that twelve years have not been enough for some Member States to implement this ban in good time and to prepare their poultry industry accordingly? This is just one of many examples of how poor implementation leads to frustration. Egg producers in Member States who have implemented the changes in good time are already experiencing competitive anomalies that run counter to the principles of the EU. I am calling on the Commission to require that the relevant law should be upheld in all Member States and to do all it can to ensure that it is implemented. Eggs should no longer be produced in battery cages after January 2012 and the then illegal eggs should no longer be allowed to reach the shops, putting an end to their negative effect on competition. The farmers who have changed their practices to comply with EU requirements should not experience financial disadvantage while those who flout the changeover reap the economic benefits. It is impossible to explain to people in Europe why EU law does not apply equally in all Member States and why some Member States are always seen to be dragging their feet. The recent crises show where this can lead us. We need a Europe that acts in a concerted way, rather than one in which every member can do as it pleases, regardless of the rest. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Madam President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, one of our top priorities as Members of the European Parliament is to reduce bureaucracy and simplify legislation and regulations in all the political areas of the European Union. This is the only way in which we can manage taxpayers’ money efficiently and increase the acceptance of our political decisions among the citizens of Europe. For this reason, it is important for farmers to feel the direct effect of simplification measures of this kind in the agricultural sector. Their job is to produce food, not to write books. At a time when local authority budgets are becoming increasingly tight, it is also important for us to reduce the amount of work to be done by their administrative staff. Regulations must be drawn up in such a way that they are not padded out unnecessarily. In addition, we must ensure that the sanctions we impose are in proportion to the breach of regulations. An efficient, long-term policy is characterised by the fact that it places a greater emphasis on advice than it does on punishment. This is the only way that we can give our citizens and our farmers the incentives to implement new findings and to fulfil society’s requirements. We need to take all of this into account when we discuss the future common agricultural policy. We also need to focus more closely on ensuring that there is no duplication of formalities and controls and that forms are only filled out when they provide real added value for the administrative bodies and for the farmers themselves. We must finally learn to work together and not against one another. Britta Reimers,

 Madam President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, providing protection for bees is in the best interests of the agricultural sector and many farmers are also beekeepers. We have seen a decline in the bee population in many regions of Europe. We must identify the causes of this problem and take the necessary countermeasures. It is a good thing that the budget funding for the national bee programmes up to 2013 has been increased from EUR 26 million to EUR 32 million. However, that is not enough. We must ensure that these programmes are continued after 2013. In order to achieve this, it is also particularly important for us to improve and simplify the process which allows researchers, beekeepers and farmers to share specialist knowledge. We should focus as soon as possible on combating the diseases and parasites to which bees are subject. We must not leave the beekeepers to fight this battle on their own. We urgently need better and more standardised statistics from all the Member States throughout the EU. This is because we need to work with facts and not just with speculation. As the number of beekeepers is constantly falling, we also need to invest more in education and training. We should provide more support for young beekeepers and also for full-time beekeepers, to ensure that the profession has a future and does not die out.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks to the rapporteurs. In view of the high level of imports of fish and fish products into the EU, it is essential that we maintain and support our local fishermen, as well as the domestic aquaculture sector. We urgently need improved catch methods in order to secure the long-term livelihood of both our seas and our fishermen. It is equally essential that we enable aquaculture to expand further. We are in urgent need of more effective data collection and more intensive research, since only once we know what is actually going on will we be able to make the right decisions for the future. Our lack of success in combining economics with ecology – which are not actually that different – is often down to excessive bureaucracy and insufficient knowledge. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 The motion for a resolution on the crisis in the livestock sector which has been adopted by the European Parliament calls for the introduction of new market management mechanisms in the livestock industry and of safety nets in all the cereal sectors.

In order to guarantee a supply of feed for the European livestock sector, we must relieve farmers of their burden of red tape and create a framework of legal certainty. A market focus in the agricultural industry will also mean that farmers can take responsibility for their own businesses and need not expect constant protective interventions in the market to be made by politicians. If agricultural policy is based only on individual interests, the result will be a spiral of exemptions which it will not be possible to finance and which will distort the market. This will turn farmers into the victims of a bureaucratic, state-run control system. In order for the market to function effectively, we need a clearly defined framework for the entire agricultural industry and not just for individual areas. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, integrated maritime policy is a forward-looking area. The oceans are being used increasingly intensively for transport, maritime economic activities, offshore energy and fishing, and the development of these areas must be coordinated. The space available is limited and, therefore, the various maritime sectors must take a responsible and thoughtful approach to working together. The use and the protection of the seas must not conflict with one another. These two areas are mutually dependent, because the oceans can only support us if they are healthy. I would like to highlight the positive cooperation between countries bordering on the Baltic who are working together to promote the dynamic development of the fisheries, the environment, the infrastructure and tourism in coastal regions. We must continue to focus on the fishing industry, which is in a weak position and is often regarded as being a low priority, but which, because it provides us with food, represents a vital link in the coastal economy. I would like to congratulate Mrs Meissner on this positive report. Britta Reimers,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Convention on Future Multilateral Cooperation in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries established a very important organisation: the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation, or NAFO. Its aim is the conservation and optimum utilisation of the fishery resources in the Northwest Atlantic. The convention has since been amended and brought more into line with other regional conventions. Modern concepts such as stock management have been incorporated. I feel it is important that the structure of the organisation is streamlined and that the obligations of the contracting parties are clearly defined. It is also good that the possibility of resolving conflicts through a dispute settlement procedure is provided. The fishing possibilities accruing to the European Union under the convention are of great interest to the EU. Parliament should give its approval under the new powers granted to it by the Treaty of Lisbon. As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I commend Mr Wałesa’s report to the House. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the distribution of profits in the food supply chain has become unbalanced, and generally to the detriment of farmers. That is the correct conclusion drawn in this report. Unfortunately, the rapporteur has focused on the old instruments of agricultural policy. He believes that farmers’ incomes can be improved by regulating supply in the manner of a planned economy. Experience tells us that planned economies go hand in hand with greater bureaucracy, but our farmers want to produce – they do not want more paperwork. Measures that are not based on the basic principles of a social market economy have failed in the past. A planned economy has not worked in the agricultural sector in recent decades. A social market economy, on the other hand, offers farmers the opportunity to run a successful business. If we are to improve the situation of farmers, then we must ensure that the European farming sector is competitive in the long term. To achieve this, it is essential that we improve the bargaining position of farmers vis-à-vis the other actors in the food supply chain. This can be achieved by means of a fair and transparent market that is also capable of holding its own in the global market. At present, I have my doubts as to whether I can vote in favour of the report. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank our rapporteur for his constructive cooperation and for the important aspects highlighted by his report on the future of the CAP after 2013. This report calls for further development of the existing common agricultural policy rather than the development of a new policy. This is a good thing. The primary function of agriculture is and remains the production of food for our citizens. The ever-increasing need for public goods, the growth in population numbers and the simultaneous shortage of natural resources make this more difficult to achieve. Farmers are required to produce more and more with less and less. This is impossible without increasing efficiency. The European Parliament, the Commission and the Council are responsible for securing the necessary framework conditions for this. If we in Europe want to maintain a healthy and diverse agricultural sector in the future, we will also need to take account of the needs of farmers, namely by imposing as little bureaucracy as necessary and by allowing as much entrepreneurial freedom as possible to enable them to earn a reasonable income for themselves.

 Mr President, Commissioners, I would like to congratulate Mr Cadec on his successful and balanced report. I would also like to thank him for his excellent cooperation. There are major challenges involved in regulating the import of fishery and aquaculture products into the EU. With a volume of 12 million tonnes and a value of EUR 55 billion, the EU fisheries market is the largest in the world. This market is growing rapidly and is increasingly dependent on imports from third countries. It is therefore important for us to control the conditions under which the products from third countries are produced and imported. We have now submitted two amendments in plenary. These relate to the need for us to recognise the special economic situation in the peripheral regions of Europe. However, we do not hold market liberalisation alone responsible for the difficulties. The huge introduction of fish products onto the EU market, which has been described as unfair, also has no direct effect on... (The President cut off the speaker) Britta Reimers  (ALDE

I support the action of the European Union in reorganising the current remuneration policy to provide long-term success and more accountability for decision makers. However, this must not lead to a situation in which policy determines salaries. This should remain the task of the authorities which are already in place, such as the board of governors and the general meeting of the banks. The proposed remuneration policy must therefore not replace existing structures, but at most complement them where necessary, insofar as this is beneficial to the quality of economic decisions.

 It is certainly important to tighten the regulations on internships. The representatives of the German Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament have supported this. Young people often work for months on end without payment, hoping that they might still get a permanent job afterwards. This is an unsustainable situation. Internships should not destroy jobs. However, today’s plenary vote is going to pave the way in the future for a complete ban on unpaid internships. We believe that this gives a wrong message. It should still be possible to do a three-month unpaid internship, for example. There are numerous non profit-making or social organisations where a young person can acquire exciting, interesting experiences. However, such organisations are often unable to pay any remuneration for the internship. The key factor should be the duration of an internship. In the case of any internship lasting longer than six months, the employer can rely on productive output from the intern. From then on, remuneration should also be paid. The decision made today is impracticable and goes too far. We therefore do not support this part of the resolution. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mr Milana, the rapporteur, on his report. In a world in which fish stocks are becoming smaller and the demand for fish and fish products is rising, aquaculture is becoming more and more important. The report underlines the important role of European aquaculture in satisfying our needs and our demand. The growth in European aquaculture has proven to be insufficient. The Community legal framework is responsible, among other things, for development in the European Union coming to a near standstill since 2001, while the rest of the world has seen considerable growth. The Member States could evidently not be persuaded to model the national and Community legal framework in a way that would allow aquaculture in the EU to be developed in a dynamic way. Bureaucratic obstacles and a substantial administrative burden are the consequences of this legal framework. I therefore call on the Commission to adapt the directives relating to the designated Natura 2000 areas as soon as possible, in such a way as to enable sustainable aquaculture in these areas too, thereby making a positive contribution to their management. A total ban on aquaculture in these areas is unacceptable. There are always complaints about the excessive requirements involved in impact assessments for the establishment of new farms or for the expansion of existing farms. That should not be the case. Furthermore, we can see that the damage caused by the voracious cormorants in many areas is jeopardising the existence of traditional fish ponds. To ensure that this is not also the case in the aquaculture that is still to be developed, we need the European Cormorant Management Plan that we have been calling for for a long time to finally be adopted. My last point concerns aquaculturists in developing countries. These aquaculturists must be made more aware of a policy on quality and higher production standards – particularly as regards environmental protection, hygiene and social standards – in their production.

 Mandatory origin labelling of meat, poultry, dairy products, fresh fruit and vegetables and processed products made from one ingredient, which is called for in the report on the provision of food information to consumers, puts an unreasonable burden on food processing companies. For this reason, I have voted against the report. Food is produced across national borders within the European internal market. For example, in the dairy industry, milk from different countries is collected and processed. Separate labelling of the batches that are being processed from different countries is technically impossible. This will place bureaucratic obstacles in the path of European companies which are successful on the global market.

 Combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography is vitally important. We must use all our strength to combat the availability of child pornography in communications networks. The permanent and effective control of child abuse is both a political responsibility and a precept of the rule of law.

 In the vote on the Scottà report on agricultural product quality policy, Amendment 5 was accepted, which called for the mandatory labelling of the origin of foods made from only one ingredient. This requirement involves significantly more work and higher costs for the agriculture industry and food processors, without bringing any real added value for consumers. For this reason, I have voted against this amendment. Britta Reimers  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when discussing quality logos and mandatory designations of origin for food, we must not forget that our political decisions need to be implementable in practice. I cannot see how Amendments 4 and 5 can be implemented in practice and I will therefore be rejecting them. Quality logos should, in principle, be viewed as beneficial if they are voluntary. They give producers and processors of goods the opportunity to be successful in niche markets. However, we need to take account of the fact that, through the market dominance of a few chain stores, many voluntary private logos are interpreted as quasi standards. This robs producers and processors of their entrepreneurial freedom and also narrows the choice for consumers. There is a similar situation with regard to the mandatory indication of the place of origin for agricultural products, such as milk. Implementing this requirement in agriculture and in the processing industry would scarcely be possible from a technical point of view. We need to be careful that good intentions do not descend into excessive bureaucracy. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is only one step on the long road to the reform of the common fisheries policy. I would like to thank the rapporteur for the report and our coordinator for doing such an efficient job. I am in favour of fundamental reform of the common fisheries policy. However, if we lack the courage to do this, it is important to me that we retain the principle of relative stability. Furthermore, I would like to mention specifically the major problem represented by the greedy cormorants and the management plan that Parliament has already called for. The fishing industry is of fundamental economic and cultural importance to our coastal regions. Therefore, achieving a balance between the economy and the environment is of great significance for me in the context of the forthcoming reform of the common fisheries policy.

According to the resolution of the European Parliament on the draft general budget for the financial year 2010, adopted on 17 December 2009, a vote was taken today on the amending budget for the European Parliament, following the revised calculations made by the Parliamentary administration. The FDP in the European Parliament abstained, because there was a paragraph in the package of amendments concerned that we could not reconcile with our convictions. The FDP had already expressed its opposition to an increase in the secretarial allowance to EUR 1 500 during the discussions in committee. It is out of the secretarial allowance that MEPs’ assistants are paid. The FDP considers that the argument that more money is needed due to the additional work that MEPs have to do with the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is unsound, as there is nothing in past experience to support this. Certainly, due to the Treaty of Lisbon, which has just come into force, Parliament will overall need extra capacity for legislative work, but with the introduction of the Assistants’ Statute from the beginning of the current parliamentary term, there is still no proof that MEPs actually need more assistants. For this reason, there are grounds for concern that further demands and supplementary increases, or an extension of office capacity, will follow. For this reason, the FDP in the European Parliament abstained. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

The German members of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe voted differently from the group as a whole on two points. The first concerns Amendment 3 from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. The FDP members voted against, because a radical devolution of fisheries policy such as proposed in the motion with the transfer of powers and responsibility to Member States and to local decision makers cannot be reconciled with the European common fisheries policy. The idea here is precisely to find common forward-looking solutions at an EU level. FDP members supported Amendment 33 because it supports the important principle of relative stability, which is important for Germans. This concerns the basis for quota allocation.

 The German Free Democratic Party members of the European Parliament have abstained from voting on the Copenhagen resolution for the following reasons. The resolution contains statements about financing for climate protection measures in third countries without defining the specific criteria or purpose of the financing. We cannot justify this to taxpayers. In addition, we believe that blanket criticism of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) is wrong. The ICAO is the organisation which deals with aviation matters at an international level. Both the criticism and the statement about the alleged failure of ICAO negotiations are incorrect and inappropriate. The call for specific arrangements for a CO2
 trading system for the aviation industry goes against current EU legislation and overburdens the EU’s negotiating position in an international climate agreement with unrealistic demands. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a farmer, I see the tabled amendment of Articles 78 and 79 as a deviation by the Commission from its hitherto sound route through agricultural reform at the expense of efficient and forward-looking farms. It is dangerous to tamper, simply because of a desire to do something, so close to the final phasing out of the milk quota system, a system that has really been to the disadvantage of dairy farmers hitherto. It has also been left behind by developments on the ground, as the market is currently finally beginning to recover. I therefore reject this amendment. It is easy to see how the Commission is seeking to exploit Parliament’s call for urgent measures for its own ends. It is doing this by attempting, shortly before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, to ensure for itself permanent scope to act without Parliament’s consent through this amendment of Article 186. I therefore reject this amendment. However, I could live with Parliament granting the Commission scope to act for a limited period in cases of crisis. This ability would also be available to Parliament in future times of crisis, with very rapid effect, through Rule 142 of its Rules of Procedure. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the world economic crisis has thrown the global market off balance. As milk producers we are suffering the effects of prices having hit an all-time low. We are hearing over and over again that the adopted milk quota regulations should be amended. As a dairy farmer myself, I can only warn you against doing this. The Commission’s intervention measures have also succeeded in preventing milk prices from falling even further and the market seems to be relaxing. However, I do not think that this intervention is really a good means of achieving this, because it will result in stocks piling up which could burden a recovering market later on. I therefore call on the Commission to explain how it is going to deal with this problem. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we all know, most people are frightened of sharks. However, sharks have populated the world’s oceans for centuries, and I believe that we should not try to imagine a world without them. In my view, we have spoken for every person in Europe by voting by such a large majority to prohibit shark finning today. Shark fin soup is a particular delicacy, and shark finning was therefore a common practice in the past as well. After finning, the sharks are dumped back in the sea. This is not only barbaric; it is also a massive waste of resources. The fins are the most valuable part of the shark because they are the ingredients for soup, which is a lucrative business, but this practice cannot be allowed to continue. With this large majority, we have sent a very clear message today that this practice cannot continue. In fact, a ban has been in place in Europe since 2003, but there were a great many exemptions. We can remove these exemptions if we specify that the sharks must be landed with their fins naturally attached to the body. That is the only way to put a stop to this barbaric practice.

Mr President, we have some very interesting reports on fisheries reform before the House today. I would like to comment on three of them. Firstly, as we all know, fishing is one of the oldest crafts practised by humankind. Even now, many forms of fishing are practised by small-scale and medium-sized operations and artisanal fishermen. We put SMEs at the heart of our policies in Europe and I think it is right that this report also focuses very strongly on their needs. That is my first comment. Secondly, with regard to the external dimension of the Common Fisheries Policy, fish is already an important source of protein in many countries; this applies particularly to developing countries and their populations. With a growing world population, it is important in future to ensure, to an even greater extent than before, that people who rely on local fish as a source of protein can actually catch fish off their own coasts and that only the surplus is available to European fishermen, for example, under fisheries agreements.  My final comment relates to shark finning. It is unacceptable, it is barbaric, and it should be banned. I think there is general agreement on that. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mr Torvalds has said that the common fisheries policy (CFP) as it currently stands is one of the EU’s greatest failures to date. I think he is right. He has also said that it is an economic, social and environmental catastrophe for our fisheries. The fishing industry is not just a means of producing or catching food. It is the oldest trade in the world and, of course, we want to preserve it for the future. Therefore, I would like to thank all the rapporteurs. I believe that we have taken an important step forwards today and I know how committed Ms Damanaki is in this area. For example, we need aquaculture as a response to overfishing. I am very interested in an integrated maritime policy which is all about maritime environmental planning. There are some interesting concepts in this area involving, for example, integrating aquaculture into offshore wind farms. This may be something for the future, but we must ensure that we can expand this sector in the most effective way possible. Finally, I would like to tell you about a small success story from Germany. The North Sea and Baltic fisheries policy has resulted in stocks of cod, herring and plaice gradually recovering. I hope that in future, all the fish stocks in Europe will also recover.

 Since a postponement of the vote on the ACTA in order to be able to evaluate and take into account the pending ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union was not possible, I abstained from voting. With regard to tackling product piracy and strengthening copyright, ACTA is something that I could support. Nevertheless, the fears and concerns of a section of the population, which feels its freedoms will be restricted by ACTA, must be taken into account. For that reason, the decision of the Court of Justice would have been an important decision-making criterion for me. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr President, it has already been pointed out that we do not have a single European railway area, although many people assume that we do. In fact, all our citizens probably assume that we do. We have a lack of tracks in some areas, we have different gauges, we have different technologies and we also do not have fair competition. There are some countries where it is very difficult for other competitors to enter the railway market. That is something that we must do something about. I would like to offer special thanks to Commissioner Kallas. He has grabbed the bull by the horns and set something in motion that has actually been due for 9 years, as we have noticed that the Member States are not implementing what we decided. I would like to thank Ms Serracchiani, who has really done us all a great service here. We now actually have a process in which we emphasise a strong regulator. We have always said that that is the most important thing. The second most important thing is the separation of networks and operators, which is something that we have to discuss and on which we await the Commission proposal before we can see how far it corresponds with the reality on the ground. It is very important that we should have within the package what has become known as ‘mini-unbundling’, in other words, more transparency with regard to funding streams. Mr Ertug just addressed this issue, which I believe is very important. We must do everything we can to obtain a truly complete single European railway area. Gesine Meissner,

 Mr President, with the digital tachograph, the truth is that we actually agreed on many points during the negotiations. I, too, would like to offer my sincere thanks to Ms Ţicău, who was very committed in her negotiations with us shadow rapporteurs. We also really are in agreement about major points – the fact that this is about adapting practically everything, the fact that a technological innovation facilitates an improvement in control checks, which also need to be tightened up, as well as greater requirements for transparency in relation to what can now be installed, what we can check. I am thus in agreement with much of what has been put forward. There is just one area with which I do not agree, and I would like to concentrate on that area now. I will start off in something of a general way. In the Europe 2020 strategy, we constantly stress the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises. There are many of these companies, and they create the jobs and the training places. In 2009, a proposal for cutting red tape specifically for these small and medium-sized enterprises was awarded a prize here. Under the proposal, there were to be options for derogations in respect of tachographs for the Member States, whereby a tradesperson who, for example, drives a 3.5-tonne vehicle himself/herself, requires no tachograph if he or she is located only 50 kilometres from his/her place of work. That should now be extended to 150 kilometres. This proposal was awarded a prize. There was actually a great deal of agreement here – albeit not with everyone – that it was a good thing to move in this direction, that this really would mean a cut in red tape. Now, though, the Commission has only proposed 100 kilometres, unfortunately. In committee, we initially amended that to 150 kilometres with a narrow majority. We had a majority for 150 kilometres, for exactly that proposal. That now hangs in the balance. We have now provided on a general basis that the rules should only apply once over the 100 kilometres line – and rightly so – but, at the same time, the weight limit is to be reduced to 2.8 tonnes. The current situation in Germany is that, while the regulations do specify 2.8-tonne vehicles, there are so many derogations provided that the likes of small-scale painters and electricians are not subject to the regulations at all. That would change under these proposals. Because of that, I believe that we must vote against Amendment 134 and in favour of Amendment 129, which I proposed. In that way, we will be moving in the direction of cutting red tape and really doing something for small and medium-sized enterprises. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr Grosch, we agree on a great many issues. You just said that we need common applicability. I absolutely do not agree with that. You also said, however, that it should apply to professional drivers and not to the other groups. It seems to me that that is already not the case at present. Let us take the example of a master roofer, as a non-professional driver, who drives his materials himself and has a 2.8-tonne vehicle. That is a light goods vehicle, and many people have those, and let us then imagine that he drives over 100 kilometres once every three years, namely 103 kilometres one way, and so actually has to fit a digital tachograph. Does that sound proportionate to you? Do you, moreover, believe that safety would be jeopardised if that were not the case? Gesine Meissner,

Mr President, we have already heard from many quarters that the Sahel region is a particular source of problems in Africa. The people there are living in inhuman conditions, which is something that we cannot simply accept. We need to do something to prevent this. The fact is that the people there are caught in a spiralling trap: they are facing drought, preventing them from keeping animals, they are coping with waves of refugees, terrorist attacks and unstable governments – in other words they are encountering a security problem of unimaginable magnitude. A number of EU citizens have been affected, falling victim to attack. This is not our sole concern, however, as we are particularly concerned with the plight of the people living in such enormous difficulties. We need to take action, particularly to protect women and girls, who are the victims of violence, and who are also denied education. This is truly a Herculean task for all policy areas in the EU, affecting development policy and security policy equally, as organised crime seems to be the most lucrative business in this area, as well as many other external policies. We need progress, which is why we have gathered today for this debate. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 I can offer a short answer to this. This is something we should really consider, because I believe that when we talk about human rights violations here we sometimes feel quite helpless; because many policies are moving in this direction and are proving inadequate, the question is: what additional steps can be taken?

 Mr President, I believe that Ms Wikström has achieved a great deal in her report. It is obviously important to set up a central body which can find a solution in these cases and identify the correct location in the case of legal issues concerning the country responsible for resolving media conflicts of this kind. I believe that Ms Wikström has done a very good job. It is a pity that so few people have chosen to speak on this subject. Of course, there is a great deal of agreement in this area and so perhaps it is not necessary. This really is an important step forward that we are taking in Parliament and I am pleased about that.

Madam President, Commissioner Malmström, I very much respect your efforts to improve the agreement. Nonetheless, I believe that the agreement in its current form is not good enough. I could, in essence, continue from where the previous speaker left off. Of course when someone comes into your home, you will want to know who they are and what they want. However, you do not necessarily want to store data about them for long periods, also allowing others to access this information. Commissioner, you have stated, for example, that the data will be depersonalised after six months. That is correct. However, as you said yourself, this only occurs after six months. We need to take numerous concerns into account. It has also been stated that this data is gathered anyway. I do not see this as a reason to sign up to this agreement. There have been no complaints to date, according to Mr Voss. Likewise, I do not see this as a reason to sign up this agreement either. There is no need to rush. Negotiations with the US are not always a meeting of equals. I am aware of this from the EU-US air transport agreement. We agreed to this, despite its inequities, because it offered us economic benefits. In this case, however, I agree entirely with Ms Weber: it is better to have no law at all than a bad one.

 Mr President, chocolate and cocoa are something to be enjoyed not just by children, but also by adults. It is true that we are now in Strasbourg, but we are often in Brussels, where many people like to buy Belgian chocolate and to give it as a gift. Most of them do not think about where the cocoa comes from, under what conditions it is cultivated, and how the chocolate is manufactured. This debate has already made it clear that we must understand that the cocoa which we import has, in many cases, been produced using child labour. As Ms Köstinger has said, this is not just about finding out whether the children are there with or without their families and whether or not forced labour is involved. We must also be aware that the conditions under which these children work are damaging to their health. Cocoa is produced under conditions which are extremely harmful to health, including that of children. We need to stop this from happening. We must do everything we can to buy cocoa fairly from countries like Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire which are attempting to bring about better living conditions for their people. This has already been said on several occasions and, therefore, I think that introducing a quality mark would be the right approach to take. I am pleased that there is widespread agreement in Parliament on this subject. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Madam President, Ms Bauer said earlier that nothing has changed. We do talk about equality every year, that much is true. Many things are changing a little bit, though. I get the impression that there are more men in the Chamber for the debate this year than last time, and that is a very positive thing, in my opinion. I would like to offer my sincere thanks to Mr Gustafsson, the chair of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, who fights in a very committed fashion for women’s rights, and also to my Liberal colleague Mr Schmidt, who will be speaking later. We are, after all, talking about fairness, and men, too, can see that things are unfair and are critical of that fact, which I think is excellent. There is another thing that is different this year. Last week there was the Gender Pay Gap conference in Brussels, and one of the speakers there began her address in a very unusual way. She said that men are less well qualified, yet they receive more money and pay more tax. Women are better qualified, they have university degrees, yet they receive less money and they pass less tax. She went on to question whether maybe it was perhaps the wrong approach to subsidise places in higher education for women if they then go on to pay less tax. She meant this as a joke, of course. What she meant was the exact opposite, and that is also the way that it has to be seen. When 60% of qualified graduates are women, can we afford for so few women to have the opportunity to develop into good jobs? Can we afford that? The truth is that this is crazy. After all, what we are doing is throwing away economic opportunities galore. It has already been said that, with one third female membership of executive boards, the working atmosphere and the success of companies are demonstrably improved. That is the case for businesses, but of course it could also be the case for politics. I therefore wholeheartedly thank the rapporteur, as well as Ms Reding and all those who champion this cause. We need more fairness in this area. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

Madam President, last year, when I drew up the report on integrated maritime policy, the accident in the Gulf of Mexico had just happened. At that time, we were already considering what we could do in order to be able to intervene better in such cases and how we could also implement some form of preventive measures. At the time, we came up with the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA). I would therefore also like to offer my sincere thanks to Mr Fleckenstein for his excellent work. It really is important for us to look at what institutions we have and to consider how we can involve them further and in different ways. The sea is, in general, being used more, and, in future, it will be used significantly more still, because it also contains raw materials. It is important not only for shipping, but also for energy production. In this regard, however, it is important to consider how we can protect the sea. If we have an institution that is perfectly capable of doing this with additional powers, then we ought to instruct it to do so. It will obviously need funds for this, but that is why it was right for us to say to the Commission during the budget debate when it wanted to cut back on the funding for the agencies that that was not on. We already knew, with regard to EMSA in particular, that we would be giving it an additional task. This is therefore an excellent report. We ought to give Mr Fleckenstein the negotiating mandate soon. Gesine Meissner,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Grosch, the work that has been done here is truly excellent. There were 413 amendments, and we genuinely all supported the majority of the 32 compromises. It shows that we all know that it is important to take as united an approach as possible with regard to the subject of transport. Of course, we have different ideas in the various groups about the details of individual matters, but by and large, we all said that transport is important. It really is the backbone of the internal market. It is a foundation of European policy that we say that we want free movement of people, goods and services. For this, we clearly need to make various improvements, which we will continue to do in subsequent reports. We can truly say that it has just become clear – and it is also clear in this report – that we need all modes of transport. Naturally, we want transport to be more efficient, more environmentally friendly and safer. That is something that we all need to take into consideration. However, in order to be able to continue to take the internal market forward, we really need all modes of transport, even if one area might produce higher emissions than another. That has become very clear in this case. There are essentially very few points on which we do not agree. One of them concerns road trains. This is currently very elegantly worded. I know that not all parties will agree, but in this regard, it is the case that we need a European modular system. In other words, we wanted an option to have a larger volume or perhaps also a bit more length and a bit more weight in the lorries. Not everyone thinks that is a good idea. However, in some areas of Europe, that has already been put into practice – and successfully. This system cannot be used everywhere. On behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I would like to refer to an amendment that we tabled after the vote. I think it is more correct, and should also meet with much approval, to say that it is not a question of us asking the Commission to submit something relating to the railway package describing the relationship between the network and operators, but rather that it should actually be about the separation of the network and operators, which we also addressed in the recast of the railway package. That is a correction, so I would imagine that everyone would be able to go along with it. Thank you once again. I look forward to tomorrow’s vote. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
).

 Madam President, Commissioner, I am pleased that we have been able to meet up again. I stood here one year ago in my capacity as rapporteur on the further development of an integrated maritime policy. We have now reached a position where we can actually anchor a fixed maritime policy in European policy making and where we will have the appropriate financial framework. This is the major advantage gained from Mr Koumoutsakos’s follow-up report. For me, integrated maritime policy is not just what you might call a truly major concern, but also an enormously important future task for the European Union. It has already been pointed out that more of the earth is covered by water than land: the ratio is about 30% land to 70% water. There is a great deal of added value to be gained from water. This includes marine transport – 95% of all transport involves the sea – as well as, of course, fishing, research or offshore energy sources. We have a very broad range of options open to us when it comes to using the sea as a resource. We have just one earth and one mass of water, which is why we need to husband it as prudently as possible. This is a major challenge that we face. In practical terms, 40% of the EU’s gross domestic product comes from the IMP, the integrated maritime policy. As I have already said, our major success this time round is that the IMP now has a fixed basis. Although we have not achieved the hoped for EUR 50 million, a figure I believed to be a certainty last year, we have received EUR 40 million, most of which will be spent on cross-border projects. After all, it is important that cooperation should be practised that embraces various countries. Naturally I must express my sincere thanks to Mr Koumoutsakos. We made a good team when negotiating in the trialogue, which has now closed. We achieved an awful lot because we stuck together so well. Thank you again. I wish us both well with the integrated maritime policy. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
).

 Mr President, we have just been discussing the integrated maritime policy and, of course, fishing also plays a role there. Since I have been dealing with this topic for some time, I am aware that fishing is usually the last policy to be decided. Fishermen naturally play an important role in our food supply, however. It is also important for small and medium-sized enterprises that they should be able to work in a secure area and that illegal fishing should be prevented as it makes their work and their position in the marketplace more difficult. What we have heard is quite true: this issue does not just affect cooperation with developing countries. It goes without saying that this is significant because these countries also import fish. It is also important for us, however, because we need to prevent illegal fishing. For this reason, I should like to pick up on one of the points Mr Milana and Ms Lövin raised. I know that not everyone equally favours the European coastguard service. However, I do believe that we need better cooperation on this front in Europe at least. This was already called for in a Parliamentary report on integrated maritime policy dating from 2008. I have brought this up repeatedly and the Commission also needs to table a proposal in this area. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
).

 Madam President, Mr Kallas, I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Serracchiani. This was a tough task for her, as this really is a difficult portfolio. As has already been mentioned, the first railway package was established 10 years ago, when all Member States agreed on how the railway market in Europe could be opened up. The crazy thing is that a review carried out in 2009 indicated that only four states had actually met the provisions contained in the package. Two countries do not count as they do not have a rail network. The remainder have failed to stick to their own resolutions. This is why we need to take action once again. It is evident that we need a comprehensive railway sector in Europe, both in the interests of the internal market and in the interests of our citizens. What we find is not just gaps in the rail lines and incompatible systems, but also legal and organisational hurdles. It is these hurdles that we have tried to eliminate here. The good news is that we now have a strong regulator at European and national level. This regulator must be independent and must also be able to take action quickly. A lot of people have said this. We have also noticed that although the separation of networks and operators may be the right solution, a lot of comparisons are required in order to establish the nature of this separation and to ensure that we have a consistent system throughout Europe. This is something that will need urgent attention next year. There is one thing that we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe disagree with – Mr Tremosa has already pointed it out and we have also asked for a separate vote on this issue – and that is Article 6(4). Mr Kuhn has already indicated that he wants transparency in relation to the financial flow. We do not want to see public monies being invested in areas other than infrastructure. This is not assured by the current wording, however. This is why we really do need to vote against the last section, as otherwise we shall have no transparency. This is not in the interest of progress in the rail market. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, as has already been stated here, China is a super power and for that reason is very important for the Member States of the European Union. I know that, when it comes to human rights violations in China, some people would say we should leave the Chinese in peace. They have a different culture and do not share our value system, hence we should not seek to impose our values on them. When, however, we find that people are voluntarily setting themselves on fire, when young people of 18 and 19 years of age who simply want to live according to their faith have no other choice than to take their own lives, then it is no longer possible to remain silent. The fact is that the representatives of the Dalai Lama are constantly calling on our support, placing their hope in the European Parliament, even though they know that even if we debate the issue here, nothing will happen and nothing will change for a long time. All we can do is repeatedly point out the injustices happening there and call on anyone who has contact with China to keep putting this issue on the agenda. After all, I believe one thing is quite clear: if everyone brings up this issue again and again, then China will be unable to ignore it and something must eventually happen. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, if Ms Rafah Nached is sentenced, then this really will be a sign of the despotism and brutality of the Syrian state, as well as its helplessness and paranoia, as a previous speaker has already said. After all, what does a state have to fear from a woman who is old and infirm and who is only doing her job by helping traumatised people? What is so dangerous about this? She has been accused of having a destabilising effect on the state. In this case, however, the government, the dictatorship, is completely at a loss and, in a completely misguided move, is attempting to make an example of her. As my colleague Mr Preda has already pointed out, we now find ourselves in the realms of the surreal. We all welcomed the Arab Spring and the democratisation of the region. Of course we Europeans are pleased to see such developments and are trying to support this movement, including though a variety of contacts. However, we must also protest when individuals are imprisoned without grounds. This is truly a violation of human rights, and we must not accept it. Gesine Meissner,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

Madam President, I am much obliged to the Commissioner for his presentation. Commissioner, you said that in this case, this proposal largely meets all Parliament’s demands. In my opinion, that is not the case, and also in my opinion, it is not the case either that all the privacy rights of passengers have been safeguarded. That is why we have just tabled an oral question on this. In fact, as Mr de Grandes Pascual stated, we had a report in which we discussed and set out what form scanners should take where these are permitted to be deployed as an additional security measure at airports. In this report, we also said that people must have a free choice as to whether or not they go through them. Health and human dignity must be protected; data and privacy must also be safeguarded. In fact, what has now been proposed is exactly what we did not want. We did not want to have scanners that show real images – whether or not these are blurred. I am familiar with these images; I have been to the US and have seen such scanners. I do not want something like that placed in Europe’s airports. These scanners do, in fact, allow quite a lot of a person’s body to be seen. To me it makes no difference whether or not the person looking at them is in another room and does not see the people in real life. It is a violation of privacy and intimacy, and we expressly discussed the fact that that is exactly what we do not want. Despite this, the Commission’s proposal now states that something along these lines is to be permitted in order to implement our decision. Naturally, we are upset about it. That is why we are asking you to reconsider. There is the option of having simple stick figures, as they are known – in other words, schematic illustrations; either a green OK or a stick figure with red dots – showing, for example, that an arm should be investigated because something suspicious is indicated there. That really is something that we would like, without images being stored. That would protect people’s privacy as well as protecting data. We are astonished, and we are not happy that something different is now being proposed. If the installation of something that is actually quite different is being considered, then we need a legislative process. We are talking about the citizens of Europe and that is why the representatives of these citizens need to be involved in a proper procedure. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, the honourable Member has said that he also wishes to protect privacy, but that he wants to avoid monopolies. Does he really believe – knowing the way the European market works – that if we want to have something on the market, such as a particular type of scanner, it will remain the case that only one company makes them? Does he not think that more companies would then start producing them simply in order to be able to compete for this market? Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
),

 The German Free Democratic Party delegation abstained from the final vote on the own-initiative report on European road safety 2011-2020. This non-legislative text contains a large number of recommendations for increasing safety on Europe’s roads. Naturally, we support this goal, as we also want to reduce the number of fatalities and injuries on the roads. Some measures are quite over the top, however; for example, the call for a general 30 km/h speed limit in built-up areas, the mandatory carrying of warning jackets for all vehicle occupants, or the use of rear-facing child seats for children under three years of age. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr President, I would like to respond directly to Ms Stassen, who is the only one so far to say that we do not actually need tourism in Europe. I believe that we do indeed need it, and, moreover, it will not undermine the competitiveness and autonomy of the individual Member States. It is indeed the case that Europe is currently the number one tourist destination in the world, and, naturally enough, we would like it to stay that way. We want it to stay that way with all the diversity that we have. The diversity that we have in Europe can be seen from the previous speeches. These alone have made it worthwhile to be part of this debate, because if anyone thinks that 10 days is sufficient in which to see Europe – thus, the Acropolis, the Tower of London, the Eiffel Tower and perhaps Neuschwanstein in Germany – he or she is mistaken. Europe offers much more and it has developed a great deal more in terms of tourism. I would now like to mention something in particular that we have in north Germany, where I come from. We have cycling tourism, we also have nature-oriented tourism, not only holidays on the farm, which certainly also awakens a real understanding of nature, but, for example, also tourism in very sensitive areas such as the Wadden Sea beside the North Sea. That is a globally unique area. There you can really see how, right next to main shipping routes, a very sensitive form of tourism can be developed that also awakens an understanding of the diversity of nature. This is something that we need more of. Something that has not had any, or very little, mention is the fact that we also have old mines and old industrial heritage sites, for example, that you can view and where you can learn a great deal about the history of Europe and the working environment. Thus, there is a very broad spectrum, and in that regard we ought to consider how we can bring this to the outside world and how we can maintain Europe as a very attractive tourist destination in future, too. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
).

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the White Paper, Commissioner Kallas sets out various possibilities for the future of transport. For instance, he describes how there is a need for incentive systems in order to give transport a more environmentally friendly form, and he also states that new sources of funding are needed, including, for example, in order to be able to work according to the ‘polluter pays’ principle. The Eurovignette Directive that we are debating today is one way that both of these points really can be achieved. This was a major Belgian effort, I believe we can say, begun under the Belgian Presidency of the Council with three important Belgians involved and, above all, because of the rapporteur, who succeeded in opening a door to the new routes. As it happens, I would have wished Belgium’s major effort greater success than what we now have. What we actually managed to achieve is a small and weak compromise. Although we do now have earmarking to a very limited extent – 15% of infrastructure costs and 15% of external costs must go to the TEN-T networks – it is really far too little. All national transport policy representatives say that we need considerable resources in order to be able to sustain our infrastructure networks. It is self-evident that the resources collected in this area should also be able to be invested there. That is a point on which we can all fail to be satisfied. The fact is that, in this connection, we have nonetheless taken a step in a direction in which we will be able to move further at a later date. That is also the reason why we intend to vote in favour of this compromise. It was a tough struggle, though. It very definitely could have been the case that we ended up with nothing at all on the table, since a few Member States would have preferred to have nothing at all. This is therefore a success, and it will have our backing in the vote today. (Applause) Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr President, I would first like to agree with Mr Verhofstadt. It is indeed shameful that these human rights debates, which are actually very important to us Europeans who believe in values, always take place on Thursday afternoons when most people have already left. I would like that noted in the record once more. It is something that we must change. Right now, however, we are talking about China and there we are more or less powerless, as has already been said. Mrs Lichtenberger spoke of a brick wall. Mr Posselt, I do not believe by the way that it is really in the Chinese interest – as you said – to help bring about a breakthrough in human rights. It is apparently not in the interest of the Chinese Government, although it is undoubtedly in the interest of the Chinese people. We are talking today about many people: Ai Weiwei and Liu Xiaobo have already been mentioned. We have frequently debated in the past how we can bring about a human rights breakthrough. It is not just a matter of instructing Baroness Ashton to speak out against the human rights abuses in China at every opportunity. All our foreign ministers and representatives must do so, and we need to stick together. I think that is the only way that we can actually have a small influence on China. Otherwise, as a strong economic power, China will play us off against each other and we will achieve nothing whatsoever. That would be a very bad thing, especially for the people concerned. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I would first of all like to offer my sincere thanks to Mr Simpson. In the Committee on Transport and Tourism, we know that, if our Chair prepares a report, we will not actually have anything to say against it. He always takes a great number of things into account, and the only thing we can say is: excellent Brian, we can support that. In this case, it has been variously said that it is a technical report. That sounds so boring. I do not find it at all boring. Although it is technical, it describes tourism, which really is a very important economic objective for us in Europe. It has already been mentioned that 40% of people worldwide travel to Europe. Thus, Europe is an important region for tourism, and therefore it is, of course, vital to know why these people travel to Europe. If, with our new competence under the Treaty of Lisbon, we now want to develop a new European framework, we must be familiar with the data and also be able to exchange this data in a harmonised way. That is the purpose of this report, and it also shows the new developments, for example, in terms of same-day visits or bicycle tourism. We also want to include our industrial heritage. All of this must be included in future so that we will really know how to set our objectives. Therefore, thank you very much – it is a good report and I believe we are able to support it. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr President, it has been very clear in the debate that violence against women is not a trivial offence; it is quite clearly a violation of human rights. It has already been said that even children are sometimes indirect victims of violence against women. They can even be direct victims of violence against women, because the main cause of still births and miscarriages is certainly the effects of violence against women. It is not only a question of domestic violence; there is also forced prostitution, honour killings – where there can actually be no question of honour – human trafficking, genital mutilation and much more besides. The trigger for this report, for which I am very grateful to Mrs Svensson, was, in this case, not only the fact that it was noticed in the context of the report on equality that equality is also put at serious risk as a result of violence against women, but also the fact that, through the Treaty of Lisbon, we now have the opportunity to enact a directive and to establish a common legal framework in Europe. That is urgently needed for us to make significant progress here, because this is a cross-border European problem that we must combat. Gesine Meissner,

Madam President, firstly I too would like to thank the rapporteur. We have already discussed the fact that, following the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament now has the opportunity to vote in favour of air service agreements of this kind or to reject them. We cannot change the contents, but we can accept or oppose them. This does not always make things simple, but it is at least a new task, which we are taking very seriously. It makes sense to replace a number of different bilateral agreements with one standardised EU agreement. It is clear that there are no boundaries in airspace, which is a good way of explaining this. The European Union is also a strong economic community and so it is sensible to discuss agreements made by the EU with different third countries, which is what we are doing now. We have a number of very different agreements on the table today. I will start with Vietnam. This is the least complex agreement. It concerns different accesses and services and also safety regulations, but it is a relatively short agreement, which is why I am only mentioning it briefly. The most comprehensive agreement is the one with Canada. In this agreement it was not just a case of ensuring free access to air services which can be used in different ways, but also of covering issues such as the environment, safety and also market access and ownership. In that respect we have long since passed the first stage of 25% and already reached the second stage of 49% ownership of each other’s air services market. Now we are about to enter stages 3 and 4. In stage 3 it is possible to establish airlines in another country and another region. Stage 4 would allow a European airline to fly from A to B within Canada. We have not come nearly as far as this with the USA, despite the fact that we have been negotiating with the USA for a long time. I would like to make one more point. Mr Kallas said that we were all very much in support of this issue, but in the case of the USA our reaction is more restrained, because the agreement does not represent a true partnership. The USA wants to take more from us than it is prepared to give. We need to continue negotiating on this. Apart from this issue, we will vote in favour, because it is clear that progress has been made. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 In today’s vote on the text of the directive on consumer rights, some members of the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament abstained. The compromise adopted undoubtedly contains many improvements on the original draft from the European Commission. For example, we have succeeded in ensuring that small businesses are not affected by most of the new rules or burdened with additional bureaucracy. However, the text adopted today also contains rules that would heavily burden companies without increasing consumer protection. Article 5, for example, will mean that a company will have to provide very extensive pre-contractual information even when goods are purchased in store. This will hardly benefit consumers, as they can assess the product directly in the shop. Article 22a places companies under obligation, in the case of distance contracts, to supply their goods to customers in any Member State. Such an obligation contradicts the freedom of contract and exposes small and medium-sized enterprises in particular to considerable legal and financial risks. Furthermore, the FDP was unable to succeed in its core demand for the complete deletion of Chapters IV and V of the directive. The FDP calls for these provisions to be amended during the trilogue negotiations with the Council and Commission. Gesine Meissner,

 Mr President, we have just spoken about natural disasters in the previous agenda item. In this case, it was a force of nature that brought air traffic to a complete standstill. Eyjafjallajökull – everyone probably knows of this volcano now – erupted last year and brought a large proportion of air traffic to a complete standstill. Incidentally, I just noticed once again during the previous speech that we have an excellent chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, because what he said is very similar to what I wanted to say. I will now try to change my speech somewhat. It was indeed chaos – Mr Simpson has already said that. As Europeans, with high-tech capabilities and with so much already coordinated, we were, in fact, helpless when it came to dealing with this disaster and finding solutions to it. We realised that there were too few agreements in place. We then set up a task force. The questions that concerned us with regard to this issue were whether the task force actually has any valid results already that could be discussed and has it published any studies? I do not know of any at least. Have all of the international experts on such volcanic eruptions actually been consulted? After all, as we already discussed here in plenary last year, there are other parts of the world where volcanic eruptions are much more frequent than in Europe and they somehow manage to have up-to-date data and to coordinate the whole situation. There is also something else that causes me concern. On 4 May, it was also mentioned in the Council of transport ministers that we need a linked-up European transport system. That can, of course, help in such cases. How far have we come in terms of being able to respond better in the event of a further volcanic eruption? We cannot predict this, of course. It will just happen. I have one further question: do we know exactly what technology we would need to be able to deal with this situation better? In Germany, we now have appropriate devices at all weather stations that collect the data and are able to pass on this up-to-date data very quickly to the people responsible at the airlines and also to pilots so that they can decide whether or not it is safe to fly. One further point which has not been mentioned yet but which I think is important in this context is the following: this ash crisis, and the subsequent problems it posed for the air transport industry, affected 10 million passengers and, of course, also many companies. Some passengers were stranded and were unable to continue their journeys. The question therefore arises as to how things stand with regard to passengers’ rights. We have rights for air passengers, but I have the impression that, in this case, they have not always been fully utilised. Perhaps we should also revise these passenger rights once more. There are a lot of questions here. Mr Hahn, I do not know whether you will be able to answer them now, as transport is not actually your area. Otherwise, I am sure that the questions I raised in addition to the written question can be answered later. You will notice that this subject is of great concern to us. After all, the air transport industry is very important, and we therefore need a Single European Sky. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 In the vote on the Lange report, I am abstaining on paragraph 31 because of the ambiguous wording of the vote, which refers to Eurobonds as well as project bonds. However, taking it as a whole, I am voting for the report, as I have nothing against project bonds in themselves. Project bonds serve as finance for extensive innovation, infrastructure and reindustrialisation projects. This is not a question of instruments for the communitarisation of debts, as would be the case with Eurobonds. Gesine Meissner,

 Mr President, a long procedure has now come to an end, which is good news. There are some positive aspects to all of this. One is that the basic rights for people with disabilities include the right to information and the right to access. Another positive feature is that the damages paid by small and medium-sized businesses have been kept to a reasonable level, which was not originally the case. It is also good that we have reached an agreement, because otherwise, we would have been stuck in the conciliation procedure and there would have been no regulations at all covering one specific area of transport. However, I would also like to pick up on some negative points, as we have not been able to produce a genuine European solution. Although we say that the free movement of people, goods and services is a European principle, we have not reached a European solution in this area, if three countries are not included and other countries do not have bus routes of this length. The right of people with disabilities to be accompanied, which is something they often need in order to be able to travel, is only guaranteed over long distances. In addition, the clause on major natural disasters, which does not apply to air travel, because damages had to be paid in the case of the ash cloud, has been applied to buses and coaches. This means that poorer passengers in particular who are making short journeys will not be compensated and have no rights. That, of course, is not a good thing. Therefore, because of this mix of positive and negative features, we abstained from voting during the midnight session in the conciliation procedure and we will do the same today. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, I would like to explain why the majority of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has abstained from voting on this directive. It is good that we have made a decision and that the rights of people with disabilities are being respected. However, that is only the case over longer distances. Many of the other points are not worthy of a European directive. For example, because the directive only covers journeys over 250 kilometres, there are many countries where it does not apply. Cyprus, Malta and Luxembourg have no rights, in just the same way as some other Member States which do not have bus routes that are longer than 250 kilometres. The free movement of people, goods and services is one of Europe’s central principles. Now it is the poorer passengers who are not protected, because some Member States have no system of passengers’ rights. This is why we have abstained. There are some positive aspects, but also many negative aspects, and this is the reason for our abstention. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
),

 This regulation is a step in the right direction as it creates an EU set of rights for bus passengers. However, except for some basic rights, it applies to regular services equal to, or longer than, 250 km. Such a limited scope can hardly be a basis for truly European legislation in the interest of all bus passengers and ALDE cannot support such a deal. We also oppose the force majeure
 clause exempting carriers from the obligation to provide accommodation for passengers in case of cancellations or delays if these are caused by severe weather conditions or major natural disasters, as it can set a precedent for other EU passenger rights legislation. Even though this is not a triumph, it is an improvement, especially for travellers with disabilities and reduced mobility. We managed to ensure non-discriminatory access conditions, disability-related training for the staff of carriers and terminal authorities who deal directly with passengers and compensation for damage or loss of mobility equipment on all routes, regardless of distance. Keeping that in mind, and with a view to creating a harmonised EU set of rights for all passengers, we did not oppose the agreement and abstained in the final vote. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mrs Malmström, we definitely do not need walls to resolve the asylum problem. A proposal was made to erect a wall, which is why I have chosen to speak. Anyone who says something of this kind has completely failed to understand European values. For us, this is all about protecting fundamental rights and human rights. We cannot say about people who have fled from their country and sought asylum in Europe, for whatever reason, and about people who have voluntarily climbed into an overcrowded boat and put their lives at risk: ‘We want to send these people back before they have even arrived’. We need sensible asylum processes for these people which function properly. We cannot leave the southern European countries, where these people arrive, to cope with the problem alone. I agree completely with my colleague, Mrs Hirsch, on that point. From another perspective, it is wrong to say that we want all these people to stay outside Europe and we do not want to take them in. Demographic change is taking place in Europe and in future, we will need integration and also asylum seekers who want to stay here. This is not just an issue of humanity, but also of common sense. For this reason, we need to come up with solutions to this problem quickly. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

Madam President, I have now been in Parliament for a year and I have dealt with various dossiers, but none of them have been as difficult as what we have on the table here. At this point, I would like to offer my sincere thanks once again to Mrs Mathieu and Mr Cercas, the two rapporteurs from the relevant committees. This really is a very difficult matter, and the reason for this is that naturally we have very high ideals in Europe. We want to treat everyone who lives and works here fairly and equally. That, in principle, is something we can all agree on as a starting point. However, the question remains as to how much we can really implement this in detail. We have already been reminded that with the Treaty of Lisbon, we now wish to draw up a common policy on asylum and migration. Asylum policy is something close to our hearts, and not just because of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. We also need a migration policy for economic reasons, because demographic changes are taking place and we have a very urgent need not just for highly qualified workers, but also for less skilled workers. Basically, the great difficulty here is what to do. As has already been said – Mrs in ’t Veld mentioned it – the Member States stated back in 1990 in Tampere that they wanted to develop a common structure. Nothing has yet been placed on the table. In other words, what we have today is a compromise – we are not completely happy with it, but in my view, it is a way for us to move forward. Speaking personally, I can well understand why some are saying that we need more time for discussion. I am not completely happy with it either. It is particularly important to me, for example, that everyone should have access to training and further education, because this is absolutely crucial – not just for the persons concerned, so that they can work in the labour market, but also for us with our real need for workers. In the case of social security, for example, where we already have so many different systems anyway that have not even been harmonised within the EU, it raises the question of how we can really create a common set of rights for third country nationals in all cases even if we want to. It is difficult, and that is why I see the compromise that is currently on the table as a good thing. We really should vote in favour; then at least we will have something. Gesine Meissner,

 Mr President, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn, the arrival of a container full of trainers on an island somewhere, which was received enthusiastically by the residents, has in the past made headline news. In another case, a contingent of rubber ducks floated ashore. These are, of course, the pleasant examples of ships’ cargoes going missing, but the fact is that in many cases lost containers can cause serious damage. It has become clear that we must do something about this. The Dutch Government was concerned about this problem and set up an investigation to find out why it was happening. The investigation identified a number of causes. Although there are EU regulations which specify how cargoes should be secured and although all ships have the manual containing the regulations on board, only 46% of ships have their cargoes properly lashed down. This means that we do not need any new rules. You were right about that, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn. In many cases, the weight of the cargo has not been correctly balanced. Another reason is that many crews in the short sea shipping sector unlash cargoes before they have reached their destination to speed up the unloading process. Stacking errors can also be a cause of the problem, together with old or damaged equipment. All of this can, of course, have a major impact on the environment. Around 70% of items lost from ships at sea sink to the bottom, but this gives rise to the question of what damage they are causing on the sea bed. A total of 15% of the goods reach land. The remaining 15% float around in the ocean and obviously represent a major hazard for other ships, platforms and the environment. This means that when accidents happen at sea we must investigate the extent to which containers were involved. Then we need to speak to shipping companies and port operators to ensure that they comply with the regulations. In addition, regular inspections must be made. Two thousand containers really are too many and I think that carrying out feasibility studies would take too long. We must take immediate action, because the situation simply cannot go on as it is. Gesine Meissner,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn, ladies and gentlemen, I wish that the Chamber were full to bursting, not on my account or because this is my first report, but because of the subject matter, which is unfamiliar to many people, but nevertheless highly important. Hardly anyone has heard of integrated maritime policy, but it is a decisive subject for us all, because it really is true that our future lies in the sea. A total of 70% of the earth’s surface consists of water. Population levels are growing, not in Europe, but throughout the rest of the world and by 2050 they will have reached 9 billion. The earth is becoming too small and many experts have already discovered the significant potential of the oceans. Our objective must now be to keep the resources of the seas safe for future generations by means of the integrated maritime policy. So far only 10% of the oceans and their resources have been explored, but we already have 50 000 products which come from the sea. Efforts are now being made to produce energy from the sea and to extract raw materials for medicines, cosmetics and industry. While we are developing our overall maritime policy, it is important to ensure that the sea does not strike back, as it did in a sensational novel by bestselling author Frank Schätzing. We have the opportunity to turn the maritime economy into the largest area of growth in our economy as a whole. For this reason, people are talking today not only about green jobs, but also about blue jobs and blue growth. The coastline of the EU is 23 000 kilometres in length and one third of the population lives by the sea. Green shipping and offshore energy are areas where Europe has extensive expertise which can be developed further. For this reason, we need an integrated approach so that we can achieve all of these objectives with great care. Which individual areas are covered by integrated maritime policy? The first of these areas is transport. Shipping can be described as the powerhouse of European transport, because 95% of global trade and 40% of internal European trade travels by sea, via ports with hinterland connections and logistics. Further growth is being forecast and therefore we must ensure in particular that we can reduce emissions by developing greener ships. The next area is shipbuilding. We have a great deal of expertise in this field, as I have already mentioned. We must make sure that we use this expertise productively to secure existing jobs and create new ones. Of course, maritime policy also includes fisheries and aquaculture. Fish are not just a source of food. In addition, aquaculture is the area of agriculture and fisheries which is showing the highest levels of growth. It is important for us to be aware of this. In the field of energy there is a great deal happening on and around the sea. We have oil and gas pipelines, oil platforms and offshore wind farms and there are already plans to fit tankers with sails so that they can cut their energy consumption by 20% by using wind energy. Wave power is an area with future potential and microalgae, which can be used as biomass, represent an almost unlimited source of energy. In the area of research there is a focus on using blue biotechnology to develop medicines. We already have painkillers and anti-malaria drugs and work is currently underway on cancer medicines. Protecting our coasts is an important issue which is also covered by integrated maritime policy. Our coasts are threatened by storm tides and we need to protect them, not only against the tides, but also against oil, piracy and smuggling. In addition, we must deal with the problem of asylum seekers in Italy. Finally our coasts are also, of course, very popular tourist destinations and we are working on developing a sustainable tourism concept for the coastline. You can see that there are many individual areas involved here, all of which are related to water. The objective of the integrated maritime policy is to develop these areas carefully and in harmony by working together. Many people are not aware of this, but it is hugely important. The European Union has already achieved a great deal in this respect, but it needs to do even more. For this reason, I have focused in this report not so much on the individual areas, but primarily on what has happened in the last few years since the 2007 Blue Paper was published, what still needs to be developed and what has to be continued. These are the areas which I will mention again briefly in my conclusion. Gesine Meissner,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I think it is good that you have been counting, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn. I did not know how many speeches had been made, but 37 really is a lot. I would like to thank everyone who has taken part in the debate today. Right at the beginning, I also forgot to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their work. We really have worked together very constructively and I enjoyed it very much. I have covered a lot of subjects in the report, because it is very important to me to have a convincing majority in this crucial area. Many of the speeches on different subjects have highlighted the fact that we need joint action on research, planning, implementation and control of maritime activities by means of joint governance, spatial planning and monitoring. This is what the report is all about. However, it is a very varied subject. I should now like to discuss a few of the speeches. Mr Fleckenstein raised the problem of the sulphur emissions. We have included it in the report because it was important to us that there is no distortion of competition, but we also need to make sure that shipping is more environmentally friendly. However, what you said about shipbuilding, Mr Fleckenstein, is not quite true. It is not the case that the Liberals and the Conservatives did not want to include this. It was simply a question of how we should implement it, of whether we should create a new fund at a European level for refitting old ships or whether we should put in place a strategy. That is the current wording. The subject of my amendment was also raised, which I introduced in order to include emissions trading in the report. In the committee it was rejected by a very small margin, but in my opinion we are all convinced that we must continue to follow this route. For this reason, I am hoping for support in these areas. Mr Kohlíček, you said that it was difficult to link all the areas together, but I know that this is possible. A group of stakeholders and business people from all the different maritime areas meets twice a year to share ideas. These are prominent players at a European level and they all very much value the opportunity to come together. My last point concerns the reference to the fact that there are so many different regions. I have included the position of islands in the report and it is not true that this has been omitted. The only area not covered by the strategies is the North Sea. I live closest to the North Sea and, therefore, I wanted to mention that when we talk about the Black Sea, the Mediterranean and the Danube, we should not forget the North Sea. Finally I would like to express my thanks, in particular for the remark that we should take moral responsibility for the sea and for future generations. This is why I have chosen the title ‘We need a new awareness of the sea’. If we continue to work on this, we will be able to achieve a great deal. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking today about the working conditions of women, which we want to improve in Europe. I will specifically address the Thomsen report, for which I was shadow rapporteur; in other words, the subject of ‘precarious women workers’. This year is the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion. It is an established fact that poverty disproportionately affects women. Naturally, we cannot, on any account, allow this to remain the case. Poverty among women may be the result of various things. It may result from the fact that women are not paid as well as men. Naturally, that is not the only cause. Women also take more career breaks, for example, when they have children and take time off to bring them up. Women also perform the lower skilled jobs. Things are particularly serious in the case of women whose employment conditions are precarious, because in some cases, they may not even have an employment contract or may have irregular employment contracts; they may have no protection whatsoever and they may have little access to information. The situation is particularly bad for women with a background of migration. This can lead to the poverty continuing, so that they also end up poor in old age. We need to break out of this spiral, which affects women more than men. One of the ways this can be done is through education and training. Every woman – every girl – needs to get a qualification, whatever their background, and they need access to a profession which will genuinely secure them a proper living. Lifelong learning must generally be possible for women too. We also need to ensure that we have more women and girls going into the better paid professions. These are frequently the professions that are more heavily dominated by men. In other words, access to education in any event, and access to social security systems – that way, we can achieve many improvements for women. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, you have stated that human rights are core values in the European Union. Last December, we proudly signed off on the Treaty of Lisbon and the legally binding Convention on Human Rights associated with it. What you have said is absolutely correct and of vital importance: we must defend these human rights at every turn and we must also allow these principles to guide our trade activities. As you have pointed out, this is a difficult matter. However, as has already been stated, a list of camps producing laogai products already exists. I have a book here with all the relevant information. It shows which prison manufactures which products and under which trade name. Hence, it is possible to research this issue. That is why, for example, the Laogai Research Foundation, which is active both internationally and within Europe – I say this for the benefit of President Müller, who is with us here today – has written to Commissioner De Gucht to ask him to enable the UN Special Envoy to visit the camps of his choice and to examine the question of whether it is possible to halt tariff preferences for such products on a temporary basis, following the example of the US, which is somewhat more courageous on this issue than we are. I would like to know what progress has been made with the Commission’s promised investigation into this issue? (Applause) Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
).

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by addressing a matter that our shadow rapporteur, Mr Kacin, was unable to mention due to a lack of time, but which he nevertheless feels is very important. It is imperative, in this connection, not only to investigate the causes of accidents but also to protect victims and their families. My group, in particular, has spoken out very strongly in favour of information regarding the circumstances of accidents being provided quickly, at least to the relatives, and in favour of this information also being provided in the case of same-sex partnerships. In general, we have already noted that the report drawn up by the rapporteur is indeed a groundbreaking one. We cannot praise it enough. The fact of the matter is that the previous directive is 16 years old. Many technical developments have been made in the meantime and we need better aviation safety. In order to be able to investigate accidents, we need information that can be independently assessed. The United States has had an independent investigation agency of this kind for a long time, as well as the guarantee of protection if someone gives evidence that could later be used against that person as a party involved. We have now achieved this. I would like to thank Mrs De Veyrac most sincerely for her excellent work. Gesine Meissner,

 Mr President, we live in a Europe where we want people to be able to live together happily and to have access to all areas of life that are important to them. As you know very well, we are experiencing demographic change in Europe. In future, there will be fewer people living in many areas than there are now. Nevertheless, we want all citizens to be provided with the services that they require and that they need in order to be able to have their say. This includes – very importantly – the postal service, which is to be guaranteed by means of a universal service. Firstly, there is the question of how we can ensure the provision of the service in remote rural areas with little money in the coffer, and at affordable prices. We also need people to deliver this post who are paid a reasonable wage for doing so. That is not a simple task for the Member States. However, we have decided that that is what we want and you, Commissioner, have indicated that a large majority of the Member States have also agreed to it. We now also need to make it possible for users to complain. I can see a problem with this. It has not yet been mentioned. However, the directive states that if something goes wrong, citizens should have a body they can complain to. It is not so easy, either, to maintain the appropriate infrastructure in this regard, particularly where there are not many people. Commissioner Barnier, you said that you are still new to this office and that you will at least take everything into account. I believe you. However, you have to understand that we are extremely sceptical, particularly in the Committee on Transport and Tourism. Mr Simpson said that the same thing happened in the case of the railway package – the previous Commission was responsible for monitoring its implementation – practically nothing was implemented and nothing happened. In other areas, too, things have not always proceeded in the way we would have liked them to. I know that, because I was also previously in politics in Germany. Decisions are made which are extremely good and which everyone is agreed on, and then no one thinks to check to see whether it is implemented and whether it is implemented quickly in the interests of the people of Europe and in the interests of workers. That is what we want from you. Therefore, show us that we can trust you. We will be very pleased if that turns out to be justified. Gesine Meissner,

 Mr President, as a previous speaker rightly said, it is important that passengers’ rights are protected in Europe, regardless of what mode of transport they are using. It is simply a logical conclusion for us to move from air and rail transport to passengers’ rights on ships, buses and coaches. Yet another speaker has already mentioned the fact that we have unfortunately not succeeded in dealing with both subjects as a package, as we had originally planned. Although we were able to reach a compromise on the rights of passengers on ships and complete the trialogue, this was sadly not the case with bus and coach transport. I would like to look specifically at the rights of bus and coach passengers, because I am also the shadow rapporteur in this area. I very much regret that we have not managed to achieve a compromise, because in the trialogue meeting, we were able to bring the position of the Council, on the one hand, and the positions of the European Parliament and the Commission, on the other, much closer together. We were concerned – and this is also very important – about protecting passengers’ rights; above all, we wanted to ensure that people with restricted mobility and with disabilities can always make use of transport, including buses and coaches. A range of measures are needed to make this possible and this is what we have been calling for. I believe that this is particularly important because in future, there will be more people with disabilities and restricted mobility, simply as a result of the ageing population. This is a very important point. Of course, we must also take into account the fact that consumers’ rights involve having an offering available. In particular, those small and medium-sized companies which provide coach trips are not able to do everything. For example, they cannot provide unlimited compensation. There is also the question of how they will cope with advance payments. We managed to bring our positions closer together in this area and this is why I regret the fact that we have been unable to reach an overall compromise. As the rapporteur said, it is important that we consider both passengers’ rights and the options open to transport providers. I would very much like to see some sort of agreement reached during the forthcoming mediation process, because I agree absolutely with Mr Simpson when he says that the exclusion of buses and coaches is unacceptable, given that other means of transport are covered by the regulation.

 Mr President, I believe that Mr Koch is right when he says that intelligent transport systems will take us into a new era. In the last year, I have come across lorries that can talk to one another. It sounds crazy, but this really is the intelligent transport management system of the future. Special devices enable lorries to identify for safety reasons whether there is an obstacle or a pedestrian crossing the road in front of them. They can then pass the information to the lorry travelling behind, so that it can brake in good time and prevent an accident from occurring. Of course, this is not yet on the agenda. In this case, the major benefit of Mrs Jensen’s report is that it gives us an overview of the current situation and an insight into what we will need in future in order to improve safety, prevent congestion, reduce accidents and take more effective action on the environment. My final point concerns something which I have experienced myself near Hanover in Germany. On the motorway, there is an intelligent transport system consisting of variable speed limits. These tell drivers what speed they should travel at in order to prevent traffic jams. This is good for drivers and for the environment and also reduces the number of accidents. We need systems of this kind and much more. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
).

 Mr President, Mr Kallas referred to a European maritime transport space without barriers. I believe that this is something that we all want. We also need it urgently and this report is another step in the right direction. It is a fact that 95% of our exports and 40% of intra-European goods are transported by sea and therefore pass through ports. For this reason, it is clearly absolutely essential for administrative procedures to be simplified and harmonised within this growth area. This report will meet both these objectives, which is why it cannot be praised highly enough. I regret the fact that Mr Sterckx was not able to achieve everything. Two points which were very close to his heart and which many other Members supported, as we have heard, are the simplification of the pilot licensing system, because this would be a really sensible, practical solution, and the lack of a common language. I believe that English really is the right language. It is unacceptable for accidents to happen in which people can even lose their lives simply because many seafarers speak different languages. It would be much better to introduce a common language in this very environmentally friendly area of transport, in just the same way as in the air transport industry. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, this has really been an afternoon devoted to transport and this is the report which basically summarises everything. Many people say that the greatest achievement made on behalf of the citizens of Europe is the internal market. As Mr Kallas has said, the transport routes are the arteries of the internal market. Therefore, it is, of course, important to ensure that these transport routes are safe, that they are developed in an environmentally friendly way, and that we take a general look at what can be improved in future using intelligent transport systems, for example. We must think about how we can structure the more environmentally friendly areas, such as rail and sea transport, in a more effective way, how we can move more transport away from the roads and into these areas, and how we can reduce the environmental impact of the emissions from sea transport. At the same time, we must also consider how to meet the specific needs of urban transport, which are very different from those of international transport. The future of urban transport may lie with managers who travel on e-bikes that also provide them with exercise. Of course, we need quite different options over longer distances, which would also fulfil a cross-border function. This is a good and very forward-looking report. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
),

 Providing consumers with information about food is undoubtedly important. However, the debate in Brussels has become a lobbying battle between large companies from the food industry and consumer protection organisations. There was no place in this debate for the reality of everyday life for consumers. The representatives of the German Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament are in favour of a minimum of labelling. Consumers should be able to make their purchasing decisions on the basis of transparent, legible information. Colour coded labelling influences consumers and does not form the basis for transparent information. The so-called guideline daily amounts (GDAs) also have their weak points. Instead of having neutral information about the amounts of nutrients per 100 grams or millilitres printed legibly on packaging, Parliament discussed whether the daily requirements of a 40-year-old woman could be used as the point of reference or whether the colour coding of nutrients was a useful decision-making tool. The proposed, far-reaching, mandatory requirements for the origin labelling of ingredients cannot be implemented in practice. We have also rejected the idea of special national provisions, because the labelling system should, as far as possible, be standardised. For these reasons, we were not able to vote in favour of the proposed report. Gesine Meissner,

 Mr President, Mrs Georgieva, you have presented this existing agreement and have said that there has been significant progress. We in Parliament take a less generous approach than you, as you have already heard. It is important that this agreement is in place, because the EU and the USA together account for about 60% of global air traffic and the USA is an important partner of ours in general terms. The problem is simply that, in a partnership, the conditions for both partners should be roughly the same. However, it is not possible to say that the conditions are the same when the USA has a 49% share of our market and we are only allowed about a 25% share of theirs. It is clear that this represents an imbalance. A small delegation went to the USA and took part in negotiations in the spring of this year. The Americans said to us that, if we wanted greater market access, we would have to lift the limitations on night flights and change the noise restrictions. We explained that for us, this is a question of subsidiarity which has to be respected. Basically, we can only negotiate on other issues if we have a reasonably level playing field. Four points were mentioned. The environment: we can make some joint progress via the emissions trading system, simply because we have such a large share of the world market. Social standards: something has been achieved in this area and passengers’ rights were also mentioned. Competition: this still leaves something to be desired. As far as security is concerned, I would now like to talk about data. The American concept of data protection and privacy is different from ours. We understandably want our concept of privacy to be respected. We looked at the body scanners while we were in the USA. There, it is normal for the scanners to show an image of the entire body, with only the face being concealed. This was completely inconceivable to us. We want privacy and data to be protected in every case. This has to be respected. We in Parliament, with our new powers from the Treaty of Lisbon, will be happy to discuss this with you. Gesine Meissner,

 Mr President, Mrs Georgieva, you have now moved from air travel to rail travel, which is our second subject this evening. I must say that it is often the case in politics that fine words are followed by actions that leave a lot to be desired and that is what has happened here. In the European Union, we have a lot of excellent objectives. We have already achieved some of them, but others we are far from fulfilling. There is still a great deal to be done with regard to the internal transport market and rail transport in particular. We had good intentions, but we have to ask ourselves whether the European Union is a paper tiger. Or perhaps we do not have the wherewithal to get to where we want to go? In the past, competition on the rail market has been very varied. We need an independent regulatory body. This has functioned quite well for the rail system in Germany, but that does not mean that there is no room for improvement. We really need the option of dividing up the lines independently, so that everything runs smoothly and there can be real competition. That is one of the points that I wanted to make. It is, of course, embarrassing for us that, out of the 27 Member States, only the United Kingdom, Finland and the Netherlands have implemented the directive. The two Member States which have no railway system – Malta and Cyprus – were obviously unable to do so. All the others have not done their homework and have obviously got away with it, because we have not reprimanded them. Therefore, it is important for the European Union to put in place appropriate sanction mechanisms, otherwise we will not be taken seriously. It is also important to make it clear to the Member States that everyone will benefit from this. In principle, everyone wants the rail market to be opened up to competition. That is what everyone says. However, when it comes to taking action, nothing much happens. We must make progress on the finances. It finally became clear in Saragossa recently that there is a general lack of funding available. It could be our job to subsidise cross-border projects and we must, of course, call on the Member States to do more. We know that the situation is difficult everywhere at the moment, but this is what Europe needs. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
).

Madam President, we have heard a great deal already. It is true, as Mrs Figueiredo said, that this is a directive that was intended to be aimed at employees. That is correct. However, there are also self-employed people who are not classed as employees. It is important for people in Europe to be able to decide how they want to work – whether as an employee or as a self-employed worker. That is only right. Naturally, the self-employed also have to play by certain rules. Digital tachographs are already present in all heavy goods vehicles and the equivalent vehicles that we are talking about here. If we were now to include self-employed workers in this directive, it would unduly restrict their freedom of choice. That is why my group is in favour of excluding the self-employed from this directive at all costs. We consider Mrs Bauer’s proposal, and the proposal from the Commission, to be right. That should be taken into account. We want to protect small and medium-sized businesses, and in this case, we can do so by adopting the proposal. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Madam President, Commissioner, we are in complete agreement about the need for an internal market in rail freight transport as well. This is very important. We have had this on paper for a long time, but unfortunately we do not yet have it in practice. If we still have a few differences of opinion, that is due to the fact that we have different experiences in the various Member States in terms of the functioning or non-functioning of the rail network. I come from Germany, where it would be terrible if freight transport took priority over passenger transport. That would have a very negative effect on local public passenger transport. At the same time, we are very well aware that we need a continuous system in Europe. This is something that we want as well as need. There is just the question of how it will be implemented, how many corridors it will have and then, of course, also who will now lay down the one-stop shop rules, who will allocate the train paths. There are completely different opinions on this. Some people think that we would create a parallel system if we had a one-stop shop per corridor and not functional national one-stop shops, which should perhaps be included. That is the only source of dissent that we have. Otherwise, we all agree that we need this freight transport in Europe. Gesine Meissner,

 Madam President, Commissioner, we have already held a debate about the ash cloud and the associated problems for aviation in the immediate aftermath of the volcanic eruption. We observed various things in this crisis. We observed, for one thing, that aviation really is essential for the transport sector, as it is not only passengers that get stranded, but goods, too, can be left untransported. In Germany, for example, BMW had some production bottlenecks due to not receiving deliveries. We observed that we need every mode of transport, including aviation. For another thing, we observed that it is a significant crisis for the airlines if it is not possible to fly for several days. A five-day break, the airlines said, could be coped with. A 20-day break, however, could perhaps have caused a collapse of the entire industry lasting quite some time. We need not talk about compensation just yet, the airlines themselves said, but if it had lasted longer, that would have been necessary. Passenger rights have been subject to varying comments from different speakers. They have now put to the test the rule that, in such extraordinary cases, too, everything can be done for passengers in relation to information, compensation and recompense to the extent that they need it and in the way we originally laid it down here. There are still two subjects in particular that I would like to go into. The first is the Single European Sky. We do not have a single European airspace, and that is something that was painfully absent this time, too. A single European airspace clearly would not have prevented the volcanic eruption, we all know that, but we would certainly have been better able to bring about the smooth evacuation of passengers. We have appointed a Functional Airspace Blocks (FAB) coordinator, of course. He is now starting work, and we all very much hope that his work will relatively soon be able to lead to a single European airspace. The question is also how long will it take until we actually achieve this? Perhaps you are not in a position to answer that precisely. We have also discussed before whether better European coordination of the railway sector – something that we have long been wanting and, on paper, have long had – could have helped passengers to get home more quickly. In this regard, too, we observed quite clearly where our difficulties lie. I will now move on to my final question. Do we have good crisis management arrangements for cases like this? We have the institute in London, which is actually there to provide information when there are earthquakes. It also deals with volcanic eruptions as a secondary responsibility. Now it has been producing computer projections based on second-hand data, and it has been criticised for that. What can we learn from other parts of the world where volcano eruptions are more common, such as the United States, Indonesia and others? What other measurements do they take? According to my information, they are better prepared for such situations. Perhaps we had not planned for this in Europe, but we do then have to learn the resultant lessons. We are a hi-tech location, we have a lot of opportunities, and researchers in Germany, for example, have called for a specialised monitoring network for those aerosols, those minuscule items, that volcanic ash contains. What else do you think that we can do? How can we improve our technologies in the interests of aviation, the people and goods? Jürgen Creutzmann,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European single market, Europe’s greatest achievement, is celebrating its 20th anniversary. Border-free travel, work and study, a huge market for businesses and consumers: the single market gives us more freedoms and is a driver of trade and productivity. However, the benefit that the European Union derives from the single market could be doubled if further barriers to trade – especially in the service sector – were to be removed by promoting the digital single market and integrating infrastructure. If we examine infrastructure in the single market, two things become clear. Firstly, it is fragmented: few countries place a priority on cross-border links. Let us take the example of rail traffic: a goods train travelling from Italy to Sweden has to change its locomotive and crew up to four times. Secondly, the integration of national systems is extremely costly. Physical and regulatory hurdles must be overcome. The Commission’s proposals currently being discussed for trans-European transport, energy and telecommunications networks address these and other problems. However, these ambitious aims can only be achieved if enough money is made available. Investments in infrastructure are the best use of EU funds, because they encourage sustainable growth, employment and European competitiveness. This is why it is so important that the Member States, as part of the ongoing negotiations over the multiannual financial framework, do not make any cuts in the Connecting Europe Facility. SMEs must also benefit more from the European single market. Ninety-nine per cent of European enterprises are SMEs, but only 25 % export within the single market. The further completion of the single market holds no dangers for Member States. On the contrary, it is an opportunity for more growth, more jobs and thereby more prosperity for people in Europe. Jürgen Creutzmann,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in many political areas we already speak with a single European voice at international level. Unfortunately, this is not true with regard to external energy policy. It is regrettable that the Commission’s proposal and the ambitious position of Parliament were rejected by the Member States. In formal terms the Council may be right in claiming that the European Union does not have executive powers. However, it must be clear to all of us that we must all pull together in the energy sector if we are to meet the challenges of security of supply and affordable energy in the long term. As globalisation progresses and various actors in the energy markets flex their muscles, even the large Member States must realise that in the long run we can only succeed by acting in concert. This is even more the case for the smaller Member States. We knew from the start that our parliamentary position was very ambitious. We had to expect resistance. However, it gives one pause to realise that the Council saw no room for negotiations. Having weighed up all the options, we can agree to the results of the negotiations. After all, we have the opportunity to agree at least a legal framework, a basis on which we can build in a few years’ time. I believe that this is better than a failed legislative text that would have forced us to start again from scratch next time around. For this reason, we will vote against the amendments tabled by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament. I would like to express my sincere thanks again to the rapporteurs for their commitment and for their efforts to support the Commission in this. Jürgen Creutzmann,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the protection of intellectual property rights is of life and death importance to the European economy. Increasingly frequent infringements of rights and the constantly increasing trade in rights-infringing products threaten the growth of our economy and, with it, also jobs. Counterfeit products damage not only the industry affected, but can also represent a serious threat to the health and safety of consumers. This is often forgotten when this matter is discussed. The customs authorities at the EU’s external borders are in a comparatively favourable position to retain rights-infringing products before they reach the internal market. That is why it is so important that this regulation should be adapted to meet the new challenges of our times. The Commission has recognised the need for action and produced a sound proposal last year in which it extended the scope of the regulation, increased legal certainty for transiting goods, and put forward a special procedure for small consignments in view of the burgeoning online trade in counterfeit products. In my view, however, there is still considerable potential to further improve the conditions for the affected actors. I am referring, in this regard in particular, to the customs authorities, rights holders and consumers. With my report, I pursued four goals; namely, increasing protection for consumers, relieving the burden on customs authorities, strengthening the position of rights holders and observing data protection. With regard to the first objective, in contrast to the oft-cited view, the enforcement of intellectual property rights is in the interests of consumers more than anyone. This is because counterfeit products generally do not meet the statutory requirements and are generally not subject to any quality control. As a result, these products often endanger the health and safety of consumers. During our committee’s consultation, we were shown horrific pictures of consumers seriously disfigured after using counterfeit toiletries. It is not going too far to say that counterfeit products can even put people’s lives at risk. By way of example, one German carmaker brought to my attention the deadly risk that counterfeit braking systems entail. With regard to the second objective, the customs authorities can only effectively enforce the various intellectual property rights if they can quickly and efficiently instigate proceedings. We therefore put forward a series of proposals in order to ease the work of the customs authorities. In principle, a procedure to destroy the goods and launch proceedings that is as standardised and simplified as possible should be used for all cases of infringed rights. The procedure proposed by our committee makes it possible to destroy products without a court having to determine an infringement of rights, provided that the rights holder confirms the infringement and – a very important detail – that neither the party reporting the infringement nor the holder of the goods objects. This ensures the protection of rights and a procedure in accordance with the rule of law. Moreover, the special procedure for small consignments makes it easier to destroy goods, as the customs authority no longer needs to contact the rights holder in each individual case. This is of benefit both to the customs authorities and the rights holders. The conditions for information exchange between customs authorities in the Union and the competent authorities in third countries should also be improved. That will make it possible to prevent the production and sale of counterfeit goods closer to the source. With regard to the third objective, with the new regulation, we are also aiming to strengthen the rights of the holders of intellectual property rights. It is they, after all, who generate significant growth and jobs in Europe through their innovations. If we Europeans want to continue to be competitive, we need to promote innovation by effectively enforcing intellectual property rights. We have a series of proposals to that end: a) Rights holders are to be given better access to information about goods seized.
 b) They may also use this information to determine the identity of the rights holder, both in connection with criminal proceedings and out-of-court settlements. c) The biggest improvement is to be found in the reversal of the burden of proof in the case of transiting goods. I will go into that again later in my summing up. Jürgen Creutzmann,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I am still a little shocked by this debate. Mr Engström, it goes without saying that the customs authorities will not become the arbiters of patents, as the Commissioner has stressed once again. Similarly, I do not understand the concerns of social democratic Members. I believe that their worry is completely unfounded as, when it comes to generic products, for the first time, the text states quite specifically that the customs authorities may not obstruct the free trade of medicines and, in particular, generic products. We further reinforced this basic principle in our report. I also thought it important – and there were some points to debate in this regard – to ensure the rule of law. This is, after all, a highly important criterion, in other words, that those whose rights are infringed can also take legal action against customs decisions. On another note, I have been pleased to see that the Council has adopted many of our amendments in its compromise text, for example, Commissioner, when it comes to the delegated acts for small consignments. We proposed two kilogrammes and three items, from which the Council has made three kilogrammes and five items, so we will certainly reach a positive result in this regard. I hope that plenary will back this report with a large majority tomorrow so that we can immediately enter into negotiations with the Council, and that, as the Commissioner said in his speech, at the end of the year, a regulation will then enter into force that offers benefits all round, which is to say, to consumers, data protection, businesses – that has been stressed once again in the speeches we have heard – but also the customs authorities. Our contribution was reducing the red tape for the customs authorities in order to help them to be able to resolve cases. I believe that we succeeded in doing so. Jürgen Creutzmann  (ALDE

 The German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament has spoken out clearly in favour of the introduction of a debt redemption fund. However, participation in such a fund must be associated with clear and strict rules, such as were contained in the proposal made by the German Council of Economic Experts to the German Government in autumn 2011. Watering down the criteria for participation is neither productive nor effective. Linking the introduction of a debt redemption fund with the eurobonds project and the treatment of economic imbalances is unfair, and is rejected by the FDP in the European Parliament in the strongest possible terms.

 Mr President, Mr Potočnik, cooperation between the European Union and Switzerland is something dear to my heart. That is why it is important to deal with these issues hampering cooperation. We have heard that the provisions for the granting of residence permits for eight European countries no longer correspond to the agreements. We regret this action on the part of the Swiss authorities, particularly in view of the fact that this is just one of many measures that threaten the transposition of bilateral agreements between Switzerland and the European Union; Mr Potočnik has outlined the problems already. It is evident from this that, within the Joint Committee, the Commission still needs to deal with the still outstanding measures for the free provision of services in Switzerland and the implementation of an internal market. If we succeed in making progress here and in reaching an agreement between Switzerland and the European Union that sets down binding rules when it comes to points under dispute, then this can only be to everyone’s benefit. The decision by the Swiss authorities is not just unwise in political terms, but also from an economic perspective. We know, for example, that there are many well-qualified young Polish citizens who would have had the opportunity to work in Switzerland in future and to contribute to prosperity there. I hope that Switzerland will revise this decision and withdraw it again. Jürgen Creutzmann,

 Mr President, one of the most serious problems for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is access to finance. The Commission’s cohesion policy should be able to help resolve this problem. There are various programmes which have already been mentioned. A study by the European Parliament on the effectiveness of the Structural Funds and other measures aimed at regional SMEs has evidently highlighted some weaknesses. These include a failure to distinguish between different types of SMEs – such as micro-enterprises, but also self-employed people – major bureaucratic obstacles during the process of applying for finance, together with the reporting and monitoring requirements, the need for advance funding for projects and a lack of standardisation of the rules and procedures across different subsidy programmes. This leads me to make a few requests to the Commission. We should be able to simplify the process of obtaining finance from the Structural Funds. We need to improve the access to Joint European Resources for Micro to Medium Enterprises (JEREMIE). The contribution of EUR 50 000 required from the applicants is too high. We need to relax the requirement for advance funding for projects. We also need to take a more targeted approach to providing finance for different types of SMEs, to reduce the amount of cofinancing required and to close the financing gap between the individual depreciation cycles. In addition, we need more support to help SMEs to help themselves in the area of financing. Professional organisations could make a contribution in this respect. We must help SMEs to become stronger and to increase their capital. They have to do this in order to obtain loans from the banks. Mr Hahn, it is, of course, also important that Basel III is implemented in such a way that it does not obstruct the process of lending to SMEs, but instead creates opportunities for companies to access loans easily and under favourable terms. Jürgen Creutzmann  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today’s vote will introduce a regulation which brings direct added value for the citizens of Europe. During the next summer holidays, mobile phone calls from abroad will be significantly cheaper and, for the first time, there will be price transparency outside Europe, which is also important. For me, an essential feature of this regulation is that we have not repeated the mistakes of Roaming I and Roaming II. It has become clear that simple price limits, which actually have the same effect as price fixing, do not lead to more competition. Therefore, it is important for us to focus now on unbundling roaming services and national contracts for mobile communication services. We are creating a market which will lead to low prices of its own accord by providing genuine consumer choice and introducing new market players. Of course, we still need a safety net for prices as a transitional measure and to protect consumers from abuse. However, more competition also requires more market players and they will not come onto the market while the price limits are too low and there is too little scope for innovative offers. It will also not help consumers if operators do not have enough money in future to invest in new, faster networks. Ultimately, we do not want to fall behind in Europe. For these reasons, I welcome the fact that we have found a sensible solution and I would like to thank Ms Niebler specifically for her important contribution to this common-sense regulation. Consumers will notice the benefits of the new Roaming Regulation in their wallets. By 2014, there will be significant falls of up to 45% in the cost of incoming and outgoing calls and, as early as July 2012, consumers will be paying almost 20% less. Particularly in the case of data roaming, there have been no limits to misuse until now, which has, in some cases, resulted in horrendous prices. A cap will be put on these in future. We must continue to work towards completing the internal market and, if possible, finding a solution which means that in future, we do not need roaming charges at all.

 The representatives of the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament will vote in favour of the Hübner report on amending COM(2011)0482
 only on condition that, when raising the applicable cofinancing rates by ten percentage points, there is an exception for those Member States explicitly affected.

 Mr President, I should like to start by expressing my deep gratitude to all the shadow rapporteurs, who made this report possible through their excellent cooperation. The committee agreed to this report with an overwhelming vote of 30 in favour, one against and one abstention. Online gambling is an international phenomenon that is growing on a daily basis. Consumers find it easy to gamble online with providers who are either completely unregulated or who are registered in other countries where different rules apply. As a result, some individual Member States are no longer able to guarantee sufficient protection for their consumers. Children and young people or gambling addicts are particularly affected by this. In addition, frequently illegal foreign competition causes Member States to lose many millions of euro in tax revenue every year. This comes at a cost to the promotion of charitable projects, combating addiction and support for amateur sport. Finally, legal uncertainties make it difficult to offer cross-border gambling services within the internal market. Given that there are no European licensing standards, it is necessary to decide on a case-by-case basis whether practices in the Member States comply with European law. The existing level of legal uncertainty is made clear by the large number of contractual violation cases in recent years. That is why there is an urgent need to close the existing gap between legislation and reality. The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has come to a clear conclusion. The Member States need to cooperate much more closely on this issue. This will not be enough to resolve the problems outlined, however. In addition, the European Union will also have to play a significant role in future. This has been demanded by our committee with an overwhelming majority. In addition to other measures, an EU directive is also to be considered that will set shared minimum standards for consumer and youth protection, combating crime in the area of online gambling. Although the committee emphasises the principle of subsidiarity in its report on online gambling, the Member States need to regulate online betting for themselves insofar as possible within their own territory. However, this means that certain rules will need to be met in accordance with the judicial rulings of the European Court of Justice: restrictions in the legal range of gambling services, through state monopoly for example, are only permitted if they are coherent and proportionate. We cannot have a situation where a state explains away its monopoly by arguing that it wishes to protect consumers from the negative effects of gambling, while at the same time intensively advertising its range of state-backed gambling options. The best example of this can be found in Germany, where we have a state monopoly on gambling and lotteries, but with frequent advertising informing consumers of the current size of the jackpot, naturally encouraging players to invest their money in the lottery. To avoid such situations in the future, the European Union should set down quality standards for state licensing models. If a Member State decides in favour of a state licensing model, this model must comply with the principles of transparency and fair competition. In other words, all providers of gambling services that comply with the relevant conditions should be able to apply for a licence. At the same time, trust between the national regulatory authorities needs to be strengthened so as to achieve greater cooperation. In addition, the Commission is called upon to examine ways to use legislation to prevent the flow of payments between illegal providers and their customers. This could be achieved, for example, if each Member State were to draw up a white list of licensed gambling operators in its territory. Banks and credit institutions would only then be permitted to authorise transactions with these approved operators. I believe that this is a sensible and realistic alternative to the blocking of Internet sites, something that we, as liberals, would not favour. This measure would also be an important step in securing tax income from legal gambling, combating organised crime, and protecting the consumer from unregulated gambling. Everyone, regulated providers, the public purse and consumers alike, would benefit from the measures called for in the report. Nonetheless, the European Commission needs the full backing of the European Parliament in order to present the necessary initiatives. It is for this reason I am hopeful that there will be a broad majority in favour at tomorrow’s vote, giving the Commission a clear mandate for action. Mr Barnier, it is over to you.

In my opinion, it exacerbates the problem of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), rather than resolving it. We need a standard, EU-wide solution. We do not need renationalisation, which will prevent us from achieving our internal market objectives. In addition, it will weaken the position of the EU in future World Trade Organisation negotiations.

 The German Free Democratic Party delegation in the European Parliament assumes that the inclusion of Romania and Bulgaria in the Schengen area will further improve freedom of movement within the EU. Now that both Member States have achieved positive evaluation results in all areas of the Schengen review, there should be no more obstacles to delay inclusion further. There is no denying that the technical securing of borders will not automatically make them impermeable as long as problems persist in combating corruption in the justice and policing system. Accordingly, this challenge also relates to Member States already in the Schengen area. For this reason, the German Free Democratic Party delegation believes that criteria such as the fight against corruption must receive greater attention when evaluating the Schengen mechanism, and any misdemeanours must be punished appropriately.

Mr President, Mr Rehn, the joint question on the review of the Small Business Act shows that there is still a great deal to be done to ensure that medium-sized companies in Europe have freedom to act, particularly on a national level. However, I am pleased that in recent years, we have succeeded in implementing almost all the provisions of the Small Business Act in the European Union. Most recently, a new directive on combating late payment in commercial transactions came into force in March, which will make an important contribution to improving payment practice in Europe. Now the Member States have two years to implement the new directive. I would like to call for this timeframe to be shortened, in particular, in the Member States where this would not present a significant problem. Instead of delaying implementation for two years, it could be completed, where possible, within one year. The Member States have not yet been able to agree on the statute for a European private company. Therefore, I very much welcome the fact that the Hungarian Presidency is following up this issue and making it one of the focal points of its work. This form of company in particular could enable small and medium-sized enterprises to save a great deal of money. I am thinking, in particular, of accounting, establishing a company and ongoing legal advice. Therefore, I would like to say again how pleased I am that the Hungarian Presidency is focusing on this area. The issue just mentioned by Mrs Riera Madurell is also important, and that is public procurement. Here, we can still achieve a great deal for small and medium-sized enterprises. There are many bureaucratic regulations in this area and it is often particularly difficult for small and medium-sized businesses to take part in the public procurement process. We need greater transparency and we must also try to make the most of the opportunities presented by the modern media and, in particular, the Internet. Jürgen Creutzmann,

Mr President, Mr Barnier, I would like to respond to my fellow Member’s remarks. Instead of a social clause, the committee has proposed investigating the impact that the measures in the internal market will have on employment. This is much more important than applying general formulae. If we want to make progress with the internal market, we must pay attention to social issues and put the emphasis on them in everything we do. For this reason, an impact assessment which specifically takes these requirements into account is particularly important. I would like to make one more comment. I was surprised to hear the President speak about economic governance, which is still translated in German as Wirtschaftslenkung
. This term is also used to mean central state control of the economy. We have had very bad experiences of state control of the economy in one area of Germany. I am certain that we can only develop the internal market further if we coordinate all our national economies. That is abundantly clear. However, we will not be able to make progress with the internal market by means of economic governance. Today, we are discussing how we can bring some momentum to the internal market. This is long overdue, because we will be celebrating the 20th anniversary of the internal market next year. Therefore, I welcome Mr Barnier’s statement in which he said that he wants to focus on a few specific measures that have not yet been implemented and that will give a new impetus to the internal market. The internal market represents a huge opportunity for all of us. It can lead to the creation of more jobs and our goal must be to find work for people. This is the very best social policy that we can put in place, because people who are employed will also develop self-esteem. Therefore, we must do everything we can to make sure that progress is made in this area. We need a balanced package of measures which brings advantages for businesses and for citizens. On the one hand, we want medium-sized companies in particular to benefit more from the internal market than they have done in the past. Therefore, we urgently need an EU patent system, so that companies can at last protect and sell their innovative products throughout Europe for a reasonable cost. In addition, businesses need more funding to develop innovations. A European venture capital market is just one of many measures that can be taken. The harmonisation of value-added tax and the corporate tax base that we are now discussing will also give a boost to the internal market. On the other hand, we also need to take specific measures which will increase citizens’ trust in the internal market. We must improve the recognition of professional qualifications, possibly by means of the European professional card. This will make it easier to work in another Member State and will create more mobility for citizens within the European internal market. We also need a European market surveillance organisation, and I would like to emphasise this point, because the Member States are constantly failing to put the dossier into practice. We do not want dangerous products to be sold on the internal market. If we can adopt this proposal with a large majority, we will be able to give a new impetus to the internal market.

 Madam President, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, the largest single market in the world in terms of economic power has developed in the globalised era into a crucial location advantage for the European Union. That is why it is so important to oppose protectionist tendencies and to expand the single market further. In view of the excessively indebted national budgets, there is nothing left for Europe to do but to strengthen the economy by means of structural reforms. Since its establishment in 1992, the single market has already generated additional growth of 1.85%. Implementation of the measures that have been announced is intended to bring about further growth of 2 to 4%. We can divide the Commission’s 50 proposals for single market initiatives into three categories: firstly, into the many specific proposals that will, in any case, enhance the single market for enterprises and citizens. These include the creation of a fully operational internal energy market which, for Europe as an economic and industrial centre, is particularly important. Then there is a European professional card and a European Skills Passport to facilitate mobility within the European Union, which will become more and more important in future in order to maintain Europe’s competitiveness in a globalised world, and the strengthening of electronic commerce by means of better management of copyrights and new guidelines for the effective implementation of the Services Directive in order to create new jobs. Secondly, there are, however, also many proposals which are worded in too vague a manner for us to be able to assess them yet. Therefore, we still need to wait for the Commission’s specific proposals. I include here the revision of the EU rules for public procurement, measures for services of general interest and also – Mrs Gebhardt – the deliberations on a European approach to collective redress. I do not know whether we ought to go down the same erroneous path as the United States. Thirdly, the communication also contains proposals which, in my view, are counterproductive in terms of strengthening the single market, because they burden enterprises with additional bureaucracy. We therefore need to discuss these proposals, and we are ready to do so. Jürgen Creutzmann,

Madam President, Commissioner Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow, the European Parliament will adopt a directive on combating late payment that will make history. It is the first directive that can quite simply be explained in three sentences: firstly, public authorities will, as a matter of principle, have to pay within 30 days in future if no shorter payment targets have been agreed and if no special circumstances make a payment target of no more than 60 days necessary. Secondly, when agreeing payment targets, enterprises have freedom of contract within 60 days and payment targets of more than 60 days are no longer permitted, except if expressly agreed and if it does not pose a serious disadvantage to the creditor. Thirdly, if the aforementioned payment deadlines are exceeded, recovery costs of at least EUR 40 and interest of at least 8% above the European Central Bank base interest rate can be charged without a prior reminder. This directive will help small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe to a great extent to improve their liquidity, and they will not need to accept as much credit from the banks. Debtors with a strong market presence will no longer be able to force small and medium-sized enterprises into granting longer payment deadlines, and that is a good thing. Furthermore, individual Member States will not only be able to retain shorter payment target deadlines in the form that has been customary up to now; we assume that, in fact, they will be retained, because we cannot imagine that the Late Payments Directive will lead to a deterioration in payment practices within the Member States. Enterprises that do business within Europe know that, in future, their claims will be settled after no more than 60 days. This is a huge step forward and a further step towards the completion of the European internal market. We can be very satisfied with the adoption of this legislation. It will help small and medium-sized enterprises and it will help the European internal market. Jürgen Creutzmann  (ALDE

 Madam President, Commissioner, in Pakistan, we have witnessed devastating floods, and we must help the suffering, destitute people of this country. In this regard, what saddens me, in particular, is the fact that there are regions in Pakistan that the central government is not allowing any proper aid to reach. Thus, for example, the region of Gilgit-Baltistan, north of Jammu and Kashmir within the Pakistani border region, has also been badly hit by heavy rainfall and its effects. According to information I have received, in Gilgit-Baltistan alone, 500 people have died and 50 000 people have been made homeless. Four bridges have been washed away and many areas of land have been completely cut off from the outside world. So far, however, aid equivalent to only around EUR 10 000 has reached Gilgit-Baltistan. Therefore, the European Union should not just hand over its aid to the Pakistani central government but provide direct support to the non-governmental organisations that are also looking after the interests of the remote regions of Pakistan.

Along with the majority of Members in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I have decided to vote in favour of the Sommer report. It is true that the Liberals were not able to achieve their goals in every area. The adoption of origin labelling for meat and milk in processed products is a regrettable move, because it imposes significant costs on producers and seems almost impossible to implement in practice. However, for me, the positive results of the vote clearly outweigh the negative ones. For the first time, we have uniform regulations on food labelling throughout the entire internal market, with no possibility of individual countries going it alone. In addition, one of the decisive successes of this vote for me is the fact that the misleading traffic light model was rejected. A mandatory colour coded nutrient declaration will not be permitted either at a European or a national level. Uniform Europe-wide labelling rules will bring clear advantages for companies and consumers. The cost of manufacturing and selling products will fall because manufacturers will only have to follow a single regulation. Consumers will benefit from uniform nutrient labelling when comparing products that come from within Europe.

 Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, Commissioner Dalli, the fact that we are discussing three own-initiative reports on consumer protection and the internal market today shows that, despite all of our successes in these areas, there is still much that is in need of improvement. Admittedly, the Member States’ transposition of the internal market directives has, on average, greatly improved, but seven Member States have failed to meet the target set by the Commission of reducing the transposition deficit for the internal market directives to 1%. The main problem, however, has more to do with the application of EU law than with its transposition. Thus, in the event of treaty infringements by Member States, it takes, on average, 18 months – in other words, still far too long – for them to comply with the judgment of the European Court of Justice. This can be seen from the current internal market scorecard, and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe finds that unacceptable. This deficit will lead to problems for citizens and, in particular, for small and medium-sized enterprises, which depend on harmonised rules within the internal market, but which meet with unexpected, time-consuming and bureaucratic obstacles when they want to operate across borders. This is why it is important for SOLVIT to be developed further. SOLVIT is an online problem-solving network in which the Member States work together in a pragmatic way to resolve problems that have arisen as a result of the misapplication of internal market rules by public authorities. All Member States must ultimately provide the financial resources and adequately trained staff for the SOLVIT centres. The ALDE Group calls emphatically for people to be made more aware of SOLVIT in the Member States in order to facilitate the cross-border sale of their products and services. For this purpose, the involvement of the relevant associations in large-scale information campaigns is just as necessary as a uniform, easy-to-understand and easy-to-find Internet portal for receiving all kinds of complaints.

 According to the resolution of the European Parliament on the draft general budget for the financial year 2010, adopted on 17 December 2009, a vote was taken today on the amending budget for the European Parliament, following the revised calculations made by the Parliamentary administration. The FDP in the European Parliament abstained, because there was a paragraph in the package of amendments concerned that we could not reconcile with our convictions. The FDP had already expressed its opposition to an increase in the secretarial allowance to EUR 1 500 during the discussions in committee. It is out of the secretarial allowance that MEPs’ assistants are paid. The FDP considers that the argument that more money is needed due to the additional work that MEPs have to do with the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is unsound, as there is nothing in past experience to support this. Certainly, under the Treaty of Lisbon, which has just come into force, Parliament will overall need extra capacity for legislative work, but with the introduction of the Assistants’ Statute from the beginning of the current parliamentary term, there is still no proof that MEPs actually need more assistants. For this reason, there are grounds for concern that further demands and supplementary increases, or an extension of office capacity, will follow. For this reason, the FDP in the European Parliament abstained from voting. Jürgen Creutzmann

 Mr President, Commissioner, if what you are calling for is further development and harmonisation of the internal market, then we need to have a common set of rules. There are three aspects to online gambling which ought to be considered in this debate. How can we best protect the interests of our citizens and consumers? How can we best prevent fraud and criminal activity? How can we best protect our citizens from harm? The European Parliament resolution of 10 March 2009 on the integrity of online gambling has indicated methods and ways to proceed with regard to this issue. Now, as before, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe endorses the principles concerning the integrity of online gambling contained in Parliament’s resolution of 10 March 2009. In accordance with a ruling of the European Court of Justice, each Member State is free, under certain conditions, to regulate online gambling itself and the resolution of 10 March stresses that emphatically. National rules are better suited to combating match-fixing fraud, although this type of fraud cannot be eliminated entirely, as demonstrated by some recent examples in Germany. It has to be said, though, that gambling markets are much better regulated at national level, according to the tradition and culture of the country concerned. Players are offered better protection against addiction, fraud, money laundering and match-fixing if they can play through major online gambling service providers, who always, by definition, operate across borders. We cannot regulate everything according to the internal market concept and particularly not the prevention of underage gambling or gambling addiction. Online gambling provides increased opportunities for corrupt practices, such as fraud, match-fixing and illegal betting cartels, as online games can be set up and dismantled very rapidly. Illegal offshore betting operators present a particular problem in this regard, as it is almost impossible for them to be regulated or controlled. Profits from gambling should primarily be used for the benefit of society in order to promote amateur sport, amongst other things. It is best to leave this to the competence of national administrations. Continuous funding, for culture and professional and amateur sport, for example, gives individual Member States some justification for permitting gambling. However, a precondition for that is that the risk of addiction must be highlighted and proactively combated. As the full impact on consumers of the specific forms of gambling services offered online is not yet known, we need to take urgent action to fill this knowledge gap. It is essential in this context that Member States really do fulfil their tasks. Market surveillance is also key, when it comes to online gambling. If we in the European Parliament can agree that Member States have the right, under the principle of subsidiarity, to regulate their gambling markets according to their own traditions and cultures, we also then have to ensure that this is actually happening, through efficient control and market surveillance. Jürgen Creutzmann,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports the views expressed in the opinion of the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment to the effect that the ALARA principle, in other words, the principle of ‘as low as reasonably achievable’, should apply in the assessment of carcinogenic substances. Secondly, there is consequently a need for the Commission to examine whether this principle is also satisfied by the limit values laid down in the Toys Directive. Thirdly, if this does not happen, we call on the Commission to ensure that, until the Toys Directive has been transposed by all the Member States in 2011, the limit values are laid down in the Toys Directive in such a way as to rule out any risk to the health of children from softening agents in toys. Fourthly, the principle enshrined in the Toys Directive, whereby chemicals that are potentially carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction are impermissible, must be implemented with regard to accessible parts of toys. This must actually be achieved by the limit values set, as otherwise such a directive is worthless. Fifthly, this calls, in particular, for better and more efficient market surveillance, because it is usually toys that have been imported into the EU that exceed the limit values set by the Union. However, efficient market surveillance would also enable toys manufactured within the EU to be tested to see whether they, too, comply with the limit values. Sixthly, it is totally unacceptable, should this be the case, that lower standards should apply to imports into the EU than, for example, into the US. However, the threat by the German Federal Minister for Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection, Ilse Aigner, to go it alone and prohibit so-called ‘toxic toys’ herself is, in my view, completely the wrong way to go about it and totally counterproductive when it comes to creating confidence in the European internal market. Merely cultivating national popular opinion not only destroys confidence in the European Institutions; it also damages the German Federal Government, because it approved the Toys Directive.

 The German Free Democratic Party members of the European Parliament have abstained from voting on the Copenhagen resolution for the following reasons. The resolution contains statements about financing for climate protection measures in third countries without defining the specific criteria or purpose of the financing. We cannot justify this to taxpayers. In addition, we believe that blanket criticism of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) is wrong. The ICAO is the organisation which deals with aviation matters at an international level. Both the criticism and the statement about the alleged failure of ICAO negotiations are incorrect and inappropriate. The call for specific arrangements for a CO2
 trading system for the aviation industry goes against current EU legislation and overburdens the EU’s negotiating position in an international climate agreement with unrealistic demands. Jürgen Creutzmann,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s response is, of course, not only discouraging, as Mr Schwab said, but also very disappointing. When it comes to the transposition, we need to realise that if you say that around 50% are on schedule, then we have to assume that the other 50% are a long way from achieving that. Take my own country, Germany, for example: the individual Federal Länder 
are currently transposing this directive. In Rhineland-Palatinate, where I live, I had the opportunity, on 2 September, to participate in the first reading for the transposition of the Services Directive for this Federal Land
. As you can imagine, it will be impossible to achieve the transposition on time, and I believe that the other Federal Länder
 are in a similar position. The crucial factor for us, of course, will be how the transposition is carried out. If Article 13(2) stipulates that ‘authorisation procedures and formalities shall not be dissuasive and shall not unduly complicate or delay the provision of the service’ then we must take great care to ensure that this does not happen in practice. A decisive factor, for example, will be how the single points of contact are equipped. Will they have language skills? Will they work closely enough with the administrations to also be able to deal with the concerns put to them? We very much doubt it. In fact, the committee should now be asking which countries are behind schedule with this, which countries make up the 50% and when do they expect to achieve this. It would then be better to create a moratorium, or something similar, for these countries. I am certain that, in most countries, this directive will not be transposed by 1 January 2010, even though these countries have had more than four years to do this. That is a major problem and it is very disappointing. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

 Dear colleague, that is a very good point. I would like to answer you in English. I have considered that, and as Liberals we are always fighting against bureaucratic burdens.

Mr President, the delegated act as adopted on 30 September 2013 foresees that public-private partnership bodies are to receive an indirect discharge via the Commission, instead of an individual discharge as they receive now. We fought against this as a team of rapporteurs, and I thank Ingeborg Gräßle for this good compromise. We rechecked with the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Controls which, acting under Rule 51 and unanimously, adopted the motion for resolution objecting to the delegated act. An alternative approach was now agreed upon by the Parliament, Council and Commission teams, which they are to endorse via a trilateral joint statement which foresees that, firstly, Parliament, the Council and the Commission agree that the joint undertakings should continue to be subject to a separate discharge by the European Parliament upon recommendation of the Council, and secondly, that the Commission will include derogations in the financial rules of the joint undertakings to reflect the separate discharge. Subsequently, the Commission will propose corresponding modifications to Articles 209 and 60 of the Financial Regulation. Thirdly (and last but not least), the Commission Delegated Regulation of 30 September 2013 on the model financial regulation for public-private partnership bodies will enter into force in order to allow joint undertakings to benefit from the simplifications introduced in the new financial framework. As just mentioned by the Presidency, the Council will endorse the joint statement on 20 January. In the light of this, the Committee on Budgetary Control and, I believe, the Committee on Budgets are ready to endorse this trilateral joint statement on the separate discharge for joint undertakings. In the name of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I request the withdrawal of the resolution objecting to the delegated act which was initially planned for vote tomorrow in Plenary.

Mr President, several Members have drawn my attention to the fact that they received written information from the Director-General of OLAF concerning the legislation decision.

 Mr President, Commissioner Šefčovič, Parliament has always actively supported the Danube Strategy. The Danube Forum, of which I am the Chair, has 60 MEPs. Therefore, I am pleased to be the first signatory of the oral question to put the subject of the Danube on today’s agenda. There has been some progress with regard to the Danube, such as the bridges I saw this summer between Widin and Calafat, on the international Danube bicycle tour. However, this progress is moving at a snail’s pace. There are still major difficulties: mayors in Bulgaria tell us that construction works on the Danube require consultation with seven ministries in Sofia. Other Danube residents have the impression in their Member States that the Danube is being marginalised in capital cities and not being placed in the foreground. This is why we are asking the Commission for more substantial results and measures. In the current programming period, the Danube Strategy should be provided with resources and for the future period we need a dedicated budget line for the Danube. We have specific projects, such as the Danube Manager, for which administration capacity needs to be developed. Small and medium-sized enterprises should be supported while they cooperate. There should be technology transfer centres. More than anything else, we need more opportunities for citizens to meet. We note that these citizens’ meetings must be supported otherwise they do not function. I have written to Chancellor Merkel and Commissioner Lewandowski to propose the formation of a Danube Youth Foundation. I therefore pose the question: can the Commission imagine itself financially supporting such a Danube Youth Foundation? Many young people would like to meet up, but cannot afford the tank of petrol or the train tickets they need to get to a meeting. Ladies and gentlemen, parliaments should play a greater role. I hope that we in the European Parliament will act as leaders and invite the other national and regional parliaments to join in, so that we, too, take greater ownership of the Danube Strategy than ever before.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the level of dissatisfaction in the wake of the Rio conference is significant. We recognise that Europe cannot force its ideas in relation to environmental policy on the rest of the world. This phase of disillusionment can also be seen as an opportunity, however. Europe can act as a role model. That is my first point. My second point is that we need to focus more on adjusting to the new situation brought about by climate change, as well as working towards climate protection. Above all, I believe that Europe’s development organisations, research institutions, universities and private enterprises can make a significant contribution; after all, we need to see economic development and environmental policy as two sides of the same coin. Weaker countries will only be able to pursue environmental policies if they also make progress on the economic development front. So, let us press forward with environmental technology. This is something Europe can offer other countries. Perhaps we need to question the idea of greening. Perhaps we should create blue growth that is mainly based on technology. As the world’s population continues to grow, this will only be possible if we see economics and environmental policy as inextricably linked.

 The German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament has spoken out clearly in favour of the introduction of a debt redemption fund. However, participation in such a fund must be associated with clear and strict rules, such as were contained in the proposal made by the German Council of Economic Experts to the German Government in autumn 2011. Watering down the criteria for participation is neither productive nor effective. Linking the introduction of a debt redemption fund with the eurobonds project and the treatment of economic imbalances is unfair, and is rejected by the FDP in the European Parliament in the strongest possible terms.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, do you know Mr Hanselmann? If not, you should get to know him. Around 20 years ago, Mr Hanselmann founded a company with three colleagues from the University of Paderborn. Now it has 1 000 employees. He received a loan from the state subsidy system in North Rhine-Westphalia to set up his company. This shows that state subsidies for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and subsidised loans are helpful. We need an initiative in Europe to promote the start-up of SMEs. The aid available must be made simpler. It must have lower thresholds and involve less red tape. One approach could be innovation vouchers. In addition, we must reallocate the unused money from the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund so that SMEs in Greece, for example, can obtain loans. However, to be able to do this, we also need different banking systems. One possibility would be cooperative banks and savings banks which the outlying countries in particular do not have. We need both things: a solution for the outlying countries and a policy for highly innovative companies in wealthier regions which will reinforce their strengths. That is what is currently required.

 Mr Lamberts, when you say we need growth and we need to create structures to allow states to borrow money again, it is also the case that the states which will be lending the money are afraid that this is just a bottomless pit.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating the 2010 budget and the European Court of Auditor’s report in this regard. This report contains both encouraging and less encouraging elements. Firstly, with regard to the funds that are directly controlled as well as managed by the Commission, it can be seen that the error rate is falling. This is the case in agricultural policy in particular, where an encouraging result was achieved with a 2.3% error rate. On the other hand, in cohesion policy, which has been a problem area for many years, we have an error rate of 7.7% – and two thirds of these errors should have been rectified by the Member States. That should not allow us to cease in our attempts to influence the Member States in this regard to ensure that the error rate is reduced. At this point, I would like first of all – on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, but also as committee chair – to thank Commissioner Šemeta as well as the President of the European Court of Auditors most sincerely for their excellent cooperation. I expressly agree with those Members who welcome the fact that the Council is also here today, represented by Mr Wammen from the Danish Presidency. The cooperation with the Commission and the European Court of Auditors is exemplary. The cooperation with the Council, Mr Wammen, is in need of improvement – and it is on the part of the Council that this improvement is required. I would like to ask and encourage you to pass that message on to the other members of the Council, too. As Parliament, we expect an improvement in use of funds for which we have shared responsibility, and for the Council now to accommodate Parliament here in the trialogue so that in future, we can reduce the error rate. After all, we must also finally make some progress on the discharge of the Council. It is not acceptable for there to be public expenditure that is not subject to any democratic scrutiny. ‘No taxation without representation’ was the battle cry of the American Revolution. Democracy requires there to be no public expenditure without democratic scrutiny. You mentioned the principle of reciprocity, but that is clearly not appropriate in terms of the relationship between the Council and Parliament, as the Treaty of Lisbon clearly stipulates that the Council recommends, but Parliament decides. That is not reciprocity; it is not symmetry, but asymmetry. Here it is important for Parliament, as the directly elected body of the citizens, to have its rights upheld. Michael Theurer,

 Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I would like to welcome the President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), Werner Hoyer, and to congratulate him on his committed and convincing debut. Following monetary stabilisation, we must now focus fully on real growth in the economy. One of the key aspects of this is the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises. The EIB supported 115 000 small and medium-sized enterprises in 2010 with funds totalling EUR 10 billion. A credit squeeze nonetheless persists for medium-sized businesses, particularly in the crisis countries and on the periphery of the European Union. We in the European Parliament expect the EIB to do all it can to provide greater support to small and medium-sized enterprises. We would be interested to learn more about the significance of the guarantees for small and medium-sized enterprises and the options with regard to the Risk Sharing Finance Facility. We also believe it is important that the EIB should play a role in financing infrastructure in the context of the EU project bonds. In summary, we believe that infrastructure, technology and innovation – in short, blue growth – should be at the centre of EIB strategy. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was an own-initiative report by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe which pointed out that the absorption capacity of certain Member States was not very high. As rapporteur on that report, I pointed to the causes of that situation. It is now necessary that the Commission take appropriate action here. We will also support the Commission in finally taking action in problem countries – in Greece, Romania, Bulgaria and in southern Italy. A reallocation of resources towards small and medium-sized enterprises, dual vocational training and tackling youth unemployment is absolutely the right course to take. That has to be our starting point. However, the vital thing is that capacities are built up, if we are to solve these problems. The impression the citizens of Europe have is that – as in Greece – all-out austerity is not working and that the government simply agrees measures which then remain unimplemented. However, it is crucial that, to use a car analogy, we do not put our foot down on the accelerator only to find that nothing happens. Now we need to engage a gear, so that the engine can provide thrust to the wheels! After all, we need to take action to develop a real economy: that is, to improve competitiveness, so that the problem is tackled at the root. Michael Theurer,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development
. – (DE)
 Mr President, Commissioner Rehn, ladies and gentlemen, in the discussion regarding the economic and financial crisis, which has led to the introduction of the European semester, the focus for the public is on the question of monetary policy and the sovereign debt crisis. For the Committee on Regional Development, however, it is important for more light to be shed on the question of the real economy. We want to eliminate the causes of the differences in competitiveness that result in some countries lagging behind. That is the central focus of European policy, and it must remain so in future, too. It is disgraceful that some countries do not utilise the Structural Funds. We need to investigate the causes here, as Parliament also determined in connection with my report on the absorption rate. It is not just a question of cofinancing; it is also a question of decentralising the responsibility for decision-making and of increasing administrative capacity. In this regard, the Committee on Regional Development is grateful to the rapporteur for including our proposals, because we now need to tackle the root of the problem and eliminate the causes of the imbalances. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Michael Theurer  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, the differences in competitiveness are undoubtedly also due to the different responses of Member States to global economic changes. It would be carrying things too far to investigate this, as even the opinions of the experts differ. The fact is that, even within Member States, individual regions are developing differently. Therefore, the Committee on Regional Development believes that current cohesion and regional policy offers a good approach for providing assistance to regions, cities and communities and the companies established there to enable them to adapt better. However, on investigating the actual effects it emerges that some Member States – such as Estonia or even Poland, which are achieving very good results – deal with the Structural Funds better than others, which find it difficult to absorb the funds – for example regions like Calabria and Sicily, as well as Greece and Romania. In the committee’s view, what is now needed is for us to tackle these problems specifically in order to utilise the Structural Funds better and to deal with the causes of the problem.

 Madam President, Commissioner, first of all, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Rühle, for her report and for such good cooperation. In view of the current debate, this is an appropriate moment to point out that public procurement is a very important way of achieving fair prices for public services and for the procurement of goods for the public sector. Competition is one element of using our scarce resources economically. It is thus a positive aspect of this report that public procurement is to be simplified. This should also facilitate access to public procurement for small and medium-sized enterprises. The measures for achieving this includes consistently allowing self-declarations, the division of contracts into lots – in other words, an SME-friendly tendering procedure – and the introduction of an electronic procurement passport. Moreover, when awarding contracts, the contracting authorities should give greater consideration to the quality of the goods and services to be procured, in addition to the price. It is also sensible for contracting authorities to attach greater weight to future life-cycle costs. In other words, it is no longer simply a matter of the cheapest offer, but rather the most economic offer over the entire life cycle. Greater consideration also needs to be given to environmental sustainability. These are the positive points. However, we in the ALDE Group feel there are some points that need revising. There are calls for the bureaucratic requirements on subcontractors to be increased. We see this as a major problem. We also want to have an open market worldwide that cannot be distorted by giving preference to domestic bidders. In return, we want other countries to open up their markets. We are also critical as regards award criteria introduced through bureaucracy; in other words, where certain local authorities are allowed to introduce their own criteria. It is in the interests of the market as a whole to prevent this. Michael Theurer,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, President Barroso has already highlighted the significance of small and medium-sized enterprises: 99% of all enterprises in Europe employ fewer than 250 people. Small and medium-sized enterprises are thus the backbone of employment and training. With the Small Business Act, the European Union began an initiative to improve national and European legislation for small and medium-sized enterprises. It was in this context that the test of the impact of legislation on small and medium-sized enterprises was introduced. Now, however, a study by the European Parliament has shown significant variation in the way that this SME test is being implemented in the individual Member States, and that in some cases, it is being implemented badly. Only five Member States have made this SME text a binding requirement. Fourteen Member States apply it half-heartedly, irregularly and with varying quality, while eight Member States practically do not carry out the test at all. That is why we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have tabled this question and are calling for the Commission to start an initiative to make this impact assessment a genuinely binding requirement in the Member States. We want the costs of administration and red tape to be quantified, in order to work towards reducing these. Small and medium-sized enterprises need to be saved from national and European legislation that burdens them with more and more additional costs for bureaucracy and administration. We are in favour of implementation being made very flexible, so that the Member States have room to manoeuvre. However, the aim must be for the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises to be taken into consideration as part of an integrated approach to law making. We also want the Commission to set an example by being the driving force behind this SME-friendly implementation of legislation. We in the European Union should take the lead in making laws that are genuinely capable of being implemented by small and medium-sized enterprises in practice. Michael Theurer,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at a late hour this evening, we are debating a subject that is of absolutely crucial importance for us. In any case, 37% of the EU budget goes on cohesion policy. Let us take a closer look – today, in the middle of the period, in 2011 – at how much in the way of resources has actually been taken from the Structural and Cohesion Funds so far. We can see that, unfortunately, in many Member States, the absorption rate and absorption capacity are well below what should actually have been paid out already by this stage. We have new Members States, such as Bulgaria and Romania, which have a poor absorption rate, but it is not only the new Member States; there are also Member States that have been in the Union for a long time, with regions such as Calabria and Sicily in the founder State of Italy, that with a rate of 7% – if we are to believe the budgetary controllers in the Committee on Budgetary Control – are well behind. This raises the question: why are these regions unable to spend the financial resources that we make available? There is Greece, too. Here in Parliament we have been highlighting where action is needed for months and have been pointing out that a country like Greece is not absorbing these resources, and we are pleased that the Commission, which to start with did not attach the necessary importance to this matter, has now given it high priority. With regard to Greece in particular, President Barroso has pointed out that, out of 20 billion, 15 billion has not been spent, and Commissioner Hahn has also just been there. We have considered what we can do to help these regions. The first thing to consider, as always, is the subject of cofinancing. The fact is that the regions are finding it difficult, in this global economic crisis, to finance their own share and Member States like Greece, which appear to be on the brink of insolvency, are also finding it difficult to finance their own share. There is no question that help must be provided here. However, it is clearly not just a matter of cofinancing, because there are also regions in Greece that really do not want an increase in European Union subsidies, are happy with the current rate of 80% and would rather implement more projects. Thus, it is not just a question of cofinancing; there are many different reasons. The procedures are too complex and need to be simplified as a matter of urgency. There is also the problem that, in many Member States, the central administrations of the governments in the capital cities take too long and the regions and regional authorities at local level have insufficient decision-making options in order to use the resources. Take Romania, for example, where the local authorities take 20 to 30 days to process applications, the regional authorities take around 60 days, but the central government takes 260 days. All of this provides an argument for delegating responsibility from the top down and introducing a strong local self-administration. Where are the Council, the Council Presidency and Mr van Rompuy this evening, in fact? He has taken the floor with regard to other matters. We are talking about 37% of the EU budget here. The EU is putting off payment obligations of EUR 250 billion. How are they to be fulfilled? The President-in-Office of the Council from Poland could have attempted to answer this, as Poland, of course, has shown how the absorption rate can be increased. There are also examples of good governance. Poland has managed it – its absorption capacities have increased – but so has Estonia. As Parliament, we are of the opinion that the Member States are now called on to ensure, as a matter of urgency, that the resources that we as Parliament have made available for the citizens in the regions are actually spent, also in the interests of increasing competitiveness and stabilisation of jobs and employment. In this regard, we expect the Commission to push forward with the method adopted and to very strongly urge the Member States to bring this matter to a positive conclusion. Michael Theurer,

 Madam President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased that, at my initiative, this oral question has received so much support here in Parliament and that it is being answered so promptly by the Commission. Thank you very much, Mr Tajani, for your response. As you know, because of globalisation, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are facing increasing competition from other countries, including from emerging economies outside the European Union. This involves major challenges, but also significant opportunities. In order to remain competitive, to secure growth and to support the sustainability of our companies, SMEs must take part in international activities. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is convinced of this. This concerns imports and exports, foreign direct investment and, of course, also acting as or using foreign subcontractors. However, only a small proportion of European SMEs are doing business with third countries. A total of 99% of the companies in the European Union are SMEs. However, only 29% of the SMEs in the EU import products, of which 50% import from countries outside the internal market. Only 25% of the SMEs in the EU are involved in exports, of which 50% export to countries outside the internal market. This means that our SMEs are not yet fully integrated into the global market. There are still opportunities to be exploited in this area and we now need to consider how we can encourage SMEs to do more business outside Europe. Not many SMEs are familiar with the public support programmes, such as the Enterprise Europe Network, or with information resources, such as the Market Access Database and the Export Helpdesk. There are also similar programmes available at a national and regional level. We need to know what concrete measures the Commission is planning in order to ensure that SMEs are better informed about the available tools and programmes. We would also like to know what the Commission intends to do to make the confusing subsidy system more transparent and clearer for SMEs. Following the decision made by the Court of Justice of the European Union on 10 December 2009, the Commission intends to include product-specific list rules in the implementing regulations for the Modernised Customs Code, in other words, to make these rules legally binding. The intention is to replace the current regulation, which has proved its worth over several decades and which specifies that the origin of a product is based on its last substantial processing or working, by countless product-specific origin rules for products imported into the EU. We are concerned that this will lead to an increase in red tape and, most importantly, will put SMEs at a disadvantage. We believe that this is not in line with the Small Business Act for Europe. Therefore, we are calling for a simplified form of this system which is beneficial for SMEs. How does the Commission intend to ensure that safety-related adaptations and changes to the Modernised Customs Code do not conflict with the existing simplified procedure and lead to competitive disadvantages? This is all about the position of SMEs on the world market, which will ensure their continued existence and allow them to safeguard jobs here in the European Union. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

 Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bütikofer, for a very good report. Commissioner Tajani, you have given a very clear signal this evening, which gives us hope. After all, we were disappointed with the presentation of the Commission’s strategy in the beginning. However, the raw materials strategy is a vital ingredient for business, employment and jobs here in the European Union. That is why a coherent strategy is essential. It goes without saying that we need the three pillars: security for our sources of raw materials, a recycling strategy, including greater efficiencies, as well as a joint approach so that partnerships can be established with the main raw materials suppliers of this world. The amendments tabled by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe focus on the idea that we should include more members of the scientific community in this strategy because there are many modern techniques for using raw materials found on the sea bed in the world’s oceans that still need to be researched and developed. This is precisely where Europeans have something to offer raw materials suppliers in developing countries and emerging economies as part of a common raw materials strategy. As liberals we believe it is important to remember that small and medium-sized enterprises require our particular help. Big business can secure raw materials for itself, while small and medium-sized enterprises need a joint strategy. Hence our call on you: let us work together to unite the Member States under the umbrella of the EU and establish long-term partnerships with the countries with the raw materials. The aim of the raw materials strategy must be to bring economic policy, environmental policy and international trade, together with development policy, under one roof. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mr Oettinger, ladies and gentlemen, even 25 years down the road, Chernobyl continues to be a cause for concern. Fukushima will also be a source of anxiety for years to come. The debate surrounding these major accidents is a sign that nuclear technology has inherent risks that it may not be possible to control. This is leading to a rethink in energy policy. However, it is also evident that unilateral action by individual countries is a mistake. We need international strategies, or at least EU-wide strategies when it comes to safety. That is why I fully support the Commissioner for Energy, who has made a number of important proposals in this direction. I would call on everyone here to work together to produce common principles so that the existing nuclear reactors really are safe, so that power failures are not allowed to happen and so that earthquake safety and other risks can be better estimated. We should then take a pro-active approach in bringing these principles to the attention of the international bodies. Michael Theurer,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Baltic Sea strategy set the ball rolling, the Danube strategy that we have debated this year in Parliament was the second step and now it is the turn of the Atlantic region. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in Parliament supports this macro-regional approach and was actively involved in this resolution. What we are concerned with here are improvements to the protection of the seas and the environment, and naturally also maritime affairs and fisheries – but it goes beyond this into lots of other areas, and three pillars in particular. The first of these is cooperation between Member States, so that synergies can be better exploited. Secondly, the Atlantic links the EU Member States and regions bordering the Atlantic with transatlantic partners such as Canada and the US and with other neighbouring countries such as Norway and Iceland. Thirdly, it is also concerned with bringing about closer links between stakeholders in the regions. We should emphasise the aspect of bringing together and networking towns and communities, regions, Member States and, above all, citizens, civil society and businesses, so that these actors can bring this framework – that is, the macro-regional strategy – to life. After all, the intention is not to create new institutions or new bodies; the idea is to have an effect using existing funding. The resources that exist are bound to contain unexploited synergies and opportunities that can be used as a basis for our activities. It is precisely because of this that the ALDE Group considers this strategy to be urgently needed, because it affects international trade. Goods from all over the world come across the Atlantic into the European Union. Naturally, this trade must take place in an ecologically sustainable way. Moreover, there are likely to be large reserves of raw materials in the Atlantic that we may be able to utilise, provided there is sustainable protection for the environment. We call on the Commission to draw up and submit a strategy for this area as soon as possible. Michael Theurer,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are currently witnessing a historic situation, because the Free Trade Agreement with South Korea that we are debating and that we intend to adopt is the first Free Trade Agreement that has been debated under the new Lisbon system, which grants Parliament full power of codecision. This makes an important area of policy – trade policy – more democratic. We, as Parliament, consider this to be important. The debate here in Parliament has also shown that, as regards safeguard clauses, we were able to include important concerns expressed to us by workers, companies and associations in an improved safeguard clause that is intended to protect the interests of industry and, above all, jobs in the future by creating a level playing field and fair conditions for competition and avoiding asymmetries. That is what we as the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have concentrated on. As shadow rapporteur for our group, I am pleased that we were able to be successful in this regard. The duty drawback mechanism, which caused us concern to start with, has now been explicitly included in the safeguard clause and there is the option for industry, and also for Parliament, to call on the Commission to carry out an investigation. A monitoring process is planned, which is intended to be established in a transparent way via an online platform, and there is greater scope for the investigation of the factors that will decide whether significant damage has been done to European industry. Mechanisms for monitoring to be carried out by the Commission, particularly for sensitive sectors in the event of increased imports, are also provided for. We can start with this and focus on the advantages associated with the South Korea agreement, such as the considerable reduction in duties – the Commission expects enterprises in Europe to be able to save EUR 1.6 billion. I would therefore like to thank Commissioner De Gucht, who has personally worked hard to enable us to reach a compromise, including with the Council. I would also like to thank the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, especially Mr Sturdy and Mr Zalba Bidegain, for their excellent work. We have achieved something really good here.

 Mr President, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn, ladies and gentlemen, we must preserve the world’s oceans as an ecosystem. However, the oceans and the concept of globalisation are not mutually exclusive. Shipping routes are essential to our prosperity, because they are the arteries of world trade. There is a lot to be done in this context in order to ensure that we protect the environment and that our transport routes are secure. In future, we will also have to secure our supply of raw materials. Scientists are predicting that valuable raw materials can be found on the sea bed and in the sea itself. The important consideration is to extract them in an environmentally friendly way. The third aspect I would like to look at is the link between the oceans and inland waterways. I believe it is important to establish a connection with inland waterway transport. The development of the Danube plays a major role in this respect. As the longest river in the EU, in combination with the Rhine-Main-Danube canal, it can link the Black Sea with the North Sea. We should be creating a connection between integrated maritime policy and inland waterways. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, my fellow Members have explained that it is an urgent human rights issue that the import of these products into the European Union should be halted. I am also of the opinion that, in the context of such inhuman conditions, the question arises as to whether these products are being sold at dumping prices. I believe that we should look at the need for anti-dumping measures. In addition, we in the EU should make it quite clear that, irrespective of the commercial issues involved, the conditions in these labour camps are unacceptable to us. Naturally we should concern ourselves not just with the products themselves, but with improving conditions for the people interned in these camps who have no recourse to the principles of the rule of law. We should once again make this very clear to the People’s Republic of China. Michael Theurer,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I would like to thank Commissioner De Gucht as well as the rapporteur, Mr Zalba, for their positive cooperation in connection with the Free Trade Agreement with South Korea and the safeguard clauses. I would first like to emphasise that we Liberals and Democrats here in the European Parliament would like to see the agreement ratified and adopted as soon as possible, because we are in favour of free trade and because we see an agreement with South Korea as providing great opportunities for both the economy of the European Union and that of South Korea. Where the safeguard clauses are concerned, however, we need to take the concerns raised with us by European industry very seriously. We believe that the safeguard clauses represent an instrument that is capable of taking account of these concerns. We hope that the vote this week will send a signal that the political forces in Parliament are united and that these safeguard clauses will result in a well-functioning agreement being concluded here. We therefore call on the Council and the Commission to move towards us on the important outstanding issues. Above all, we do not want to see the duty drawback system being abused. We cannot allow duty drawback to provide an open door via South Korea for cheap products, particularly cheap primary products from China and other Asian countries. Moreover, we want the South Koreans to dismantle their non-tariff barriers to trade – such as the CO2
 regulations for cars – so that we do not have new barriers to trade coming in through the back door. We want social and environmental standards to be upheld. Naturally, the matter of comitology must also be settled; that is, for the later application of the agreement. Here, we want to see a strong role for Parliament. We also want industry itself and the Member States to be able to initiate such investigations and monitoring in future. One last point is a cause for concern: in the coming days, the Council will debate the provisional application of the agreement and possibly also vote on this. I must sound a note of warning here that, under the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament must give its consent. Provisional application would be contrary to the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon. I therefore call on the Council not to approve provisional application of the agreement, but to wait for Parliament to make its decision. We have done everything in our power to make a timely decision possible, and we should demonstrate this again by showing a united front in the vote. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

I support the action of the European Union in reorganising the current remuneration policy to provide long-term success and more accountability for decision makers. However, this must not lead to a situation in which policy determines salaries. This should remain the task of the authorities which are already in place, such as the board of governors and the general meeting of the banks. The proposed remuneration policy must therefore not replace existing structures but, at most, complement them where necessary, insofar as this is beneficial to the quality of economic decisions.

 It is certainly important to tighten the regulations on internships. The representatives of the German Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament have supported this. Young people often work for months on end without payment, hoping that they might still get a permanent job afterwards. This is an unsustainable situation. Internships should not destroy jobs. However, today’s plenary vote is going to pave the way in the future for a complete ban on unpaid internships. We believe that this gives a wrong message. It should still be possible to do a three-month unpaid internship, for example. There are numerous non profit-making or social organisations where a young person can acquire exciting, interesting experiences. However, such organisations are often unable to pay any remuneration for the internship. The key factor should be the duration of an internship. In the case of any internship lasting longer than six months, the employer can rely on productive output from the intern. From then on, remuneration should also be paid. The decision made today is impracticable and goes too far. We therefore do not support this part of the resolution.

 Combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography is vitally important. We must use all our strength to combat the availability of child pornography in communications networks. The permanent and effective control of child abuse is both a political responsibility and a precept of the rule of law. The German Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament is of the opinion that it is necessary to remove such criminal content as quickly as possible. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the current debate on a functioning system of European economic governance, the long-term perspective is being neglected, in my opinion. Now is the right time to incorporate the short-term stabilisation measures into a long-term strategy. We need a vision of a market economy. The fundamental principle of the social market economy is already laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon. We must now bring it to life. The social market economy was the successful model behind Germany’s economic miracle. Walter Eugen, the guiding light of the economic miracle, remarked as early as 1950 that the economic activity of the state should focus on designing the regulatory systems for the economy and not on managing the economic processes. Therefore, I am calling for a regulatory approach, in other words, measures taken by the state to influence the basic conditions of economic activity by means of general legislation. It is not the state which creates jobs, but it must create a regulatory framework for job creation and this is what we need to focus on. Competitiveness is not the start but the result of economic activity. Michael Theurer  (ALDE
).

 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, as we have heard, the financial markets need to be packaged in a new regulatory framework so that in future, we can avoid the excesses that have led to the crisis. However, if we highlight the underlying causes of the indebtedness of governments, then it becomes clear that, here in Parliament, we talk too much about public debt and too little about how we can achieve prosperity and growth. What determines our growth? Our growth and prosperity depend on people in the European Union developing products and generating new ideas that can also be sold on the global market. It is therefore right that one chapter in the EU 2020 strategy is Innovation Union. We need to focus on inventions and on how we can reinforce research and development. With that, it is important that we enhance the synergies of research funding and regional development policy. A great deal more could be done in those areas. Together with the Liberals and the German Free Democratic Party (FDP), I would argue that we focus on small and medium-sized enterprises. We should see to it that we, as the EU, spend our funding so that SMEs really get access to that funding and so that there is a technology transfer between universities and colleges and SMEs. We should encourage people to take their destinies into their own hands through personal responsibility and self-initiative. Governments cannot create jobs; they need to be created in the economy itself. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Takkula has just said, cyanide technology is a common method in mining. However, as we have heard, it is highly dangerous. The disaster that Mrs Băsescu just mentioned contaminated the Danube at the time and shocked us all, and you know that I campaign strongly for the Danube region. For that reason, as a trade politician, I wonder what can we do about it? In the European Union, we only have limited gold mining capacities. The goal is to make a difference worldwide with technical innovations. Here, there is high technology, I know. In Germany environmental technologies were developed that will help to avoid cyanide in the future. We must make these European high technologies commercially viable and we must make them affordable. I see great potential for trade in this. We should not confine ourselves to the European Union, but ensure that here, we also achieve a breakthrough in international trade, in the interests of the environment and our economy.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate about the euro, the debate about Greece, has defined recent days. I would like to draw your attention, at this point, to what strikes me as a disturbing piece of news, namely that 40% of Germans now believe that the introduction of the euro was a mistake. We have to be disturbed by that, because the introduction of a Community currency is not a one-way street. Europe’s integration process is not irreversible. I believe that we must keep the promise that we gave the German people when they gave up their national currency, namely, that the euro would be just as stable as the German mark. I am also firmly convinced that we in Europe need a discussion about the social market economy, about the regulatory framework. We should not be talking about how we are making Germany less competitive. Instead, we should be discussing how we can make the whole of Europe competitive so that we can be successful on global markets. That is what our aim must be; that is why I am calling for a debate on the social market economy in Europe. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

 The European Commission’s negotiations relating to the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) have raised a few questions. Although the agreement deals with justified concerns, namely combating the counterfeiting and smuggling of products and brands, it needs to be more firmly based on our European principles. It must not lead to the harmonisation of copyright law, patent law or trade mark law in the EU – on the contrary, the principle of subsidiarity must remain our most important principle. Trade agreements must not be misused in order to curtail the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals. Before Parliament can give the approval that is required for the ratification of this agreement, significant improvements still need to be made, and not only in terms of content. Parliament must be involved to a greater degree in the negotiations and the negotiation documents must be made available to us in full. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

 Mr President, the Goldstone report describes human rights violations by both sides. Over 1 400 victims in the Gaza Strip are obviously too many. However, I am also certain that, without the rocket attacks on Israel, there would have been no military response. During a visit to the country by the Delegation to Israel, we discovered that Israel does not take military action lightly. The main accusation of the Goldstone report, that Israel deliberately and continually attacked civilians, does not hold water. The question of the extent to which Hamas used civilians as shields has not been adequately investigated. However, the report mentions that the Israeli army provided warnings by means of telephone calls and flyers. Hamas did nothing like this in connection with the rocket attacks on Israel. However, we also need to ask whether the UN itself did enough in Gaza, for example, to prevent the Hamas rockets being fired in the vicinity of UN facilities. I do not believe that the Goldstone report is a basis for further terrorist attacks on Israel – it does not justify that. It perhaps does not help any further, either. However, it is clear that, here in the European Parliament, we must demand respect for human rights and call on both sides to return to the peace process. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

Madam President, Commissioner, firstly I would like to congratulate you on your appointment as commissioner. We are pleased to see such an astute and successful politician and a well-known Liberal on the Commission. You will need all your powers of persuasion to bring a new impetus to international trade policy in the EU. We must fight against any protectionist tendencies. History clearly shows that countries which have taken part in world trade have enjoyed better growth than those which did not. We are also facing a new world order. Some of the players involved, for example, China, have State capitalist systems, but may be using quite different methods in this arena. Therefore, I call on the Commission to develop a new strategy for world trade. It is clear that we must move forward with the Doha development round, because a multilateral approach is the right one. However, we will need all our efforts to make progress in relation to China. Michael Theurer,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon is opening a new chapter in the cooperation between the Commission, the Council and Parliament. The right of codecision of the European Parliament that has been directly elected by the citizens of Europe gives us the opportunity to bring democracy back into decisions on trade policy. This is the right thing to do, because it will have consequences for employees and consumers in the Member States. Free and fair trade forms the basis for Europe’s prosperity. We must therefore firmly oppose any protectionist tendencies. Free trade agreements like this one with South Korea can make an important contribution to stimulating world trade, growth and employment. However, it is in the nature of agreements of this kind, that, depending on their specific structure, they bring more benefits for some sectors of industry than for others. It is our job in Parliament to weigh up carefully the impact on different industries and sectors within the EU. In order to do this, we need the relevant data and impact assessments and it is the Commission’s task to provide them. However, despite many requests from the committee and in the plenary session, we have not yet received data which we believe to be satisfactory. This is the reason why the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has joined with other groups to ask this question. According to the information that we have received so far, the agreement offers opportunities for the service, mechanical engineering and plant construction, chemical and agricultural industries in the European economy. However, the concern is that the agreement will have a negative impact on the car industry and the textile and electronics sectors. The free trade agreement with South Korea is the only agreement with a developed country which does not include a ban on duty drawbacks. This may lead to one-sided cost benefits for South Korean industry. As the Commission has assured us on several occasions, the provisions on the duty drawback include a safeguard clause, which allows for a waiver on the basis of certain criteria. However, we urgently need to clarify this in the interests of the companies involved. The system must be applicable in practice. It must not be the case that the safeguard clauses are worthless because the companies cannot provide the necessary proof. As the agreement seems to contain one-sided regulations and as it sets a precedent for future agreements, for example, with India or with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, we feel that the specific wording of the safeguard clauses, the procedure for settling disputes and the other regulations relating to the application of the agreement are of central importance. We are therefore calling on the Commission to submit the free trade agreement together with the provisions on its application to Parliament for approval. We want a decision quickly. For this reason, a provisional version of the agreement must not be allowed to come into force. I know from discussions with companies what an important impact the implementation has. Therefore, my question to the Commission is as follows: Will the development of the European External Action Service lead to it playing a stronger role in trade policy? In our opinion, at least, this should be included. Michael Theurer  (ALDE
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against tax fraud is a necessity. Of course, tax evasion and tax fraud are not the causes of the economic and financial crisis. It seems important to me to make it clear once again in this House that we must regain the confidence of the taxpayer through simple tax systems and through low and fair taxes. However, that is not to say that we should not actively fight tax evasion and tax fraud, because any tax evasion undermines our sense of justice. That also brings us to the subject of tax havens. Germany’s neighbour, Switzerland, has voiced concerns that it is being placed under pressure. On this point, I would like to ask the Commission specifically: are proposals being made, or rather, are measures being taken to place Switzerland under particular pressure? My personal view is that Switzerland cannot afford to treat the EU any less well than the USA. Therefore, that means that Switzerland must actually join in our concerted efforts to fight tax evasion.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the importance of the Danube Region is evident by the very fact that 80 million people in six EU Member States and in four neighbouring countries live along the Danube. In the Black Forest – 100 km away as the crow flies – the Danube begins and then flows down to the delta and into the Black Sea. Therefore, we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe support the call for a Danube Strategy and, as the European Parliament, we are also making an important point this evening by having the subject of the Danube Strategy on the agenda. Twenty years after the collapse of the Iron Curtain, after putting an end to the division of Europe, the Danube is once again a symbol of unification. From a founder member of the EU, Germany, via Austria, which joined in 1995, through to the new Member States in Central and Eastern Europe that joined in 2004, the Danube also connects neighbouring countries like the accession country Croatia as well as other neighbouring countries that have aspirations for accession. It is therefore almost possible to see the reunification of Europe along the Danube. Ladies and gentlemen – and this is something to which the ALDE Group attaches a great deal of importance – we now need to take the appropriate measures to also make the Danube Strategy a regional policy priority in the new funding period. There are many ways to go about this. One option is for small and medium-sized enterprises to conclude more mutual partnerships. There are, of course, other major tasks in the area of infrastructure. This is particularly important to the ALDE Group because, as a result of the division of Europe, the historical transport links were broken and have not been modernised. Therefore, the development of the Danube as an inland waterway, the modernisation and improvement of its ports, locks and passability will provide an environmentally sound method of transport. However, work still needs to be done on the road and rail network. It is also particularly important that we involve the municipalities, towns, districts and the citizens in this. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, funding for the regions and structural funding form part of our practical economic policy and make Europe widely visible. In local authority areas, towns and municipalities in the regions, different players are working closely together. For this reason, we must retain this integrated approach for the entire European Union. I call on the Commission to focus much more closely on small and medium-sized enterprises and to involve the local authority areas, the towns and the municipalities much more in the future cohesion policy. We will definitely need to invest in the infrastructure in future, but most importantly, we must ensure that innovation and technology transfer are guaranteed for small and medium-sized enterprises. In future, we should also enable jobs to be subsidised. These are the crucial issues in choosing a new direction for the structural and cohesion policy in the European Union. Michael Theurer,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, two weeks ago, the Seventh Session of the World Trade Organisation Ministerial Conference was held in Geneva. I had the opportunity, as the representative of the delegation of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, to attend the conference and, as co-author, to contribute to the present joint motion for a resolution. There are four lessons that can and need to be learned from these experiences. The economic and financial crisis also brought a sharp fall in world trade. A speedy conclusion to the negotiations in the Doha Round is therefore crucial in order to give new impetus to the world economy. The revival of fair and free world trade is something that Doha can, and indeed must, achieve. The European Union has gone a long way to accommodate its partners, in particular those in the developing countries. For example, we have promised to abolish all export subsidies for agricultural products. Now we need to bring the negotiations to a conclusion. For this to happen, we need a signal of political will. In the ALDE Group, we are determined to achieve a conclusion to Doha. Now! It is therefore vital to join forces in order to bring the Round to a conclusion. The European Union can and must play a leading role in this. We should also take on a bridging role, for example, to bring together the United States and the emerging economies and developing countries, just as we call for in our joint resolution. We must now also raise the public’s awareness. We need broader support from the citizens. We should emphasise the advantages of global trade, as free and fair world trade is good for all of us. I do not see any alternative to Doha. The alternative would be competition for bilateral agreements, which would put access for the weaker countries and the inclusion of human rights and environmental aims at risk. That must not happen. We therefore need a conclusion to the Doha Round now. Michael Theurer  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have drawn up a major resolution which covers a number of themes. However, one important point – trade – is only touched on briefly. I believe that international trade is a decisive factor. The fall in world trade is one of the causes of the economic and financial crisis and I would like to see a greater focus on world trade, even now in the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC). It is not the case that the US and the European Union agree on every area. On the contrary, we have only a few trade agreements, there is a risk of bilateralism and there is the possibility that the Doha Development Round will not be continued by the US. Therefore, we should address the critical points and I hope that the TEC will introduce some new stimuli to revive international trade. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

 Mr President, I would like to congratulate you warmly on your speech. The process of bringing an end to the division of Europe was the result, on the one hand, of the desire for freedom among Central and Eastern European countries and, on the other, of course, of the attractiveness of Europe as an economic model. I believe that we have too little confidence, too little confidence in the future. If we cannot achieve this in Europe, then who can? We should explain with greater conviction that we can work on resolving our problems with confidence. We have a great deal of potential and there are still opportunities for growth throughout the world. While there are still people in the world who need goods and services, there will still be opportunities for growth. We can make sure that in Europe, we have a slice of this cake and everyone involved will benefit. I would like to encourage all of us to have more confidence in Europe as a successful model and I would like to ask you to convey this idea in your speeches. Michael Theurer,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank you, Commissioner Ashton, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, for the information that you have given us this evening in the extraordinary committee meeting and here in plenary. Clearly, the free trade agreement with South Korea is close to being concluded. From a Liberal viewpoint, and particularly from the point of view of my own German Free Democratic Party, the objective of free and fair world trade is of great importance, particularly right now, as, in the course of the economic and financial crisis, we see tendencies towards protectionism, tendencies which must be resolutely countered in the interests of prosperity and jobs in the European Union. In this context, the question arises of what significance the Commission attaches to the free trade agreement with South Korea, as there has, for a long time, been a focus on progress in the Doha development round, without any agreement being reached so far. That is the reason behind my question, Commissioner Ashton: do you see concluding the free trade agreement with South Korea as a first step towards further bilateral free trade agreements, and does that, in your view, mean a move away from Doha? Or are such bilateral agreements merely a supplement to or expansion of the European Union’s free trade policy? As you know, furthermore, the clause on the refunding of duties is a cause of concern in a number of Member States and sectors of industry – in particular, in the car industry. This clause could lead to supporting business in low-cost countries such as India and China, thereby threatening European manufacturing. Can you see a way that these concerns on the part of a number of Member States in respect of such refunding of duties can still be addressed? Nadja Hirsch,

 Mr President, it is necessary to change the year, because we have already decided that 2015 should be the European Year of Development. Therefore I propose, together with the other shadows, the following oral amendment ‘supports the Commission in its plan to declare 2016 the European Year of Integration.’  So we have only changed the year.

 I abstained from today’s vote, as the report presents the internet as a source of dangers to children and young people in too one-sided a way. It also intends to protect them by taking measures whose effects on freedom of expression on the internet cannot be foreseen. Too little reference is made to the huge opportunities that the internet offers young people, in the areas of education and participation for example. I also consider effectively disempowering parents by means of an ‘educational alliance’ among families, schools and civil society to be a crucial point. Instead of creating an artificial safe area for children, we should make sure that children and young people are empowered to use the internet confidently and independently. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE

 In addition to supporting the ‘eight hours’ campaign, the alternative resolution also contains a call for a legislative proposal introducing a ban on cloning. On balance, I decided to support the alternative resolution, despite the call for a ban on cloning, as limiting the transport time for farmed animals to eight hours is something that takes absolute priority. For one thing, the European Parliament has supported a written declaration in this regard. In addition, more than 1 000 000 people throughout the EU have put their signature to the ‘eight hours’ campaign. It is therefore only logical that the demand of the majority in Parliament and one of the first citizens’ initiatives should be reflected in the EU Animal Welfare Strategy. Nadja Hirsch,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is actually absurd. With regard to this important subject of a resettlement programme, we have achieved agreement across all of the groups. Many of the Member States are already implementing resettlement programmes. In other words, there is broad consensus that this is necessary and, above all, that it is not only an urgent, but also a highly volatile situation – as demonstrated in particular by the current situation in Africa. Thus, it is actually absurd that, even though there is agreement from almost all sides, this can founder simply as a result of the technical implementation. It is the duty of both the European Parliament – we are aware of this and that is why we have tabled a proposal – and the Council to assume responsibility here and to push this matter forward. I have experienced the Polish Presidency to be very creative, also in connection with the asylum package. It has tabled new proposals. For that reason, I am really placing my hope in the fact that you will now see the opportunity and present us with a proposal that is workable for the Council, the Commission and for us as Parliament, and that now, as we are in any case all in agreement, we can finally also tackle the implementation and – as Mr Tavares also said – can finally bridge that period that costs some people their lives. That is something that we need to be aware of in relation to this matter. I do not mean to be dramatic here, but each additional day that it takes us can cost someone’s life. Nadja Hirsch,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

Madam President, Commissioner, a good education policy is the best kind of employment policy. It is true that many highly qualified people are currently unemployed, but despite this, the people who have no education or few qualifications are also the ones who have little or no chance of finding a job, even when the economy recovers and the labour market takes off again. Therefore, it is precisely these people that we should be concerned about. It is our responsibility to ensure that these people have the chance of a new life. I would like to point out that 14.4% of pupils in the EU leave school early and this is an average, which means that in some places, the figure is much higher. What is happening to all these young people? They will have no opportunity in the foreseeable future, regardless of whether or not the economy is growing, to live an independent life or get a well-paid job. For this reason, we must invest in this area. I believe that, while it is a good thing for the European Parliament to call for this to happen, it is primarily the responsibility of the Member States. It is up to us to demonstrate which projects are already running successfully. At the moment, there is a model pilot project which involves looking after early school leavers and providing a youth guarantee. The project is attracting attention to this subject and giving it a high priority. This is a key issue on which we need to take action. In addition, there are, of course, all the people who already have a job. We must not forget that in many countries, the talk is of people retiring much later. My generation will probably retire at 70, if at all. This also means that it is not enough to train once for a job. We must invest in further education and make flexible and attractive training available within the European Union, so that people can continue their education alongside their family life. These are all factors that we need to take into account and I am confident that we will be successful and will take a step in the right direction. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE

Mr President, Mr Mleczko, it is not the case that we are starting from nothing. We should always remember that we in Europe have a good minimum standard in comparison with many other countries. Regardless of that, the Commission has submitted a new proposal. It is simply a result of the timing that the situation with regard to equality has changed. Therefore, the Commission proposal was a wise move, a step forward, which sent out a clear signal, but, at the same time, it was sufficiently moderate, at 18 weeks and 75%, that it would have been practicable. Unfortunately, I can only agree with the other speaker. Here in the European Parliament, a small majority put together a huge wish list. At the moment, it is sadly the case that we must either stick with this wish list or get nothing. I would like to make it quite clear to you that I would rather we took the new Commission proposal as our basis, so that we can at least move forward. Each individual country can then decide whether to add other provisions. Then it will be up to every individual Member State to raise its own standards even further. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE

 The German Free Democratic Party delegation in the European Parliament assumes that the inclusion of Romania and Bulgaria in the Schengen area will further improve freedom of movement within the EU. Now that both Member States have achieved positive evaluation results in all areas of the Schengen review, there should be no more obstacles to delay inclusion further. There is no denying that the technical securing of borders will not automatically make them impermeable as long as problems persist in combating corruption in the justice and policing system. Accordingly, this challenge also relates to Member States already in the Schengen area. For this reason, the German Free Democratic Party delegation believes that criteria such as the fight against corruption must receive greater attention when evaluating the Schengen mechanism, and any misdemeanours must be punished appropriately. Nadja Hirsch,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, tomorrow, we will vote on the role of vocational education and training in the Europe 2020 strategy. In this connection, it is worth taking a brief look at the position we are starting from. We currently have a level of youth unemployment of 21%, in other words, almost double the normal average. We have an EU-wide school drop-out rate of over 14%. The participation of women in gainful employment is still very low. Many people with disabilities, as well as migrants, are without jobs. The goal of the Europe 2020 strategy is precisely to tap this potential in terms of workers and to bring them into the workplace so that the EU, too, can deal with globalisation. Thus, it is also our job to ensure that initial vocational education in particular is of high quality. The discussion began in connection with the Copenhagen process, followed by the Bruges Communiqué, and now it is up to us to see to what extent this area can also be incorporated into the Europe 2020 strategy. An absolutely key element is the fact that young people must have the opportunity, not only in their studies, but also in their vocational training, to undertake part of their training in another EU Member State. It is a key element because someone who has already worked in another Member State will also take the opportunity later on to regard the European labour market as his or her labour market, with all the opportunities that that offers. It is therefore an absolutely key aspect that we must pursue. The second major area is, of course, that of further training. On account of demographic change, people are having to work for longer and longer – or they can work for longer, but everyone has to take that decision for themselves. People are living until they are much older and will continue with their careers for much longer, and in order to be able to carry on in skilled work until they are older, they will also need to undertake further training. There is currently a very low level of participation in further training initiatives. Here, too, it must be ensured that the willingness of both employers and workers exists and increases when it comes to taking advantage of further training and continuing to gain education by means of lifelong learning. For this, of course, the options on offer also need to be flexible. We must take everyone into consideration. Further training must fit in with other elements of people’s lives and it must be possible to do it alongside work and family life. For that reason, we clearly need to create flexible opportunities in future. The area of universities has received a great deal of attention – in connection with the Bologna Process, for example – and a similar situation faces us in the area of vocational training, including with regard to mobility. We could almost say that no one has noticed this. Nevertheless, alongside the universities, the area of vocational education and training is particularly important and we therefore must not ignore it. For that reason, I would like at this point to thank my fellow Members from the other groups once again for their very committed cooperation. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE

Madam President, the borders have been removed for the first time in Germany and Austria and we finally have free movement for workers from the countries of Eastern Europe. On the one hand, borders are being torn down, while on the other you are trying to build barriers yet again. I find it impossible to accept that two Member States and two gentlemen looking to make a name for themselves have managed to bring the issue of the reintroduction of border controls back to the debating chamber. There is no going back on this matter and we cannot allow ourselves to be put under pressure by this single-issue discussion. The refugee problem cannot be automatically resolved by returning to a regime of border controls. Pardon me. These people have risked their lives in making their way to Europe and they will also succeed in bypassing border crossings. The only ones who stand to gain from the reintroduction of border controls would be the human traffickers because the refugees would have to find new ways to cross the borders, providing the human traffickers with a new source of income. I cannot accept the fact that we are seriously contemplating this matter and I would call on the Commission not to compromise here. Nadja Hirsch,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, Mrs Malmström, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs most sincerely. We had very many debates. In the end, we reached some very good compromises, even though we all know that it is not always quite so easy, of course. On behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, however, I would like to say that, in any case, we still have the goal of establishing a common, EU-wide asylum system by 2012. That also means that we must now make some real progress and also send a clear signal to the Council that we have not lost sight of this goal and that we are, of course, still prepared to enter into negotiations. That goes without saying. However, I also believe that we need to make it clear that, above all, we want a common asylum system. It is not acceptable, as has already been said, for it to be almost like a lottery depending on where an asylum seeker makes his application. It is not acceptable – and in this regard I am pleased that, at the last minute, we achieved success here – for every individual Member State to have its own national list of what constitutes a safe third country. Either a country is safe or it is not – and then it still must be examined in each individual case whether it can, in fact, be a safe third country for the particular person who has made an application or whether, in this individual situation, it is perhaps not possible to simply say that is the case as such. I am also convinced that, ultimately, the Member States will benefit from this, but so will the asylum seekers, who will have the chance, in future, to receive a ruling directly at the first instance in a fair and nevertheless rapid application procedure if this is implemented in the way that we envisage it. I believe this also to be a right; asylum is a right, not a favour. We must take an absolutely clear position on this and then also have a clear procedure. Above all, I welcome the fact that we have managed to further extend the rights of minors. I am in favour of that and so is the ALDE Group, and I will be pleased if we get a good result in this regard tomorrow. Nadja Hirsch,

 Mr President, the resettlement programme is something that we worked extremely intensively on, investing a lot of energy, across all group divides and allegiances. We were unanimous in wanting to send out a clear signal on this matter. We also made it our top priority simply because it is such an important issue: people’s lives are at stake. Nonetheless, the situation and ongoing developments in North Africa mean that we are called on once again to produce results in double-quick time. We have already lost one year. We have made the best use of the time available to provoke a civil and social debate because, in the final analysis, we also need the support of the Member States, regional authorities and the local population if such a programme is to become established in the new Member States, too. This discussion and the social consensus that has gradually resulted cannot be abandoned just because the Council and other key players are unable to agree and have reached an impasse. The issue is too important. We have instigated this debate and, true to our liberal credentials, our aim is to make this matter a genuine priority. I believe that we have agreement across all the groups in Parliament. We have signalled our position and now await a clear course to be set by the Council so that the issue will be placed on the agenda and that the other Member States that have so far not played an active role will now be encouraged to get involved. The feedback that we have received during our discussions indicates that these Member States are willing to come on board. For this reason, the main concern on the part of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe – although I believe I can speak for all the groups involved because the level of cooperation was really excellent – is that this matter should be given priority and the debate that we have engendered on a broad social level should be encouraged, rather than jeopardised by continuously the matter being continuously put on the long finger. Nadja Hirsch,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.

 Madam President, as the rapporteur for the opinion on the report on equality, I concentrated on the labour market. Unfortunately, the pay differential is still 17% and women are still not always represented in management and supervisory boards. There is an urgent need for action here. We can no longer afford to waste the potential of females in society, whatever their age. We have a good level of education and the state invests in these young women and mothers. We really do need to make progress here and demand that companies finally put their fine words into action. To this extent, I welcome the fact that companies really are taking a step in the direction of a voluntary quota. However, on the other side, any report on equality should not forget that men are also disadvantaged in some respects. In particular, boys are not always given the opportunity to develop in school. Deficits exist in the area of housework and childcare and men can become more active here, too. This is one task we should all adopt for ourselves. Each of us, whatever our gender, should be given an opportunity to find our niche and live our lives as we see fit. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mrs Malmström, we are talking today about the judgment passed by the European Court of Human Rights. This is ultimately about Belgium, but it concerns every Member State of the European Union. Germany has also decided no longer to send asylum seekers back to Greece. As one of my fellow Members has mentioned, we must ask ourselves whether we want to build walls around Europe or whether we want to maintain and develop the right to asylum, something which I, as a Liberal, strongly support. However, this also means that we must give every asylum seeker the chance of a properly organised process. We must realise that it is unfair and shows a lack of solidarity if we allow the southern countries to bear the entire burden alone. Because of their geographical position, these countries have been exposed to an increased influx of refugees. In Lampedusa, this is because of current events in Tunisia. However, this is also an ongoing situation which the local asylum authorities cannot cope with. The recent liberalisation with regard to Kosovo also resulted in a huge influx of asylum seekers into Germany just a few weeks ago. We also had the problem that we could not initially process all the applications properly. Therefore, if we really want to retain this right to asylum, we must restructure the system to ensure that it offers greater solidarity in future. Dublin II cannot continue in its current form.

 Madam President, Mrs Malmström, we were all pleased, as were the citizens of Europe, about the revolution in Egypt and Tunisia and the fact that values such as freedom and democracy were suddenly on the agenda. Images from these countries have dominated the news over the last few days. However, for two or three days, we have also been seeing pictures of the streams of refugees and people in boats on our television screens and in our newspapers. We must act quickly to ensure that we do not miss this historic moment and that it is not only the pictures of refugees which remain in our memories. We must remember what these countries have really achieved. We must explain to the public that although a lot of people are coming here, the majority of them will go back, because they have no right to asylum as we define it. Of course, we have to ask ourselves the question which is frequently posed about economic migrants. One thing is clear. If these young people have no future prospects, they will come back. Perhaps not the same people, but constant streams of new migrants. This is why we need to deal with this problem now. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE

 In overall terms, the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament supports the waste disposal directive. However, the subject of photovoltaic modules remains a problem. There is no understandable reason for excluding the entire sector from the regulations. We have a wide range of legislation governing waste streams. Therefore, it is not clear why a complete industry, which is expected to produce significant waste streams, is being exempted. For this reason, some of the FDP Members of the European Parliament have abstained from voting on the report. Nadja Hirsch,

 Mr President, we have agreed in the European Parliament that we want a common European asylum system to be in place by 2012. This also involves having the same or similar conditions in all the Member States. However, the implementation of the system has met with resistance and that is primarily due to the fact that during the discussions on the asylum package, we were given inadequate information, sometimes no information at all, or even conflicting information. We had very little data as the basis for the financial estimates relating to the Procedures Directive and the costs in the Member States. Our aim is to call on the Commission to provide Parliament with a study or with the necessary information. This concerns areas such as the interpreting service and also legal advice. It is not clear what effects this will actually have in the Member States. On the other hand, during the process of revising the Procedures Directive, it has become clear that we can produce a high quality, fast procedure which is of benefit to both sides, because it helps decisions to be made quickly so that the situation is clear to people and there is a low error rate. Our objective as liberals is to give the Commission our complete support for its plans. However, we need arguments, including in the discussions with the Member States, which will demonstrate the effects of the revision of this asylum package and, in particular, the Procedures Directive. For this reason, we are calling on the Commission to give us genuine support to ensure that this asylum package becomes reality by 2012, so that we can establish a common European asylum system.

 Madam President, Commissioner, as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I, too, would like to express my sincere thanks to the two rapporteurs. Thank you for your cooperation. I think we have put together a good document today. We can take a decision on something today that can really put paid to human trafficking. However, the challenge will be getting the Member States to put this directive into practice. It is crucial that the enforcement bodies, such as the police and the courts, are made aware of how to actually recognise and to prosecute this crime. This is vital, and it is also very important to raise public awareness – as Mrs Matera has already mentioned – so that people are aware of the fact that human trafficking is happening within the EU. It is not just happening somewhere else; theoretically, it could also be happening right outside my front door. Another important point that, as Liberals from Germany in particular, we had difficulty with – although this has now been resolved in a positive manner by empowering the Member States – is the criminalisation of people who make use of this sort of service, because if someone is liable to prosecution, he can refuse to make a statement in a subsequent trial. If someone makes use of this right to refuse to give evidence – for example, a man who had been with a prostitute who had been endangered through human trafficking – information will be lost that could be used further to finally uncover this network of human traffickers. It is therefore a good thing that this rests with the Member States, and I would like to thank you very much for your cooperation. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE
).

Madam President, the question that we must ask ourselves is what is this directive intended to achieve? There is relatively substantial agreement that there should be health protection for mothers-to-be and new mothers. The great debate concerns the areas in which the aspect of equality should also be included. On the other hand, as the European Parliament, we also need to be aware that we are adopting a directive that will be in force not just for five years, but perhaps for the next 20 or 25 years. However, I hope that by then, women’s working conditions will be substantially better and companies will be keen to employ young mothers – not least because of a shortage of skilled labour – and, above all, will also build up the appropriate infrastructure for this. We need to bear in mind this perspective too. Notwithstanding this, I also realise that at present, we do not have a majority that is prepared to adopt this perspective. In view of this, we will probably arrive at a point where we agree on a compromise such as eighteen weeks, a higher rate of statutory payments or the continued payment of 75% of salary, which will indeed bring about an improvement in some European countries in particular. A much more important point, and one which goes beyond the aspect of maternity leave, is the framework conditions surrounding young families. This means childcare facilities; in Germany, for example, there are still not enough of these. That would be a real equality policy that gives women a chance to go back to work. Nadja Hirsch,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, I think it is right and proper for us to be championing the cause of a coordinated cohesion and regional policy. This is extremely important in order to deliver efficiency and to be able to use the money well, despite the limited amounts in question. I must warn, however, that the plan is to achieve this efficiency by applying one and the same set of rules to everyone. The funds are very varied, have very different target groups and different contents. With that in mind, coordination is very important but the same rules are not. That is exactly what we are experiencing with the European Social Fund at the moment, which is to say that it would be extremely well received by just those little communities, municipalities, if – just as the speaker before me said – for these small bodies on the ground, in particular, such an enormous amount of time and effort did not have to be spent in order to actually be able to access and use this money. That is exactly what we need though, as unemployment, poverty and socially excluded people are to be found in every Member State of the European Union, not just in certain regions, but in every Member State. With that in mind, I find it particularly important that the European Social Fund, in particular, should truly continue to be available to minorities, which, to an extent, also includes young people, but also the elderly and often people from an immigrant background, in future and actually, that it should be more available, in order to give these people the chance to enter the labour market, as that is precisely what we are aiming to achieve. The Europe 2020 strategy represents our attempt to achieve greater inclusion in the labour market for the different groups. I hope that that will not remain simply a goal; instead, we now have to genuinely provide the measures and the instruments to achieve it. The European Social Fund is a very effective tool in this regard. We just need to optimise it and, above all, make it useable. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE

 I cannot support the animal experiments directive in its current form. It is true that this version is more progressive that the old directive from 1986. However, in comparison with the huge scientific and technical advances made over the last 24 years, the measures for replacing animal testing seem very feeble. There are too many exceptions. In addition, the wording is weak and allows too much scope for interpretation and implementation. It is also absurd that Member States cannot put in place animal welfare measures which are stricter than those required by the EU. Market distortion is given as the justification for this. This sends the wrong message to the citizens of Europe, to the research community and to industry. On the one hand, the state must take into account the changes in citizens’ ethical awareness. On the other hand, more pressure must be exerted on the research sector and on industry. No one wants to put the status of Germany or Europe as a research location at risk, but investment costs are not a valid argument for postponing the further development and use of methods which do not involve laboratory animals.

 The German Free Democratic Party is fundamentally in favour of positive labelling (process labelling) of genetically modified organisms at a European level in order to ensure the necessary transparency for consumers. However, in this case, we were not able to vote in favour of the report, because it proposes unequal treatment for different sectors. It calls for labelling for foods of animal origin, but not for those of plant origin. Unfair labelling of this kind for products of animal origin could distort the market to the disadvantage of one side. This counteracts our efforts to ensure fair competition and is clearly in conflict with the principle of equality enshrined in our legal system.

 It is certainly important to tighten the regulations on internships. The representatives of the German Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament have supported this. Young people often work for months on end without payment, hoping that they might still get a permanent job afterwards. This is an unsustainable situation. Internships should not destroy jobs. However, today’s plenary vote is going to pave the way in the future for a complete ban on unpaid internships. We believe that this gives a wrong message. It should still be possible to do a three-month unpaid internship, for example. There are numerous non profit-making or social organisations where a young person can acquire exciting, interesting experiences. However, such organisations are often unable to pay any remuneration for the internship. The key factor should be the duration of an internship. In the case of any internship lasting longer than six months, the employer can rely on productive output from the intern. From then on, remuneration should also be paid. The decision made today is impracticable and goes too far. We therefore do not support this part of the resolution. Nadja Hirsch,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, what we all discussed on this subject was that we simply must convince more Member States to take part in this programme. I believe there is much to be achieved in this regard by explaining the programme and also highlighting its benefits, as those who take part have thus far always said that they will continue to do so and that they welcome the programme. It is very important to make clear which people this relates to. It relates to people who do not, themselves, have the power to come to Europe. These are women, children and the sick, who find themselves in refugee camps outside the EU and need our help. I think it is very positive that we will be deciding to make a larger proportion of the European Refugee Fund available in future. At the same time, I also believe that it is very important that this money, if it is paid to the national Parliaments, the nation states, in other words, must not just disappear into the budget, but it really must be used in order to build a durable structure, that the money, in fact, even has to be passed on to the local authorities and to the towns and cities where the integration actually takes place, where the nursery places and housing are provided. It is a very important point that the towns and cities and the local authorities, as our allies, must be involved in this discussion. The Member States are perhaps more inclined to reject this in the short term than the local authorities on the ground. In the predictability that this brings with it, I see an important element connecting us – the EU – and those on the ground bringing about the integration. All together, this could certainly give a boost to the resettlement programme, something that I think is very positive. Above all, there is one thing that needs to be stated very clearly, which is that the citizens cannot be left behind – people and associations must be found who ease the path of people who want to start a new life locally and who show them how their new town works or where the nearest swimming pool is. We need a cross-society consensus that we want to take part in a resettlement programme, that it is a good solution, and that people will actually bring about integration on the ground.

According to the resolution of the European Parliament on the draft general budget for the financial year 2010, adopted on 17 December 2009, a vote was taken today on the amending budget for the European Parliament, following the revised calculations made by the Parliamentary administration. The FDP in the European Parliament abstained, because there was a paragraph in the package of amendments concerned that we could not reconcile with our convictions. The FDP had already expressed its opposition to an increase in the secretarial allowance to EUR 1 500 during the discussions in committee. It is out of the secretarial allowance that MEPs’ assistants are paid. The FDP considers that the argument that more money is needed due to the additional work that MEPs have to do with the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is unsound, as there is nothing in past experience to support this. Certainly, due to the Treaty of Lisbon, which has just come into force, Parliament will overall need extra capacity for legislative work, but with the introduction of the Assistants’ Statute from the beginning of the current parliamentary term, there is still no proof that MEPs actually need more assistants. For this reason, there are grounds for concern that further demands and supplementary increases, or an extension of office capacity, will follow. For this reason, the FDP in the European Parliament abstained. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE

Madam President, firstly, congratulations to Mr Füle on his appointment as Commissioner. I would also like to congratulate Mr Swoboda, the rapporteur, on his report. It is a very balanced presentation of the progress made in Croatia. At the same time, it clearly indicates the areas where Croatia still has work to do in order to be able to complete the accession process. It is also significant that statistics taken from a Eurobarometer survey carried out in the autumn of last year show that 84% of Croats are dissatisfied with democracy in their country. This means that not only are reforms to the judiciary required, but also an improvement in the situation of minorities. It is also important to ensure that the freedom of the press is guaranteed. These reforms must be initiated and implemented and, above all, they must be supported by the population. In formal terms, the criteria can certainly be met very quickly, but the entire population must be behind the process and must welcome Croatia’s accession to the EU. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE

 Madam President, we have the European Year against Poverty and Exclusion. Women are still at a very high risk of becoming poor or having to live in poverty. There are many small steps which land them in that position: girls tend to choose jobs which do not pay so well. They then decide to have children, which often leads them to only be able to work part-time. Alternatively, they might decide to look after their parents or grandparents, which again puts older women in a situation where they are unable to return to work. These periods add up and, as a result, women’s professional careers progress much more slowly. This is also reflected in the fact that they have lower pensions, for example. There are many aspects to this, and many have been included in this report. The really important message we need to put across is that there are already many opportunities out there, but girls and women need to make use of them. The awareness that a girl is studying engineering, and that she is brave enough to do so – that is what we have to promote in schools. This also applies particularly to immigrant women. I would also like to make another point: if you look around the Chamber today, you will see that two thirds of us attending this debate are women and one third are men. We must also win men over to taking a much greater interest in this subject, so that, one day, we can have the two remaining thirds of men attending and supporting women’s issues. Nadja Hirsch,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her commitment and excellent cooperation, as this really is an important subject. As we have said already, human trafficking is perhaps the very worst form of crime. Europol’s figures, cited in the question, show that there has been no improvement in this field. The opposite is true, in fact. In the area of forced labour, specifically, the figures are going up, whilst the figures on the trafficking of women remain unchanged. It is thus absolutely clear that there is an urgent need, above all, for consistent action. In order for such action to succeed, it is necessary, first and foremost, to adopt an integrated approach in the most varied of areas. One absolutely essential element is to increase awareness – including amongst the population within Europe – that human trafficking takes place right in the middle of Europe, in every country. We need, above all, to get to work on education in this regard, as we did, for example, for the football World Cup in Germany, in order to bring the issue of forced prostitution to light, and to show that this really happens everywhere, and also to inspire debate amongst the populace so that there is an awareness there which will lead to the victims being helped. My second point concerns the protection of victims. Precisely when people are rescued from such a dramatic situation, the Member States, too, must ensure that there is medical and psychological care for them so that they are supported in going back to their countries of origin where appropriate or so that the way is opened to asylum or other similar possibilities here to find a new home and to begin a new life.

 The German Free Democratic Party members of the European Parliament have abstained from voting on the Copenhagen resolution for the following reasons. The resolution contains statements about financing for climate protection measures in third countries without defining the specific criteria or purpose of the financing. We cannot justify this to taxpayers. In addition, we believe that blanket criticism of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) is wrong. The ICAO is the organisation which deals with aviation matters at an international level. Both the criticism and the statement about the alleged failure of ICAO negotiations are incorrect and inappropriate. The call for specific arrangements for a CO2
 trading system for the aviation industry goes against current EU legislation and overburdens the EU’s negotiating position in an international climate agreement with unrealistic demands.President. −  
Dear colleague, I do not have any doubt that those who can speak, will speak, but it is not a convention. The Rules of Procedure stipulate that it is up to the chairing President to decide when and how it is allowed. Excuse me, but that is for clarification. Alexander Alvaro  (ALDE

Mr President, this is turning into groundhog day. Every seven years, we have renewed squabbling over money. As Jutta Haug has rightly said, the Member States bicker like children. Once again, we are becoming embroiled in discussions over whether there should be 5 % more or 5 % less for agricultural subsidies and essential investment in research and development, instead of talking about the priorities and where the European Union should be going in future. The fundamental problem is becoming increasingly obvious. Our Member States are all egotists. The question is always: ‘What can I get from the European budget?’, not ‘What can I contribute in terms of added value to this budget?’. Instead of shared European interests, the EU is dominated by 27 sets of national interests.  Unless we manage to formulate some shared interests for the European Union, we will set the course for its ultimate demise. That is something that no rational Member of this House could possibly want. The multiannual financial framework must be seen as an opportunity to define these European interests. President.

I voted in favour of this report because I believe that the discharge decision for the European Medicines Agency (EMA) cannot be based upon additional requirements, such as the guidelines of the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development), when the implementation of those requirements has not been officially requested by either the EU legislator or specific arrangements within the Agencies during the respective discharge procedure. The European institutions are therefore invited to examine whether it is advisable to incorporate and to commit to additional guidelines in a possible common framework for all European institutions and bodies. On the basis of the data available, I agree that discharge can be granted to the Executive Director of the European Medicines Agency in respect of the implementation of the EMA’s budget for the financial year 2010.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time we have met to discuss this issue, although it may be the first time that we have met at this hour. The question now arising, slowly but surely, is this: when will our debate about data retention finally be at an end? A great many Member States and their constitutional courts have decided that it is not compatible with national constitutions. The Irish High Court referred the matter to the European Court of Justice, and countless citizens in the Member States have not only expressed disquiet and incomprehension about data retention but reject it outright.  I hate to say it, but our assessment all those years ago, when this issue was first discussed in 2005, was correct. We have legal issues which are unresolved; we have economic issues relating to data retention which are unresolved; and we have technical issues which are unresolved. Above all, we have social issues which are unresolved. The Commission’s evaluation report clearly showed the extent to which the approach to data retention, procedures and use vary between the Member States. In some countries, for example, the coastguard can access dossiers of retained data; in others, authorities can make a verbal request. The evaluation report also showed that everything has been achieved, except for harmonisation on issues of data retention. The question whether it is needed at all is still unanswered. In that sense, the authors are rightly asking when we can expect a new initiative from the Commission. It is time to stop flogging a dead horse, which is what data retention is. I would hope that we will have the opportunity to discuss a reform before the end of this legislative term and, in particular, to hear the Commission’s proposals during this debate. I hope we will find out more this evening. I do not want to speak for too long, so let me finish by saying this: I am sure you will have noticed from my comments that we are all getting very tired of this issue. I personally would greatly welcome it if we could find a solution to this sorry state of affairs at European level and perhaps even deal with the issue in an objective manner. Alexander Alvaro,

Mr President, many thanks, Mr Voss, for your input, which is very interesting, especially as regards the role of the Justice Minister. Would you not say that it is the Justice Minister’s responsibility, if she sees that an item of legislation is incompatible with the law and, furthermore – as noted by the Irish High Court, which would not have referred the matter to the European Court of Justice otherwise – possibly incompatible with EU law as well, to suspend the legislation until the matter has been clarified, rather than transposing what is possibly bad law?

Madam President, Mr Lewandowski, the draft budget for 2013 includes funding of almost EUR 150 billion for commitments alone. These commitments are directly related to the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy and they have increased by 2.7% to EUR 64.5 billion in total. The figures under Heading 1, sustainable growth, in particular, have risen by 3.5%. The central programmes for growth and investment, small and medium-sized businesses, employment and young people and new initiatives, for example, the planned pilot phase for the project bond initiative in the fields of transport, energy and ICT, should help to resolve liquidity problems and, therefore, to promote investment and growth, which Europe currently needs more urgently than ever. The payments in the draft budget amount to a total of EUR 138 billion. In the last year of the current financial framework, the draft budget includes higher funding for payments than in 2012, in particular, in the Seventh Framework Programme, where the increase is around 28%, and in the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, where the increase amounts to about 12%. These correspond exactly with the estimated payment applications from the public and private partners, which are responsible for projects in these areas. The proposed increase of 6.8% in the total payment appropriations is the result and the inevitable consequence of the EU’s commitments under the terms of the Treaties to enable all the larger programmes to continue and to take into account the outstanding commitment appropriations from the current year and from previous years. This is conscientious and responsible budgeting. We are also setting priorities, such as the programme for supporting ICT policy, which will be concentrating in 2013 on increasing the spread of these technologies and ensuring that they are used as effectively as possible, in line with Europe’s digital agenda. Overall, this programme will support Europe and the draft budget is a positive approach which we will hopefully be able to adopt together with the Council. Incidentally, if you will allow me to, I would like to conclude by saying that we would have saved a significant amount of money if we had held this debate in Brussels and not in Strasbourg.

− I would be happy to oblige, Mr Pirker. Firstly, perhaps you will have noticed that I did not preside over this debate from the outset. Accordingly I regret that I did not realise that you did indeed have the discipline to be here from the start. The Rules of Procedure themselves state that if we have a five-minute ‘catch-the-eye’ procedure, then five speakers are permitted. It is basically a matter for the President to decide how to handle this. I do not know the eight colleagues from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) (PPE) who requested the floor. I actually made what I thought was the fairest choice. I chose a woman so that there would be a balanced representation of the genders, because the other groups were all represented by men. I am not sure if my answer will satisfy you, but I have to follow some rationale in making a choice. With eight members of the PPE Group requesting the floor, I freely admit that my choice was not based on who had been here for how long. As I was not presiding at the start of the debate, but only took over the chair at a later stage, I was not aware of this. I can assure you, however, that I will take this into consideration the next time, particularly in your case. If a Member has had the discipline to attend a debate from start to finish, then he should be given the opportunity to speak. I apologise that this was not the case this time.

Mr President, inevitably, we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe find it difficult to reach a decision on issues like this. For us, this is a matter to be pondered and we follow a rational path, weighing up the arguments rather than being swayed by dogma. We are the only group in this House to follow such practice. We are aware that legal certainty, legal clarity and the question of the clarity of the wording are decisively important, in other words what is contained in this agreement and what the decisive points will be for us. There are deficiencies with regard to the question of further usage and retention periods, as well as with regard to the area of application, which is open to interpretation. The wording is not clearly defined. As a group we are known for our attachment to freedom, specifically the freedom of the individual. Security is always the servant of freedom. It is never the other way round. Responsibility is an essential element in this context. It is our responsibility to protect and balance the interests of our citizens. In our view this agreement does not achieve that and I believe that our rejection makes it clear that we shall oppose this erosion of freedom and responsibility. President.

 Mr President, thank you, Mr Lewandowski, for the proposal you have submitted. It is not easy to present a budget when so many different interests are involved and Mr La Via has succeeded in highlighting the majority of Parliament’s priorities. In my opinion, there are three decisive aspects to the budget guidelines: the budget must be balanced, it must be sensible and it must be responsible. Mr Lamassoure has just referred to the fact that we have had two austerity budgets in a row. This is absolutely the right thing to do in this situation. During this period, the Member States have only been able to provide limited resources. At the same time, as the previous speaker rightly pointed out, we need to make investments. These are, of course, complementary measures. First of all, we need to create the necessary structures, which are based on a responsible approach to the use of taxpayers’ money, so that we can make investments. Otherwise, we will be throwing good money after bad and this cannot be in our interests. Therefore, I believe it is important that we remind ourselves of this in the guidelines from the parliamentary side. We played a significant role in ensuring that the Member States agreed on automatic sanctions after the summit on 1 and 2 March and this must now be put into practice. I would like to see the Commission and not the Council taking responsibility for this, because then we could be sure that it would be implemented. At the same time, however, we need to give the Member States support with regard to European added value. The issue of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) has been mentioned. They form the backbone of the European economy. It is not the large organisations and the multinationals that create jobs. It is the medium-sized companies which ensure that Europe’s engine for growth and employment continues to function. Therefore, we need to make targeted and sensible use of money. More funding does not necessarily mean better policies. Finally, I would like to express my full support for what Mr Lamassoure said about the need to resolve the problem of the outstanding commitments or reste à liquider
. Most importantly, as far as the budget is concerned – and it is a pity that the Member States are not represented – it would make sense for us to draw up a sensible budget right from the start, so that we do not find ourselves in a difficult situation because amending budgets are required. President.

 Mr President, since 14 of the 15 blue cards have unfortunately gone by the board, I would like to ask Mr López Aguilar whether he can explain to me why Mr Weber, who represents the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), supports law and order, but is not prepared at least to take the group in the direction of carrying out a serious legal test under Article 7(1) which would be a proper solution to the case.

Madam President, Commissioner, good morning. It is good to see you in this last week of business in Strasbourg for this year. As Mr Fernandes has rightly said, 2007 was the year the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund was established, since which – it is unfortunate that my fellow Member from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is no longer listening – EUR 307 million has been distributed – out of a fund of EUR 2.5 billion. Money alone is not the solution when it comes to tackling economic crises and the consequences of globalisation. Structural reforms in the labour market, economic reforms, taxation reforms and social reforms are the elements that can be used to take control of globalisation. Do not be fooled into thinking that money is the horn of plenty that can be used to solve all problems in the long term. If we see the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund as a way to reward the conduct of companies like Nokia, which has moved from Bochum in Germany to Romania and, ultimately, out of the European Union, receiving monetary support on two occasions, that is the wrong approach, and we will certainly not allow that to happen. Mr Fernandes is quite right and I share his views on the prospect of the European Parliament becoming the field where national election campaigns are fought. I note what has happened in France. I also believe, however, that this is a matter for France and does not need to be discussed here. That is why my group will reject the oral amendment if tabled. There are still more than 40 Members of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in this House. This means that we can also reject this oral amendment. I would much prefer it if we were to sit down together and work out how we can integrate the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund intelligently into European budgetary policy within the parameters of the Multiannual Financial Framework, ensuring more growth and more jobs, rather than perpetuating unemployment with the money we have.

Blue-card answer.

(DE)
 Mr Rübig, I believe that these are precisely the kinds of proposals that we can build on. If we work together – for example with the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), although I am also certain that it would be possible to collaborate with the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance – to produce suggestions for how we can finance and support medium-sized enterprises, young entrepreneurs and start-ups, as well as encouraging quality in the existing business community, then I believe we will arrive at a common denominator, which is precisely the path we should take.

 Madam President, actually this is the problem, and we in the Committee on Budgets have asked, in the reports dealing with EAGGF – especially through amendments – for evaluation mechanisms to be put in place, because we as a Parliament do not know exactly how many people have been reintegrated into work with the help of the European Globalisation Fund (maybe Commissioner Lewandowski knows). We know how many workers we have helped and how many redundant workers have been receiving money out of the Globalisation Fund, but we do not know how many have actually been reintegrated into work. Just to correct one thing: I did not say that companies are doing good; I said that the European Globalisation Fund is actually taking away the burden from enterprises to elaborate specific social plans. This is something which worries me probably as much as it does you. Alexander Alvaro  (ALDE

 Mr President, I am pleased that the Polish Presidency was able to conclude its term in office so successfully. When you receive more praise from all the groups for your Presidency than I, like Mr Schulz, have ever heard in the 15 presidencies that I have had the good fortune to experience, then it is clear that the ‘P’ in Poland stands for ‘professional’. We would like to thank you for the work that you have done in that area. Unfortunately, a lot of what you have achieved in your Presidency has been overshadowed by the general focus of attention on the euro crisis and the debt crisis in Europe. However, you did something very important that has not yet been mentioned. In the preparations for the multiannual financial framework of the European Union, your Presidency involved Parliament at a very early stage for the first time. I had the pleasure of leading a European Parliament delegation in Sopot. We in Parliament were involved in these discussions at an earlier stage than we have ever been before. That is important to us. We hope that the same thing will happen in future, too. In the areas of justice and home affairs, in which I have also been working for many years, you have achieved a significant amount of success in connection with combating child abuse as well as in other areas. I could say that you are concluding your Presidency with a results sheet of successful action that I would like to see followed in a similar way by other European states and companies. I would like to thank you, and I look forward to our continued cooperation in a different context in the Council. Alexander Alvaro  (ALDE

 Mr President, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Council Presidency, Mr Lewandowski and, in particular, the two rapporteurs who, together with the Chair of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Lamassoure, have done an excellent job. The tough negotiations that formed part of the conciliation procedure lasted for 17 hours and the European Parliament spent two hours of this in discussions with the Council. Perhaps it would be sensible next time around if the Council did not hold its negotiations during the conciliation procedure, but instead reached a common position first. That would make the job easier for all of us and would extend the Saturday morning slightly. Nevertheless, we have nominally agreed on a sensible budget. We have accommodated the Council’s requirements. At the Council’s request, the payments were limited to EUR 129 billion and the commitment appropriations were set at EUR 147 billion, which is what Parliament wanted. We should not be under any illusions, however. We are pushing a very dangerous avalanche along. The Council is prepared to finance the commitments that have been entered into by means of supplementary budgets, but I would prefer a commitment to establishing a budget from the beginning with a clear financial basis, so that we do not need constant amending budgets. This simply postpones the problem. Another problem that has emerged is the fact that the European Union needs more investment in research and development. Everyone, including the Member States, clearly supports this. However, this will not work with a capped budget, unless we are prepared to abandon our dogmatic approach to preserving the status quo and our subsidy mindset. If we do not restructure the budget in favour of research and development and the Europe 2020 strategy, we will not be able to meet these priorities. At the same time, we have also shown that, at a time when citizens have to tighten their belts, the European Parliament can do the same. I would like to thank Mr Fernandes in particular, who has made an excellent job of initiating this process. We have achieved a good result and we will be able to vote in favour of this budget. However, we still have to discuss whether this is the right approach in the long term. Alexander Alvaro  (ALDE

 The representatives of the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament will only vote in favour of the Hübner report on amending COM(2011)0482
 on condition that, when raising the applicable cofinancing rates by ten percentage points, there is an exception for those Member States explicitly affected. This exception must not be able to act as a precedent in any way and should be revoked in respect of the Member States in question once the severe financial and economic crisis and its liquidity squeezes have been overcome.

Mr President, I would like to recall that about three years ago Franziska Brantner and I set up what we called ‘Friends of the European External Action Service’, a temporary platform where academics, NGOs and future diplomats of the EEAS could come together and discuss how this should be structured. Some of the things that we came up with are on the agenda today. One is political deputies. We recommended this, but at the time it did not find favour with those who initiated the service. It became clear very quickly that ubiquity is not something that one can expect of the High Representative in what we always called an impossible job – three hats at the same time is simply impossible to fulfil without serious political deputising. Today this is the first point in the recommendation that we are writing as a Parliament. The second issue that we discussed – and which was indeed realised – was to have a broader leadership structure rather than one all-powerful General Secretary. If it was Pierre Vimont we would not have a problem with that of course, but we did not want to have an éminence grise
 behind the scenes who would not appear in Parliament etc. We wanted to have the opportunity to give you as much information from as many sources as possible in your leadership functions. We believe that, even if this is modified, the principle is still valid.  A last point – and my colleague here the Earl of Dartmouth just mentioned this  – is that our Member States are indeed closing down embassies and consulates and that this is where the External Action Service can provide added value because our Member States will continue to be represented by a service that is their own.

I actually have two questions. Firstly, you complain about a lack of solidarity, although aid of about EUR 10 billion has been given to Cyprus, a country of less than one million people. I think that is proof of solidarity. Do you agree with me? Secondly, are you aware of the Council of Europe’s report that has just been leaked, concerning money laundering and the lack of effort on the part of the Cypriot authorities to combat money laundering effectively? We are seeing some pretty dramatic figures online right now. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Mr President, the Taoiseach is here; Chancellor Merkel was here; Prime Minister Monti was here; President Sarkozy, when still in office, was here. David Cameron is hiding in Holland. He seems to be afraid of a real debate about the future of Europe with the elected representatives of the peoples of Europe. I would like to say to Martin Callanan of our Tory friends to invite him to come here to have this debate here rather than in The Hague. Your being here earns you our respect and loyalty but not only that. Sie haben sechs Sparhaushalte nacheinander verabschiedet. Sie haben alle Auflagen von IWF und Europäischer Union erfüllt. Sie sind am Kapitalmarkt zurück, Sie haben wirklich viel getan! Aber Ihr Schuldenstand wird in diesem Jahr ungefähr 120 % des Bruttoinlandsprodukts erreichen, und Sie wollen deshalb die irischen Schulden europäisieren. Ob das richtig ist, sei dahingestellt. Es ist allemal legitim, es zu versuchen. Es wirft nur eine Frage auf: Kann Irland wirklich ein ehrlicher Makler sein, wenn die Last der nationalen Interessen so schwer auf Ihren Schultern drückt? Vergessen wir nicht, in zwölf Monaten wird hier der griechische Premierminister sitzen. Welche nationalen Interessen wird er mitbringen? Das ist ein großes Problem. Sie haben eben in Ihrer Rede gesagt, Sie wollen eine erneuerte und umgebaute Europäische Union. Das klingt bei Ihnen erheblich glaubwürdiger als wahrscheinlich bei David Cameron am Freitag. Ich habe einige Vorschläge, was man machen könnte. Zum Einen: Lassen Sie uns die rotierende Präsidentschaft abschaffen. Sie werden sehr gute Arbeit machen. Das ist Ihre siebte Präsidentschaft, Sie haben eine hervorragende Europaministerin. Aber das System ist ein Problem. Zweitens: Gestern hat hier der österreichische Bundeskanzler, der auch hier war, um über Europa zu debattieren, gefordert, dass alle Rabatte abgeschafft werden sollen bei der Finanzierung der Europäischen Union. Lassen Sie uns das System erheblich einfacher machen! Beim dritten Punkt geht es an Ihre Glaubwürdigkeit: Sie haben gesagt, Sie wollen eine Europäische Union, die weniger komplex, weniger institutionell ist. Der erste wichtige Schritt dahin ist eine kleinere Kommission. Wir haben jetzt 27 Kommissare, es werden immer mehr. Das ist der erste wichtige Schritt, und hier spielen Sie eine ganz besondere Rolle!

Mr President, I second the last remark. It is good to have you here in this job, Stavros, it is good that we have you as an EU Special Representative for Human Rights. I think that is very good. Die Menschenrechtspolitik der Europäischen Union war ja eine Zeit lang wirklich in der Kritik.  Die Stunde der Wahrheit war der Arabische Frühling. Wir haben in den Spiegel geschaut, und was wir gesehen haben, das hat uns nicht alles gefallen. Wir haben darauf reagiert, mit einer Menschenrechtsstrategie, mit einem Aktionsplan – das ist gut. Mit einem Sonderbeauftragten für Menschenrechte – auch das ist gut. Wir unterstützen die Zivilgesellschaft und Nichtregierungsorganisationen – auch das ist gut. Wir wollen uns koordinieren und wir wollen an einem Strang ziehen – auch das ist gut.  Aber hier habe ich eine ganz konkrete Frage an Frau Kozakou-Marcoullis, mit der Bitte um Antwort: Wir wollen uns koordinieren, wir wollen uns abstimmen, wie machen wir das praktisch?  Sollten wir uns nicht – Sie haben den Europäischen Demokratiefonds erwähnt – in unserer Politik und in unseren Instrumenten wirklich darauf verpflichten, dass die Demokratieförderung von EIHDR und EED eng abgestimmt wird, dass miteinander geredet wird, um Doppelungen zu vermeiden? Ich bin sicher, Sie werden mir da zustimmen.  Und Sie haben auch Diskriminierungen auf der Basis von Kastenzugehörigkeit erwähnt. Wir werden morgen hierzu eine Dringlichkeitsentschließung haben. Würden Sie mir auch zustimmen, dass die Europäische Union in ihrer Politik und ihren Instrumenten kastenbasierte Diskriminierung aufgreifen und bekämpfen sollte? Herzlichen Dank für Antworten auf diese beiden Fragen. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Mr President, we are voting on quite a large number of amendments tabled by one particular group that usually attaches great importance to strict compliance with the Rules of Procedure. In this House, roll-call votes are generally reserved for issues of particular and major importance. It would therefore be sensible for the EP’s Services to contact the group concerned to establish whether each of these roll-call votes is, in fact, necessary. In my view, what the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group is inflicting on us here is completely unnecessary. (Applause) Alexander Graf Lambsdorff,

 Mr President, Prime Minister, Mr Barroso, we have heard a great deal about how the house of Europe is built of the bricks of solidarity, but houses must be built on solid foundations. That has been the distinctive line of the past six months: the link between solidarity and solidity. I would therefore have liked you to have said a bit more about solidity, Prime Minister, and to have talked about how we can exert better, stricter control over the situation that we are in – the debt crisis in the Member States that has dragged our currency down with it. You mentioned the ‘two-pack’, and that indeed took place during your Presidency. In the case of the ‘two-pack’, we, as the European Parliament, called for a debt redemption pact. I believe we need to take a brave step forward if we want to be successful here. However, the Council’s decisions of last weekend leave a lot of questions unanswered. Mr Swoboda mentioned the growth pact. I know that it is something he is particularly concerned about. Der Spiegel
 called the whole thing a sham. A total of EUR 50-55 billion is supposed to come from the Structural Funds, but even Commissioner Hahn says he does not know how such figures are arrived at. I am not convinced that it is genuinely solid, that it will restore confidence among our citizens. Liability and control go together; that is the really crucial thing. We want to liberate forces for growth, we want the European patent. However, and in this Mr Swoboda is absolutely right, what the Council has decided is completely absurd. A court that sits in three different places – London, Paris and Munich – is downright grotesque, and it shows that quite clearly the Member States are not capable of coming to sensible decisions on such an important, innovation-driving matter. I have one question. A new system of banking supervision is now to be established on the basis of Article 127(6) of the Treaty. I thought we had a European Banking Authority. Are we now going to have a banking supervisory authority with two seats as well? Are we going to get two different banking supervisory authorities? Precisely what form does the Council imagine this is going to take? You will find it pretty difficult to explain the proliferation of seats of various organisations to this Parliament and get support for it. In other respects, I would like to offer my sincere thanks for your committed Presidency. There are some other matters that you have progressed with real success. I have not mentioned Schengen, which was undoubtedly a sore point in your Presidency. However, the enlargement policy in respect of Serbia and Montenegro is undoubtedly one of the positive aspects.

Blue-card question.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I should like to ask Ms Harms whether what she describes as a comfort – the prospect of joint liability, common risk – does not necessarily also entail shared political control, or should be viewed in parallel with this. After all, the debts for which we are jointly liable today are the taxes of tomorrow. No taxation without representation. That is a very important point. My second, very specific, question is as follows. You said that bank risk should be separated from sovereign risk, and that we have now succeeded in this. However, the European Stability Mechanism, which is currently recapitalising the banks, is borne by sovereign states. In other words, sovereign risk is being distributed differently, but it is still there. What is your assessment of this? I take a very critical view of it, and where the conclusion of the Euro Group is concerned, I am decidedly sceptical as regards how vague it has been kept and what impact it will have in practice. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, firstly, congratulations to Mr Lewandowski. However, the person I really want to wish all the best is not you, but rather your namesake, Robert, of Borussia Dortmund – I hope he manages to score to take Poland into the quarter finals. That really would be something to celebrate. We have just heard a few things about the Council and the future of Europe that this Council is to decide on, that are to be debated. Listening to what Mr Bokros has said here, I believe this to be very important. The crucial thing as regards everything that we are debating in relation to the multiannual financial framework, in relation to the budget, is whether the private sector is going to invest again, whether the private sector will regain its confidence in the European economy and its prospects. This is the decisive factor. Public budgets can only provide incentives at best. The Social Democrats sometimes need that explaining to them. You cannot buy growth; you can only enable growth. That is why it is crucial that the structural reforms that President Barroso mentioned come about. The second really crucial thing is the debt redemption pact; a clear, effective debt redemption pact linked to clear conditions which will relieve the burden on the budgets in the Member States, which at present, despite all their efforts – in Italy, for example – simply cannot emerge from the constraints of their refinancing. We therefore need a clear and effective debt redemption pact. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff, Britta Reimers and Michael Theurer  (ALDE

 The German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament has spoken out clearly in favour of the introduction of a debt redemption fund. However, participation in such a fund must be associated with clear and strict rules, such as were contained in the proposal made by the German Council of Economic Experts to the German Government in autumn 2011. Watering down the criteria for participation is neither productive nor effective. Linking the introduction of a debt redemption fund with the eurobonds project and the treatment of economic imbalances is unfair, and is rejected by the FDP in the European Parliament in the strongest possible terms.

 I have two very specific questions. One is whether Mr Rouček is aware that the Czech Government has granted political asylum to Mr Danylyshyn, the former Ukrainian Minister for the Economy. This is only granted when the person is suffering from political persecution. I would also like to know what he thinks of this fact. My second question concerns whether it is relevant that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament or the Social Democratic Party of Europe has a cooperation agreement with the Party of the Regions. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, as Mr Siwiec has just said, this is not the first debate that we have held on the subject of Ukraine and, as has so often been the case before, large parts of this debate have been unproductive and predictable. Why is this? The answer is quite simple. The Batkivshchyna is a party which follows the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and, as we have just heard, the Party of the Regions has an agreement with the Socialists. In other words, the PPE group is now making a big fuss, puffing out its cheeks and running a poster campaign to create a good photo opportunity, while the Socialists are giving speeches about the situation in Ukraine which they ought to be ashamed of. This is a softly-softly approach which glosses over the reality of the situation. This type of debate does not do justice to the strategic or the humanitarian dimension of the problem. Ukraine is a large country with a population of 50 million. It lies between Russia, the European Union and the Black Sea. For 20 years, it has been stagnating in economic, democratic and social terms. Of course, that was also the case under the Yushchenko/Tymoshenko government. I believe that we now need to put the focus on the political and humanitarian dimension. We must ensure that democracy has a chance at the elections in October. However, Mr Füle, the electoral campaign is already under way. I would like some very precise information from the Commission and the European External Action Service about how they plan to implement the measures that you have just described, in other words, the close monitoring of the electoral campaign and the elections themselves. I would like our two guests, Hryhoriy Nemyria and Yevgenia Tymoshenko, to take away more from today’s debate than just the usual disputes between left and right. To Ms Tymoshenko, I would like to say in particular that I hope her mother receives the medical treatment she needs. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

The subject of our debate today is the case of Ms Tymoshenko, a political and humanitarian case which gives rise to the most serious concern, and Members who I otherwise have a great deal of personal respect for, such as Mr Rouček and Mr Vigenin, are giving speeches which do not in any way do justice to the severity of the case about the various minor reforms that are taking place at the moment. The situation would be exactly the reverse if the government in Ukraine were different. That is what I mean. We must be open and clear about this. Regardless of who is in power in Ukraine, the country is too important for us to discuss it here from a party political perspective. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr Schulz, I hope you have noted the fact that I did not express a naïve hope, but that I called on the Commission to make it entirely clear how it intends to monitor the election process.

 Mr President, there are three important issues for the summit tomorrow. The first is to continue consolidating the national budgets. That is not an end in itself, Mr Bullmann. If investment levels are currently low or even at zero, as you say, then there is a reason for this. We are paying interest on the debts that we have accumulated in the past instead of building schools. We are paying interest instead of building roads. We are paying interest instead of investing in innovation and research. We need to continue consolidating the national budgets so that we can begin investing in these areas again. The second important topic is structural reforms. Productivity, efficiency, competitiveness, entrepreneurship and an appropriate level of taxation for businesses will all help to ensure that the Member States and their markets are competitive. It concerns me that the labour market reforms in Italy have come to a stop. We need to abolish Article 18. I do not understand how anyone can be opposed to that. The third point is growth. How do we intend to finance it? The UK is not prepared to go along with the financial transaction tax. This amounts to false accounting. The European Investment Bank is a much better solution. In addition, the Commission must finally submit proposals as to how we can mobilise the available money in the Structural Funds for use in Greece and the other countries, because we have already been talking about this for two years. We gradually need to introduce some concrete measures. We have been talking about this for two years without anything being done. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

I simply wanted to ask Mr Lamberts whether he might consider assuming that the Members of the House, whatever their nationality and whatever their political affiliation, pursue honest motives in their political activities, and whether he might refrain in future from slanderous and belittling remarks.

 Mr President, what do Düsseldorf and Dortmund, Herten and Essen, Arnsberg and Würselen have in common? They are all places where the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) Members of the European Parliament for North Rhine-Westphalia live. The people of North Rhine-Westphalia hear from Ms Kraft that the SPD’s aim is to protect and promote both industry and the region as an industrial heartland. At the same time, these Members from Dortmund, Düsseldorf, Essen and other places are now about to vote for a massive increase in the price of diesel, this despite the fact that Germany and Europe lead the world in this energy-efficient and environmentally friendly drive technology. The consequences of this price increase are clear: rising prices, a decline in internal demand, a threat to technological superiority and to the survival of the industrial base. If this really is the Social Democrats’ industrial policy, then we can say good night to North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany and Europe. The truth is that this makes no economic or environmental sense. If we consider rising fuel costs, which have already reached record levels, then we must recognise that we are inhibiting internal demand, despite the fact that the Social Democrats are always looking to stimulate growth in this area. This makes no sense from an environmental perspective either. We all know that diesel-powered vehicles travel further on less fuel than petrol-driven vehicles. That is why I would call on the Social Democrats to reconsider the consequences for the people, the consumers and the drivers of Germany and Europe of their vote tomorrow. It is high time that the SPD espoused an economic policy that targets success, not just on election posters, but also in specific political action. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I support the motion tabled by Mr Swoboda to remove this report from the agenda. Some points in the report are so incomplete that it needs further debate. The current wording of the report makes it clear that diesel would become considerably more expensive. This is definitely not the sort of economic policy signal that car drivers and industry want to see. Therefore, I believe it is right to discuss this report further and to focus on the uncontroversial areas when it is next referred to Parliament. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Madam President, my group tabled the original amendment. We regret that it is not possible to name the Zaman
 newspaper here, because this was the only paper to suffer attack in Cologne, Paris, London, Rotterdam and Zurich. As a group, we intend to vote in favour of Mr Obiol’s amendment nonetheless in order to show clearly that the freedom of the press is a central objective for us. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, my report appears in the voting lists as an own-initiative report. However, according to the Rules of Procedure, it is, in fact, a recommendation to the Council. That is a different matter. We would not need to vote on the report because, according to the Rules of Procedure, it is deemed adopted if there are no amendments tabled by the groups. I would ask that the documents be corrected in order to put this right. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 – (DE)
 Mr President, we all agree that we want a stability culture in Europe. That is at least what we are constantly hearing. We also need to assess what has been achieved with the fiscal compact, which represents an important step towards the stability culture. It is not a turning point and it is not the solution. It is also not a universal remedy. We can all agree on that. However, I believe that it is an important step forward, and this needs to be said for the sake of truth. We want balanced budgets with very low primary deficits, if these cannot be avoided. We want a debt brake in the euro area countries. We want automatic sanctions for offenders before things go wrong. We want old debts to be reduced and the results to be reported to Brussels before new debts are incurred. We want the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) to come into effect earlier. We must also make sure that only those countries which join the fiscal compact have access to the ESM. These are all important elements of a stability culture in Europe and, with the ‘two-pack’, we are attempting to implement this under European law, including a debt redemption pact, which is something my group is specifically calling for. We want to stimulate growth in Greece and the money to do this is available. Between EUR 16 billion and EUR 18 billion – the numbers vary – can be provided from the Structural Funds. I believe that we finally need to get started with this. Everything that Mr Reichenbach and the Troika have so far achieved in Greece is not enough to give a real boost to growth. Then, today, there was a debate in the German Parliament which surprised me, because the Social Democrats are threatening to vote against the fiscal compact unless it includes a particular tax, which would justifiably be controversial. I believe this would be a huge mistake. I also think it is important for the Social Democrats to become aware of their responsibilities in terms of stability policy and to vote in favour of the compact without playing party political games. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the central issue for us is to make progress on the road towards a stability culture. I would like to finish by congratulating you, Mr Van Rompuy, on your reappointment. Everyone agrees that you are doing an excellent job. However, I am still of the opinion that your position, as it is enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon, is a mistake. I would prefer to have a President of Europe who, if possible, was also directly elected. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff,

 Mr President, as Mr Wammen has just said, the Spring European Council meeting is traditionally the European Union’s rendezvous with social and economic reality in Europe. However, we have all heard that the finance ministers yesterday cancelled their meeting in Brussels at which they intended to approve the second aid package for Greece. What does that mean? What does it mean for Greece and for Europe? I believe that our common goal is to keep Greece in the euro area and I would like to respond to Mr Daul on this subject. I do not agree with what Ms Kroes has said about Greece remaining in the euro area, but the reason why she has said it and why so many people are so impatient, is the behaviour of her sister party, Nea Dimokratia, in particular. If they could just call Mr Samaras to order, it would be very helpful. I believe it would be better for all of us. We want Greece to stay in the euro area, but it is important to make one thing clear. In the past, the Greek Government has made a lot of promises, but has delivered very little. The introduction of another austerity package does not by any means indicate that what is being promised will actually be put into practice, and that is exactly what this is all about. It is about structural reform, which will lead to further aid being made available. If it takes the right course, Greece can count on our support. However, we no longer need preliminary work; instead, we are looking for action. It has been said here that the situation in Greece is genuinely dramatic. In addition to the savings which are needed, Mr Swoboda, from 1991 to 2007, in other words, before the crisis, Greece had an average annual national deficit of 6.6%. Greece is now having to pay the bill for its poor policies in the past. Of course, we do not envy the Greeks. That is absolutely clear. We want to get the country and the economy going again and the trade unions will be an important part of this. Trade unions have played a constructive role in increasing competitiveness in Germany over many years. Economic performance has fallen by 7% over the last three months. This is why we now need genuine structural reforms, in other words, a tax reform which is worthy of the name. Progress must be made with privatisation in important sectors such as energy generation, ports and lotteries, every area where the state is too heavily involved. The proposed cuts in the bloated civil service are also needed. Parts of the Greek political system have been based on this. People simply found positions for their supporters in a ministry, a public authority or a public company. In other words, the state sector is completely bloated. I would like to remind everyone in this context that it was the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe which called for a sort of Marshall Plan some time ago. We call it the Hercules Plan and we will be happy to work on it. However, after the last Council meeting, our group also made three very specific proposals for measures to promote growth and create jobs. These proposals are addressed to the Council: the implementation of the European patent, the deployment of unused funding from the European Union budget and a plan to reduce the risk of infection within Europe. We want a debt redemption pact for the whole of Europe. We expect the Council finally to tackle this problem.

 Mr President, I am looking around and I do not want to exclude any of the Members who are sitting behind me. It is important to make it clear that we must not attach too much importance to these remarks. It is obvious that many people really have run out of patience. We want to see something happen in Greece. We are prepared to help and to show solidarity, but the phase of promises must be replaced by a phase of taking action. I believe that this is what lies behind these remarks. They are made on a pars pro toto 
basis. This is not just one voice speaking. Many, many people are saying the same thing. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, I would be very grateful if Mr Cohn-Bendit could explain to me what he believes the Taliban are. I am not familiar with the phrases ‘liberal Taliban’ and ‘neoliberal Taliban’. Mr Daul has just outed himself here as a liberal. I do not believe that he is a member of the Taliban, not even the neoliberal Taliban. We should stop all this nonsense. What is really important, and I would like to say that Mr Cohn-Bendit is right about this, is that we should all treat each other with respect. That also applies to the different peoples of Europe, including the Greeks, the Germans and the others. Treating each other with respect within the European Union should always be more important than wonderful rhetorical flights of fancy which are actually rather disrespectful.

– The FDP Delegation has abstained in today’s vote on the motion for a resolution on the feasibility of introducing stability bonds. We believe that the introduction of Eurobonds would set the wrong incentives. Since the introduction of the euro, low interest rates have led to a substantial increase in debt levels in many eurozone countries. Eurobonds would take the pressure off highly indebted eurozone Member States to consolidate their budgets and introduce much needed structural reforms. Therefore, we believe that Eurobonds would aggravate, rather than alleviate, the current crisis. However, we did not vote against the resolution as many of our concerns have been taken on board by the rapporteur. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Mr President, Mr Swoboda, I would like to ask you to take note of the fact that the same states which are currently in particular difficulties in the midst of the debt crisis are also the states with the highest youth unemployment levels. Please also take note of the fact that labour market policy is the responsibility of the Member States and that imposing sanctions in areas where companies have to hire people definitely does not make sense but simply aggravates the situation. Please also take note of the fact that the citizens of France will elect their own president. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, I was particularly pleased about the Council’s decision to impose sanctions and an oil embargo and to increase the pressure on Iran. I consider this to be the sensible and right thing to do and I am amazed to hear many fellow Members saying that there is no proof of military intent or that it is not possible to distinguish between civil and military use. We only need to look at the facts. Iran has 5 000 kg of uranium that is enriched to 3%. That is what is needed for energy production. However, it already has 75 kg that is enriched to 20%, and the only explanation for that is that it is planning to use it for military purposes. The enrichment needs to be pushed to 90%. That is technically complex, but by no means impossible. All of the facts, including the most recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), indicate that military use is intended here. In other words, we have a predictable period here in which the whole scenario will enfold, and it is therefore right for the European Parliament to now increase the pressure. The same applies with regard to the delivery systems, commonly known as missiles. The Iranians are obviously working on medium- and long-range missiles. This brings the urgency of the situation even more clearly into focus. It would have been better if the oil embargo had been put into effect immediately – although I fully understand the need of some Member States to find means of diversification. However, that will also give Iran the opportunity to find ways round this. I am pleased that the joint parliamentary resolution received broad support. I am also pleased about the particularly constructive role of the IAEA, in particular since Yukiya Amano took over the position of Director General. That is extremely helpful, and I am also pleased to see the positive and constructive role that Turkey has been playing recently with regard to this matter. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, Prime Minister, I would like to start by thanking you. Immediately upon entering office, you reversed the snap decision of the previous regime to reintroduce border controls between Denmark and Germany and Denmark and Sweden. I believe this was a very good decision. My group favours an open Europe. This was good news for those citizens living in the border regions. It was also good news for business, particularly the transport companies on either side of the border. Thank you for what is a really positive step. In my second point I find myself agreeing with Mr Langen: please defend the Community method. You have already seen what happens when we revert to the intergovernmental patterns of the 19th century and the attitudes associated with them. At least this is what has been reported in the media in relation to what Mr Sarkozy had to say to you. If this is the new tone we can expect from the intergovernmental method, then this is another argument in favour of the Community method. There is one important point to make, however. In setting out your priorities for the Presidency of the Council you state that you want the European Union to have a strong, consistent external profile. I believe it would be good if you could use the opportunity afforded by this Council Presidency to initiate a debate on whether you really wish to maintain your opt-out from the Common Security and Defence Policy. It is strange that every country except Denmark is a member of the European Defence Agency. I would be extremely grateful if you could take advantage of this opportunity. Finally, my group, together with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, is pursuing a procedure against Hungary under Article 7(1) of the Treaty. It is then up to the Council, however, to make any recommendations. Article 7(1) only provides for recommendations. I would encourage you: place this on the agenda and organise the necessary four-fifths majority of Member States. This is the only way we will make any progress with regard to Hungary.

 Mr President, Mr Weber, I have absolutely no doubts about your commitment to the rule of law. However, today I do doubt your political judgment. There is a new national justice agency in Hungary. It is responsible for appointing judges and for allocating cases to specific courts. This national justice agency has a director. It is managed by a lady. Perhaps you would like to tell us who she is, if you know. If you do not know, ask your neighbour. She is the wife of Mr Szájer and I find this very strange in the context of discussions on the independence of the judiciary. (Applause) Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Orbán, I would like to make one thing clear straight away: Hungary is not Belarus, you are not Mr Chávez and it is possible to live a good life in Hungary. Nevertheless, we do have serious concerns. I am intending to link my criticisms to specific points, as Mr Weber has called on us to do. You said that no one had criticised the constitution. There are now 25 ‘cardinal laws’, which raise some issues to the level of the constitution because a two-thirds majority is required to change them again. One of these is the flat tax. I am a Liberal and I think a flat tax is an excellent idea. However, it is not acceptable to take a tax policy issue out of the political debate and include it in the constitution. This undermines and impairs the citizens’ democratic right to vote, to choose a different government at the next elections and to bring about comprehensive change. Tax law is a question which must stimulate central political debate and democratic disputes. This situation is unacceptable because it undermines democracy and that is why it is so serious. Incidentally, you have said, and this was the point which concerned the judicial system, that this is all about the independence of the judiciary and about facts. The Prime Minister has said that he has done everything possible to consolidate the budget. How can he then reduce the retirement age for around 300 judges from 70 to 62? That will cost the state a lot of money. Of course, new judges will have to be appointed to fill the vacancies. That is all well and good. We have our own ideas about who they will be. I think we understand that very well. A year ago we expressed our criticism of the media law. We were told that the pluralism of the media was not at risk. Now Klubrádió is being closed down. It has already been closed in Budapest and the frequencies are now being shut down in the countryside. Mr Orbán, you have said that you have written a letter to Mr Barroso in order to discuss the situation calmly and objectively. In the BILD newspaper today you explained that you are yielding to power. (The President cut off the speaker) Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, I am rather surprised. This morning on the German radio station Deutschlandfunk
, Mr Schulz was celebrating the agreement on the ‘six-pack’ as the hour in which the European Parliament demonstrated its importance and I completely agree with him about this. However, he failed to mention that the left wing of this House did, of course, vote against the ‘six-pack’ and has now also taken up a position opposing the results of the summit, balanced budgets and effective sanctions. This does not add up. I am sorry, but we have a debt union. We must have balanced budgets. We need sensible mechanisms which will allow us to achieve this. That is what was decided at the summit. In overall terms, the results are an effective way of allowing us to move from being a debt union to becoming a stability union. However, on one point I agree with him and my other fellow Members: this will become a government agreement. As a result, the risk of a democratic deficit and of a lack of acceptance by the citizens is very real. Therefore, it is very important that the parliaments, both this House and the national parliaments, are very closely involved in this process. My third point, Mr Barroso, concerns something that is important to me. Of course it is essential that what is decided in this fiscal compact is transferred into the Treaties. To do this, we just need the agreement of the United Kingdom at some point. However, it may possibly be the case that we will be forced to do things the other way round. We may need to see this fiscal compact as the founding of a new European Union, as closer integration and as the starting signal for a new project. Nevertheless, I would like to make it clear that we want the British to be involved. Mr Daul, the countries where Liberal parties are in government are those where the public finances are largely in good shape: Estonia, Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and Sweden. These are the countries where the Liberals are in government. In the countries where the Conservatives are in power without Liberals to apply corrective measures, such as Italy, Greece and Portugal, things look a little different. The Liberal position is very clear in that respect. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, I take every appropriate and inappropriate opportunity to praise Ms Wortmann-Kool. To put it simply, no one disputes the institutional point. Of course, this was one of the European Parliament’s finest hours. However, we are not only discussing institutional questions here today; we are also talking about overcoming the euro crisis and about the route towards a stability union. (Heckling from Martin Schulz)
 This is an important point. I am amazed by the tough stance taken by the entire left wing of this House in opposing the results of the summit, including Mr Steinmeier, who described the whole thing as a fiasco. With the best will in the world, I cannot understand this. It is in our common interest that the Member States in the euro area have balanced budgets and that they are monitored. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, before I come to the topic in question, I would like to mention that our former fellow Member and Vice-President, Mr Lambrinidis, is here in the Chamber. He is holding a conversation at the back and we are pleased to see him. He is not listening, because he does not understand German, but that does not matter. When I attend events in my constituency, I always ask my constituents: Which has more soldiers, the European Union or the United States? People generally give the wrong answer. The Member States of the European Union have 2 million soldiers under arms, while the United States has 1.4 million. We are armed to the teeth, but we are only spending on these soldiers one-third of what the Americans are spending. That is plainly nonsense. For this reason, pooling and sharing makes perfect sense. However, it is also clear that we cannot leave this to the armed forces alone. The process must be under political control. In this respect, this report makes a major contribution to the political debate and I would like to thank Mr Lisek. However, I would like to express my criticism of one point and that concerns offsets. The opinion expressed in this report cannot replace the legally binding provisions of the directive on defence procurement in the European Union. I have read the Commission’s guidelines on the use of offsets and it is essential that we follow them. Regardless of whether they are civilian or military, direct or indirect, they always have the effect of distorting competition and, under the terms of Article 346, are only permitted in very few exceptional circumstances. Therefore, I believe it is important for us to emphasise this once again, to stick to it and to vote accordingly.

 Mr President, as I know how excellent our interpreters are, it cannot have been due to the interpreting, so it must have been down to you Mr Van Orden. I clearly said that the Member States have 2 million soldiers and that we are only spending on these soldiers in Europe as a whole one-third of what the Americans are spending. It is obvious that this does not make sense. Even the United Kingdom is very happily pooling and sharing strategic transport aircraft, nuclear testing and aircraft carriers with the French. I believe that this debate is important and I would like to thank Mr Lisek for his positive report. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Madam President, I believe there is cause for concern with regard to this summit. The role of the US in the global economy is far from agreeable. While we here in Europe have learnt from the debt crisis to be responsible with our public finances, we see the American Central Bank continuing to open the floodgates and flood the American market with dollars. Easy money was one of the causes of the crisis in 2008. The whole affair is, unfortunately, continuing along the same path, just like the US public debt situation. The risk of inflation must not be ignored. I also think it is regrettable that the US has still not managed to carry out any permanent reform of its Medicare, Medicaid and social security systems. In this context ahead of an election year in 2012, a weaker dollar is, of course, not what the US wants. A revaluation would absolutely not fit in with President Obama’s jobs programme. The advice to Europeans to please stabilise the euro should also be seen against this background. After all, if the euro loses value against the dollar, US exports will have a harder time on the global markets. At the same time, there is a rise in protectionist efforts in the US – this is also a trend that we absolutely must counter, and therefore it is good that the Commissioner for Trade has spoken here today. I consider this to be extremely important. We Europeans and Americans still have the most significant trade and investment relations with one another. A second point that is important for my group is the fact that, with Google, eBay, Apple and Amazon, so-called information empires have arisen. With regard to the handing of the data, it is important for us, together with the US, to find a new approach for these private players too, and I believe that this is of great interest to our citizens. This matter must be addressed seriously. I forgot to mention Facebook, which should clearly also be included here. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 – (DE)
 Mr Rübig, I wish I could give you an encouraging answer. My fear is simply that if the Republicans actually manage to remove President Obama from office, we will not see any particular improvement in the US public finances in terms of revenue, whereas if things were to go on as before, the Democrats will continue their irresponsible policy in relation to expenditure. Therefore, I do not believe that the macroeconomic situation in the US will take a turn for the better. We will have to humbly wait and see who the Americans ultimately vote for next November.

Madam President, Ms Schaake is one of our most competent Members when it comes to issues relating to the Internet, freedom of information and data protection. I would like to take the opportunity to ask you whether you think it would make sense to draw up an action plan with the US that would ensure the protection of data and the privacy of users of these major providers. Could this be an objective for this or another EU-US summit? In my view, it could be. I would like to hear your opinion on this and perhaps a few elements that could be agreed on in such an action plan. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what we are now experiencing is something we have warned about for many years in soapbox speeches. We are leaving the coming generations an impossible debt burden. This is irresponsible. All the political parties have said so for many years. We can see from the example of Greece that the problem is no longer waiting for the next generation – it is now confronting this generation and we can see what this means. Tightening one’s belt is painful, however we need to move towards a stability union. There have been some good developments that are going well and where things are working. Ireland is heading in the right direction. We have introduced a budgetary control watchdog, the European Semester. We have agreed a stability pact with teeth – something also to be welcomed. Last night marked an important step along the way to stability union. We agreed that the banks need to do business on a more solid basis. They are to be forced to fulfil their responsibilities and will be recapitalised, however they must have a solid 9% of equity capital. Greece is to have the haircut. It was clear that this would have to happen. We will also have permanent monitoring of the reforms in Greece. Italy has announced pension reforms. We must be clear about the fact that we are still on the path to stability union. All of these things must be implemented in order for us to move forward. I would like to close by congratulating Mr Rehn, the new Vice-President. I am certain that he will play a key role in taking us along the path to this stability union. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I have to say that the wishes of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have never been met so quickly by the Commission. The chair of our group has only just requested the documents that describe the proposals in detail and here they are. We have asked for the documents because I would like to reassure myself that I have correctly understood one point which is particularly important to me. The Commission proposals, which, on the whole, are excellent and far-reaching, include the following statement:  Deciding a sustainable solution for Greece within the euro area, through an effective second adjustment programme.  (DE)
 We need a lasting solution for Greece within the euro area and we can achieve this by making Greece’s debts sustainable. In other words, this is the famous haircut. It is insolvency or, if you prefer, ‘re-solvency’. That was precisely our position. This is why we were accused of being populists a few weeks ago when we said that debt reduction would be needed to allow Greece to emerge from the crisis. The Commission is rightly combining this with robust implementation and supervision mechanisms. This is the right thing to do. We want solidarity, we want to keep Greece in the euro area, but we also want solidity and we want to be able to monitor it, because solidarity cannot be a one-way street. That is extremely important to us. I am pleased that the European debate is now moving in this direction. I am also pleased that our position, which all the experts have long since confirmed is the right one, is now also being confirmed in the political arena. I always get a warm feeling when I hear the Tory Members of this House, like Mr Kirkhope, calling for strong European solutions to recapitalise the banks. Issues like national sovereignty and the United Kingdom and its special position always come to mind in these circumstances. However, I am pleased that there are occasions when even London believes that Europe is useful. I would just like to see this happening more often. I have one final point to make, which is that the news agencies are already reporting that the opposition and the governing parties in Slovakia have agreed to support the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the increase in its scope. This also pleases me. The spectacle of the last few days clearly shows that the requirement for unanimity is a means of setting up blockades. We need majority decisions, including when it comes to stabilising the euro. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
).  
– (DE)
 Mr President, the interpreter, at least, did not word it as a question, but nevertheless, I am happy to provide an answer. No, the solidarity between the Member States of the European Union and of the euro area makes various demands on us and on our voters. However, we are prepared to meet those demands because we want a stability union for Europe and, within this stability union, solidarity is a two-way street. This means that we are prepared to take on these guarantees. As far as the question of the banks is concerned, I am unhappy about the developments in the banking sector, just as everyone who takes a close look at it is. It is true that some of the things which were being done before the crisis are still going on now. However, one thing is absolutely clear. Without a functioning banking sector, we cannot develop a strategy for growth in Europe. As a result, the actions that we have just taken – paying the next tranche to Greece and organising a haircut which does not completely cripple the banking sector – are necessary to allow us to emerge from the crisis by means of economic growth. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Ms Harms, are you aware that the Prime Minister of the Netherlands has proposed a Commissioner – Mr Rehn, to be specific about it – as a sort of European finance minister? We believe that this is a good idea. My second question to you is as follows. You have spoken here about imbalances and about the investments that need to be made. How do you explain the fact that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will be voting here today against a better, tougher, stronger Stability and Growth Pact, which will stabilise the eurozone, while we in Berlin are being given wonderful advice by the Socialists and the Greens? (Applause) Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, you have made a very good speech, Mr Barroso. What is important now is putting it into practice, in other words, the follow-up, as Mr Verhofstadt has said, and ensuring that something really happens here. I believe that we agree almost unanimously that we need more Europe in order to be able to overcome this crisis. However, we need the right Europe and for us that means that we want a stability union rather than a debt union. We need to include a ‘debt brake’ in the national constitutions. We still need, and here my opinion differs from that of the Chair of my group, different interest rates, because they act as an economic ‘debt brake’. We also need an organised process for national bankruptcy. We need rules which determine what happens when a country becomes unable to pay its debts, so that we can keep it in the eurozone. That is the crucial point. We need a stability pact with teeth and with automatic sanctions. I would like to say one thing. The plan by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to vote against this tougher stability pact here today is a continuation of Gerhard Schröder’s policy of 2003, which aimed to destroy the stability culture of Europe. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, some excellent work has been done in a difficult field. I am a little surprised by Mr Cohn-Bendit, who spent five minutes berating you, describing your role as that of a blackmailer and calling on you to resolve the problems immediately, before leaving the Chamber. He could at least have waited to hear what you had to say in reply. The fact is that some excellent work has been done in this field. There is one thing that we must not forget: what were our fears? We were afraid that the European Union would once again create an impression that our Member States would not pull together, just as we failed to act cohesively in the war in Iraq or as we are doing now in Libya. Germany and France had already made their positions clear in individual statements. On the contrary, the European Union is pulling together. You have earned the trust of both sides in the region, the Israelis and the Palestinians. This is a diplomatic feat in itself and it is true to say that we can only play a constructive role through trust. It is also true that we, the European Union, can only play a constructive role if our Member States are united. Both of these points are on a good footing thanks to your work. Overall, you have done a good job. There are three more important things I would like to mention: we want a united European Union – you are making good progress in this direction. As Parliament stated in its resolution, we want a negotiated solution in the United Nations. We do not want a vote with winners and losers. We regard this as vitally important. Thirdly, we must have a timetable. We say that the Palestinians should get their upgrade during the 66th General Assembly, in other words, they must be recognised. We should allow the Palestinians this moment of joy, Mr Swoboda. However, I should say, whenever reference is made to 1947, that immediately afterwards, in 1948, Israel found itself under attack from all its Arab neighbours. If we achieve recognition for Palestine as a peaceful state and secure borders for the state of Israel, then this will be a reason to celebrate for the Palestinians, for the Israelis and for us here in Europe who played a constructive role, thanks to your efforts. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
).  
– Madam President, just a short question to Mr Davies. Would he concede that, on the Palestinian side, it is fair to speak of two faces as well? Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE) 
Mr President, Mr Tusk, Mr Barroso, you have been quoted, Mr Tusk, as saying that the Polish Presidency will primarily be characterised by the way it reacts to crises. It seems to me that your speech today showed that you have more than just crisis management on your agenda. You want to give Europe a direction. I believe this is a good thing, and my fellow Members on all sides of the House have emphasised this. You delivered a great speech. I would like to thank you warmly for that. You mentioned the debt crisis in Europe, calling for European solidarity. We, in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe give our emphatic backing to such solidarity. However, I would remind you of the other side of the coin. For us, this clearly means solidity. It was a lack of solidity and dubious lending policies over many years that led to this crisis. That is why our key demand is for a stability pact that genuinely has teeth. It is ironic that in 2003, the German Chancellor and the French President watered down the Stability and Growth Pact and that the present German Chancellor and French President decided while strolling on the beach in Deauville that the pact for the future should once again be toothless. Mr Tusk, do not let this discourage you! Set to work – as Mr Verhofstadt has pointed out, the direction is clear. A second area where I would encourage you to press on boldly is one of the focal points of your Presidency: progressing the common security and defence policy. You will hear some sceptical, reluctant reactions from the capitals of Europe. Do not let this discourage you. The Americans are withdrawing. We have Libya, we have Syria, Eastern Moldova and Georgia – we Europeans have a lot on our collective plate. Strengthen the European External Action Service, promote democracy and human rights, continue to develop security policy instruments and the European Defence Agency. Push for progress in the interest of Europe! There is much to be done. I wish you the best of luck. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, you have mentioned that you will be holding Quartet negotiations on 11 September and I am very pleased about that. I am equally pleased, although perhaps also a little surprised, because you are setting your sights very high. You have already clearly stated that you expect this meeting to result in a statement that will bring the Palestinians and the Israelis back to the negotiating table. You have publicly set yourself a very challenging objective and I very much hope that you achieve it. Why am I hoping for this? On the one hand, for the sake of the people in the region and, on the other, because I am concerned once more about the common foreign and security policy. Mr Sarkozy has announced that he will behave in a certain way and the German Government has said that it will do something quite different. If we then find ourselves in a situation where the Palestinians present their concerns to the General Assembly, I am again worried about the unity of the Member States on a central foreign policy question and it is you who will bear the brunt of the criticism. Therefore, I wish you every success in these Quartet negotiations. My second point is that you have said that democracy is important and that the people in the region want democracy. That is certainly true. However, I believe that we should not lose sight of the fact that what the people really want is dignity and we should focus all our attention on this issue. They want to be able to live in dignity under the rule of law, with no arbitrary confiscation of property. They want habeas corpus and they want to be free from constant threats by the secret police. They want jobs and the prospect of a positive future, so that a free trade agreement with us really will bring results. Of course, they also want democracy and the option of shaping their own political system. However, that is one part of a bigger picture. Finally, they also want peace and an end to this terrible violence. I would like to emphasise once again that we should take the measures proposed by Mr Verhofstadt here in relation to Syria. It would be very good if we could work closely together with Turkey and make genuine progress. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

Madam President, I, too, wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs De Keyser, for her excellent report. This report has a normative section and an operative section. In the normative section, we try to establish a European consensus on what, from our point of view, constitutes democracy, what it absolutely must encompass. The Council has been unable to come to such agreement for years, because the Member States have very different traditions. Nonetheless, I believe that we can all agree that what we have included in recitals C to O are clearly elements of democracy which must be taken into account when promoting democracy. The operative section deals with the instruments. What instruments are available to us? The EIDHR has been mentioned. We find that it is often too slow, too bureaucratic, too complicated and has scope for improvement. The Instrument for Stability could also be faster. The report states that we always react in an immediate and integrated manner to situations; however, it took weeks before election workers could be sent to Tunisia to provide technical assistance under the Instrument for Stability. There is still a lot of work to do here. That is why the European Endowment for Democracy is being discussed, because we want a faster, more flexible instrument. I believe – and this is important and applies to all the groups – that there are some who are more enthusiastic, while others are somewhat more reticent. We need clarification from the European External Action Service, from the Commission and from the Polish Presidency of the Council, which considers this an important project. Where are the boundaries between the instruments that we have and what a European Endowment for Democracy is supposed to do? Who does what with which instruments and when? Mr Howitt addressed the question of election observations in this context. I believe that this is very important. Please look at paragraphs 60 to 63: they contain this House’s view on election monitoring. We want stringent criteria for selecting countries; we are of the opinion that they are not always stringent enough. We want comprehensive political concepts. We want recommendations to be followed-up. I think these are some of the points that need to be highlighted. What happens next? This report contains numerous calls for action, by the EEAS and by Parliament. How can we make sanctions more effective? How can we make the instruments more effective? What are we doing for women and democracy, for gender equality? What are we doing in the EEAS delegations across the world? There are numerous calls for action to be drawn from this report. Let us get to work. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff,

Mr President, Prime Minister, President of the Commission, my group is of the view that the Hungarian Presidency has achieved some truly important successes. This was a difficult presidency, with the financial crisis, Fukushima and the developments in North Africa. We have your government to thank, Mr Orbán – particularly your foreign minister, Mr Martonyi, who is sitting alongside you, and also your Minister of State for EU Affairs, Mrs Győri – for the fact that really outstanding work has been done here. This is particularly true as regards economic policy. What has been achieved in terms of stabilising the euro has undoubtedly been a great success, although it remains an important task. The adoption of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and also the Treaty establishing the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) – these are great and important achievements. The implementation of the first European Semester, the coordination of Member States’ budgetary policy – this is progress par excellence
 when it comes to preventing the indebtedness that has been commonplace in the past. There is one outstanding matter, which you yourself have mentioned: the so-called ‘six pack’ – the economic governance package. Our group will insist on this and we will continue to insist that we strengthen the Stability and Growth Pact, and consequently we will also stand firm on the issue of the reversed qualified majority. I believe it was right to postpone the decision for the time being and to continue the negotiations. Joseph Daul has said here that we need a convincing economic policy package if we are to have a stable euro. We feel that the Stability and Growth Pact is key to this. It needs teeth, and that is why the negotiations should continue. There are a few other policy areas in which you were very successful during your Presidency. Croatia has been mentioned, and the conclusion of the accession negotiations. I can only endorse what Mr Swoboda has already said: this is a most significant step forward for the whole region. After three years, the directive on consumer rights has at last been finalised. Progress has been made on the energy efficiency plan. One further very important matter from our point of view, and also in the view of Europe’s small and medium-sized enterprises, is the European patent, which President Barroso has just mentioned. A whole raft of really noteworthy successes achieved under your Presidency. Prime Minister, when we met in Budapest we said to you that we would assess your Presidency fairly, but that naturally we would also look at what is going on in your country. From the point of view of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, we regret that your Presidency has been overshadowed by the controversy surrounding the media law. We would have liked to have seen a different media law. Although the Commission brought about some amendments, to our way of thinking these were not in the key areas. We would also like to have seen the Constitution being drawn up by the process proposed by the Venice Commission. I believe that this watchfulness of each Member State – including my own, by the way – by the rest of Europe must continue if the European Union is to make progress. Freedom dies little by little – whether it is freedom of the press or freedom to travel. In a quarter of an hour customs officers will take up their places on the German-Danish and Danish-Swedish borders in order to reintroduce border controls. That is a development against which we might have wished the Presidency to have spoken out more strongly. This whole area – freedom to travel, asylum policy, revision of the Dublin II Regulation, the attack on the freedom to travel within the Schengen area – is where we would have liked to have seen greater commitment from your Presidency. Overall your Presidency has been a successful one, but we would have preferred it not to have been overshadowed by the criticisms that I have mentioned. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Madam President, Mr Weber’s motion makes good sense. We have completed a truly enormous programme with some major, significant reports. We now no longer have any legislative reports to vote on. It is already after half past one. It would be best to postpone the non-legislative reports to the July part-session. This would be no great loss. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, following the confidence vote yesterday in Athens with the result that we are all aware of, the Bild
 newspaper in Germany printed the headline ‘Greek leader has survived – Europe can breathe a sigh of relief’. I have to say that I was also pleased with the result of this vote, but I think it is far too early to breathe a sigh of relief. This is because we now need to put the substantial austerity package successfully in place in the next week. That is the next big test. Even then, we will be a long way from being able to breathe a sigh of relief. Further steps and measures will still need to be taken before this crisis is overcome. I believe that what has been said here is right. The people in Greece need a light at the end of the tunnel. However, I would also like to make it quite clear that the people in the countries from which most of the aid is coming also need a light at the end of the tunnel. They have the feeling that they are giving and giving and giving and there is no end to it. In Greece the people have the feeling that they are saving and saving and saving and there is no end to it. That is why a growth strategy is so important. That is why privatisations are crucial to break open and liberalise this encrusted economy. That is why it is right for us resolutely to promote and support the reduction of public debt in Greece. Democracy has to endorse this. What is happening with respect to Mr Samaras is totally irresponsible. However, it is right for us to give guarantees for investments, for example. It is also right for us to draw out unused EU funds, Mr Barroso, and make them available to Greece, because ultimately it will not only be Greece but the whole of Europe that will benefit from more growth. If we look ahead slightly, one thing is also important: the Stability and Growth Pact must be strengthened. We must prevent future crises. This is where this reverse qualified majority comes in. No ordinary citizen will understand what that actually means. To put it plainly, either the Stability and Growth Pact has this strange technical element that I have just mentioned, and then the Stability and Growth Pact will have teeth, or else it does not. Then we will not be able to support this package. Reverse qualified majority voting in the preventive phase of the Stability and Growth Pact is absolutely essential as far as we are concerned. Mr Barroso, I am extremely pleased to hear you explain once again that the Commission is of exactly the same opinion. I would like to see substantial support for this project from this House.

Madam President, it is hardly conceivable that our relations with Russia are based on an agreement dating from 1994. We have not succeeded in resolving anything new since then. We alternate between cooperation and confrontation with Russia. Where the neighbourhood is concerned, we deplore the war with Georgia, the pressure brought to bear on Ukraine, the recognition of President Lukashenko in Belarus and the split in the Republic of Moldova as a result of the conflict in Transnistria. At the same time, our cooperation with Russia in the Security Council on the issue of Libya or on Iran’s nuclear programme is pleasing. As regards Russia itself, the new paradigm is what is known as the Partnership for Modernisation. Yet what is modernity without democracy? In the list of priorities that you have just given, Commissioner Füle, human rights came after cucumbers and the rule of law after tomatoes. Is that the best we can expect in this area? Do we expect nothing more of Russia’s democratisation? I believe that as Parliament, we must make it clear that we do expect something; for example, fair elections – there must be progress there. There is, though, one thing that I would like to say quite clearly: such progress is often to be achieved at expert level. Two summits a year is too much. Let us have one summit, as we do with America. We have enough exchange with Russia in the specialist areas. Otherwise, we will have summits with no real content, and that would not be good either. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Madam President, Baroness Ashton, we are still a long way from a common foreign policy which is really worthy of the name. You are being criticised for this, but it sometimes seems to me that you have been made the scapegoat in a situation which is outside your control and which is caused by the fact that the Member States do not have the political will to agree on a common approach. Let us take the example of Libya. First of all, Italy blocked the imposition of sanctions, then France recognised the transitional council in Benghazi without any consultation and, finally, Germany abstained during the vote on the resolution in the UN Security Council. There is nothing you can do to change this, but it gives Europe a negative image. In Syria, we should have imposed stronger sanctions, but here, we also needed unanimity. There are some Member States – Greece, Italy and Spain have been mentioned in the press and Germany may also be one of them – which are opposed to this. In this case, you must stand up here and say: ‘We have only been able to put 13 on the list’. The need for unanimity is paralysing us. It no longer works with 27 Member States. We must make the next quantum leap forward in our common foreign and security policy. I would like to make this quite clear to Mr Tannock and his Tory friends. What can you do? Make public the fact that European cooperation has failed and identify who is responsible. Make use of the community instruments, in particular, to promote democracy. I was surprised to hear you speaking here so openly about the European Endowment for Democracy. We are in the process of drawing up a report on the subject with Mrs De Keyser as the rapporteur and we are evaluating what the requirements are. I must make it quite clear that we do not want a second European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR), which is bureaucratic, slow, over-complex and unpolitical. We need a solution that is unbureaucratic, fast, simple and political. If you can bring this about, you will have our full support. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Madam President, Mr Le Hyaric, I see things in exactly the same way as you do. The unity between Hamas and Fatah really is an historical step forward. It may now perhaps be possible to make progress in the process of reconciliation between the Palestinians and the Israelis. Baroness Ashton has made it very clear that the second flotilla will be a completely unnecessary provocation which could harm this process. Would you and your group now distance yourself from your support for this flotilla in the same way as happened yesterday here in Parliament with the substantial involvement of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left? Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, spring has arrived in the Mediterranean, but in the Gulf and in Syria, winter still reigns. The images of violence which we are seeing are horrifying. Several hundred people have been killed and Amnesty International and the United Nations have produced alarming reports. The calls which the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are making are clear. We want a special session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva to be held as quickly as possible. The Council of Europe and the Member States of the European Union which are represented on the UN Human Rights Council should take up this call. The UN Council is always very quick to act when it comes to taking one side in the Middle East conflict. It is now time for it to face the real challenge presented by these extreme violations of human rights. We need reform, we need a move to democracy, and we need an arms embargo. All of these things have already been mentioned here. I watched the speech made by President Assad of Syria live. This is a medieval-style dictatorship which uses western PR agencies to present its representatives as pseudo-modernising influences in glossy magazines. The agencies and the magazines should be asking themselves whether this is really the right thing to do. Now to Yemen. This is where there is, in my opinion, the greatest danger: the risk of a split between north and south, an active al-Qaeda cell and the danger of a failed state. We already have a failed state of this kind in the case of Somalia and our Atalanta mission is in operation in the Gulf of Aden. Europe has a direct interest in the area and we need to hear more than what the representative of the Council has said here today. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Madam President, it has been said here that it is not the euro that is in crisis, but the Member States that have got into debt. That is the nub of the crisis – irresponsible indebtedness that has been carried on for many years. That is what we must now stop. That is why it is right that the European Stability Mechanism must be strict. That is also why it is right that this has been the case in the bail-outs that have taken place. That is also why it is right that Ireland is not given an interest rate reduction. This indebtedness must end. Once again I am hearing the social democrats talk of a distinction between good and bad debt. Of course investment is different to consumption, but at some point too much good debt becomes bad debt too. We need to be fair to future generations, we need sustainable public finances – and then the euro will become stable again. The pact for the euro involves too little Community method. That has been said here, and quite rightly so. I share this view. I would like to say a final word about Libya. The Council has supported resolution 1973. We must now look to the future. I agree with Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra when he says that France has played a very good role. However, had Turkey been invited to the Elysée summit then we would not be having these problems in NATO and the situation would be considerably easier for us all. Moreover, I hope that the newly appointed head of the transitional government in Libya will soon be visiting us here in Europe. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff,

 Mr President, we have been addressed specifically here. Of course, we have confidence in Commissioner Kroes’s work. Her examination of the secondary law was exemplary. We wish the Commissioner examining the primary law had done her work in the same way, as this is where the problem lies. (Applause from the left)
 The reality of the situation includes those things just mentioned by Mr Swoboda, namely that, in the opinion of both the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the amendments are inadequate. Hungary’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Public Administration and Justice, Mr Navracsics, has himself admitted that this was not a significant amendment of the media law. I could mention the protection of journalistic sources, which still remains unregulated, or the composition and powers of the media authority. All of these are matters that still need to be discussed. I would therefore like to state, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, that we will not withdraw the motion for a resolution, but rather request that the vote take place. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, this debate here in the European Parliament makes one thing clear, and that is that we are not neutral when it comes to this conflict. We are on the side of the democratic revolution. Gaddafi must go and Europe must play an active role in bringing that about. There is a sharing of the workload here at the international level. We are discussing a no-fly zone, something for which – as Mr Schulz correctly identified – the backing of the UN Security Council is required. What do we do if Moscow and Beijing do not grant their assent? Well, then we would have to close this loophole in international law. We would have to take on the responsibility of protecting the unarmed population regardless, with the aid of the Arab League and the African Union, but also with the aid of an active role on the part of the European Union. Military implementation would then be the responsibility of NATO and its partners, but politically and economically, the European Union would continue to also have the key role to play, long after, in such a scenario, NATO and the United Nations had finished playing their major roles. There is one thing that I would like to say quite clearly, and that is that I was very pleased, Mr Schulz, to hear you say that we need a free trade zone. This is because, if we do not allow these people’s products into the EU, they will continue to come across the Mediterranean in coracles and in their masses to overwhelm Lampedusa. We certainly do not want that. Let us, therefore, create the free trade zone, let us allow the products into the EU, so that the people there also have an economic future in their democratised countries. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, the contrast is striking! The revolution, the change taking place in the Arab world is fascinating for all of us. We are trying to help. We have discussed Libya today. In recent days and weeks, we have discussed Egypt and Tunisia. Yet, at the same time, we have a standstill in the peace process. Against this backdrop, we must say quite clearly here, Baroness Ashton, that you did us a service when you managed to convene a meeting of the Quartet. To produce movement now, at this period of profound insecurity in the region, and profound insecurity in Israel, was an extremely positive service. I should like to make this very clear. You occasionally have to endure criticism from this House, too. For this reason, some praise is perhaps also in order. As far as the contents are concerned, I should like to make it clear that I do not believe that Israel is sceptically disposed towards democracy in Arab countries. It is merely that these changes have not yet come to an end. When and if there are democracies there, I agree completely with Mr Pöttering and with you too, Mr Swoboda, then there will clearly be a great opportunity finally to get the Middle East peace process going too. Settlement building must stop, that is clear in any case, as must the sophistry with which it is defended. There is a consensus among all groups in this House on that point. Connected to the uprising in the Arab world, we also have experienced protests against the Hamas regime in the Gaza Strip. The situation in the Palestinian Territories is in no way simple. Democratisation must succeed here too. For the time being, we fortunately have a moderate and conservative partner in the West Bank, but that is absolutely not the case in the Gaza Strip. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

Madam President, Mr Füle has just made it completely clear that Turkey and the European Union need one another. We are important neighbours, we are allies in NATO, and many people of Turkish origin live in Member States of the European Union. We must show respect for one another. I very much support visa facilitation for businesspeople and students, just as you have said. I am also in favour of integrating Turkey much more closely into the structures of the common security and defence policy. I would like to see Cyprus bringing an end to its blockade in this area. When we look at North Africa, it is clear that Turkey is a role model for many countries in the region. All of this is very good. Then we come to the accession process and we find that many chapters are blocked. It is extremely difficult to open new chapters. There are only three chapters left and the competition chapter is almost at the stage of opening. What will happen when the last chapters are opened? Will Turkey and the European Union no longer have anything to say to one another? That surely cannot be the case! Therefore, we must consider very carefully how to progress with the accession process and whether or not we can retain the current procedure, which involves Parliament commenting on the Commission’s progress report by means of a resolution. Our 2010 report is highly critical, but also constructive. It deals with fundamental rights which are self-evident, particularly for Liberals: freedom of the press, freedom of speech, expression and assembly, student demonstrations, trade union rights and freedom of religion. For years, we have been calling for improvements in freedom of religion, but far too little progress has been made. The arrest of Ahmet Şık and Nedim Şener and the interference in the work of political foundations in Turkey are giving us great cause for concern. This is covered by the first Copenhagen criterion. It is a central issue, because it is the political criterion. If Turkey cannot move forward with its internal democratic constitution, I believe that we will still have serious problems in some areas, quite apart from the deadlock in the Council. In diplomatic terms, we need Turkey and Turkey also needs us. In democratic terms, there is still a great deal to be done in Turkey. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, the Treaty of Lisbon makes new demands of European Union foreign policy and development policy. One has been mentioned here: coherence. In other words, our various instruments, the European External Action Service, the European Investment Bank and the Commission must act in a consistent manner. The Treaty of Lisbon also provides for greater parliamentary control, greater transparency and joint decisions on these matters. All of this will enhance the quality of the debate on foreign policy, particularly if we have greater transparency as a result of the participation of the relevant committees – primarily the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Development – in this House. One result of this transparency is that this Parliament has resolved to remove Belarus from the list of countries in which the European Investment Act can act without first having another debate here in this House. Are human rights being respected? Have opposition politicians been released? Does the state respect the property of its citizens? Is there freedom of the press? Are entrepreneurs able to act freely? Are there free trade unions? In our relationship with such an important neighbour – one which is located directly on the border of the European Union – these are all matters which need to be debated first, before the European Investment Bank becomes active there. I am very pleased that the House has taken up this suggestion and I call on the Council to do the same. Yesterday we had a debate on Egypt. We debated the instruments and what we could do. Baroness Ashton called for the ceiling applied to the European Investment Bank to be raised. Parliament is happy to pursue this. We need to improve how we work together with Egypt and Tunisia, with North Africa. That is only right. It is also a good example of how this Parliament can react quickly. The same is now required of the Council, which must act accordingly. I believe that our foreign policy instruments, especially if they are market-oriented, together with the loans from the European Investment Bank can do a lot to assist with development and economic growth in North Africa. That is precisely what is needed. If there is growth there, if there is democracy there, then we will also have fewer migrants arriving at our borders. If I may specifically address our fellow Members from the extreme right, I would like to say that your arguments are really far too rudimentary and simplistic – if not primitive. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the course of a revolution is seldom predictable. That was the case with the American and the French revolutions, as well as the major revolution in Europe in 1989/91. It is important for us to be clear about one thing: this is and remains the Egyptian revolution. It is not a European revolution that we would be able to steer. Instead, what Baroness Ashton is doing there is right, namely to listen and not to try to dictate events there as Europe would wish. However, one thing is key: there should not only be an election in Egypt in August, the Egyptians must have a genuine election. It is good that the Muslim Brotherhood has involved itself in the process to amend the constitution, has founded a party and will take part in elections. However, the secular powers must be equally involved so that the Egyptians will have a genuine election in this revolution for freedom. I would like to say a few words about adaptation of the instruments. That is jargon and hardly anyone understands what it means. What does it mean? Firstly, it means providing more money to enable the European Investment Bank to do something. But what else does it mean? We need a European foundation for democracy to enable us, in future, to work more efficiently, more quickly and more democratically with these civil societies. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
).

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, I would ask you to be more courageous. Go to Cairo before the Council of Foreign Ministers. Speak with the government representatives and with the opposition there. Come back to Brussels and tell your colleagues what you have seen and heard. Set the agenda and do not listen to 27 different opinions, with which it is then very difficult to actually do anything. When Mr Mingarelli goes to Tunisia – something that I view very positively – inform us so that we are aware and so that the public is aware that Europe has a presence there. I first found out that the American was there and only then did I hear that Mr Mingarelli was also there. You are the foreign minister for Europe and I would earnestly advise you, on the one hand, to be our foreign minister. On the other hand, as foreign minister for Europe, you must not jump through every hoop that people put in front of you. Comparisons have been made here today with 1989, and I think that is right. I believe that Tahrir Square in Cairo in 2011 is equivalent to Alexanderplatz in Berlin in 1989. A revolution is taking place there. However, if we recall the revolution of 1989 for a moment we will remember that we had the same dilemma then. We wanted freedom, stability and democracy, and we overlook the fact that this process, the transition from a stable dictatorship to a democracy, is rarely peaceful, orderly and stable. From this point of view, diplomacy, organisation and caution also have their place. That should not distract us from the fact that we are extremely pleased about this revolution. It is a revolution against the dictatorship and for freedom. I do believe that Europe can dictate the setup in these countries. However, our joy needs to be apparent, but one thing is also clear, and that is that, even with limited influence, it will certainly not be possible to build a state with Mr Mubarek. With the violence today in Tahrir Square, the last vestige of legitimacy for this ruler in Egypt has been lost. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Madam President, Mr Orbán, in an article which appeared yesterday in a major German newspaper, you cited Otto Graf Lambsdorff as one of your role models. We last met at his funeral service in December 2009. You attended as a private individual and we very much appreciated that. I would like to ask you to honour his memory by respecting, following and defending the principles of the liberal constitutional state in all the measures that you take. You have responded to the criticism of the media law with two arguments. You have said that this is a campaign against Hungary and against you personally and that the campaign is unspecific. I would like to make it very clear on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe that this is not a campaign. It is an issue for Europe if fundamental freedoms are interfered with and called into question in a Member State of the European Union. I would like to say to the Commission and to Mr Barroso that a legal assessment must be carried out by Mrs Kroes. However, the Commission is not just a solicitor’s office; it is also a political body. The assessment must take a political form and it must be completed quickly. Your second argument is that the criticism is unspecific. Mr Orbán, I would like to make a few specific points: slander, defamation and incitement to hatred are against the law in Germany and in other democracies. That is what the criminal law is there for. Please let the criminal law take effect in this case. You need to improve the legal protection in Article 163, change the composition and the powers of the media authority in Articles 123 and 183, together with a great deal of other things. There are many specific points. I suggest that you postpone the application of the law until the Commission’s assessment has been carried out and this must be done as quickly as possible. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, there is one thing that it is important for citizens, too, to understand: the European Union is not in debt. We are talking here about a debt crisis in our Member States. The European Union is the only political level in Europe that is debt free. I would also like it to remain that way. However, we are joined together in a shared destiny by the euro. In this regard, Mrs Harms and Mr Schulz rightly lamented the lack of European spirit. Deauville was a mistake. Germany and France have been blackmailed by the United Kingdom. The Commission must impose the sanctions, not the finance ministers. Mr Van Rompuy, the automatic nature of the sanctions during the preventive phase was sacrificed in Deauville. The finance ministers must take the decision again here. These are the ones who were previously responsible for triggering the financial crisis and the debt crisis in the Member States. What is economic governance? Everyone is talking about economic governance, but what does it actually mean in specific terms? Do we really want the European Union to interfere in the details of our labour market and social policy? There is a big question mark here. Setting the legal framework for entrepreneurship, stimulating growth, they are all well and good, but above all putting public finances in order once again in the Member States – that is the challenge. That is why the European Semester is so important, and that is why it must be implemented. (

 Mr President, of course I am happy to answer that. Mr Schulz is, of course, also a member of the Bureau of the Social Democratic Party of Germany and will also occasionally make statements here which are probably not entirely congruent. There is, however, one thing I would like to say, and it is that, if Mr Schulz can show me who from the FDP was present in Deauville, I would be grateful to him. We made a relatively clear statement on this at the end of the summit. I believe that the key point, namely actually relinquishing the automatic nature of the sanctions in the preventive phase, was criticised by us in no uncertain terms. If we get the change to the treaty, this will be rectified retrospectively. However, the decision made in Deauville was clearly a mistake. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, the European External Action Service is one of the most important decisions in the Treaty of Lisbon. It is now only six weeks until Baroness Ashton will no longer primarily be the Minister responsible for establishing an EU foreign ministry; she will instead be the Foreign Minister for Europe, and that is a good thing. This will commence on 1 December and we wish you every success in this regard. We have had many debates and we have achieved a great deal. It was a fruitful political battle. The lack of democracy associated with the old common foreign and security policy has been eliminated, there is a greater degree of accountability and the quality of the public debate has improved. There will be more stringent budgetary control, the prerequisites for a genuine team spirit have been created and national diplomats can, if they so wish, remain in the European External Action Service. There will be no geographical quotas – you could sometimes get the impression that this is the most important issue here, but it most definitely is not. Germany, in particular, would benefit greatly from a quota, but I am nevertheless against this. A common form of training will be provided. I believe that the prerequisites for a successful EEAS are in place. In other words, the European Parliament is almost happy. We would be really happy if you were now to take advantage of the opportunity and actually establish the appropriate structure for conflict prevention and crisis management that has been promised. Then we would have European added value right from the start. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, this, of course, was a European Council meeting that focused, among other things, on foreign policy. At almost the same time, in the United Nations General Assembly, China and numerous developing countries voted against granting special status to you, Mr Van Rompuy, and also to Baroness Ashton. This ought to be addressed with China at the summit on 6 October and it needs to be discussed in no uncertain terms. However, it demonstrates quite clearly the reality of the situation: the European Union still has a long way to go to achieve political power. We are currently an economic power and, for that reason, citizens expect us to do something in this area to combat the economic crisis. That brings me to the task force. Mr Van Rompuy, you said there was broad consensus. At the end of the month, this consensus will be put to the test. On 29 September, the Commission will present its documents. You have already said that you will present a draft on 27 September. I hope that these will be in line with each other to some extent. Incidentally, I would recommend that you speak Dutch more often; I very much enjoyed your statement on the Community method. As regards macro-economic surveillance, there is apparently consensus in the task force – great! Monitoring of national fiscal policies within the European Semester – that is a good thing and something that we expressly welcome. As regards the sanctions, you say that more work is needed. We all know what that means: there is no consensus. The test will therefore come at the end of the month. Why, as Parliament, do we insist so strongly on the Community method? Mr Schulz has just mentioned this. We are still in the process of weighing up the Lisbon machinery. However, the crucial point is this: the European Council is now a European Union body. What that means in terms of its understanding of itself, we do not yet know exactly. If often appears to us to be a gathering of Member States representing only their national interests. One national interest is very clear: that of the United Kingdom, which is to have as little regulation as possible in the financial sector. The Community method represents our only chance of getting the interests of Europe as a whole to prevail over individual national interests. That is why this House insists on the application of the Community method. In light of your Dutch statements, I am pleased that you view this in the same way. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mr Hughes, we have worked together before and I have high regard for your work. However, in your analysis of the economic crisis and of the measures that are now to be taken, you are seriously wide of the mark, just like the majority of your group. Would you not agree that it was excessive debt – in other words, too much expenditure in pursuing so-called policy objectives – that triggered the current crisis? Would you not also agree that, for that reason, precisely the right thing to do now is to focus on stability and a sound fiscal policy in order to overcome this crisis? Holger Krahmer  (ALDE

 Madam President, a comment on the Rules of Procedure: where are the Greens when environmental associations organise exhibitions in Parliament and confront elected MEPs with the words ‘we are the voice of the citizens’?

blue-card question
. – (DE)
 Mr President, Ms Lepage, are you therefore willing to accept that it is a question of physics rather than a lobbying question; that if you burn gas more efficiently than coal, there are fewer CO2 
emissions than with coal-based power generation? This means, for example, that if we ultimately shut down our coal-fired power stations in Europe – a development that is already taking place in the United States – and bring gas-fired power stations on stream, CO2 
emissions will fall. That is my question. My second question, which follows on from the first, is as follows: are you willing to accept that mining less coal possibly also has less of an impact on the environment than shale gas exploration may have, in other words that coal mining has a greater environmental impact than shale gas exploration?

Mr President, Ms Wils, my question is along exactly the same lines: what impression do you have of freely elected MEPs – to think that we are at the beck and call of industry interests, that we are not smart enough to form our own opinion and that we need exhibitions and lobbying before acting as stooges for some lobby or other?

Mr President, Mr Groote, there is no technology without risks! The perfect energy generation technology does not exist. I believe the same applies to what we are discussing here today. I am very much in favour of a rational discussion. What we are currently experiencing is a new arrival on the energy markets in the form of unconventional resources, applying mainly to gas, but also to oil. It is neither appropriate to get carried away with euphoria about the great future of gas, nor, as some of my colleagues from the Greens and Left have done here, to paint a picture of terrifying scenarios which bear absolutely no resemblance to reality. I think we should bear in mind that these unconventional resources have the potential to change all the familiar energy supply relationships between suppliers and consumers, and that economic efficiency calculations for existing energy sources are also called into question. We should face up to this development. We should acknowledge that it could also be an opportunity for Europe and not only a risk, and we should prepare ourselves to take up and use new technologies in a positive way, to weigh up opportunities and risks fairly and not to fall into ideological debates.

rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.

Mr President, my role in this great financial market regulation process is limited to the issue of the extent to which industry is affected by financial market regulation – here I speak on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy – since there is a need for financial market regulation, which we are addressing with this directive and regulation package. However, there is a lot of activism involved in financial market regulation and the Commission’s first proposal on the subject would simply have led, through questions of definition and interpretation, to companies in the real economy – here I am thinking of smaller industrial enterprises such as German public utility companies and agricultural cooperatives – suddenly being treated like banks, for example when they hedge delivery relationships with suppliers and customers on the futures markets. This would have been the collateral damage of financial market regulation and would have been in no one’s interest. In my view it is clear that industrial companies must be treated differently to banks. The majority of futures transactions made by these companies are for hedging purposes, not speculation. Even where these transactions do involve speculation, it must be said that I do not know of a single industrial company or energy supplier that is of systemic importance. The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy was very clear in its opinion on this subject and I must say that I am pleased that these aspects managed to appear in the final package. To that extent, in the end we certainly did well to include this ancillary aspect. Holger Krahmer,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, firstly, I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur. We have recently enjoyed very constructive cooperation on this subject in particular. The result that we have before us today is a compromise, and it is in the nature of compromise that everyone is both satisfied and dissatisfied with it at the same time. Overall, it is a step in the right direction when it comes to the quality of marine fuels in the European Union. We have been making policy on air quality in other areas for years and, in my opinion, we often overshoot the mark and pass measures that are not particularly efficient. In this case, we are on the right track. Nonetheless, I have certain objections here. In reaching agreement so quickly at first reading, we have disregarded some of the arguments and concerns of some players in Europe’s internal market. In 2015 at the latest, when it becomes compulsory to use what are, in fact, sulphur-free fuels in the Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs), which is essentially in the North Sea and the Baltic, there may be consequences of this legislation that can already be foreseen today but which, at the end of the day, we are completely ignoring. It cannot be in the interests of this legislation if more expensive fuel for goods transport by ferry in the North Sea and Baltic results in goods vehicles turning around at the ferry ports and going by road instead, where this is a possible alternative to short sea crossings. We have given no thought to that, and it was not considered when the Marpol Convention was concluded either. We have simply disregarded this argument. Consequently, I fear that we will have to look at this situation again in the northern regions in two years’ time. I think it is important to harmonise things in Europe, but we also have to be clear that this cannot happen at the very highest level. I can quite understand some of the arguments from southern Member States, particularly those bordering the Mediterranean, which are dubious about this idea and feel that they have other priorities than the introduction of sulphur-free fuel. It costs money, and you can only ever spend your budget resources once. Consequently, I see this as a step in the right direction but, in the end, unequal competition within the EU has been written into the legislation here. My final point is that compensating Northern Europeans for their hardships by means of State aid cannot be the way to go since, in the end, this would distort competition between the countries of Northern Europe. Some countries will pay, while others will not. Holger Krahmer  (ALDE
).

 Mr President, I, too, would like to thank Mr Gerbrandy for the sound piece of work that he has presented here. I can also support much of what is in the report. I consider it a good thing that we are making the effort to say that we have to overcome the obstacles in the internal market when it comes to removing barriers to the exploitation of resources and the exchange of resources. I also feel, however, that a lot of things that have been said here are not quite correct. I feel I must briefly mention these. Jan, the price of copper is not going up because copper is becoming more scarce, neither are the costs of raw materials at AkzoNobel and Unilever going up because the raw materials are becoming scarcer. Instead, it is because we are printing so much money, and because a lot of money is looking for safe investments and increasingly it does not find these in government bonds – which is why much of it is ending up in the commodity markets. That is one reason why prices of raw materials are rising; not so much because we are about to completely run out of some raw materials and they will no longer be available. I think we need to look more carefully at the causes here. It generally has little to do with a scarcity of resources. There are two things in the report that I find hard to stomach and that I consider to be sending out completely the wrong signals. The first is the call to extend the scope of the Ecodesign Directive. We should stick with the principle that we will find the best solutions through competition and not by political edict – we have already heard the term ‘eco-diktat’ used in this context. The second point is that we in Europe, which is no longer growing and is facing catastrophic developments, should call for new taxes in order to manage our resources.

 That is a matter of political judgment. I would simply remind you that the central bank – this has nothing to do with this debate, but I have been asked the question so I must answer it – printed EUR 1 billion in the months of December and February in order to ease liquidity bottlenecks in the countries of southern Europe. In my opinion, it is apparent that we are on the way to losing price stability. I also think that this policy risks exacerbating the situation in the commodity markets, because a lot of money is flowing into precious metals and commodities there, since some investors see them as safe havens or want to make speculative transactions there too. Holger Krahmer  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mr Davies is aware that I am a fundamental opponent of the plan we are about to decide on. Political plans – particularly ones with very long-term goals – have always existed. These plans always had one thing in common: they were superseded by reality. The fact is that it makes absolutely no sense to plan how the world will be in 2050. This presumes too much knowledge. A great many things are bound to happen to us before then that we have not planned and that we cannot know or predict. The targets we set ourselves are, in the final analysis, arbitrary. We find ourselves comparing years and percentages that actually only have one constant feature, namely that they end in zero. Their relevance in terms of climate cannot really be explained in objective terms. We could just as easily deduct five years from the dates or add 5% to the percentage points. This would be just as arbitrary, but a little more ambitious. Why do we not do this? I would suggest that any of us still alive in 2050 should meet once again as venerable ladies and gentlemen to discuss the reality of these plans as part of a night’s entertainment. I have the feeling that would make a very entertaining evening indeed. It is also high time that we realised that European climate policy is a failure in global terms. Our pioneering role is not accepted and no one pays much attention to our standards. I would simply remind you of the inclusion of the aviation industry in emissions trading. We must take a much more reasonable approach. We will only achieve success in climate policy if the rest of the world comes on board. (Applause) Holger Krahmer  (ALDE

 Mr President, I believe that our decision today marks a black day for the European internal market. We are giving up on the concept of the internal market as a result of what is simply a reflex opposition to technology. This is obviously the latest fashion in the EU. We have criticised Denmark today for wanting to leave the Schengen Agreement for populist reasons. Essentially, we are now behaving in the same way. We must be fully aware of what we are doing. We are allowing the European Food Safety Authority to continue authorising genetically modified organisms (GMOs) on the internal market, but, at the same time, we are giving the Member States the legal means to deviate from these authorisation criteria. I hope that this will not set a precedent for other internal market decisions which are due to be made in future. We should pull ourselves together at this point and remember that we must not give up on the European idea at every opportunity. Holger Krahmer,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, in the discussion about whether or not it is sensible to come to an agreement during the first reading, we should not stick as closely to our principles as some Members have recommended. This should depend on the dossier. How are the discussions going? How controversial are they? In the case of the regulation of CO2
 emissions from light commercial vehicles, it is clear that the positions of the institutions were not very far apart. Therefore, it would not have been worthwhile to start the second reading process, except in the case of an issue which is the subject of heated discussions, in other words, the long-term target. The European Commission has never explained properly and it is also not clear from the impact assessments how a reduction in emissions from 203 grams today to 135 grams within 10 years – these are the figures just mentioned by Mrs Hedegaard – can be implemented in an economically viable way. This represents a cut of 34% and goes far beyond our other climate targets. Parliament’s most important job was to bring this target back to reality and to make it feasible in economic terms. This is what we have done. I am pleased that Mr Groote took up my argument, because a fleet average of 147 grams is a long way from what the Commission originally proposed, but it is also by far the most ambitious target set anywhere in the world. We should not try to persuade ourselves that a CO2
 limit for light commercial vehicles will save the world’s climate. I would like to thank everyone, including the rapporteurs, for their hard work. I am pleased that we have achieved a large majority for this compromise. Holger Krahmer,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

Madam President, Europe is rightly regarded as having the safest medicines in the world. With this legislation, which we have been discussing for a long time, for two years I believe, we will further improve levels of safety. I would like to thank Mrs Matias very much for taking on such a complex report as a new Member of Parliament. This was a huge task and she has done very well. It also involved a great deal of teamwork and I would like to thank everyone involved for this. We have produced some very good results. However, we must not lose sight of the fact that we can never achieve complete safety by means of regulations. This is true in every area, not just in the case of medicines. We have rightly concentrated on the essential issues, on the distinctions between different types of packaging and on traceability in the distribution chain. By differentiating between prescription and over-the-counter medicines, we are taking the right approach, because we must remember that every piece of legislation and every attempt to make products safer costs money. Therefore, it is reasonable not to include every pack of aspirins or every over-the-counter medicine automatically right from the start. Instead, the Commission or the agency must be given the task of monitoring the market and investigating developments. I believe that we can be proud of what we have achieved. We have produced a piece of legislation that brings real benefits. Most patients will probably not be aware that they are the result of EU law and, therefore, we must make this very clear.

 In overall terms, the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament supports the waste disposal directive. However, the subject of photovoltaic modules remains a problem. There is no understandable reason for excluding the entire sector from the regulations. We have a wide range of legislation governing waste streams. Therefore, it is not clear why a complete industry, which is expected to produce significant waste streams, is being exempted. For this reason, some of the FDP Members of the European Parliament have abstained from voting on the report. Holger Krahmer,

 Madam President, Commissioner, with this directive, we have before us legislation that has come about surprisingly quickly. I am very surprised that we have reached a compromise already which I and my group – and I expressly underline that – consider acceptable. When all is said and done, this piece of legislation has had a very difficult passage through Parliament. We expanded its scope, only to restrict it again straight away. We have quite incidentally attempted to declare certain substances highly dangerous; perhaps we should ask ourselves whether this legislation is really the right forum for such a debate. Personally, I did not think it a good idea to include PVC and nanomaterials in a directive on ‘hazardous substances’. I therefore think it sensible that this is no longer the case in the compromise. The previous speaker has just said so already, but it really is remarkable that we consider each gram of polluting substances so carefully and are then sometimes very irrational in our debates. Apparently, there are industries in Europe which we are ring-fencing for political reasons. This seems to be the case for enterprises in the renewable energy sector. The fact that we instantly exempt them completely from the scope of this legislation by saying that we have to put up with environmental pollution for the sake of climate protection and our objectives in the area of renewable energy is incomprehensible. It does not add up. I only hope that we do not do the same thing in the case of electronic waste – the decision on which is also imminent here – because that would be even more astonishing. Holger Krahmer  (ALDE

 Mr President, it is good that we are looking at biocides, because they are hazardous, toxic substances. However, I am wondering why we do not base every piece of chemical legislation that we implement on the same system as that of REACH. We have passed the most comprehensive piece of chemical legislation in the world. The principles have been laid down: collect the data, evaluate it, authorise the product. Why are we using a different system for subsequent chemical legislation and defining new exclusion criteria, which ultimately also results in chemicals that we need and that, in some cases, do not have alternatives, being withdrawn from the market? I think that we will end up in a blind alley if we draw up our policy on chemicals purely from the perspective of toxic substances. Pest infestations can be much more dangerous, in particular, for small children because of the risks of disease transmission, than the few milligrams of biocides which we use to combat them. I would like to see the situation being put into proportion and, most importantly, I would like to see regulations that can be used not only by large companies which have the resources to enter into a discussion with the authorisation bodies, but also by smaller companies which supply useful products for niche markets. Holger Krahmer,

 Madam President, I regret to say that we are debating a failed strategy here. Even at the time we adopted the directive, some voices of warning could already be heard asking whether including third countries in emissions trading without any consultation had really been thought through. Even today, we are ignoring the international situation. We imagine that we only have to grit our teeth and then everything will work out in Copenhagen, subsequent conferences and ICAO. However, it is not that simple. Nonetheless, we have an EU directive that has to be implemented. I would like the Commission to tell me how it intends to do this. I have four specific questions on this and I eagerly await the answers. Firstly, what steps is the Commission planning to take if third countries or third country airlines refuse to participate in the EU emissions trading system? Secondly, what measures are planned to bring about the inclusion of airlines in emissions trading? Thirdly, is it correct that the Commission is investigating or planning the withdrawal of EU flying rights from those airlines or third countries that refuse to participate in the EU emissions trading system? Fourthly, if such flying bans are imposed, how does the Commission expect the third countries concerned to react? May I remind you that the European Court of Justice has received actions from third countries that are simply refusing to be included in the EU’s emissions trading system. It is high time that we took a careful look at the day of reckoning that will come in 2012. I want to know what will happen then. What will we do then? Debating what position we are going to take at ICAO is of secondary importance to me right now. When it comes down to it, ICAO is nothing more than an assembly of the governments of the world that are acting from exactly the same vast differences in interest as they were in Copenhagen and, I suspect, as they will be in Cancún. My question to the Commission is therefore as follows: how are we going to get out of this dilemma? We are trying to implement a law that already exists, but which, in fact, cannot be implemented.

The FDP is basically in favour of positive labelling, or process labelling, for GMOs in food at European level in order to bring about the necessary transparency for consumers. In this case, however, we cannot agree to the fact that unequal treatment of different sectors is being demanded. While labelling is requested for the field of animal production, this is not the case for plant production. Unfair labelling of this kind for products of animal origin could distort the market to the disadvantage of one side. This counteracts our efforts to ensure fair competition, and is clearly in conflict with the principle of equality enshrined in our legal system. Holger Krahmer,

 Mr President, this debate was timed badly. I would like to have seen the Dutch team win, even if for the last time in this World Cup. This is perhaps a bad omen, because we are no longer allowed to watch, so they will probably not win after all. Commissioner, today – or more precisely tomorrow – we are completing a legislative package that we have been discussing for more than two years. It is not just controversy that is responsible for this, but also the European elections that have taken place in the meantime, and also the entry into force of a new EU Treaty which has meant that we have had to adjust a few things. However, I think that, if we can draw a conclusion from today’s debate, it is that we are voting on a compromise which completely deserves to be approved, even if, in some areas, we might do so with gritted teeth. I would like to emphasise two aspects. The first is the environmental requirements in industrial plants. What we are talking about here is the better implementation of best available techniques in Europe. I think that we have found a paragraph of exceptions in the compromise which is currently before us which gives the European Commission – Mr Potočnik, here I am addressing you directly – the tools to ensure over the next few years, better and more firmly than has been the case up to now, that the approximately 52 000 industrial plants in Europe which are affected by this finally make better use of best available techniques than they currently do. I have heard many arguments in this debate. I would like to take up one of these and deflect it, because I cannot comprehend it at all. It has often been said to me that the use of best available techniques is too expensive and that we will thereby endanger the competitiveness of European industry, and even more so in the crisis. I do not like to remember my past, but I come from the former GDR, East Germany. The economic and ecological collapse of the GDR was attributable to the fact that for decades, we neglected to invest in up-to-date technology. I think that every industry and every industrial enterprise, for its existence, needs to invest in up-to-date technology, because otherwise it will become less competitive, and this naturally means also reducing emissions of pollutants. Today, we have the opportunity to bring in a law which will improve this situation from which we are starting. The second part of the directive – and here we have some of the gritted teeth that I mentioned – deals with large combustion plants. We are talking once more – as we did before with the last directive – about renewing exceptions up to 2020, and in some cases 2023, for large combustion plants which do not have to achieve the environmental obligations and, in particular, the limits on air pollutants. Here I call on the Council, but also perhaps all of us here, to consider very carefully how sensible it really is that we regularly bring in ambitious environmental targets, and we discuss them and welcome them here, but always, whenever it comes to implementing them and transforming them into concrete legislation, then a tragedy begins in Europe. Then it suddenly becomes clear to the Member States how much it costs, which bills we have to pay, and then, as a rule, the ones who have done this in advance are punished. There are a number of Member States which now already meet the obligations, and which will, in the end, be left out in the cold. I will say it here once again: whether we are talking about industrial plants or large combustion plants – which essentially means coal power stations – we are not dealing with science fiction. We are not talking about things which are not available; on the contrary, this is up-to-date technology. Best available techniques – what is available on the market given competitive and cost factors – can be incorporated into these plants, and today, against this background, we are completing a legislative package which I think is better than what is currently in force, and therefore I would encourage us all to approve it. I would also like to thank my fellow Members, who, while sometimes pulling no punches, have worked with me on this for the last two years, for their support, their legwork and, above all, for the fact that almost all of the main groups have subscribed to this compromise. Holger Krahmer,

 Mr President, three relevant things have happened while we have been debating: first, it is clear that Europe will be the football world champions. A good omen, I think. Who exactly it will be, we will see. I do not want to express any preference now. The second is that Germany is receiving compliments from the United Kingdom. Chris Davies, many thanks! That also does not happen every day. It is certainly worth noting. Thirdly, all is still well with the world; even the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance finds football more important than environmental protection. Regrettably, our fellow Member, Mr Eickhout, has left us again. However, congratulations to our Dutch friends, of course. I wanted to talk about two aspects of the debate to which I have just been able to listen. The first is that I understand all the worries and woes of my Eastern European friends only too well. As an East German, I am also half-Eastern European. I understand that Eastern Europe cannot immediately catch up on every step of environmental policy that has been taken in the Western European countries in recent decades. In order to get high-level environmental protection, one has to be able to afford it. Yes, that is true. However, I think that – even if we allow for this – it is worth approving this compromise, because it will do justice to the different starting positions that many Member States find themselves in. Secondly, the argument that the use of best available techniques will endanger competitiveness, in particular, with respect to China, is not only false; it is also dangerous. We must deal with the fact that industrial processes in Asia are always cheaper than here. However, we will only meet this challenge if we implement best available techniques in as many branches of industry as possible. Those which do not do this will become less competitive. No one, including this law, is demanding that an industrial enterprise should be switched off tomorrow. No one is demanding a leap from 0 to 100 in order to achieve a particular pollutant limit within a week. We have enough transitional periods, but to say that we must go without for competitive reasons is false. I also think that with this directive, we have set a course not only for environmental policy, but also for industrial policy, a course for which it is worth working in the next few years. Holger Krahmer  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I think that we are making good legislation today. It is good and right that we are taking steps to avoid illegal timber being placed on the European internal market. However, what holds for all environmental laws also holds for this law: we cannot just put in what we want, but we must also always check whether what we put in and prescribe is feasible in the end. Therefore, I think it is right that we have, in the end, come to the compromise that due diligence only needs to take effect at the first instance of placing on the market, and also that only then can the import ban be issued. It would be much too bureaucratic to provide documentary evidence of origin throughout the entire supply chain within Europe. This was on the table at the beginning of the debate. I think that it is not realistic here to constantly keep new accounts and provide documentary evidence, from the timber yard and the sawmill right up to the furniture factory. This produces bureaucracy which, in case of doubt, produces more paper and thereby may even accelerate legal felling. Therefore, we must be moderate in this area and ensure balance. We have succeeded in doing this. I am not in favour of the approach that Mrs Hassi has just spoken of, namely that we can bring in a zero-risk policy. This is not only applicable to felling, and it will not work. Zero risk is not feasible. It produces bureaucracy and, above all, produces new risks. We must ensure that the laws remain balanced and feasible. In this sense, this compromise is a good one. I am pleased that we will be able to approve it with a large majority tomorrow.

 Providing consumers with information about food is undoubtedly important. However, the debate in Brussels has become a lobbying battle between large companies from the food industry and consumer protection organisations. There was no place in this debate for the reality of everyday life for consumers. The representatives of the German Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament are in favour of a minimum of labelling. Consumers should be able to make their purchasing decisions on the basis of transparent, legible information. Colour coded labelling influences consumers and does not form the basis for transparent information. The so-called guideline daily amounts (GDAs) also have their weak points. Instead of having neutral information about the amounts of nutrients per 100 grams or millilitres printed legibly on packaging, Parliament discussed whether the daily requirements of a 40-year-old woman could be used as the point of reference or whether the colour coding of nutrients was a useful decision-making tool. The proposed, far-reaching, mandatory requirements for the origin labelling of ingredients cannot be implemented in practice. We also rejected the idea of special national provisions, because the labelling system should, as far as possible, be standardised. For these reasons, we were not able to vote in favour of the proposed report. Holger Krahmer  (ALDE

 Commissioner, I have two specific questions for you. Firstly, in your paper, I see no analysis of the European negotiating position at international level. Have we really taken note of the fact that Europe’s influence in climate policy has diminished? Have we taken note of the fact that the political and economic weight in this world has shifted sharply in the direction of Asia? Is it possible that we completely overestimated our influence here? Secondly, your paper is remarkable. In the twelve pages that you have completely filled, there is not a single reference to the IPCC Panel. Is that a subtle attempt to distance yourself from this body? I would like to remind you that this panel formed the basis for all the political decisions relating to the directives that we have drawn up here in recent years. Is it not time to call for a broad scientific approach that gives us real scientific statements, not political ones?

According to the resolution of the European Parliament on the draft general budget for the financial year 2010, adopted on 17 December 2009, a vote was taken today on the amending budget for the European Parliament, following the revised calculations made by the Parliamentary administration. The FDP in the European Parliament abstained, because there was a paragraph in the package of amendments concerned that we could not reconcile with our convictions. The FDP had already expressed its opposition to an increase in the secretarial allowance to EUR 1 500 during the discussions in committee. It is out of the secretarial allowance that MEPs’ assistants are paid. The FDP considers that the argument that more money is needed due to the additional work that MEPs have to do with the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is unsound, as there is nothing in past experience to support this. Certainly, due to the Treaty of Lisbon, which has just come into force, Parliament will overall need extra capacity for legislative work, but with the introduction of the Assistants’ Statute from the beginning of the current parliamentary term, there is still no proof that MEPs actually need more assistants. For this reason, there are grounds for concern that further demands and supplementary increases, or an extension of office capacity, will follow. For this reason, the FDP in the European Parliament abstained. Holger Krahmer,

Madam President, it seems to me to be a little symptomatic for the EU in general, but also for Parliament in particular, that we should have knee-jerk debates about situations in certain countries that are in no way new. Unfortunately, it is very often the case that overnight events lead to us here in Parliament spouting out waves of political demands that I sometimes find somewhat dubious. I think that it does not give a good impression of us if a failed bomb attack on an aeroplane only leads us to a general debate on Yemen. We should be clear that it would be fitting to consider a strategy for how to deal with this situation. I also think that the situation in Yemen requires a precise analysis, specifically with regard to the fact that this is a failed state in which the government does not have control of large parts of the country We should analyse for ourselves what risks this involves for Europe. The risks appear to be that terrorists are trained there and the risks also appear to relate to the Yemeni coast, where piracy is clearly taking place. We – and perhaps Baroness Ashton, also – must consider what we can do to counter these risks. As I see it, the main question might well be: how can we bolster the Yemeni Government so that it can regain control of the country and thus contain these risks? All the other debates about the long-term building-up of the country also need to be held, of course, but I do not think that there is really any point in us putting forward a catalogue of demands clean across all political areas – from the freedom of the media to women’s rights – here in Parliament at this point, or that we will be taken seriously if we do so. Doing so will not achieve our goal in Yemen, so instead, we should concentrate on what tangible assistance we can provide in the current situation in order to solve an urgent problem.

 The German Free Democratic Party members of the European Parliament have abstained from voting on the Copenhagen resolution for the following reasons. The resolution contains statements about financing for climate protection measures in third countries without defining the specific criteria or purpose of the financing. We cannot justify this to taxpayers. In addition, we believe that blanket criticism of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) is wrong. The ICAO is the organisation which deals with aviation matters at an international level. Both the criticism and the statement about the alleged failure of ICAO negotiations are incorrect and inappropriate. The call for specific arrangements for a CO2
 trading system for the aviation industry goes against current EU legislation and overburdens the EU’s negotiating position in an international climate agreement with unrealistic demands. Holger Krahmer  (ALDE

Madam President, European climate policy should leave its reverie behind and take note of the international realities. First of all, Kyoto was a failure. It was very symbolic, but delivered no reductions in emissions. Secondly, on the eve of Copenhagen, it is clear that important states in the world are not prepared to accept binding targets for reductions. Thirdly, politics must take note of a debate emerging in science. The same scientists who signed the conclusions of the IPCC panel two years ago today talk of natural influences on the climate – something that the IPCC categorically ruled out two years ago. We should already know how sure we can be of what influences climate change when we make political decisions. I therefore call for a change of strategy. First of all, we need to adapt to inevitable changes to the climate, while we should also move beyond all the ideological discussions about CO2
 and look for international allies in order to accelerate research into new energy sources and clean technologies. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Madam President, it has been an honour and a privilege to be the rapporteur for the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) on the proposal for a directive on the accessibility of public sector bodies’ websites and websites operated by entities performing public tasks. This piece of legislation is long overdue and eagerly awaited both by citizens with disabilities and by our increasingly ageing population who find themselves more and more isolated and excluded from a world where information is accessible primarily online. In Europe this amounts to 80 million citizens with disabilities and another 87 million aged over 65. 167 million European citizens is too great a number to be ignored. Throughout my involvement with this dossier, I have seen what these people face when trying to navigate their way online. I was particularly struck by the difficulties faced by the blind, which was exemplified at an IMCO Committee hearing held in April 2013. Ioanna-Maria Gertsou, a blind woman who owns a school for guide dogs in Athens, came to Parliament for a web accessibility demonstration and got visibly lost on traditional websites. However, despite the fact that assistive technology already exists, Europe has been lagging far behind. We are the European Union. We should be setting the agenda, not struggling, or even failing, to keep up. Less than one third of Europe’s public sector and government websites, and even less than 10[nbsp ]% of Europe’s websites in general, are fully accessible. Making websites and their content useable for all should already have become a priority at EU level. The Commission’s initial proposal was limited in scope and not fully in line with the goals promised in the digital agenda for Europe. The IMCO Committee was more ambitious, and made a number of significant amendments to the text. The directive now covers all EU public sector bodies’ websites and websites providing public services, as now laid down in a new annex. It now covers mobile web and apps and includes a robust enforcement mechanism. The specifications for accessibility are technology-neutral and based on the international Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0, also known as WCAG. This directive is essentially a forerunner in the planned European Accessibility Act, which I know is also being eagerly awaited by our citizens. The scope, along with the enforcement mechanisms and monitoring systems, reflects the binding obligations set out in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the commitments made in the digital agenda for Europe. In addition, with the implementation of a harmonised European approach, making these websites accessible also has the potential to be a highly profitable business. The financial benefits are currently estimated at EUR[nbsp ]2 billion.  Members of this Parliament will vote tomorrow to deliver on their commitment to uphold the rights of disabled people. However, this is only the first step in the legislative process. We regret the lack of engagement by previous presidencies on this dossier. However, I thank Commissioner Kroes for having openly supported our legislative work using one of the most modern ways of rapid communication, Twitter. I thank her for that.  I am sure the Greek Presidency will follow up the good work on this file and it is completely feasible that the Italian Presidency will be able to bring this dossier into legislation. In our increasingly digital world, accessibility is very much a human right. All people are entitled to use the internet in order to exercise their fundamental rights. I hope tomorrow’s vote will cement Parliament’s commitment on this.  Lastly, I must emphasise that cooperation with my shadow rapporteurs last year was both consensual and produced a directive that should be acceptable to all and I thank them for that.

 Madam President, my thanks go to all colleagues, especially to Adam Kósa, the Intergroup Chair, who really contributed to this piece of legislation.  This is both an ethical issue and a commercial issue. It is about basic and fundamental human rights and it is about jobs. Yes, the report is ambitious and I will admit that it has been made more ambitious by Parliament, but it is a feasible report, this is a feasible issue.  The ball, as many colleagues and Commissioner Kroes have said, lies now in the court of the Council of the Member States. Yes, and with our vote tomorrow we will take an important step. And I am very confident that the next Parliament will take up its work where we end it now and will bring this to an end together with the forthcoming Italian Presidency. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

Mr President, as Co-Chair of the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) of the European Parliament and the Sobranie, let me congratulate you on yet another positive report. For the first time our colleagues from Skopje are here in Strasbourg to attend the 11th JPC at the moment and to follow this debate on Richard Howitt’s report. I would like to welcome especially my Co-Chair Kenan Hasipi. Last December, only two months after the positive Commission progress report, we experienced a major political crisis in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The opposition was kicked out of the plenary, journalists had been expelled previously, and voting took place without their presence. The whole political process was disrupted due to parliamentary blocking for many weeks. We have been following the developments very anxiously in Brussels and in Europe, and the EU has made tremendous efforts to act as a mediator between the parties. On 1 March 2013, an agreement was achieved thanks to an EU mission by Parliament’s former President Jerzy Buzek, Richard Howitt and Commissioner Füle. Congratulations, especially to the Commissioner for his commitment and his tough tone, which led to the 1 March agreement and calmed the situation. Our rapporteur Mr Howitt postponed the vote on his report as he feared that the vote could turn out negatively for the country. I respect his decision. Moreover, the JPC was also postponed. This was a sign of mutual respect. Parliament, I think, and our colleagues were extremely tolerant in allowing us to use this time-out instrument, but this measure can only be an exceptional approach. Let us continue to work hard, keeping the country on the European track. It is in our common interest. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

Mr President, when I entered politics one of my biggest idols, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, defined as one of the cornerstones of the European Union respect for the right to sovereignty, especially for the small Members of the European Union. The Eurogroup did not respect this small Member State, Cyprus, and its sovereignty, nor the Cypriot economy and society. The Eurogroup should stop putting in danger this fundamental value of the European Union, namely respecting the sovereignty of the small. That is why we should respect Cyprus in order to safeguard the European Union. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,

Madam President, President Caldeira, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the Court of Auditors for the important work that it undertakes on behalf of the European taxpayer every year. Mr Caldeira, you and the Court are and will remain a valued partner for us as Members of this House, the representatives of the European Union’s discharge authority. A year ago, as we sat here discussing the Court of Auditor’s previous report, I said that the Court’s report presented a positive picture, but there were some grey areas. The picture is becoming steadily brighter, but there are still some spots of grey. The sum of EUR 130 billion was available in 2011, and of this figure, EUR 5 billion should never have been disbursed. That is an error rate of 3.9 %. Compared with previous years, that is an improvement, but it is still much too high. I am at a loss to explain how these figures can possibly be justified in view of the budget constraints throughout the EU. However, there are some positive aspects. The instruments that Parliament, in its discharge reports, has given the Commission, especially in recent years, are being utilised at last and are working. This is happening to an exemplary – extremely exemplary – degree in the field of employment and social affairs. The Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion and its Commissioner, Mr Andor, have since 2008 applied a consistent policy of suspending and discontinuing payments if current projects simply do not work. As a result, the error rate here has fallen to 2.2 %. I would like to congratulate you, Commissioner Andor, on these consistent efforts, which show how it should be done. I would like to extend these congratulations to Commissioner Šemeta as well, for he is of course involving in overseeing these efforts.  I myself, as one of the previous rapporteurs for the budget discharge, together with my parliamentary colleagues, reminded the House that funds that have been disbursed without justification must be recovered. This measure is also being used to an increasing extent, and I would like to congratulate you on this as well. My perusal of the Annual Summaries, which we Members are now permitted to inspect, has convinced me that this instrument is working. As regards efficiency, there are still some problems here. The evaluation report has rightly been criticised by the Court of Auditors for being too vague. I would like to offer Mr Geier, who is reporting on the budget discharge this year, the support of the House as a whole in order to ensure that the procedure is improved. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

The EU single market is one of the most worthwhile European achievements. Between 1992 and 2008 it created about 2.77 million jobs and increased GDP by 2.13 %. These figures clearly show the potential of a smoothly functioning EU single market. The 20 years of its existence that we are now celebrating is an anniversary of which all Europeans should be proud. However, past achievements should motivate us to remove any remaining obstructions. As the rapporteur has clearly shown us, some things in the single market are still in dire straits. The Commission has also produced a working paper containing the 20 main concerns of citizens that they consider impede the everyday smooth operation of the single market to no purpose. The problem areas identified must be solved using an integrated approach. Another problem concerns the issue of how we can ensure that every European citizen can benefit from the achievements of the EU single market, no matter where they live. The trade balance deficits within the EU may in the long term create difficulties for the Union. European policy must steer us in the opposite direction. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, 20 years of the internal market are indeed a reason to look back on this track record. It is exactly as Ms Gebhardt said: the internal market has brought the European idea, the European philosophy, to the fore, there is no doubt about that. It goes without saying that, externally, the internal market is seen as a success. However, if we look inside the European internal market, we will discover that some have benefited more than others. Germany has a very healthy balance sheet. The German Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau
 has calculated that, in Germany alone, the internal market effect represents an annual amount of EUR 30 billion in relation to the euro. On the other hand, we see that productivity in the peripheral countries is declining. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let us take the Single Market Act II and these 20 years of the internal market as an opportunity to consider how we can get to grips with this imbalanced development, these current account differences, within the European Union. If we do not succeed in this, unless everyone sees an advantage in the internal market, the internal market will lose credibility and legitimacy in the long term. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Busuttil, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I warmly welcome this own-initiative report by Mr Busuttil. It is further proof of how important it is that Parliament sets the agenda on important matters. Thank you, then, Mr Busuttil, for this very balanced report. The subject is more relevant than ever, for alongside the things that we imagined would be the engine of European integration when the internal market was established 20 years ago, we can also see that there are imbalances in the internal market. The imbalances where the balance of payments is concerned are also one reason why the euro area has run into such difficulty. The single European market as a whole is also at risk of losing its legitimacy, its role as an engine, if we do not devote particular attention to what has happened now, on its 20th anniversary. The internal market scoreboard could be a useful instrument for indicating where things are going wrong at a very early stage, as a kind of early warning system. It would be a significant first step towards economic policy that is at last coordinated. That is why I also welcome the European Commission’s plans to publish this internal market scoreboard annually. We need to square the circle here. On the one hand, the economies that have nursed their labour markets back to health by making appropriate reforms – those that are more prompt with transposition – must naturally not be punished for their achievement. On the other hand, however, even the best in class will be affected if its neighbour gets into excessive debt in order to buy its products. As an initial step, it would be sufficient for the EU’s internal market regulations to finally be transposed in a more timely manner. In reality, what we need here are realistic transposition and implementation targets – as this report also underlines. Then there is the varying speed of transposition. In May 2011, the Member States took, on average, 5.5 months longer than the transposition deadline to transpose EU directives; today, the figure is nearly 8 months. This time period needs to be reduced, for the sake of equal opportunities alone. In short, the Member States must meet their obligations better and must demonstrate greater commitment to and make greater efforts towards implementing European legal provisions. At the same time, it can be seen that 20 years of the internal market have resulted in a drastic increase in the differences between the competitiveness of the national economies in the European Union. There has been a radical shift in the balance of payments between the strongest economies and what are now the weakest economies, in favour of the strongest. The low interest rate policy conducted since the launch of the euro has reinforced this trend, acting rather like an accelerant. We Europeans have trusted in the healing powers of the internal market, while ignoring the fact that competitiveness has not necessarily improved across the board as a result of this internal market policy. Commissioner Barnier, we need to take action to counter this. The scoreboard provides one way of doing so. The 20th anniversary of the single European market also gives us an opportunity to look into drawing up a plan for more equal balances of payments at national level, and possibly even at regional level in a further step, alongside the completion of the internal market. Only then will we achieve overall economic equilibrium in even the marginal regions of Europe, and particularly in the southern parts of the euro area. Europe’s sovereign debt crisis shows that the surpluses in the north and the deficits in the south will have a blocking effect on each other unless we can resolve this problem in the medium term. I would therefore urge Europe’s economists to give us new theories that reconcile the internal market with reciprocal balance. The internal market scoreboard could provide a decisive starting point for this, but it must not be allowed to become a paper tiger. Let us use the internal market week as an opportunity to think about these things. Let us also use the 20th anniversary of the internal market as a chance to make all of us in Europe – not just the strong countries of the north, but everyone as a whole – fit for the future.

 Mr President, Mr Rehn, I wish to congratulate Werner Hoyer on his brilliant debut in his new job. Mr Hoyer, this is not an easy time for the European Union. This economic and financial crisis calls for adroit economic and political expertise. You have both in good measure. The European Parliament is happy to see you at the helm of the European Investment Bank (EIB). I would also like to thank the outgoing Vice-President, Matthias Kollatz-Ahnen, however, as he has also achieved a great deal. As an example, I would mention the establishment of the European Energy Efficiency Fund. Mr Hoyer, the role of your bank is decisive in overcoming the crisis. We are all aware of this. You have also proven this. I would cite the example of how you overcame the crisis in the automotive sector. Thanks to the scrapping premiums, which were mainly paid for by your bank, we managed to do something good for the environment, while also providing a stimulus for the economy. We are now facing new challenges. We have heard several references to the issue of project bonds. We are constantly talking about the innovative financial instruments we expect from your bank. We need clear rules, however; we expect your bank to issue clear rules for all Member States. We wish you every success in your efforts to obtain a triple-A rating for the bank. As stated in our report, for which I would like to thank Ms Ivanova, we would like to see the EU becoming a shareholder. This may perhaps be a step in the right direction. I wish you all the best for the work ahead. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, Jürgen Creutzmann, Britta Reimers and Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 The representatives of the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament will vote in favour of the Hübner report on amending COM(2011)0482
 only on condition that, when raising the applicable cofinancing rates by ten percentage points, there is an exception for those Member States explicitly affected. This exception must not be able to act as a precedent in any way and should be revoked in respect of the Member States in question once the severe financial and economic crisis and its liquidity squeezes have been overcome. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,

 Mr President, this year’s report from the European Court of Auditors presents a positive picture, but there are some problems. The good news is that many areas are satisfactory, in particular, the major area of agricultural spending, as Mr Fjellner has already said. The bad news is that the predicted deterioration in the area of cohesion has taken place and 49%, in other words half, of all the payments audited in the area of cohesion had errors. That is a great number. A total of 90% of all the payments with problems are made in the Member States. In our committee, we were critical at the time of the fact that the Council was not present. I am looking at the Council bench and the Council is once again not represented. The Council really should be here for this debate. Two-thirds of all the errors occur in three Member States. I would like to congratulate you, Mr Šemeta, for having the courage to name these Member States in the committee. You have said that they are Italy, Spain and the Czech Republic. You have our support for this new policy of naming and shaming. You have followed up another call by the European Parliament and I would like to thank you for this too. You have interrupted payments amounting to a total of EUR 2.4 billion. This is the only way that we will be able to introduce discipline in the Member States. After the process of damage limitation, we must identify the errors and name the culprits. The key words here are effectiveness, efficiency and economic viability. There is also a new chapter where you, Mr Caldeira, make it clear in your report that the Commission often does not achieve the goals which it sets itself. Mr Šemeta, we will be interested to see the evaluation report from the Commission, which is expected in December. However, we would also like to say that in times of financial crisis, we must use taxpayers’ money in a way which is even more effective, more precise, more carefully targeted and more efficient. That is our job. I would like to thank the Court of Auditors for helping us to do this. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Mr Korolec, Commissioner, energy is the lifeblood of our national economies. We therefore want price developments to remain transparent for consumers. I regret to say that there are still too many deals and agreements being made behind the scenes. In the end, it is consumers who foot the bill, in the form of severely inflated energy prices. This is not just annoying; it also has real effects on growth and employment. We want a better internal energy market. Europe needs transparent energy markets that are protected from abuse. This is precisely what the regulation on energy market integrity and transparency aims to achieve, and that is what we are talking about here. I would specifically like to thank the Commission and Commissioner Oettinger for their positive cooperation. This is exactly how European legislation needs to be made – in the way that we have brought it about here. I am particularly pleased that the European dimension of energy trading is stressed in the text that will be put to the vote tomorrow. One of the main issues was whether or not we need a special law on this. Do we need a sector-specific approach or could energy trading simply be subject to the general regulations for financial markets? When it comes down to it, however, energy markets have different rules; energy traders are not banks. I am particularly grateful to Commissioner Oettinger for having done all he could to ensure this matter was put to the House quickly. That was essential for a sector-specific approach. The negotiations with the Hungarian Presidency were tough and we succeeded in getting a result at first reading. Parliament – my fellow Members – introduced seven new points into the Commission’s text. The first important point was the introduction of an approval system for a register of electricity traders. This regulation now sets out the requirement of a national register of electricity traders. It also provides for the establishment of a European register which is to be organised by the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER). The Commission is to evaluate the registration system in the future and propose further instruments to improve it. Secondly: there is a link-up with CO2
 emissions trading. The regulation gives the ACER access to existing databases relating to trading in emissions certificates. Although Member States are not required to keep such records and the ACER is not being given the rights of control, the Commission is asked to present a legislative proposal to deal with the deficits in the CO2
 market system. Thirdly: there will be penalties, and we have worked to harmonise these penalties and to achieve minimum standards. Following pressure from Parliament, the damage caused to consumers is to be given particular consideration when deciding on sanctions. In addition, the Commission has been given the opportunity to table a proposal on minimum standards for penalties. Fourthly: the role of the agency and the national regulatory authorities have been strengthened. Parliament wanted to strengthen the ACER, which is why we have pushed for the director of the ACER to be more independent. The director of the ACER is to consult national provisions, but should not be bound by these. A fifth important point: there is a revision clause in respect of staffing and resources. Parliament would like the ACER to be provided with the appropriate financial and human resources to be able to perform its new tasks. This is emphasised in a new recital. The ACER needs to be better equipped if it is to be guaranteed a strong presence in important organised market places. Sixthly: naturally, insider trading is banned, but we have agreed one exemption when it comes to insider trading. This exemption may be applied only in the event of a direct physical loss resulting from unplanned outages. This exemption is allowed in order to provide security in the system, since otherwise players in the market would be unable to discharge their contractual obligations or to act by agreement with the competent transmission system operator. Mr President, I should like to continue speaking now rather than saving two minutes until the end. The seventh and final point concerns delegated acts versus implementing acts. This was a tough one in the negotiations – it was a central issue, and, in part, we were breaking new ground as a result of the Treaty of Lisbon. Parliament has conceded some of its demands concerning delegated acts in favour of a stronger role for the ACER and in favour of more detailed directions in the section on penalties. This was a trade-off that we made. One important element of the final package is that all the aspects relating to data collection will be laid down by an implementing act rather than a delegated act. This also applies to the setting of a de minimis
 threshold for the definition of reporting obligations. Nonetheless, the Commission will reserve the right to make a proposal ahead of any legislative proposal on such a threshold. This is also enshrined in the text as part of a declaration. Overall, we have achieved a good result. I am very satisfied. The Hungarian Presidency was a tough negotiating partner, but with the assistance of my colleagues from all the other groups, we succeeded in achieving a genuinely satisfactory result. I would like to express my warmest thanks to everyone, especially to my Hungarian colleague, Mr Gyürk, because he naturally had a particularly direct line to the Presidency; however, everyone was involved in the trialogue negotiations. We achieved near unanimity in committee. I would be pleased if we could do the same in plenary. Thank you for your cooperation. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, it only remains for me to thank everyone and, in particular, once again to wish Mr Pototschnig, the director of the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER), who is with us today, every success with his work. He only assumed responsibility for this area in March and it is already becoming clear that the resources available to him may be inadequate, as the two previous speakers and many other of my fellow Members have said. Therefore, we will soon be in the position where we have to provide the ACER with additional resources. I would like to give Mr Pototschnig and his team my best wishes for their work on an issue which is important to consumers. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control
. – (DE)
 Mr President, from the perspective of budgetary control, the European Union is often accused of taking a sloppy approach to spending. Who is responsible for this? In 80% of cases it is actually the Member States, which have joint responsibility for the expenditure. It is often the Member States. We all remember how the British Prime Minister, Mr Cameron, said to the President of the European Parliament that instead of asking for more money, we must first of all make sure that the money is spent more effectively. Which country was the biggest offender in 2010? The United Kingdom. All the British programmes were stopped in 2010. Why is that? It is because the rules are too complicated. Therefore, I would like to ask my fellow Members and, in particular, the Commission to campaign together with the Member States for simpler rules, for more effective and simpler monitoring systems and for the introduction of new components. For example, if research policy were to include an award or a prize for a particularly successful, innovative project, this would make it much easier to monitor. The same applies to cohesion policy, where we could create a leverage effect by providing project-related loans. There are a lot of opportunities open to us for innovation. We should take a brave step forward. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,  
rapporteur. 
– (DE)
 Mr President, Commissioner Šemeta, ladies and gentlemen, the process we are dealing with today – that is, the discharge for the expenditure of the European Commission – is an essential process. In recent years it may perhaps have been taken rather lightly, but in fact granting discharge for all the expenditure of the European Commission for the year 2009 is an essential task of the European Parliament. We are aware that 80% of these funds were spent as a shared responsibility between the Commission and the Member States. Nonetheless, the overall responsibility for this process lies with the Commission. I would therefore like to address you quite directly, Commissioner Šemeta. Firstly, I would like to thank you. I would like to make that clear at the outset. I would like to include my fellow Members who have worked very well together and who have supported Parliament’s position very strongly. However, the discussions that we had were very intense, Commissioner Šemeta. You have only shared responsibility for 2009, yet you have thrown yourself into it. In some cases we have had heated arguments and have gone into very great detail. I should like to emphasise, however, that you have put the discharge at the top of the agenda in the College, in the Commission. The President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, spent over an hour negotiating with us on the details. You yourself played a major part in changing the attitude of the Commission to the discharge and the attitude of the Commission officials to this whole process. I am grateful to you for having said quite openly that the pressure that Parliament has exerted this year will in the final event help you to improve transparency. You now have in your hands a means of exerting pressure not just on the Member States, but also on your own administration – which has until now been a little lax in dealing with these matters. However, I also think that we need to utilise this momentum that we have created together, Commissioner Šemeta – and I would ask you to pass on our thanks to President Barroso – and this dynamism for the other discharge reports. For there is one thing that must be clear to us, which is that for the 16th time in succession the European Court of Auditors has not given a positive statement. That is not insignificant, as it means that you have not actually met the criteria for 16 years running. Nonetheless, we have set key criteria that I would like to mention briefly and that you have met. I am pleased to have Mr Fjellner, the forthcoming rapporteur on the budget discharge, at my side. I hope that he will continue the work with the same impetus. The Commission has begun – and this is crucial, because we are after all talking about 80% shared responsibility here – quite clearly to state erroneous expenditure in the accounts of the European Union for 2009. It has listed these items openly. Building on this new transparency, therefore, we have set five key requirements. The first is a long-running issue – an old favourite – that Parliament has been dealing with for a long time, and that is the national management declarations. As a representative of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I am also pleased to be able to point out that this has been brought about by Dutch members of the ALDE Group in particular. We are talking here about the confirmation by the finance ministers that EU funds have been spent correctly in their home countries. We do not yet have these national management declarations, but we want to get them. In this respect I will be building on my cooperation with Mr Fjellner in the future. Commissioner, you have promised that we will look into whether stricter conditions can be introduced by the next financial perspective in 2014. It is important that you have drawn up guidelines – we are grateful to you for that – that you have shown which countries have actually provided national management declarations – it is not many: basically, only the Netherlands meets the requirements in full – and that you have instructed the Directorates General to show for the first time in the activity report for 2010 what components will be present in a future national administrative declaration, even if this will only take place at working level. The second key requirement is that the commissioners must also accept greater responsibility. You have proposed that the Directorates General be obliged to inform their commissioners of irregularities and I want to thank you for that. The third, and essential, requirement was for the instrument of stopping or suspending payments to be used to a greater extent. You have listed clear criteria for when you will do that. You have shown us clearly how you have already done this in the last couple of years. Thank you for such openness and transparency, which helps us exert pressure on the Member States. Thank you also for the guidelines that will help the Member States. In addition, you promised that when evaluating the performance audit you will set clear standards; this is an obligation that you have anyway under the Treaty of Lisbon. Thank you also for involving us to a considerable extent in the performance audit process. You have also promised to make simplifications, because often the material is so complex that people hide behind the rules and indulge in abuse. Thank you also for having set very specific requirements for the next financial perspective. I advocate that we continue along this path. I believe that Parliament can make a great contribution towards raising the Commission to another level. I wish Mr Fjellner all the best and would like to extend my warm thanks to my parliamentary staff, particularly Bent Adamsen and Dominykas Mordas. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the Commissioner once again on behalf of Parliament for his excellent cooperation. You have now raised certain points once again. We should take these as a starting point for our continued work. However, I would also ask you to pass on our thanks to your colleagues, because we had a very intense exchange with many individuals – I should particularly like to mention Mr Cioloş and Mr Hahn – and both were very cooperative. Please would you pass this message on to them once again. I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Becsey, for his clear words. He spoke very clearly; we may not like what he said, but at least he was clear in what he said and we are grateful for that. I consider it only right that you are here. I do not think there is particular cause to mention it. Nonetheless, it is good that you are here. I have saved my final thanks for the President of the European Court of Auditors, Mr Caldeira, with whom Parliament always enjoys genuinely open and positive cooperation. We very much appreciate that. Our work would not be possible without your background work. Our discharge is based mainly on your contributions. We would like to see you playing a greater role in the future assessment of the performance audit, Mr Caldeira. The future of the European Union depends not just on the funds being spent legally and correctly, but also and above all on their being spent usefully; in other words, effectively and efficiently. That will form part of the performance audit under Article 318 of the Treaty of Lisbon. As Parliament, we would like to see an annual debate on the performance audit of the Commission and we would like you to be invited here to debate it with us as a representative of the European Court of Auditors. My sincere thanks to my fellow Members and to everyone involved. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 In the vote on the Lange report, I am abstaining on paragraph 31 because of the ambiguous wording, which refers to Eurobonds as well as project bonds. However, taking it as a whole, I am voting for the report, as I have nothing against project bonds in themselves. Project bonds serve as finance for extensive innovation, infrastructure and reindustrialisation projects. This is not a question of instruments for the communitarisation of debts, as would be the case with Eurobonds. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,

 Madam President, Mr Tajani, thank you very much for your strong commitment to a European industrial policy. I have been looking over at Mr Lange and thinking that there has been a lot of commotion about an own-initiative report. A total of 500 amendments and 50 compromise proposals have been tabled with the aim of making industry in Europe a world leader again. We can only achieve this by means of an integrated and sustainable policy. We need to ensure that research and innovation are at the heart of our strategy. Therefore, we must put in place a regulatory framework which will support innovation and sustainability at the same time. The major challenge faced by your report was finding the right balance between environmental goals and economic competitiveness, while also avoiding protectionism. I am looking at Mrs Grossetête, because the French always want to introduce a touch of protectionism. At the same time, we need to support small and medium-sized businesses, promote the European patent and prevent knowledge theft, particularly with regard to China. We also want to see fewer regulations being imposed on European industry as a result of red tape. This means that we need to focus on reducing the amount of bureaucracy. Mr Lange, you have succeeded in covering this quite well in your report, so I would like to thank you for your hard work. However, this report can only represent the first step. We need to link the concept of industrial policy, which people in many Member States find it hard to discuss and which the Germans, in particular, have always been unwilling to talk about, with the competitiveness pact, which will be presented to the Heads of State or Government over the next few weeks in order to safeguard the euro area. If we do not manage to do this, then we will have a problem. We must coordinate areas such as cohesion, industry, trade, research and innovation, but also social issues, the climate and the environment. The current example of E10 in Germany demonstrates that this is not happening. This is all about adding bioethanol to petrol. The EU has put in place an important strategy, set itself the 20-20-20 targets, and we have said to the Member States that they must implement it. The Member States, and Germany in particular, were part of the decision-making process and supported everything that was decided. However, when it came to putting it into practice at home, they suddenly cut back the tax incentives and the consumers stopped cooperating. If we fail to convince consumers, as was the case in Germany with E10, then we will not be able to implement climate policy in combination with industrial policy. We need to have the consumers on our side. That is the central message. For this reason, I wish the industrial policy project every success. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 In overall terms, the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament supports the waste disposal directive. However, the subject of photovoltaic modules remains a problem. There is no understandable reason for excluding the entire sector from the regulations. We have a wide range of legislation governing waste streams. Therefore, it is not clear why a complete industry, which is expected to produce significant waste streams, is being exempted. For this reason, some of the FDP Members of the European Parliament have abstained from voting on the report. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Mr President, the Communication and the report are very good, and I would therefore like to express my thanks to Commissioner Dalli and Mrs Matias. Alzheimer’s is a plague of our times, and our biggest problem is that we simply know too little about Alzheimer’s. That is why we need research, research, and more research. We need to pool our strengths and I therefore welcome the Commission’s initiative to create an innovation partnership on the subject of healthy ageing; Alzheimer’s fits in with this perfectly. Many years ago, the US Government designated the fight against cancer as a lighthouse project. They have not conquered cancer, but a great many medicines and a great many therapies have emerged as a result. That is the kind of thing that we need here, and I therefore welcome the fact that we are to concentrate on Alzheimer’s. We need to know how to take preventive action. What can we do in the future to combat Alzheimer’s? That is why we cannot continue to adopt the watering can principle in European research policy. We need to concentrate on specific areas. Alzheimer’s could be one of the major themes that we get to grips with. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

Mr President, Commissioner, energy efficiency has always been the biggest resource proffered to us. It is the sleeping giant with the hidden but enormous potential for the European energy economy. All that is true, and the nice thing about it is that it is so free of ideology. Above all, the approach to this issue can be technology-neutral. All that interests us here, and it is a point that is clearly also a little divisive, is the issue of whether or not the targets are binding. I have to say, Commissioner, in this regard, that I like your two-stage approach whereby you start by trusting in the Member States and by building voluntary agreements and then, if we observe that we will not achieve the targets by 2020, we perhaps get the thumbscrews out. That is the right approach to take. This report, by and large, moves in the right direction – there is little to criticise. There is one issue that I would like to raise, however, which is the role of the regional funds. You mentioned this issue, Commissioner. In the regional funds, together with the Cohesion Funds, we have an immense instrument in our hands in the European Union that we are not making use of. In this field of energy efficiency, we could finally create European added value which we could put to use in an innovative way to get to grips with energy efficiency in a way that has not happened in the past. As the current rapporteur for budgetary discharge for the Commission, I can see just how badly we have wasted money in the sphere of cohesion. Let us put a stop to that waste! I endorse the focus that you are giving to this issue, Commissioner Oettinger, and the fact that you are seeking to bring about greater use of these funds, including for this energy efficiency instrument. That is the only way that we will ensure that there really is cohesion, at least in the energy sector. I feel I must warn against smear campaigns, as we saw with light bulbs and with shower heads. Such campaigns are the kind of things that alienate the citizens. We must thus ensure that we aim to achieve energy efficiency in general and that we keep this objective in mind without pursuing ideological smear campaigns that ultimately lead to the citizens losing their positive impression of the EU.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to congratulate Mr Almunia on the open debate that has taken place in the Commission. There are good reasons why you and the Commission President, Mr Barroso, took part in the debate in the College of Commissioners with a very different year in mind. I am pleased that the Commission is able to discuss issues so openly from a regulatory perspective and then to reverse its decision. That is both admirable and remarkable. It is a good thing that you are supporting the new decision here. There are a number of good grounds for this decision. Nevertheless, the Member States which are affected have been making plans. There are plans in place and I can only say that I am pleased that the review clause has been removed, which stated that we would have to open up the whole can of worms once again from 2012 onwards in the largest Member State affected, in other words, Germany. This means that your debate in the College of Commissioners has also had a very successful outcome. I know that 2018 will eventually come around. I am also pleased about the fact that the mining industry has the security to plan ahead and I will vote accordingly. However, I can see that regulatory policy is the winner here.

 Mr President, Mr Šemeta, Mr Caldeira, I would like to thank the Court of Auditors for this report. Your organisation, Mr Caldeira, provides an essential service for European taxpayers. It is a good thing that the reduction in the error rate has continued this year. This is the result of the reform of the Commission which was pushed through by the liberal Commissioner, Mr Kallas. There are major improvements over the previous year in the area of cohesion and only a slight deterioration in agriculture. However, the Commission should not now simply sit back and do nothing. We must make it clear that the huge improvements are based on a very lucky choice of samples. Therefore, I am concerned that the positive trend will not continue next year. We should make use of the momentum from the first budget discharge under the Treaty of Lisbon to introduce a decisive paradigm shift. I would like to make it clear once again that this year’s report from the Court of Auditors is the sixteenth in a row which does not have positive overall results. How can we finally bring an end to the inefficient and wasteful allocation of funding and to the political connivance in this area? My proposals as rapporteur are as follows: Firstly, the Commission must intervene more strongly in the case of obvious errors and, where these errors are repeated, it must suspend the funding. How is it that a Member State of many years standing like Greece is not subjected to sanctions over a period of 10 years, despite the fact that it is in obvious breach of the provisions of the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS)? Secondly, we must no longer impose double penalties on taxpayers. The beneficiaries of EU funding which has been allocated illegally are only required to repay 10%. In accordance with the 50:50 rule, the Member States contribute half of the amount from their national budgets. This is an insult to taxpayers. Let me give you a few figures. Between 1994 and 2006, the Member States have been wrongly allocated a phenomenal EUR 7.7 billion in the area of cohesion policy. The Commission itself has just made this fact public. Only EUR 709 million has been paid back, which demonstrates very clearly the difference in these circumstances. This is probably correct, because the Member States are not in a position to come up with accurate calculations. The Court of Auditors has confirmed this. Thirdly, all the Member States must finally sign and submit national management declarations. Fourthly, the Commission must be politically accountable. This is why we want signatures at least from Mr Barroso on the synthesis report on annual activities. We also want an evaluation report, which is provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon. There are still some things that are in need of improvement. All in all, I would like to thank the Court of Auditors very much for this report. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,

 Mr President, what exactly does European innovation policy do? What does European research policy do? If we ask ourselves this question and if we were to ask the citizens on the street, we would just get a blank look. This is because it is not clear what added value European research and European innovation brings. For that reason, we welcome the fact that Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn’s proposal begins by providing a definition of innovation. What is innovation? Innovation involves making money, a product or a licence from knowledge. That is something new. I am pleased that the Commission is going down this path. However, we also now need ‘man on the moon’ or ‘woman on the moon’ projects which are understood by the man on the street, so that EU taxpayers understand what we are doing here with their money. In this regard, I see great potential in the issue of increasing the number of healthy life years by two. That would be a project that everyone out there would understand. I am therefore pleased that the first innovation partnership proposed is being devoted precisely to achieving this goal. Two additional healthy years of life – that will be understood by everyone and it is something we should do. In this regard, you have our support. However, I would like to point out, and Mrs Merkies has already mentioned this, too, that if we simply look at the instruments that already exist, there is the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), the Joint Technology Initiatives (JTIs), the so-called Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP) – these are all programmes that already exist. If we add yet another programme, then we will make the whole area difficult to get to grips with. This is something we must not do. The innovation partnerships are intended to make a real contribution to bringing order to this situation and combining everything in a single system. That is why we will only accept this if it is all made clearer for taxpayers. We must always know the answer to the question: what brings more European added value? If that is the case, we will give it our full support. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Mr President, there is an error in the Dutch version of the resolution on the Gallo report. I am listed there among the signatories to the resolution by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left as a member of the GUE/NGL Group. In this regard, I would like to say that, firstly, I am not a member of the GUE/NGL Group, I am not a Leftist and I am no Communist. Secondly, I remain a member of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe – a Liberal – and will vote for the ALDE resolution, as will many members of the other groups in this House. Thirdly, I call on the GUE/NGL Group to also vote for the ALDE resolution. (Laughter) Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank Mr Oettinger and congratulate Mr Vidal-Quadras on his report. With the help of the Spanish Presidency, it has been possible to produce a very good document. Natural gas is important and its importance is increasing. In his speech, Mr Turmes said that we must change our perspective on the situation. In the country which I represent, half of all households are dependent on natural gas, but 40% of this comes from Russia. This is why adding legislation to the existing directive is important. It is also the right thing to do. It will give us prevention plans, preventive measures and emergency plans with three crisis levels. We do not want a repeat of the pictures which we saw in the gas crisis winter of 2009. We do not want to see our European partners and Europe’s neighbouring countries freezing. For this reason, this report forms part of our common European responsibility, which covers not just the EU Member States but also the neighbouring countries. Ladies and gentlemen, the legislation is good, but we also need to take other routes. For this reason, I welcome the announcement by Mr Oettinger that all the infrastructure measures, some of which have been mentioned here, including Nabucco, Nord Stream and South Stream, will receive support. This will allow us to diversify and will ensure that we are not dependent on a single supply. What we need is storage facilities. We definitely need more storage. In Germany, we have 70 days’ supply and that is not the case in every country. We must raise the standards in every country in this respect. The other issue is the energy mix. That remains our greatest challenge, which we must work together to overcome. Thank you very much and I hope that the new legislation will be successful. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Mr President, firstly, I would like to express my gratitude to and respect for Mrs Jeggle, who has been working on this report for years. However, Mrs Jeggle, there is one thing that I must say. As Europeans, we cannot take pride in this report. It is too vague and it permits too many things which a country or a continent that plays a leading role in animal welfare throughout the world should not allow. I foresee a worsening of the situation, in particular, as far as the reuse of experimental animals is concerned. Previously, this was more difficult, but I believe that the regulations have now been watered down. You are shaking your head, but it is true that when you look at this carefully, the small print and the nuances in the wording are the things that make the difference. The severity of the tests is also an area where, in many Member States, things are likely to get worse. Some Member States, such as Germany, the United Kingdom and Sweden, had already gone further than this. We have introduced a pain threshold and the Council has watered it down by permitting exceptions. In addition, the power of the Commission has been reduced with regard to inspections. Nevertheless, I will be voting in favour of this report, Mrs Jeggle, because it represents an improvement on the 1986 directive, which is now 24 years old. The authorisation mechanisms are in place. A licence is needed in advance for three stages of testing, which is a good thing. The procedures have been simplified, which is also a positive step. Personally, I am proud of the fact that we have been able to rescue the subject of alternative test methods from the last parliamentary term. However, we will need to provide more funding for this. This directive will have to be revised within the next seven years. It represents quite a good foundation, but in seven years, we will need to improve it so that we can live up to our reputation here in Europe for having the highest levels of animal welfare in the world.

 Providing consumers with information about food is undoubtedly important. However, the debate in Brussels has become a lobbying battle between large companies from the food industry and consumer protection organisations. There was no place in this debate for the reality of everyday life for consumers. The representatives of the German Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament are in favour of a minimum of labelling. Consumers should be able to make their purchasing decisions on the basis of transparent, legible information. Colour coded labelling influences consumers and does not form the basis for transparent information. The so-called guideline daily amounts (GDAs) also have their weak points. Instead of having neutral information about the amounts of nutrients per 100 grams or millilitres printed legibly on packaging, Parliament discussed whether the daily requirements of a 40-year-old woman could be used as the point of reference or whether the colour coding of nutrients was a useful decision-making tool. The proposed, far-reaching, mandatory requirements for the origin labelling of ingredients cannot be implemented in practice. We have also rejected the idea of special national provisions, because the labelling system should, as far as possible, be standardised. For these reasons, we were not able to vote in favour of the proposed report.

 Combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography is vitally important. We must use all our strength to combat the availability of child pornography in communications networks. The permanent and effective control of child abuse is both a political responsibility and a precept of the rule of law.

 Mr President, Commissioner thank you for your statement. I am very grateful for the initiative by the Spanish Presidency – and this is a very Spanish event as far as I can see – in adopting this series of proposals and leading the way in this regard. Electromobility must play a key role in future. However, as we all know, we are still a long way from achieving comprehensive electromobility. For that reason, we should also not make the mistake of allowing electric-car hype to arise, the claims of which we are not able to fulfil in political terms. Therefore, we should not abandon our focus on improving conventional means of locomotion, as crude oil will probably continue to fuel our mobility for a long time yet. The following points are crucial, however. Firstly, as you and all of the other speakers have said, we need a European strategy for the development of standards. The United States and China are working jointly on conductive charge couplers. We must not lag behind in this regard. We ought to lead the way and should not allow European vanity to take hold. Are the French quicker, or the Germans or the Spaniards? We should all pull together and the Commission should certainly take the lead in this. We need to develop cost-effective, high-performance batteries. Secondly, we need to extend network-infrastructure coverage to all areas. For us, that means that we have to focus our subsidy options on this in a more targeted way in the area of cohesion, in the regions and also in the development of rural areas. Citizens must be able to use electromobility across borders, otherwise they will not use this form of transport. Thirdly, we must also take electric cars into account in our CO2
 emissions calculations. Car manufacturers that are currently carrying out fleet calculations cannot yet include electric cars. We need to be able to take these into account in future. Fourthly, we must provide tax relief on electric cars throughout Europe. This applies to batteries in particular, which are still the most expensive part. We need to carry out research in this regard, but we also need to harmonise our taxes. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

Thank you, Mr President, that was very kind. Commissioner Šemeta, the adoption of the reports on the budgetary management of the European bodies and institutions is one of our most important obligations as representatives of the European people – it is our sovereign duty. The question of what Europe has done with taxpayers’ hard earned money is crucial for the acceptance of the European integration project. I would first like to thank all the rapporteurs for their efforts. However, I see light and shadow in the reports. I see light in budgetary management overall. Meanwhile, it is the case that everywhere the EU controls and manages funds itself, it runs things in accordance with the rules. Whether or not it is efficient is another matter altogether. As the European Parliament, we should pay closer attention to the efficiency of policies, political issues and implementation, in particular, with regard to the 2020 agenda. There is shadow in the area of cohesion policy. Eleven per cent of things do not comply with the rules and this percentage is too high. Therefore, it is very important that the EU tries harder to recover funds paid out incorrectly. The Committee on Budgetary Control has therefore adopted an amendment tabled by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. We want 100% of the money back. For 2010, I have the honour of being the rapporteur for the European Commission discharge. Due to the delayed entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, this will be no easy task. We must monitor very closely whether the new responsibilities of individual Commissioners lead to even less transparency and more concealment of responsibilities. We must and will examine this very closely. Allow me to single out two areas: firstly, the so-called non-governmental organisations and secondly, the gentlemen’s agreement. Between 2008 and 2009, the European Union paid NGOs over EUR 300 million in funds. These include honourable organisations like the Deutsche Welthungerhilfe
. However, there are also some that want to destroy the reputation of the European Union, namely Counter Balance, which has attacked the European Investment Bank. This is not acceptable and we must deal with it. We need a register and a definition of such non-governmental organisations, as they receive a lot of tax money. With regard to the gentlemen’s agreement I would like to thank Mr López Garrido. I would like to thank you for coming. I would also like to point to the historical element: questioning and revising the gentlemen’s agreement after 40 years is a huge step. Given the importance of Parliament due to the new Treaty of Lisbon, it is also a necessary step. We must ensure transparency, here and in the Council.

According to the resolution of the European Parliament on the draft general budget for the financial year 2010, adopted on 17 December 2009, a vote was taken today on the amending budget for the European Parliament, following the revised calculations made by the Parliamentary administration. The FDP in the European Parliament abstained, because there was a paragraph in the package of amendments concerned that we could not reconcile with our convictions. The FDP had already expressed its opposition to an increase in the secretarial allowance to EUR 1 500 during the discussions in committee. It is out of the secretarial allowance that MEPs’ assistants are paid. The FDP considers that the argument that more money is needed due to the additional work that MEPs have to do with the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is unsound, as there is nothing in past experience to support this. Certainly, due to the Treaty of Lisbon, which has just come into force, Parliament will overall need extra capacity for legislative work, but with the introduction of the Assistants’ Statute from the beginning of the current parliamentary term, there is still no proof that MEPs actually need more assistants. For this reason, there are grounds for concern that further demands and supplementary increases, or an extension of office capacity, will follow. For this reason, the FDP in the European Parliament abstained. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Mr President, as the head of the delegation, I would like, first of all, to congratulate Mr Thaler on his very balanced report. Skopje has carried out reforms and is on the way to joining the European Union. We welcome this very much and are very pleased about it. The visa liberalisation was perhaps the clearest and most visible sign. It was a milestone in our cooperation. This objective has only been achieved as a result of close collaboration with the EU Member States. It represents openness, interaction and cooperation. However, we must not forget that Macedonia was granted the status of accession candidate four years ago and since then, we have constantly been asking ourselves when it would finally join the European Union. I would like to call on all the parties to ensure that the name conflict, which is currently the focus of attention, is resolved. We must make use of the momentum generated by the Council decision in December and by the new Greek Government. This momentum is diminishing day by day. I would like to explain to the parties that if we concentrate now on other topics, such as the financial crisis, the goal of Macedonia’s accession will be pushed further into the background. We surely do not wish this to happen and this is why we must continue to make every effort in this area. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mr Kallas, Mr Caldeira, I can see both good things and bad things in the presentation of the Court of Auditors’ annual report on the EU budget. First of all, I would like to thank the Court of Auditors for a clearer, bolder and more political report which is easier for us to understand. The good areas include the management of the budget as a whole. In contrast to recent years, this has improved. This is, above all, the result of better management of funds in the area of agriculture and natural resources, which has been our biggest headache over the last few years. For the first time, Mr Caldeira, you do not give an adverse opinion in your report and that is good news. The report highlights the fact that wherever the EU itself controls and administers the funds, there is proper budget management. Whether it is efficient is another matter. I would like to congratulate Mr Kallas warmly in this respect. It is to your credit and during your period of office that this visible improvement has taken place. Congratulations! However, it is now the responsibility of the Member States in particular to improve their control systems. If there is continuing cause for criticism of budgetary management in the EU, this is not at an EU level – as we have now seen – but at the level of the Member States. This is where the problems lie. Cohesion policy, for example, which is implemented by the Member States and which receives around a third of the funds, is the major problem area. You say that 11% is irregular and the non-attached Member said that the figure was EUR 4 billion. That is not correct. It is over EUR 2.5 billion, which you specifically state is taxpayers’ money that should not have been spent. We must say this quite clearly and we must introduce clear controls. However, the consequence is that the European Commission must continue to exert pressure on the Member States and we will support you in this area, Mr Kallas. We must implement a policy of naming and shaming. We must publicly shame the wasteful Member States, which continue to exist, and describe the situation clearly. Overall, you come to the conclusion that the regulations must be simplified. We would like to support you in this and we would like to add one other request. There must be an increased focus not only on regularity but also on efficiency, to ensure that taxpayers’ money is spent correctly. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am speaking as head of the delegation to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and I will be concentrating on this country. I would like to offer my very warm thanks to Mr Rehn for his courage. His report and his green light for this country represent a bold step forward which has generated momentum. At the same time, elections have been held in Greece and there is a new government in Athens, which gives us a situation and a window in which we can achieve something. However, I would like to ask my fellow Members to react calmly. A meeting is being held on Friday between Mr Papandreou and Prime Minister Gruevski, and if we set expectations too high, we may increase the pressure so much that the whole thing falls apart and we do not want to risk that. We must encourage all sides to continue in friendship along the path that has already been taken. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Thaler, for describing this route so accurately. I would also like to wish my friend, Mr Rehn, a successful future in the Commission. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Madam President, thank you very much for the question. I believe that both sides need to change their spots and it is clear that both sides are ready to take a step forward. We are now expecting a lasting solution. For this reason, I expect the name issue to be resolved clearly and definitively in the course of a five-minute discussion. That is not the problem. The application of the name, the so-called scope, is the major issue and both sides obviously need time to resolve it. I would like to see a lasting solution because the alternative is a short-term solution which could lead to disaster. For this reason, all of us must give both sides friendly encouragement to find a long-term solution with a broad scope and a broad application. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner Kallas, first of all, I very much welcome the fact that the Swedish Presidency of the Council is present, and I would also like to personally thank Mrs Malmström for having made the procedure more transparent. Everything that my fellow Members have said is true – the procedure is more transparent, and even if she expressed herself in a somewhat more cautious manner today, we can still say that we will be granting discharge. There is still a very long way to go. We ask the Council to follow this first step with further steps, especially given that the Council’s competences in the field of foreign and security policy have been much more clearly defined under the Treaty of Lisbon. In future, this policy will also have a face, in the shape of Baroness Ashton. The citizens, however, did not previously know Baroness Ashton, and they, the European taxpayers, will still not know, in future, exactly how much money she has at her disposal and what she does with it. We must change this state of affairs. This, indeed, is an absolute must in a time where we are actually fighting for a transparent, democratic Europe. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Søndergaard for having applied pressure in our – Parliament’s – name, and we will maintain that pressure. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,

 Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, today we are debating a motion for resolution on neurodegenerative diseases. The intention is actually for this to become a directive, and so next time, we should also be debating a directive on this subject. The diseases that we are discussing today – Alzheimer’s disease, although Parkinson’s disease is also referred to in the text – are diseases of the brain which constitute a major challenge for Europe. The long-term costs are set to soar and there is still a lot of research to do. Unfortunately, there is a lot of duplicated research and bureaucracy in Europe. Thus, with this motion for a resolution, we want to eliminate the duplicated research, bureaucracy and fragmentation. The Group of the United European Left – Nordic Green Left has tabled a motion for the research results to be made publicly available. I think this motion is a good one. Unfortunately, the wording is wrong, and I would therefore ask for it to be reworded so that it can be incorporated better. Essentially, there is a problem with regard to European patents. It would be good if the Commission, and the Council, too, could take up the subject of European patents in the areas of pharmaceuticals and bio-research and make it clear that we need this. In any case, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports this motion for a resolution. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

Madam President, I'm delighted to be given the opportunity of taking the floor in the first meeting to be chaired by you. I am very pleased, in fact! Most of all, however, I would like to thank Commissioner Špidla for having spoken German, and I would like to express my heartfelt congratulations to Commissioner Kroes. Many people believe that the Opel-Vauxhall case is a German issue. It is not – it is a European issue! It relates to jobs all across Europe, and special treatment here for Germany would not be right. I am therefore particularly pleased to see that the Commission is willing to examine this case. The issues at hand are questions under European law in relation to competition law and State aid. We do want to save every job, but at what price? As counsel for the citizens and taxpayers, it is unclear in the Opel-Magna deal what long-term commitments will be laid at taxpayers’ doors. The Opel case is also questionable from an industrial policy point of view. It is always only the biggest who receive help. The smallest and those in the middle are left to look after themselves, yet they are the backbone of the economy. The fixation on one investor was clearly a wrong move. Better and more favourable offers were turned down early on – and by politicians, in fact. The Opel case has more to do with electioneering than with economic and industrial policy that is pure and above board from the point of view of EU law. To restate the point, it is important the Commission now plays an active role, even if the German Government does not approve. The Opel deal is a sham. That is becoming ever more obvious. It could mark the most expensive election campaign in the history of Germany. We want Opel to survive, we want it to be healthy and we want to fight for every job, but we do not want there to be costs involved, nor do we want a solution at the expense of our European partners, on whom Germany, as the biggest exporter in the world, is also dependent.

Mr President, Commissioner, dear colleagues, thank you for the opportunity to raise the issue of non-preferential rules of origin with you in plenary today. ‘Better late than never’, I feel compelled to say, as we already tabled this question about a year ago. This was at a time when the internal market and the Committee on International Trade were drafting their report on the modernisation of the customs code. Nevertheless it is still important to have this discussion on the proposed introduction of the ‘list rules’, as my colleague already mentioned, for the non-preferential origin of goods, and hear the Commission’s answers to our questions. This is all the more important as business and customs officials fear the rise of new bureaucratic burdens if these rules for the determination of the origin were to be changed. My colleagues from the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection have been working intensively on the recast of the Union Customs Code and adopted their report with a broad majority at the end of last year. The report states very clearly that the current concept for the determination of non-preferential origin of goods should be maintained. This is, and I quote, ‘when they underwent their last substantial economically justified processing or working’. This definition is very clear and has served as a solid basis in international trade for decades, so why change it? The Commission says the introduction of list rules would bring greater legal certainty for the determination of origin and in anti-dumping cases. Well, in my view this is quite a theoretical approach. Practitioners have been complaining that the legal certainty is not improved, and anti-dumping cases only involve 0.7% of all imports into the EU. So I think we should stick to the saying: ‘If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’. From the perspective of international trade, the proposed changes are particularly sensitive. They would have obliged EU importers to comply with the new EU rules instead of applying the domestic laws of origin as is currently the case. We should be very careful with such requests to our trade partners as it would also mean that EU producers would have to apply the multitude of rules of origin of the multitude of destination countries to which we are exporting. Knowing you, Commissioner De Gucht, I think it is not your intention to make trade more complicated for EU producers. So I would like to thank you for being here tonight and I am looking forward to hearing your answers on the questions we have raised. Silvana Koch-Mehrin,

 Madam President, while Russia and the European Union enjoy a very intertwined and intense relationship and today we are not only neighbours, but fortunately we are friends, the Liberals and Democrats also welcome the accession of Russia to the WTO after eighteen years of negotiations. It was high time indeed. I think it is good news for Russia but also for the European Union. Why? Because we can hope for a relationship based on clear rules and clear applicability. If we look at what happened to China after it joined the WTO, we can see that the growth and the success story of China really began with that date a few years ago. So I hope this will happen for Russia as well and that Russia can also envisage an extreme success story after the significant date in August this year. But I would also like to raise two concerns, two challenges. One has already been mentioned by Mr Sefčovič and other colleagues, and that is that Russia does not seem to be willing to live up 100 % to its obligations which come with the accession to the WTO but is instead undertaking some extensive and potentially restrictive trade measures like the examples which have already been mentioned. The second point I would like to make is that we have to look at the business environment in Russia. Russia has always been a very proud nation with a rich culture, with inventions and esprit
; Nobel Prize winners and astronauts have come from Russia. We all know about these important landmarks in Russian history. But why is it that today – apart from maybe vodka, caviar and Gazprom – we do not really know of any Russian brands? Why is it that they do not really thrive? Why are there not Russian success stories? I think this has to do with the applicability of the rule of law and human rights, and I think it is good that it has been raised in our resolution. It comes in a timely manner, because next week we go to Moscow and can discuss it there. Silvana Koch-Mehrin,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, every aspect of European trade policy has changed. The policy has a completely new legal basis and it is particularly obvious that the new Treaty has had major consequences for the European Parliament. The subject we are currently discussing concerns what at first sight are technical questions and these involve complex concepts, such as the introduction of delegated acts and the adoption of implementing provisions. However, behind these concepts lie tangible trade policy interests. We only need to think of the time limits for anti-dumping procedures or for the regulations on anti-subsidy instruments. In these cases, time really is money. The new requirements for transparency in the case of non-confidential information are also of great interest to the general public. Ms Quisthoudt-Rowohl has already mentioned the subject of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). If we had had more transparency in this area right from the beginning, who knows how many of the discussions could have been avoided. I think that at this point, I simply need to give my thanks to the rapporteur, who has guided us confidently through this subject and has managed the cooperation with her fellow Members very well. I hope that we will very soon reach a conclusion in this area. Silvana Koch-Mehrin  (ALDE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, who in Europe is still talking about votes for women? The answer is that nobody is nowadays, as we take women’s right to vote for granted. How was that situation brought about? It was done through legislation, through compulsion, in other words. I therefore think it is important that we should also introduce gender quotas today through legislation. The result would be that we would not have to talk about it any more, as it would be just as self-evident as women’s right to vote. Voluntary self-imposed obligations either do not work or are not even entered into, and this applies just as much to the economy as to politics. In a representative democracy such as Europe, the majority of the population, which is to say women, must actually be represented accordingly in politics. Yet the reality in the parliaments and in the parties is something quite different. When it comes to the economy, numerous studies have shown that an equal distribution of women and men in executive positions considerably improves the economic success of a company. Moreover, it is also the case that the decision on whether or not to buy something is taken by women for nearly every product. As a liberal, I stand for competition, and I stand for a free and fair market economy. However, both of these only work when basic conditions are in place that permit that very freedom and fairness. Those conditions are not in place for women when it comes to executive positions. I therefore look forward, Ms Reding, to the proposals that you will be bringing forward in May on the participation of more women in executive positions. It is, I would say, high time for that to happen. Silvana Koch-Mehrin,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Petitions

 Mr President, in the Committee on Petitions we are concerned with ensuring that the European Ombudsman receives adequate funding. The office of the European Ombudsman is an important European body. It provides assistance to citizens and resolves problems and errors in the institutions. It also brings the EU closer to its citizens. In the 2012 budget there is very moderate increase of 0.47% for the European Ombudsman. For example, no new posts have been requested and no new employees will be appointed. Nevertheless, the Council wanted to make some cuts. Therefore, I would like to thank the Committee on Budgets for reversing these cuts and I hope that we can confirm the committee’s position today. This would send out a signal that the EU needs to move closer to its citizens. Silvana Koch-Mehrin,

 Madam President, this is certainly an important subject; we are all aware of that. Before the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, the national parliaments were constantly complaining that 80% of the laws they passed were actually decided by Europe; that they were simply rubber-stamping it as a kind of agent of the EU. The Treaty of Lisbon has changed that. The national parliaments play a leading role and can exert an influence. The Treaty of Lisbon has made the EU more democratic because it has given greater power to the representatives of the people. This applies to the European Parliament just as much as to the national parliaments. The national parliaments then continued to complain nonetheless; this time, about the increased workload, the mountains of documents constantly landing on their desks with just a few weeks for them to respond. The important thing, however, is that the representatives of the people in Europe’s capitals now have a means of exerting influence over the European Union’s initiatives – and I get the impression that the national parliaments are increasingly realising this and making use of it. Almost two years have now passed since the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force on 1 December 2009, when these procedures also took effect. I and a few of my fellow Members therefore felt that the time was right to ask how the Commission sees the situation now. Is it satisfied with the quality of the response from the national parliaments? How does the Commission deal with this? Does it have sufficient resources – including human resources – to deal with it? Moreover, in some Member States, the regions are important, such as the Bundesländer
 in the case of Germany. How is input from this political level dealt with? Does it have sufficient resonance? Is there also adequate cooperation with the Committee of the Regions? These are the questions put jointly by Andrew Duff, Alexandra Thein, Michael Theurer and myself. I look forward to hearing your answer. President.

 In the vote on the Lange report, I am abstaining on paragraph 31 because of the ambiguous wording of the vote, which refers to Eurobonds as well as project bonds. However, taking it as a whole, I am voting for the report, as I have nothing against project bonds in themselves. Project bonds serve as finance for extensive innovation, infrastructure and reindustrialisation projects. This is not a question of instruments for the communitarisation of debts, as would be the case with Eurobonds. Silvana Koch-Mehrin,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the equality of all human beings is enshrined in the first two articles of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This states: ‘All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood’. What a wonderful sentence. However, even one hundred years after the first International Women’s Day, we still have not achieved this: there is still no sign of true equality between men and women. Granted, we have achieved at great deal in Europe. Today, our primary concern is no longer the legal freedom of women. We have largely achieved this freedom. I would like to express my gratitude to the feminists, both male and female, for their work in the past. Today, our main concern is freedom in action, that men should take ownership of the issue of the compatibility of work and family life, and that seeing women at the top in business or politics is something that should become commonplace. It is fantastic to see how the liberation movements in North Africa look to us, the women of Europe. They look to us to play a pioneering role. It is vitally important that we do not lose sight of our goal: the freedom to live our lives according to our own conceptions. That is when equality will become something we take for granted and when International Women’s Day will be transformed from a day of remembrance to a day to celebrate freedom. President.

Madam President, Mr Oettinger, it is good that you have commissioned the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks to look at this issue again. I am pleased about this. However, the question remains: How can we explain to the citizens of Europe that they have to allow something into their houses under EU regulations which represents a health hazard for their children? You have children and you know how it is. Things often get broken. Mr Leichtfried from Austria and I are very concerned about this. How can we make it clear that this is something dangerous? We do not seem to be able to learn from past mistakes. However, you were not responsible for the original decision, so you can show a willingness to learn without losing face. You could have said that we will withdraw this ban, at least for private households. Would you be prepared to reconsider your decision? President.

 Mr President, competition policy is one of the most important, central policy areas of the EU. Good competition policy enables markets to function properly. Good competition policy also allows consumers to benefit from a wide variety of products at reasonable and affordable prices. Good competition policy also contributes to creating growth again in Europe. That is why it is so important, Commissioner, to include all the areas that you have mentioned in competition policy. It is also important to strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises, as they are the driving force behind growth in Europe. Market barriers must be abolished, which also means doing away with the excessive costs that still pertain where competition is not working, such as roaming charges on mobile phones, where competition still does not exist – something that needs to be changed. Finally, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Eppink, for his excellent work, and to the Commission I would say: be ambitious in your goals. (Applause) President.

 Combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography is vitally important. We must use all our strength to combat the availability of child pornography in communications networks. The permanent and effective control of child abuse is both a political responsibility and a precept of the rule of law. The German Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament is of the opinion that it is necessary to remove such criminal content as quickly as possible. President.

– As far as the list of speakers is concerned, the cause is being looked into. President.  
– Mr Ouzký, many thanks once again for bringing this to our attention. We have looked into it. It was a problem in the allocation caused by the computer system. You will thus be listed in the minutes as the speaker for your group. I hope that this resolves the issue. Thank you for pointing it out. President.

 Supplementary questions using the blue card are not permitted during the one-minute speeches. Thus, it was not a point of order. Your fellow Member could perhaps answer your question on a one-to-one basis, but in any case not during the plenary debate. President. - 
 Thank you very much. As you can imagine, as President of the High Level Group on Gender Equality and Diversity, equality is very important to me. We have a list of speakers and we did try to make it balanced. Who gets the opportunity to speak during the debate is, of course, also dependent on who is actually present. That concludes this item.

– Blue card questions on a personal comment under Rule 151 are not permitted. Your request to speak on this point therefore cannot be accepted. President.  
– Many thanks. We will now continue with the debate. I allowed the personal explanation because the previous point of order referred directly to Mr Martin. We will now go on with the debate and also devote our full attention to it. President.

– The next item is the one-minute speeches in accordance with Rule 150. Rule 150 states that we may spend a maximum of 30 minutes on this item. We had more than 74 requests to speak under this item. That will clearly not be possible. Thirty minutes and 74 speakers for one minute will simply not work. Therefore, we have, for the first time, selected in advance the Members who will be granted speaking time using clear criteria, namely that those who requested speaking time in another debate with one-minute speeches but did not get chance to speak will now be granted speaking time where possible, whereas those who have already spoken in other debates will not be granted any speaking time. All of those who have not been granted speaking time were informed of this in advance by e-mail. Therefore, they do not need to be here to wait in vain for their speaking time. I hope that you understand that. This was the only possible way to enable the debate to proceed in an orderly manner. Therefore, those who have been granted speaking time can now begin straight away. President.  
– That concludes this item. Thank you all for your understanding and for the disciplined proceedings. I hope that all of those who did not have an opportunity to speak this time will get the chance to do so next time. President.

According to the resolution of the European Parliament on the draft general budget for the financial year 2010, adopted on 17 December 2009, a vote was taken today on the amending budget for the European Parliament, following the revised calculations made by the Parliamentary administration. The FDP in the European Parliament abstained, because there was a paragraph in the package of amendments concerned that we could not reconcile with our convictions. The FDP had already expressed its opposition to an increase in the secretarial allowance to EUR 1 500 during the discussions in committee. It is out of the secretarial allowance that MEPs’ assistants are paid. The FDP considers that the argument that more money is needed due to the additional work that MEPs have to do with the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is unsound, as there is nothing in past experience to support this. Certainly, due to the Treaty of Lisbon, which has just come into force, Parliament will overall need extra capacity for legislative work, but with the introduction of the Assistants’ Statute from the beginning of the current parliamentary term, there is still no proof that MEPs actually need more assistants. For this reason, there are grounds for concern that further demands and supplementary increases, or an extension of office capacity, will follow. For this reason, the FDP in the European Parliament abstained. President.

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Spain is now taking on the Presidency of the European Union for the fourth time. You know what it is to cooperate with the European Parliament in a very wide range of situations. We now have the Treaty of Lisbon, which means that the European Parliament is now your key contact partner. In your programme, you say that you want the EU to take root in the will of those who render it legitimate, namely European citizens. That is a very ambitious aim. The path to achieving it can only be found via the representatives of European citizens, in other words the parliaments. I am therefore very pleased to hear you say that cooperation between the national parliaments, the parliaments of the EU Member States, and the European Parliament is the cornerstone of such a path. You want to bring the parliaments closer together in order to bring citizens closer together. That is a good thing. You have a great responsibility in this regard, as you are the first Presidency following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. Other Presidencies will use you as an example. You are therefore creating the blueprint, so to speak. I would like subsequent presidencies to have to measure themselves against you where cooperation structures are concerned. I wish you much success! Silvana Koch-Mehrin  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Reinfeldt, your calm and steady Presidency was a success. You had difficult political issues to resolve and overall you did a good job. The people chosen by you for the important new EU posts can now define these without any preconceived ideas, as they are as yet largely unknown to most European citizens. As an aside, if I may say so, your best decision is sitting on your right. Nevertheless, Mr Reinfeldt, I cannot give your Presidency full marks. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, you increased the development towards making the European Council into a kind of EU ‘supergovernment’. Its comprehensive jurisdiction is increasing, from the environment to financial policy. At the same time, you are closing the doors ever tighter. This is not what transparent debates by representatives of the people look like. The second reason is this: the fact that you pushed SWIFT through the Council just hours before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon demonstrates a clear disregard for the European Parliament and hence a lack of respect for the citizens. Nevertheless, I would like to thank you for the last six months. President.

 Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would also like to thank our colleague Ms Thyssen for her extremely detailed and largely balanced report. We have known for some time that the euro area can only be successful in the long term if it achieves greater integration and actually becomes a genuine economic, financial and monetary union. What that means in detail and what measures need to be taken emerge from the report put forward by Mr Rompuy this summer. This report was drawn up by four Presidents. There is one President missing, however, namely President Martin Schulz, the representative of our House. To me this demonstrates the little esteem in which our House is actually held by the Council. This is also made clear by the fact that the Council is now trying to rush through a very important issue, namely the introduction of a powerful supervisory mechanism for the banking sector at the European Central Bank, with Parliament once again having been assigned nothing more than a role on the sidelines. I do not consider this to be compatible with the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon and I believe that the Council’s ‘sink or swim’ policy towards Parliament is doomed to failure in the long term.

 Mr President, … am not satisfied with the collaboration between Parliament and the Council on this point. The Crisis Committee’s proposals, some of which the Council is now taking up, were hardly commented on by the Council in any way at the time the report was presented, let alone adopted. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

Mr President, Commissioner, two years ago the European Parliament came to the conclusion that the European internal market for financial services also needs European supervision and it proposed establishing this supervision with, but not in, the European Central Bank, so as not to put the Bank’s independence at risk. The Commission now suggests establishing such supervision within the ECB and first focusing its work on the financial institutions of the euro area. The European internal market for financial service providers involves more than just the euro area, however. For this reason I believe it is crucial for us to act as quickly as possible to place not only the financial institutions of the euro area under this supervision, but also the entire European Union. The first step should be at least to place all the countries that have committed themselves to introducing the euro, in other words all countries except Denmark and the United Kingdom, under this supervision. It is important that this supervision should not become a bureaucratic monster. That is why it is crucial that the share-out of tasks between the ECB and the national supervisory bodies should be clarified quickly. It is also necessary to clarify the share-out of tasks between the ECB and the European Banking Authority (EBA). Democratic legitimation has been mentioned more than once here. The key is that the accountability of this supervision is assured without putting the independence of the bank at risk. One more point: the project must be implemented in such a way that citizens have no reason to be even more Eurosceptic. Be careful in your use of national rescue, resolution and deposit guarantee funds. Our citizens see this as their money and want it to be used in their own countries. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have a massive crisis of confidence, and therefore expectations of the last summit were relatively high. The summit was scarcely any different from earlier summits, with one exception: seldom have the negotiating tactics – which sometimes bordered on blackmail – and the differences between the negotiating partners been played out so clearly to the outside world as this time. In the end, agreement was reached on Friday morning. However, it turns out that, when it comes down to it, the consensus reached was only a formal compromise, which was then called into question again just 72 hours after being reached. The Dutch and the Finns have already announced that they do not support the buying of government bonds on the secondary market. The markets, which had, until then, reacted positively, are now also beginning to question and smear the result. I expressly welcome the fact that it was decided at the summit to get serious about creating a real banking union. If we have a common economic area and currency area, then we also need a genuine functioning internal market for financial services. Naturally, that includes bank supervision, but it also includes a banking resolution and rescue fund, and ultimately it also includes a deposit guarantee system. All that will take time, and I hope that the European Parliament will be adequately taken into consideration at least in the first step, the construction of supervision at the European Central Bank, and things will not continue as they have done recently. This summit was definitely not the great breakthrough. It was not a great act of liberation. The citizens are just as uncertain as before, and I fear that we will continue to muddle along. I can only hope that we have enough time in which to find the ultimate solution. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 The German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament has spoken out clearly in favour of the introduction of a debt redemption fund. However, participation in such a fund must be associated with clear and strict rules, such as were contained in the proposal made by the German Council of Economic Experts to the German Government in autumn 2011. Watering down the criteria for participation is neither productive nor effective. Linking the introduction of a debt redemption fund with the eurobonds project and the treatment of economic imbalances is unfair, and is rejected by the FDP in the European Parliament in the strongest possible terms. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis goes on. The measures adopted in recent months, or even years, have failed to convince the markets on a durable basis. There is an urgent need for the Member States to take seriously a disciplined, balanced budgetary policy. The ‘two-pack’ can help to make progress in that direction. It can provide the basis for stability and growth. However, a whole series of amendments are once again being tabled, with the aim of watering down the proposals. We do not need a watered-down ‘two-pack’, however. What we do require is a genuine act of release. This act of release could consist of two elements. The first element would be the debt redemption fund already mentioned by a number of speakers, which would help to consolidate the inherited debts and spread them out over a period of 25 years. The second element would be that we have to achieve real progress in the conversion of the euro area into a true internal financial market, in other words, into an internal market with cross-border banking supervision, a cross-border deposit guarantee fund and a uniform cross-border banking rescue and resolution regime. Wolf Klinz,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, all products and services are taxed, so one might well ask why financial transactions should not be taxed also. I can therefore fully understand the idea behind taxing such transactions. The financial sector has, after all, caused considerable damage in recent years, and is not exactly without blame for the difficult situation that we currently find ourselves in, particularly in Europe. The speculative losses of JPMorgan Chase that recently came to light bear witness once again to the fact that the financial industry really has not yet learnt from past mistakes. It seems that the greed of some players has still not been assuaged. The Commission has tabled a very creative proposal, and the residence principle that it has proposed has been supplemented by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs with the issuance and the ownership principles. Together, these should actually ensure that the risk of financial transactions being shifted out of the EU to other regions of the world can be relatively well averted. Nonetheless, naturally, there are still issues outstanding. Unlike the Commissioner, I feel that we should, in fact, exempt pension funds, because I do not see why savers who are putting aside money for their old age should be penalised. Moreover, there are naturally a few questions regarding the practical implementation of how the tax is levied that have yet to be clarified, and last but not least, how the revenue is actually going to be used. What will go to the EU and what will go to the Member States? In our approach to resolving this, there are two things that we should not lose sight of. Firstly, we must not weaken Europe. Secondly, we must ensure that we do not fragment Europe further. We have to achieve the exact opposite – not fragmentation, but as much progress as possible on the harmonisation of our taxes. A global introduction of the tax is not feasible at present; we know that. Regrettably, we cannot introduce it EU-wide either. It appears that the British veto cannot be broken. The rapporteur’s suggestion that we proceed now by means of enhanced cooperation does not seem to me to be sufficient. If we were to push ahead with only nine or ten Member States, we would actually be contributing to further fragmentation in Europe. That is not what we want. That is why I feel that as a minimum, we must have all 17 euro area members plus a couple more on board. We therefore have to look for alternatives that would enable all countries to participate. I feel that we could even take the UK’s stamp duty as a starting point, and then of course expand it and include not just shares, but also bonds, derivatives and professional dealers. If we content ourselves with the current proposal and the mechanism of enhanced cooperation, then I believe we will be going down the wrong route.

 I did, in fact, say that the matter of how the resources will be used has not yet been finally decided. How much will go to Brussels and how much will remain with the Member States is still a matter of debate. Even among the Member States, it has not yet been settled which Member State would receive the funds. Once we have fundamentally settled this issue and know how much is going to the EU budget in Brussels, then we can think about the question that you have raised. At the moment, it would be purely speculation. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I subscribe to your opinion that the highly indebted countries will only be able to extract themselves from their predicament through a combination of growth and austerity. Some of what you propose – such as European Investment Bank (EIB) financed infrastructure projects – could indeed make them more competitive and thus contribute to growth. However, much of what you say reminds me of what Christine Lagarde of the International Monetary Fund is proposing – namely, taking on more debt in order to stimulate growth. At the end of the day, such additional financial injections would be just a flash in the pan, and there would be nothing to show for it afterwards other than even higher levels of debt, even higher unemployment and even higher inflation. We experienced that in Germany in the 1970s, when Helmut Schmidt tried precisely that. What we are dealing with is not a cyclical problem, but rather a structural weakness. If we are to overcome it, we need courageous structural reforms. Unfortunately, we are seeing little of that in the countries concerned. We need to complete the internal market, including the services sector. We need to open up protected markets, we need to make the labour market more flexible and we need to get rid of red tape. All that can happen without taking any more money, and it would still lead to growth. Wolf Klinz,

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of February, I had the opportunity to travel with several Members of this House to Burma, or Myanmar, as it now calls itself. To me, it was like a small miracle when President Thein Sein, a former member of the military junta, gave us a relatively credible explanation of his desire for reform. The critical test came at the beginning of this month, when the by-elections took place. It was very impressive to see how the opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who previously had to operate in secret, achieved an overwhelming victory, despite the fact that obstacles were occasionally placed in the way of her election campaign. However, one thing must be clear to us. Her party, the National League for Democracy, is still a very small party. It currently has only just over 40 seats. Therefore, the way in which it develops over the next few weeks, months and years will be decisive. The crucial landmark will be the 2015 elections. This is when it will become clear whether the citizens of Burma really have the opportunity to elect their members of parliament and their government freely, fairly and without outside influence. Until then, the reform process must continue at a rapid pace. It is essential that those who are currently in power make genuine progress and go on with the work that they have started. They must release the remaining political prisoners, as Mr Belet has already said. They must come to a ceasefire in the feuds that they are having with different ethnic groups and ultimately bring about peace. They must offer their citizens full democratic rights, such as freedom of expression in speech and writing, including on the Internet, in schools and in universities. They must ensure that there is a free and independent press and an independent judicial system. They must begin the systematic process of establishing the structures of a social market economy. We, together with our private sector, can and must help them to achieve this. As Burma introduces more democracy and freedom for its people, so the West can reduce its sanctions or even lift them altogether. It is in all our interests for Burma to free itself from China’s embrace and to overcome the mass poverty among its citizens. Wolf Klinz,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when the Lehman Brothers Bank in New York collapsed in March 2008, the global financial crisis reached its first high point. For small-scale savers and depositors, this crisis began a year earlier, when Northern Rock in the United Kingdom ran into difficulties and long queues of depositors suddenly began to form outside bank buildings, with customers waiting to withdraw their money. This was not just limited to Northern Rock, but was also evident in other banks too. The uncertainty among savers, in particular small-scale depositors, was enormous, which was why national governments found themselves forced to guarantee investments above the contractually guaranteed minimum level. Some states, like Germany and Ireland, actually guaranteed deposits to an unlimited extent, something that could not be sustained in the long term. The divergence between the deposit guarantee schemes in Europe came at a price at the time. That is why the Commission rightly said that we must ensure order and we must present a uniform deposit guarantee scheme for all 27 Member States of the European Union. It did this in an extremely convincing and acceptable way. The gaps were closed, depositor security was strengthened and a broad degree of harmonisation was established. As representatives of Parliament, we support this proposal. We had thought that we could have tabled one or two improvements. Unfortunately, as Mr Balz has already explained, our negotiations with the Council have been unsuccessful to date. Nonetheless, we are not giving up hope, but believe that we may still succeed in the coming months. The following is an important point, however: a deposit guarantee scheme protects depositors and is therefore necessary. However, it is even more important that it should not run out of money. Even more important again is that insolvency, or even difficulty, should be avoided, and that we should have preventive measures in place. That is why we urgently await the Commission’s presentation of the crisis and process management dossier. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union stands at an absolutely crucial crossroads. We need to deepen integration, especially in the fields of financial and economic policy. We need a strong Commissioner who combines the functions that are currently spread between the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Euro, the President of the Euro Group, a different Finance Minister every six months and the regent of economics Herman Van Rompuy into a single role and who represents the EU and the euro area to the outside world. If that does not succeed, we will not even be able to defend the status quo
, we will then inevitably find ourselves in a disintegration phase. We do not want a union of debt. We need a union of stability, and that is why the solution does not consist of issuing Eurobonds. Only today, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) had to pay 200 basis points more for its bond issues than Germany. The situation is getting worse – the bonds already issued are quoted far below face value. We need to attempt to also raise reserves that we still have in every Member State. The whole issue of the subsidies must be approached. In my country alone this is certainly a high two-digit, maybe even a three-digit, figure in billions that thus can be adjusted in the budget, with the effect of raising taxes. Mr Trichet hit the nail on the head today when he said that time is of the essence. The reality is that we must act fast or else the markets will continue to set the course for politics.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis was established in autumn 2009, many observers commented that it was too late. It should have been launched a year earlier and the crisis was almost over, they said. Today, we find ourselves not in the first or second year following the crisis, but rather in the fourth year of the crisis. The problem is still ongoing. Fukushima has shown that, one day, everything that can possibly go wrong will go wrong. It was a similar story with the global financial crisis. Numerous negative factors coincided and, if it were not for the decisive action by the European Union and the USA, things might have hit a new low, leading to economic melt-down and a repeat of the great depression of the last century. Happily, this has been avoided. However, we now have the so-called debt crisis or the euro crisis in Europe. We have been in the grip of this problem for eighteen months now. I get the impression that Europe’s decision makers have not been providing active leadership for the last year-and-a-half. They react to market distortions and turbulences in the market, but they do not act with foresight on the basis of a clear vision of where they want to take Europe. That is what is missing. There is a lack of vision, and our citizens have the impression that it is business as usual for those who caused the crisis: profits are privatised, losses are socialised and the actual issues are side-stepped. That is where our report has its starting point. It makes proposals for the overall direction of the future development of the European Union and the euro area. Mrs Berès explained these proposals in detail and Mr Karas also discussed them. I do not need to go into further detail at this point. There is one important point to note, however, which is that Europe has reached an extremely critical turning point. If we do not choose the right path now, we will not even be able to maintain the status quo of the integration already achieved, and will instead find ourselves taking a step backwards. It is important that all of us who believe in Europe and who want to shape Europe’s future should support these ideas, addressing our citizens and the representatives of the national parliaments and trying to win them over to our cause.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we do not know precisely what role short selling or naked short selling played in the bankruptcies of Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers, but we do know that they made at least a substantial contribution to the collapse of these institutions. Claiming that naked short selling is useful for the market is as hard to prove as saying that it will be the end of the world if we do not prohibit it. We are dealing here with a highly complex, extremely technical area and I would not dare to claim that one thing or another was definitely right. However, it seems to me absurd to want to sell something that you do not even have, and moreover to want to do this on a speculative basis. It goes against my basic understanding of how one should behave in business. If I do not have the title to something then it is difficult for me to offer it for sale. Whether this is genuinely useful for the market is something that I am not in a position to judge. Perhaps it is – but my instinct suggests it is not. I would therefore suggest that we should deal with it by saying that shares, debt instruments and credit default swaps (CDSs) can only be offered for sale if you either hold the title or – if you do not hold the title – a loan agreement has been concluded or at least an agreement that says that the title will be available the next day or in a certain number of days’ time if the transaction is actually concluded and settled, so that no risk arises. I thought that the Council and Parliament had already agreed on this when they agreed the intraday rule. I regret to say that the Council has since moved away from this position, and I hope that it may find its way back to it. One thing is certain: in the final event, these are international transactions and it is therefore important for us to have very clear supervisory rules. It seems to me that the recently established European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) is the ideal institution to have a sole mandate to intervene in serious cases and to establish what needs to be prohibited, what needs at least to be recorded, where we need a repository, where we need a reporting requirement and so on. In this respect we have an ideal opportunity to use ESMA productively. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for a long time we believed that the internal market and the introduction of a common currency would automatically result in economic convergence and convergence of the Member States, and that the Maastricht criteria were sufficient to ensure discipline. Reality has now caught up with us. The management instruments have proved to be inadequate and in the past they have been grossly transgressed. A single currency and a single monetary policy are not feasible in the long term unless the rules have teeth in the area of fiscal, budgetary, economic and social policy. The EU is now trying a new approach. To speak metaphorically, it has one last shot. If this last shot fails to hit the target, the damage could be severe. The EU could find itself in a regressive phase, we could see the return of renationalisation and protectionism, and the first signs of disintegration in the euro area. The new package attempts to prevent this and to lay a new foundation. I am in favour of this package, even though I consider it rather half-hearted in view of the problems that I have just outlined. There is a risk that the European semester will turn out to be a centralist, bureaucratic exercise. The pact for the euro may possibly be toothless. What we need are binding recommendations from the Commission. What we need are automatic initiatives and sanctions which the Council can only stop by means of reversed qualified majority voting. This is undoubtedly necessary if the disgraceful, opaque wrangles by Council members in back rooms are finally to be brought to an end. What we urgently need is a clear resolution mechanism for the financial sector so that it can work again. Wolf Klinz,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, credit rating agencies certainly did not cause the global financial crisis, but, in my opinion, they were responsible to a significant extent for its severity. When the so-called structured financial products were developed in America on the basis of the subprime mortgages, the credit rating agencies supported this process by rating dozens, if not hundreds, of products each day in an almost conveyor-belt fashion. In so doing, they also accepted conflicts of interests, in that they supported the issuers with advice and help in designing these products. They continued to claim that they were only expressing an opinion, although they knew very well that their ratings were, in fact, being used as a seal of approval. My report deals with numerous deficiencies and puts forward proposals in the hope that the Commission will perhaps be able to include some of them in its legislative proposal that it will be tabling in the autumn. I put forward five proposals. The first is that the reliance on ratings must be reduced. In practice, we have found that the regulatory environment has led to the use of ratings being absolutely essential, by banks, insurance companies, pension funds etc. which invest their money. Basel II made this very clear and, in fact, the credit rating agencies have become regulatory certification bodies. We need to make it possible once again for market operators, particularly institutional investors, which possess their own expertise to actually take responsibility themselves and not outsource the responsibility for investment decisions. It needs to be made clear that investors should only invest if they actually understand the product and cannot use the excuse that they can, to a certain extent, automatically make a triple A product the goal of their investment strategy. Secondly, we must ensure that the information on which credit rating agencies base their decisions is made publicly available, that it is understood, and that the models used are also known. That will lead to transparency and will also make it easier for institutional investors seeking to invest to make their own decisions. It will also help to enable unsolicited ratings to be given. In this connection, we should also consider whether the proposal that the United States is considering is a sensible one, namely, that where only one credit rating agency is chosen by issuers, a second, independent body could be encouraged to give a rating and this second body could be allowed to work on the basis of the information that is publicly available. Thirdly, we need more competition. We have a de facto oligopoly. The three credit rating agencies that exist and operate worldwide control 95% of the global business. They have a so-called monopoly income of 40% return on turnover, and therefore I am proposing that we set up a European credit rating agency. It should be based on a foundation model and the start-up financing should be provided by the finance sector by means of interest-bearing loans. After five years, we will know whether it is working and then this credit rating foundation will also have to pay back the funds that it has received. However, I am sure that there are also other options. It would also make sense to perhaps allow national and regional credit rating agencies to operate in the form of a European network. Fourthly, we still have an outstanding matter with regard to the payment model. Currently, we have an issuer-pays model. That is the model that essentially works throughout the world. Thus, the issuer pays, but clearly there is a conflict of interests here that we could reduce if there was no more advising of issuers and if the staff of the supervisory bodies was genuinely independent. Other possible models include a subscriber-pays model. Here, there is obviously the risk of conflicts of interest as well as of this being an invitation to freeloaders. Therefore, this needs consideration. The third option would be a performance-based payment, in other words, an up-front payment and then the final payment only once it is clear how good the rating is. The last, but important, point is that we must introduce liability. Credit rating agencies must accept responsibility for what they actually do, and therefore I believe that we should make them liable, obviously not for the rating as such, but for failures and negligence in their work. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

Madam President, Mr Barroso, Mr Van Rompuy, listening to you carefully one gets the impression that everything is ship-shape: the euro is secure, we have a new Stability and Growth Pact, we have an ESM and we have a Euro Plus Pact. I would say this quite clearly: ‘While I have heard the message, I am not sure I believe it.’ We should not lose sight of the starting point for all these deliberations and measures, namely the run-away debt of some euro Member States, the loss of competitiveness, economic distortions and, as a consequence, an increasing current account deficit that has to be financed. It is already obvious that many Member States will not be able to meet the conditions of the new Stability and Growth Pact with the best will in the world. The ESM will not help to overcome economic distortions because no one has seriously faced up to the idea that a euro Member State could become insolvent and because the prospect of financial aid from the ESM will lead to further laxity. The so-called stringent regulations will prove to be relatively lightweight in practice. The need for unanimous resolutions is resulting in the horse-trading that was a familiar fixture in the past. Finally, the pact for the euro is much too non-committal to cause destitute countries to implement far-reaching real economic reforms. Overall, therefore, I fear that we will not succeed in eliminating the root cause of the problem. We shall have a permanent overdraft facility whose credit parameters will have to be increased at regular intervals. This will turn into a bottomless pit and the citizens in the states that will have to foot the bill will find themselves duped once again. Public confidence in Europe will decline even further as a result. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 – (DE) 
Madam President, Mr Schulz is right. We are in the midst of a huge crisis of confidence and the members of the Council are pulling the wool over the citizens’ eyes. They are telling them that everything is under control, we just need to make small changes to the treaty by introducing a permanent stability mechanism and then the problem will be resolved. In fact, the situation is not under control. The Member States are reacting rather than actually taking action. They are desperately firefighting, but they cannot put out the flames. The markets are asking themselves: Who is actually in control in Europe and in the euro area? The EU has reached a critical turning point. If we do not choose the right path now, we will not even be able to maintain the status quo. Instead we will take a step backwards. What we need are further moves towards integration. We need more Europe. We must finish establishing the internal market, including the service sector. Alongside the monetary union, we need an economic, budgetary and fiscal union. We also need a strong Commission which has the right and the power to control and monitor this economic union and to impose sanctions automatically, in cases where this is justified. If we take these steps towards more integration, then we can talk about the introduction of eurobonds. Then we will have laid the foundations for them. However, during all of this we must ensure that we have the long-term investment funding that we need, despite all of the justifiable austerity measures, to secure the European Union’s competitive ability in the medium and long term. We must finally tell the citizens the truth. We need solutions without blinkers, we must discuss the issues without bringing in ideologies and we must stop trying to muddle through. What we require is action for the long term, rather than short-term reactions. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in a few weeks’ time, we will have a new supervisory structure in Europe, which has been shaped to a considerable extent by the European Parliament. Among these three new supervisory authorities will be one that is responsible for markets and securities: the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). ESMA will have the last word in connection with the registration and oversight of credit rating agencies and be responsible for ensuring that the credit rating agencies actually comply with the new regulations. If it so wishes, ESMA can delegate this cross-border responsibility to national supervisory authorities if these supervisory authorities are small and only operate nationally. This proposal is therefore nothing more than an adaptation of the regulation of April 2009 to the new circumstances, but it strengthens the role of ESMA. It gives the new supervisory authority more powers and – something that is completely new – it gives ESMA the power to punish non-application of the regulation. I very much welcome this, because I believe that strengthening the position of a new supervisory authority of European mould will genuinely increase its credibility on the market. I just have one point of criticism. When drawing up the regulation in April 2009, we took a political decision with regard to how we should deal with ratings from third countries in Europe. We said at that time that they can be used in Europe if they either comply with the equivalence procedure or are supported by a credit rating agency that is registered and approved in Europe, the so-called endorsement procedure. The Commission has now changed this at level 2 and said that endorsement will no longer be possible. Therefore, only the equivalence procedure actually applies. I consider this – as it was undertaken unilaterally – to be an undemocratic way of going about things, and I believe that we should stick to the decision that we made at the time in April 2009. As the Commissioner also mentioned, there are still a lot of outstanding issues where credit rating agencies are concerned, namely, the lack of competition, insufficient transparency, the business model as to whether the issuer or the investor should pay, which need to be looked at critically. There are questions with regard to the payment system and also with regard to excessive dependency, because in reality, it is the case that, as a result of regulatory provisions, many ratings agencies have become de facto regulatory certification authorities. I am taking this up in the own-initiative report, and I am pleased that the Commission is going to table a legislative proposal on this matter in the next year. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 Madam President, Mr Almunia, we need to bite the bullet now, rather than prolonging the agony. This is what comes to mind when I think about the subject that we are discussing today. I support the Commission proposal to phase out State aid in 2014 for the pits which are not competitive by that date. The cost of each job in the coal mining industry is much higher than the average. This money is not being spent on developing sustainable and competitive employment for the future. Therefore, I believe it is right to phase out state subsidies for uncompetitive mines in 2014. We must invest the money which becomes available in research and development and in education and training. This is the only way in which we can maintain our technological head start and remain competitive in the global economy as a whole. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

Madam President, Mr Trichet, we all know that the main task of the European Central Bank is to ensure monetary stability and that you can best achieve this aim by being politically independent. We have always supported you in this. The crises of the last two years have shown that you have a further task, and that is to ensure the stability of the financial markets and of the financial system. This task, too, you have performed very professionally and convincingly. However, to do so, you have had to accept being yoked together with the governments concerned. In other words, you were not able to act with complete political independence here; instead, you had to work together with the governments. I would be interested to know how exactly you would like to arrange this role in the future to ensure firstly, that you are independent, and secondly, that you can continue to perform this task properly without governments exploiting this opportunity to in fact undermine your independence.

 Mr President, after lengthy rounds of negotiations, Parliament, the Council and the Commission have finally agreed on a joint text for regulating alternative investment fund managers. I welcome this, and I have to correct Mr Goebbels: We wished to send the original proposal back because we believed that the alternative investment funds were so different – hedge funds, private equity funds and property funds – that they each need to be regulated separately. Nevertheless, we now have a text that we can fully accept and support. The all-embracing approach that we found disturbing at first has been amended in respect of key elements. As a result, we no longer have a problem with it. The goal of the directive was to create greater transparency for the supervisory bodies but, above all, for the investors, in order to be able to identify systemic risks in due time and at an early stage and so to be able to deal with them accordingly. Personally, I am in favour of rules that all fund managers operating in the EU have to abide by. At the same time, however, I do not like the idea of us turning Europe into a fortress or even a prison or of European institutions seeking to invest not being able to do so outside Europe. We were therefore initially unable to support the proposal as presented in committee. The compromise that has now been found solves this problem. It promises to keep the markets open. Another reason for our initial rejection was the regulations relating to the area of private equity, which would, in fact, have led to distortions of competition in this area. The requirements for private equity, as they were initially formulated, would have placed even listed companies under a definite disadvantage. The compromise that we now have before us eliminates this shortcoming and it prevents asset stripping, which is something that we expressly welcome. Overall, therefore, we are very pleased with the proposal. It creates clear framework conditions and rules for alternative investment fund managers. It will ensure greater transparency for identifying systemic risks. It will therefore ensure greater stability. It will strengthen the internal market because it introduces the EU passport, which, following a transitional period, will also be introduced for managers outside Europe. It will ensure clear, undistorted competition. Finally, it will establish a clear, new task for the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). To conclude, I would like to thank not only my fellow Members but, above all, the Belgian Presidency, which has brought this matter to a successful conclusion with its untiring efforts.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the height of the financial crisis, the G20 countries promised joint action to stabilise the financial markets. Today, two years later, we are still a long way away from a global answer. In many instances, the measures adopted pursue national interests and considerations. The initial energy has dissipated and all too often we are back to ‘business as usual’. Mervyn King of the Bank of England put it succinctly when he said: ‘The need to act in the collective interest has yet to emerge’. In its interim report, the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis makes it clear that Europe is at a critical crossroads. We need to intensify our integration, we need to harmonise our economic and budgetary policies more, we need European infrastructure projects in the areas of energy, transport and telecommunications. We need a functioning internal market and labour market, and we need the resources required in order to achieve the demanding growth targets set out in the EU 2020 strategy. We need innovative sources of financing if we are to be able to exploit the potential of the SME sector. We need more Community method and less intergovernmentalism. A standstill here is a backward move; it will not preserve the status quo
. The debt crisis in Europe clearly demonstrates that stability and confidence are not achievable without discipline. The proposals made by Commissioner Rehn and by Mr Van Rompuy’s task force are intended to ensure that the Member States act in a disciplined manner. I regret to say that in Luxembourg the other day, the finance ministers cast aside these proposals at the behest of our Franco-German couple – a missed opportunity and a bad day for our citizens, who quite rightly feel betrayed by politics yet again. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if banks have to hold more capital for loans and financial instruments, that increases their ability to bear losses. The most recent proposals from the Basel Committee take this stability-based approach as their basis. Unfortunately, the Basel Committee has not, as yet, satisfactorily addressed the problem of system-relevant banks. I therefore welcome Mr Karas’s call for the requirements for the liquidity standards to be made independent of system-relevance. In other words, appropriately tougher requirements need to apply to banks that, due to their size or interconnectedness with the global financial system, need to be bailed out using taxpayers’ money in crisis situations. We should take a more differentiated approach to the factor of debt leverage. Only when it is empirically proven that this instrument does not lead to arbitrage and distortions of competition and actually counters the overheated granting of loans should we consider permanently incorporating it into the first pillar. There is a need, in any case, for these proposals to be implemented at the global level. We cannot allow the US authorities to have a decisive influence on the Basel proposals only to not then implement them. The G20 summit in Seoul next month will show whether, and to what extent, we can achieve this objective. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 I support the European Union’s initiative to refocus the current remuneration policy on long-term success and more liability for decision makers. However, this must not lead to salary levels being set by politicians. This task should remain the responsibility of the existing structures within the banks, such as the supervisory board and the general meeting. Therefore, the proposed remuneration policy should not replace existing structures, but should supplement them where necessary, ensuring that this helps to improve the quality of financial decision making.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, even the members of the Council realise that the weaknesses of the supervisory system are or were one of the causes of the biggest global financial crisis experienced since the 1930s. They are also aware that national measures alone are not sufficient to deal with the consequences of this crisis, but that we need to look for global, or at least European, solutions. The Council should know that the European Parliament does not want an independent European supervisory structure and systemic risk board to be set up out of dogmatism or stubbornness, but from a deeply-held, cross-party conviction. This is the only way of guaranteeing transparency and protection for investors, based on a uniform regulatory framework and a uniform interpretation and application of this framework. One clear message from the crisis is that we need not less, but greater involvement from Europe in the financial sector; if we do not go forwards, than we will go backwards. Member States should drop the hypocrisy they display when calling for global solutions at G20 meetings and demanding at least European regulations at home, but actually refusing to make any compromise in the trialogues.

 Combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography is vitally important. We must use all our strength to combat the availability of child pornography in communications networks.

 Mr President, Commissioner, rating agencies have played an appalling role in the global financial crisis and in the euro difficulties and are far from deserving of praise. Lack of transparency, conflicts of interest, financing through contracting entities and the publication of ratings at questionable times with a procyclical effect, or shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted, speak for themselves. Rating agencies have been, and continue to be, oblivious to this and do not see these problems. I personally have proposed that the EU should act now and I am pleased that you, too, feel the same. We should establish a European rating agency on the basis of a foundation model. Obviously, this foundation model must be financially independent. It must not be subject to any political interference, either from the European Central Bank, the Commission or any Member States. As an independent foundation, this European agency could become a serious competitor to the oligopoly, or indeed the monopoly, of the three rating agencies we are discussing now. It should be the case that any product offered in Europe and all issuers operating in Europe be required to give two ratings, one of which must come from this European agency. In order to be independent, this foundation must also be financially independent. This means that we need seed-funding that could be provided by the European Investment Bank or perhaps the Commission, and from that point on, this European foundation would have to finance itself. The question of whether such financing should come from contracting authorities or users remains to be clarified. This was raised earlier on by Mr Giegold. We have to reach a decision on this as well. On a general note, we should also consider whether we could restrict our reliance on rating agencies somewhat because it seems to me that we are much too dependent on them at present. Wolf Klinz,

 Mr President, Commissioner, if I take a little more than four minutes, I will make my concluding remarks shorter so that I do not overrun my six minutes. The Prospectus Directive was originally put together in 2003 with the condition that it be reviewed in September 2009. That has been the case. The Prospectus Directive concerns the completion, approval and publication of prospectuses as a prerequisite for the public offering of securities or their emission into a regulated market within the European Union. In general, the current review concerns technical aspects and is intended to eliminate legal uncertainties and unjustifiably onerous requirements. First of all, I would very much like to thank all the Members who have worked together with us on this, as well as all the shadow rapporteurs. We have had very good cooperation, and that includes with the Commission. Without such good cooperation, we would not actually have been able to see this package through to a successful conclusion at first reading in less than ten months. I would now like to present briefly the agreement we have forged – and this includes the tripartite talks – in the form of eight principal points on which we were able to reach agreement. Firstly, one of our objectives was to facilitate access to capital in the market for small and medium-sized enterprises. You know that in the US, there is a much higher percentage of companies, including SMEs, that obtain finance through the market, whereas in Europe, the common practice, especially amongst small businesses, is to obtain finance through bank loans. What we want to do here is open up the opportunity for small businesses to use the market more often than before. We have therefore raised the threshold for exemption from the threshold requirements, which ultimately saddle SMEs with red tape and costs, from EUR 2.5 million to EUR 5 million. My second point concerns investor protection: we want to make sure that, in the course of such facilitation, we can provide sufficient safeguards to the small private investor. This is why we have raised the threshold for exemption from the prospectus requirements for securities denominated in 50 000 to a denomination of 100 000. The third point I would like to raise concerns the issue of how to enable employees to participate in a company’s share capital without that company needing to bear the relatively high costs of launching a prospectus. So, this is about relaxing the prospectus requirement when offering employee participation programmes. Here, we have introduced a proportionality clause in that we have eliminated the unnecessary disclosure requirement. At the same time, however, we have made sure that we have a document detailing basic information so that those employees who benefit from this form of participation can have an idea about what it is they are getting. We have also made sure that companies listed in a third country, that is, a country outside the European Union, be exempted from the prospectus requirement as well – just like European companies – where they offer their employees shares, on the condition that they are able to prove equivalence with the disclosure requirements. The fourth area we discussed and on which we have reached agreement concerns what is commonly known as a ‘prospectus summary’. You can look at it this way: typically, a prospectus is a thick and voluminous document frequently containing several hundred pages. However, there is also the summary which frequently contains another 50, 60 or 70 pages. What we want Parliament to do is to shorten this to what is known as ‘key investor information’ or a document with essential information for investors of the kind provided by traditional investment funds, the UCITS. The Commission did not, in fact, consider this, wanting merely to ensure that key information really is contained in the summary. We have now agreed that, while keeping the summary in its present form, we should also ensure that it does indeed contain key information which will eventually be set out through directive requirements and a level 2 elaboration. This will help shorten the summary considerably, cutting it down from the current 60, 70 or 80 pages to some 20 or 30, perhaps, and help make it an easy read, especially for the small investor. This is important, because we do not want to leave the small investor out of the picture. Fifthly, the issue of liability: when a prospectus is drawn up, who is it that guarantees the accuracy of the contents? In particular, if an intermediary uses this prospectus, if he makes arbitrary changes to the contents, then the liable party is the intermediary. The prospectus requirement expires either when the offer period has expired or when the trading has begun, whichever is the later date. Seventhly, the review clause: as with the previous one, this directive will also be reviewed in five years’ time. My last point is that, in this document, we have the first piece of legislation that has been brought into line with the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon. Last but not least, allow me to point out that the Chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has managed to ensure that Parliament is given sufficient time. We have three months to respond to the Commission and another extension of three months, if necessary. Having said that, we have undertaken, in the event that all other options fail, to grant early approval, that is, to push this piece of legislation through within the shortest time. This satisfies all parties. Wolf Klinz,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, I will make just a few brief comments. First of all, I wish to thank the Commissioner and all the Members for their friendly comments. I am pleased that you share my views. Our cooperation has actually enabled us to balance out various objectives, namely easier access to capital for SMEs and the removal of administrative hurdles, on the one hand, and improvement and securing of investor protection and making progress in terms of creating a genuine European internal market, on the other. I hope that, when this new version of the Prospectus Directive comes up for review in a few years’ time, we will be able to establish a link between the Prospectus Directive and the Market Abuse and Transparency Directives, and that we might perhaps go so far as to choose, in terms of non-equity securities, not the home market, but another Member State of the European Union as a starting point for emission.

Madam President, I am delighted to be able to welcome Estonia as the 17th member of the euro area from 1 January 2011. Our Baltic neighbour, as previous speakers have already said, is actually one of the very few countries that meet the Maastricht criteria, and indeed with enthusiasm! In the current climate, we can be certain that the Commission, Eurostat and the European Central Bank have looked very closely at everything and made no allowances in their evaluation of the figures. The Council will also take its decision without any political benefit. Ten years after its introduction, the euro is, as we all know, currently facing its greatest test and challenge. It is testimony to an enormous degree of commitment, an unbelievable will and an extraordinary amount of effort that Estonia has succeeded in actually meeting the accession criteria under these circumstances. I believe that it is also evidence of the fact that it wants to meet these criteria as laid down in the Treaty. Estonia knows that, as a Member of the European Union, it is also obliged one day to become a member of the euro area and the fact that it wants to do that so quickly makes me, personally, very happy. It shows that there are still countries that have real confidence in this European project. It is fortunate that the Estonian Government did not have to put this accession decision to the people in a referendum, as we are well aware that citizens are to some extent very concerned. If they follow the media, they will view the euro as a soft currency and the euro area as a transfer union, and they are scared that the introduction of the euro will lead to large price increases. Slovenia and Germany are examples of this, and in Germany it is not without reason that the expensive euro has been referred to using the play on words as the ‘Teuro’ (‘der teure Euro
’ – expensive euro). The fact, then, that all of this is just perceived inflation, as the European Central Bank says, is surely something of an understatement. As a member of the euro area, Estonia will also have to deal with the problems facing the single currency and thus also sign up to the euro area rescue plan. What impact that might have on the budget, we do not know. I would like to ask the Commission to provide some clarity in this regard. I hope Estonia continues its excellent development and I hope that its achievements, particularly with regard to budgetary discipline and combating inflation, will prove to be sustainable in future, too.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European governments are being driven by the markets. At last they are reacting, but they are reacting after the event and not in advance. It is scandalous that the governments and the Commission only react when the real weaknesses appear in the markets. They should have identified these weaknesses themselves at an early stage. When the euro was introduced, we knew that we would not have a single monetary and fiscal policy, as is normally the case in individual states. For this reason, we have taken measures to find a substitute for this, but we have not adhered closely to these measures. The rules were broken very quickly and right at the start, even by the larger Member States. We need another effective set of rules with sanction mechanisms, including a name and shame policy, the loss of voting rights and suspension of payments from the European funds until the fines have been paid. Secondly, it has become clear that there are internal tensions within the euro area which are on the verge of putting its strength to the test and which take the form of differences in competitiveness. The Commission must take action in this area. It must investigate the budgets of the individual Member States to determine whether they represent a risk for the euro area. Of course, we know that the right to draw up a budget is a central right of the national parliaments. However, that is no reason for failing to develop a common European approach. This is urgently needed. We need more Europe and not less Europe. This may well be our last chance. If the Commission and the Council do not negotiate with Parliament, I am afraid that the result will be a major disaster at some point in the future. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from my economic experience I know that strategies are only as good as their specific implementation measures and the means of monitoring them. The Commission is yet to provide an answer in this regard. We listen to the goals, with which we can thoroughly identify, we hear the lofty intentions, but we hear next to nothing about how these goals are to be achieved in concrete terms. I had actually assumed that the financial and economic crisis – the largest we have experienced since the Second World War and which has now deepened on account of the additional problem of the national debt crisis – would have been at the top of the Commission’s list of considerations. In my opinion, that should have been the logical starting point, as both crises have changed the situation significantly. If we do not just stop at lofty intentions but actually want to achieve something in the next ten years then we will have to address a number of points in very concrete terms: Firstly, we need to review our finances – not only in the EU, but in each Member State, according to uniform criteria – so that we know where we really stand, what our financial leeway is and what we can actually afford to do. Secondly, we need to develop a crisis resolution mechanism to prevent us being thrown out of kilter again in the future should there be further storms on the markets. Thirdly, we need to complete the internal market in areas where it is not yet complete – I am expecting a great deal from Mr Monti’s report – including for services. Fourthly, we need to convincingly set out how we are to supplement the common monetary policy with a common, closely interlinked economic and finance policy and even a fiscal policy. Fifthly, we need to set out very specifically how we can replace the divergence that we have observed between the Member States with increasing convergence by concentrating on economic projects that are truly European in nature. There are very many of these: energy policy, energy interconnections, high-speed rail and road networks, navigation systems and many similar projects. Wolf Klinz,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the partnership between the EU and Canada works very well, not only in the area of the economy, but also on questions of foreign policy, such as Iran, Afghanistan, Haiti and other similar cases. Despite this, we are faced with a number of serious challenges. I am sure that we can overcome them, because we have such a close friendship and partnership. I am thinking about five points in particular. Firstly, we must do the job of regulating the financial sector properly. A great deal was promised by the G20 and I believe that it is important for it to be clearly shown at the G20 summit in Toronto, which is hosted by Canada, that the G20 countries are taking concrete measures and not just making promises. My second point has already been mentioned. We have very similar objectives with regard to climate policy. We in Europe can definitely learn from Canada about carbon capture and storage projects and other developments in this sector. We hope to be able to agree on joint standards for reductions. My third point concerns the need for a new trade agreement and I believe that our objectives are very similar in this area as well. I would like to highlight two points where action is needed and where we intend to move closer together, but still remain some distance apart. One of these concerns visa-free travel, which you, Baroness Ashton, have already referred to. I hope that it will be possible to treat ethnic minorities from EU Member States in the same way as all other EU citizens. My last point relates to the passenger data agreement which expired in the autumn of last year. It is de facto still in force, but no longer has a basis in law. We need a new legal basis, so that we can produce a new agreement. This new legal basis must ensure that civil rights are respected. Modern technological opportunities for networking should not be used to make all the information on names, dates of birth, flight details, credit cards, and so on, readily available in such a way that this information can be misused. We hope that we can work together to create a legal basis which corresponds to our European concept of civil rights. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, VAT fraud is not a mere peccadillo. It is a criminal act and a problem which either escalates or diminishes over time. According to the latest estimates, citizens, and thereby taxpayers, lose up to EUR 100 billion every year, perhaps even more. At a time of accelerating public debt and crisis, citizens have no sympathy for the fact that the European Union has so far not been able to tackle this problem successfully. This is why I welcome a fresh attempt to introduce the reverse charge procedure, on which we will be taking a vote the day after tomorrow. What we are trying to do with the reverse charge procedure is effectively eliminate the problem of VAT evasion or at least reduce it. We have to wait and see, however, whether or not this procedure will generate the desired increase in VAT receipts and deter new cases of fraud. However, it is certainly worth the attempt. We will monitor closely the results of the procedure, the application of which is currently limited to 2014, and carry out a critical assessment. However, I would have liked an amendment to one specific point: I am in favour of enterprises which duly discharge their duty of care in the context of a review of their VAT registration numbers, being exempted from any liability, even if the recipient commits fraud. I explicitly regret that my amendment to that effect did not command a majority in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the fast and decisive reaction of the G20 to the global financial crisis. A great deal has happened. The fire appears to have been put out, but the foundations of our financial system are still shaky. The citizens are unsettled. Profits are being ploughed back for the benefit of shareholders and losses are being socialised, that is how the citizens see it. In the meantime, it is back to business as usual for more and more market players, who are making big moves, rather than focusing on what they should really be doing as service providers, namely supporting the real economy. Financial ethics and responsibility appear, as ever, to be foreign words to many of them. I am expecting specific – and fast – measures from the G20. I hope that the EU Member States will all pull together. In addition to new supervisory structures, we also need bigger equity bases, which increase in line with the risk, long-term – not short-term – incentive systems, a coordinated exit strategy from State aid, contained protectionism, congruent regulation, rather than regulation arbitrage, an end to pro-cyclicity and a solution to the ‘too big to fail’ problem and, above all, we must abide by the tried and tested social market economy.Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the democratic structure of the European Union is the subject of much discussion at the moment. The Commission’s report on monitoring the application of EU law makes it clear that this is a complex topic and also involves the Member States. Citizens have a right not only to European legislation being drawn up in accordance with democratic principles, but also to European laws being transposed so they – the citizens – as well as businesses can benefit from them. Member States are also under a democratic obligation in this respect. They are obliged to transpose the legislation. If they fail to fulfil this obligation, they are infringing the European legal order and therefore the rule of law. Observing this rule of law is, however, a necessary condition for the legitimacy of any form of democratic governance. It is a guarantee for citizens that they will be able to benefit from the rights provided for in law. The Commission’s reports show year on year that many Member States frequently flout the transposition deadlines for Directives. As guardian of the Treaties, the Commission is therefore forced to institute costly infringement proceedings, which are embarrassing for the Member States. Here the Commission must keep a particularly close eye on those Member States with very poor transposition records. As Parliament we are also required to do this. Our citizens are turning to us with increasing frequency with petitions and in this way drawing our attention to transposition infringements by Member States. We must therefore make sure that communication between Parliament and the Commission is improved, so that infringements can be identified and remedied as early as possible. We owe it to our citizens!

Mr President, I do not wish to advance any political arguments against the ACAA Protocol, such as the idea that we are rewarding Israel for its human rights violations and sending out the wrong signal. Instead, I shall present some legal arguments. The Protocol states that the territorial competence of the Israeli Responsible Authority for pharmaceuticals, in this instance the Ministry of Health, is to be defined by Israel – in accordance with its own national law, of course. However, under Israel’s national law, the settlements in the West Bank, which are illegal under international law, and the illegally annexed areas of East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights are deemed to be Israeli territory. Due to the absence of any provision to the contrary in the Protocol, the worry is that Israel will extend the jurisdiction of the Responsible Authority to the Occupied Territories as well. When implementing the Protocol, the EU would thus be forced to recognise, for the first time, Israel’s claims to sovereignty over parts of the Occupied Territories. I therefore urge the Members of this House to vote against the ACAA Protocol today. As democratically elected Members of this House, we have an obligation to respect and uphold EU and international law as part of our set of values.  The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the EU because we apply rule-of-law and democratic principles – not only in relation to the EU itself. How can we ... this important ...

Madam President, legal, cross-border online access to orphan works is fundamental to the fostering of our diverse cultural treasures in Europe. The directive to be adopted will finally enable public institutions in Europe – libraries, museums, archives and the like – to dig out orphan works from their cellars, digitise them and thus make them available to the general public. After long and also difficult discussions in Parliament and with the Council, we have found a solution that serves both the individual rights holders’ interest in the reasonable protection of their works and the public interest in the distribution of such works. We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, in particular, insisted that there must be a truly thorough and effective search for the rights holder whose rights are to be protected before a work is published. If the rights holder makes himself/herself known at a later date, he/she should be due at least reasonable compensation. It is also important that we have put a stop to purely commercial use of such works. On the other hand, public institutions, especially in times of tight purse strings, depend on private bodies to assist them with the digitisation. Public-private partnerships are exactly the right approach to take in order to make as many works as possible accessible to the public. It is high time that the European Parliament finally made hitherto unused cultural heritage available to the public. I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, as these negotiations were truly difficult and we had proposed various different ways forward at the outset. I do not share the view of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance that there is, to all intents and purposes, no value in this directive. I take the view that, if that were the case, the review clause makes it possible to overhaul the directive after two years. I am, however, quite sure that digitisation can get under way straight away now, and also that the necessary funds for that are available. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, only simple and comprehensible law is good law. We issue European legislation in the public interest and for the benefit of the citizens. It is therefore essential that European law should be simple, easy-to-understand and accessible to everyone. As European legislators, we need to constantly monitor and optimise our work. That is what our citizens expect of us. It is important that we should have an ever more intensive exchange with the national parliaments in order to give shape to laws and act together as guardians of the principle of subsidiarity. In that way, we can ensure, together, that we really do only legislate at European level what is too much to deal with at national level. Good law making also includes not putting in place regulations that could be at least as well dealt with at national level. Particularly in these difficult times for the European Union, it is absolutely critical that European legislation should be accepted by everyone, including by our national elected representatives. The early warning mechanism established in the Treaty of Lisbon, which many people have labelled a paper tiger, showed its potential power for the first time yesterday. After reprimands about subsidiarity from 18 national parliaments, the Commission decided to withdraw its proposed regulation on collective striking law. There is cause to criticise the fact that there has still been no updating of the existing interinstitutional agreement on better legislation from 2003 to fit in with the Treaty of Lisbon. The Treaty of Lisbon brought in changes in respect of secondary legislation. Given the immense practical importance of such legislation, the agreement needs to be updated. Alexandra Thein,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are about to vote on two technical reports on the European Court of Justice. I would like to make the following non-partisan comments: the European Parliament expressly regrets the fact that the increase in the number of judges at the European Court of Justice, the necessity of which has also been accepted by the Council, has failed simply because the Member States were unable to agree on the Member States from which the extra judges were to be drawn. This is despite the fact that there were several possible solutions on the table. Thus, in procedural terms, we have an absolutely exceptional case here that is almost without precedent in Parliament, as we are about to vote on the proposed regulation and the first part today in order to relieve the Court of Justice of at least some of its workload, while leaving the second part hanging; it will hopefully be possible to bring this more important part to a successful conclusion by summer 2013. On behalf of our citizens and businesses, I once again call on the Member States not to play their usual power games with the third estate and to afford it the respect it deserves. Alexandra Thein,  
rapporteur

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg is overstretched. Tomorrow’s decision may seem technical and non-political at first glance, relating to the internal reorganisation of the three courts that comprise the Court of Justice of the European Union; however there is more to it than that. The European Union has been, and continues to be, invested with more and more powers and responsibilities, most recently through the Treaty of Lisbon. Accordingly, the responsibilities of the Court of Justice of the European Union have also gradually expanded. Thus, the excessive workload cannot be attributed solely to the increasing number of cases – in common with many Member States – quite apart from the accession of 12 new Member States. In fact, the number of cases concluded has lagged behind the number of newly received cases for many years. In this context, it becomes clear that the reform of the internal organisation of the Court of Justice will have a major impact on the functioning or the European Union as a whole and, in the final analysis, on the lives of Europe’s citizens. For this reason it was important for me that all of the participating legislative bodies – including the Court of Justice, which we included in the trilogue negotiations – should cooperate from the start and find practical compromises. We have only partly succeeded in doing this. Let me begin with the part for which we have actually found reasonable compromises, which make the work of the Court more efficient and which will reduce the length of court proceedings. The key points are as follows: the office of Vice-President is to be established at the suggestion of the Court itself. In future, the Vice-President will relieve the President of some of the burden involved in representing and administering the Court and will attend all Grand Chamber sessions. In addition, personnel structures are to be changed in the Chambers and in the Grand Chamber, which is to consist of 15 judges, so that the Presidents of the Chambers with five judges will also have their workload reduced and it will be possible to share the workload of all judges more evenly. The proposals in relation to the Civil Service Tribunal are also easy to explain. This Tribunal has always had seven judges. The small number of judges means that, in the event that a judge is absent, for example, due to lengthy illness, the Tribunal as a whole is seriously impaired in its judicial functions. In order to prevent this, an option is to be established whereby judges can be appointed to this technical tribunal on an interim basis. The judges in question are former members of the Court of Justice and they are to be appointed from a list in a particular order, so as to satisfy the requirements in relation to legally eligible judges. These judges can then replace individual judges should they be unable to fulfil their duties. So much for the positive and rational compromises which we have hammered out together and for which I wish to thank all those involved. As was stated at the outset, however, we have not been able to bring all the necessary proposals to a conclusion. I wish to emphasise clearly that the reason for this lies not with the European Parliament, but with the Council and the national vanity of the individual Member States. It was suggested that the number of judges in the Court of First Instance should be increased by 12, rising from 27 to 39 judges. This is the right decision in view of the increasing workload of the judges, although the precise number of additional judges required might be open to debate. Parliament is certainly convinced that increasing the number of judges will, in the final analysis, contribute to better jurisprudence for individual citizens and businesses alike. From which the Member States the additional judges are drawn should not really matter and appointments should be made solely on the basis of qualifications. After all, the principle of impartiality among judges also applies in the European Union. This, however, is something for the future. We have proposed a fair system for the appointment of judges, with numerous suggestions for how they could be selected. The Member States however, were unwilling and unable to agree to any of these solutions in the Council, which is why we shall not have an agreement to increase the number of judges for the foreseeable future. The motives behind this are purely national in character and cannot be justified in objective terms. I find this extremely unsatisfactory. In the future too it will be necessary to ensure that European jurisprudence follows a reasonable timescale. Our citizens and businesses are entitled to that. Excessively long cases, sometimes lasting over five-and-a-half years, represent a violation of our Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. That is why it is vital that, in view of the present, well-balanced proposals in relation to the selection of additional judges, Member States should finally consider their position and avoid any loss of confidence in the European legal system. Alexandra Thein,

Mr President, I would like to thank all my colleagues and I am particularly pleased that we have cross-group agreement that the number of judges must be increased, as Ms Regner has also indicated how many there will eventually be. This still has to be discussed. The third estate is often neglected because it is unable to make its voice sufficiently heard in politics. It is reticent by nature. It is essentially important, however. Mr Häfner has underlined its importance for the public at large, while Mr Karim has explained its significance for the business community. I hope that the friendship group established by the Council will not only deal with further internal reforms of the Court of Justice of the European Union, particularly because it has already achieved a major reform that has also contributed to a drop in case numbers and concluded cases. It is extremely important that the principle of the separation of powers should be followed here, and the system as a whole must not be overburdened. The work on the two dossiers has shown that some questions remain outstanding and that we must take a closer look at the Court of Justice in our Committee on Legal Affairs when it comes to the issue of divergent opinions, even though these are not required by the Court, or the establishment of special chambers and technical tribunals. A number of questions have arisen during the negotiations and need to be clarified. We were under considerable time pressure because 14 new judges must be appointed in October and I hope that we will have concluded the negotiations on the additional new judges to be appointed before the next appointment of 13 new judges in September 2013. Mr President, as we have saved some time because a number of colleagues have failed to attend, please permit me to present once again the various options for appointing the additional judges. We tabled a cross-group resolution that was never adopted, despite unanimous support, because Parliament changed its Rules of Procedure in the interim. The following proposals are on the table: Firstly, the selection takes place in strict rotation and involves all 27 Member States. The second option: six judges are drawn from the most populous Member States, while the remaining six are drawn from the other 21 Member States in strict rotation. Alternatively: six judges are drawn from the most populous Member States, while the remaining six are drawn from the medium-sized Member States in strict rotation. Yet another option: six judges are drawn from the most populous Member States, while the remaining six are selected using the same system as that used to appoint advocates-general. Another possible interim solution would be to appoint temporary judges for approximately five or six years, as suggested by the Danish Presidency of the Council. Thus, there are plenty of solutions available, but the Council needs to agree. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 I was unable to vote in favour of the Ferreira report because of Amendments 68, 27 and 67. In its proposal to the German Government in autumn 2011, the German Council of Economic Experts demanded clear and strict rules on participation in a debt redemption fund (Amendment 67). Whatever one’s general position on such a debt redemption fund, which was not even foreseen in the Commission proposal, these participation criteria have been greatly watered down in the report that has now been adopted. Moreover, linking the introduction of a debt redemption fund with a road map for eurobonds or stability bonds and the treatment of economic imbalances is unfair and inappropriate.

 Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, as a liberal, I, too, welcome the hearing instigated by the Commission on the future of European company law. This is a key element of a functioning internal market. There are particular problems in respect of the mobility of our enterprises – in other words, the outstanding 14th company law directive on the cross-border transfer of company seats without having to establish a new company. The Commission has been slow in presenting draft legislation because the Member States are unable to agree on a common line, and negotiations are therefore likely to be difficult. Similarly, it is scarcely possible for shareholder rights to be exercised across borders and we are still awaiting harmonised framework conditions in this area. There are also problems with the European private company, where the Member States are again blocking progress, being unable to agree on, among other things, the necessity of cross-border aspects, the level of capital stock and worker codetermination. My final point is that in the current proposed directive on accounting, the Commission has, in my view, made a technical legal error. In principle, the idea of making payment flows from the commodities industry in developing countries transparent is to be welcomed. In terms of legal technicalities, however, this topic does not belong there. If we want to help fight corruption, EU accounting law is not the right place to do it. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, it was only on 8 June that you condemned settlement building in the occupied territories. Today, you referred for the umpteenth time to the fact that settlement building is illegal under the terms of international law. Furthermore, on 14 May, the Council reaffirmed in its conclusions on the peace process the fact that we must maintain the viability of a two-state solution. Therefore, it is incomprehensible that we in the European Parliament are now being asked to vote in favour of the additional protocol to the association agreement with Israel on conformity assessment and acceptance of industrial products (ACAA). I think it is particularly important to make the following point. We have not yet had a clear explanation of the precise way in which products manufactured in the settlements are handled in the agreement between the EU and Israel. These products are still finding their way onto the EU market. Before we conclude any further trade agreements with Israel, we need to resolve this problem. We must investigate whether there are any effective mechanisms for monitoring this which can be introduced and implemented. In the meantime, Israel continues to disregard its obligations under international law. More settlements are being built, enlarged and even relocated as Israel sees fit, while the EU stands helplessly by. A two-state solution is quite literally being buried under the settlements.

 I spoke against the report because two amendments tabled by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe did not receive a majority in plenary.

 Mr President, Mr Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome this discussion about the European corporate governance framework. Normally in the Committee on Legal Affairs, when it comes to own-initiative reports, in other words, non-legislative proposals, we try to bring all the political groups on board by means of compromises. On this occasion we did not succeed and that is a good thing, because in the case of corporate governance there are fundamental differences in the political perspectives of the Social Democrats and the Greens on the one hand and the Liberals, the Christian Democrats and the Conservatives on the other. For example, we believe that the comply-or-explain system is a useful tool in corporate governance. Any deviation from the code of conduct should be justified in an appropriate way and the alternative corporate governance measure that is taken should be described and explained. Calling for binding rules in this area, as the Social Democrats do in their alternative motion for a resolution, involves intervening to an excessive extent in companies’ freedom to do business and this is unacceptable, particularly when it is not dependent on the size of the company. Listed companies, some of which are small organisations, must not be lumped together with non-listed companies and small and medium-sized enterprises, especially given the additional call for sanctions to be imposed whenever there is a well-justified deviation from the code of conduct. This is pure socialism. We cannot simply force companies to accept the German or Austrian codetermination model in the light of the different corporate cultures in other Member States, even if this would perhaps prevent a few unnecessary strikes of the kind that often take place in southern Europe. I would now like to discuss the quotas for women. We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have tabled a far-reaching amendment concerning the representation of women on boards. We are not fully in agreement within our group and we have heard the same thing from speakers from other groups. Nevertheless, I hope that this issue will receive broad support. In future, I would like to see the Commission giving more consideration to the dual structure that we have in Europe and not focusing solely on the system with a single board. Alexandra Thein,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as a member of both the Palestine and Israel delegations, I welcome the fact that Parliament has decided to speak out on these unacceptable Israeli raids on two television stations in Ramallah. I would remind you that Ramallah is located in Zone A of the West Bank, in other words in the small area that the Palestinians are permitted to administer for themselves. This means that there is no legal basis in any agreement for such action by the Israeli authorities, particularly since it was unannounced. In addition to the fact that this action ran contrary to the right of free expression and freedom of information, what we have here is the illegal destruction of Palestinian property by the Israeli occupying powers, something that is stereotypically defended by Israel as necessary on security grounds, which does not make it any less illegal under international law: we witness the destruction of drinking fountains and energy sources, the almost weekly destruction of agricultural land and olive trees, as well as the continuous demolition of hundreds of Palestinian homes, including in Jerusalem itself. What is particularly galling is that the Israeli authorities do not even baulk at the destruction of infrastructural projects financed by the EU or its Member States. According to a recent report in Der Spiegel
 and elsewhere, solar energy systems funded by German taxes are once again being torn down. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Madam President, I welcome the fact that Parliament has taken up the issue of human rights violations in Bahrain. According to the list kept by the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, the number of fatalities since 14 February 2011 is much higher than indicated in the resolution. The number quoted there is 63. The debate is made all the more important by the fact that a large number of Member States were very quiet and indecisive about the events in Bahrain, when they actually should have made their voices heard. If one compares the way the Member States reacted to the very first killings in Syria, then it is apparent that the response was quite different. In the final analysis, this is what leads me to hope that the standards applied in the European Parliament at least will be the same, whatever country is under consideration. We cannot use a different yardstick here simply because Bahrain is the location of a US naval base rather than a Russian one, because it receives supplies of US weapons rather than Russian ones and because our trade relations with the country are better than with Syria. The same standards need to apply in Bahrain and in all the countries of the Arab world when it comes to compliance with human rights. Alexandra Thein,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are in the process of re-regulating succession and family law in respect of which law is to be applied, which courts have competence and the recognition and enforcement of judgments from other countries. We have done so already in respect of the arrangement of child support and divorce law. Tomorrow we will be voting on the law of succession, and marital property law will follow. As Mr Lehne has already said, in the plenary today we are not discussing any old abstract political issues. Instead, we are helping our citizens in a quite tangible way to solve what are currently in some ways irresolvable problems. In the worst case scenario it can happen in a cross-border succession case that the heirs appeal to the highest instance of the courts in different Member States, spend a great deal of time and money and that there are then two contradicting decisions because each of the courts applies the law in that Member State. The aim is for such situations to be avoided in future. We are on the verge of a change of system when it comes to succession law. In future, the entire succession will be in the competence of the courts of the Member State in the territory of which the bequeather was habitually resident at the time of their death. This is because we are working on the basis that people have a stronger relationship with the country in which they reside. However, someone who, by way of example, as a German permanently resident in Strasbourg, regards him- or herself as having a closer connection with Germany, can choose to have German law apply to their succession. In order to avoid a French court having to apply complicated German succession law, there is, in such circumstances, also a provision for the succession to be brought before a German probate court. Meanwhile, those who like to winter in Mallorca need have no fear either, as, wherever you go on holiday, it does not constitute habitual residence in the country in which you holiday. Furthermore, this regulation will not affect inheritance tax. Denmark, the United Kingdom and Ireland, as we have heard, will not initially be involved as a result of their opt-outs. That is a shame, as so many Britons, in particular, have holiday homes in southern Europe and these would then also be subject to the common law and not, as up to now, to the law of the Member State in which the land is located. A major information campaign will be necessary. I would also like to thank Mr Lechner once again for his comprehensive work and for the solution that he reached. His work shows how important it is that this Parliament should contain not only career politicians but also professionals from other walks of life. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, I welcome the fact that trading relations are to be established with a view to creating a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area in response to the Arab Spring, and that the over 100 bilateral protocols are to be brought together in a single regional agreement. I would, however, like to draw attention to one critical point, namely, products that purportedly originate from Israel. There have been some serious flaws in the implementation of the association agreement between the EU and Israel concluded in 1995. We in this House are all aware of this. I recently drew attention to precisely this flaw in a written question to the Commission. We know from several sources, including our customs authorities, that Israeli settlers have intentionally falsely labelled goods produced in the occupied Palestinian territories, including fruit and vegetables, also issuing these goods with falsified certificates, declaring the country of origin of these products to be Israel. This was in order for this produce to gain access to the EU’s single market at preferential conditions, including lower tax rates. We cannot have a situation whereby this new agreement will also be misused in further extending this illegal practice. Mr Barnier, I believe it is extremely important that the aforementioned list of the designations of origin of the various Palestinian villages and towns should be published. Our delegation has long been of the view that this list should not be kept secret, but should be published in the interests of greater transparency and clarity and to help restrict abuses.

– The FDP Delegation abstained in today’s vote on the motion for a resolution on the feasibility of introducing stability bonds. We believe that the introduction of Eurobonds would set the wrong incentives. Since the introduction of the euro, low interest rates have led to a substantial increase in debt levels in many euro area countries. Eurobonds would take the pressure off highly indebted euro area Member States to consolidate their budgets and introduce much needed structural reforms. Therefore, we believe that Eurobonds would aggravate, rather than alleviate the current crisis. However, we did not vote against the resolution as many of our concerns have been taken on board by the rapporteur. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

Mr President, Commissioner, in 2009 the European Parliament resolved to set up a European Observatory on Counterfeiting and Piracy in order to capture reliable objective data on the actual number of counterfeit and imitation products, rather than being solely reliant on the data made available by producers and the trade. The Observatory, which in the end only commenced operations in 2010, was a complete success. It has become a centre of excellence, collecting information and data on all the counterfeit products – such as drugs, toys and car parts – that threaten the lives and health of our citizens. This Observatory, which was co-managed by the Commission – the bottom line is that it was actually only co-managed – now needs to be restructured, and given additional human and other resources to deal with the increase in its tasks. To bring this about, we have decided – for reasons of costs and efficiency – not to establish a new agency, but to utilise an existing agency and, in effect, to transfer the Observatory’s tasks to the existing agency, the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market in Alicante. This agency in fact employs 650 people, and they are already responsible for the registration of Community trade marks and designs. May I therefore explicitly repeat to the Member from the United Kingdom – who has, unfortunately, already left – that this Office is therefore able to work on a cost-neutral basis, because it finances itself from the fees received for the said trade marks; in other words, we are merely imposing additional tasks on an existing agency and are benefiting from the agreement on fees. I would also like to repeat that analysis of the problem of data theft is mentioned only in the recitals, and that it is stated there that the Observatory will primarily deal with counterfeiting and product piracy.

 The obvious answer to that question is yes. I think that was the point of the question. I find it genuinely regrettable that comments are made here without any detailed knowledge of the facts. I, too, come from a liberal party that is extremely concerned about costs and efficiency, and naturally I hope that the people working there are performing their duties properly. Above all, however, I hope that this agency will continue to work on a cost-neutral basis by continuing to finance itself from fees and requiring no subsidies of any kind. Alexandra Thein,

Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, the interconnection of companies and commercial registers is a further milestone along the way to creating a European area of law. I am pleased that this matter, which is so important for our small and medium-sized enterprises in particular, and which I advocated and promised to work for during my electoral campaign, has now – following trialogue negotiations – been successfully incorporated into a directive. There are two aspects to this. Firstly, it gives citizens and companies easier cross-border access to commercial registers. Until now, if you wanted to access, say, a Greek commercial register, you had to instruct a Greek lawyer – who of course also had to speak your language, or at least a language that you had in common. The end result was extra costs and wasted time. This should now be able to take place via a platform. What is special about this platform is that I can make an enquiry in my own language and get an answer in my own language. Secondly, the commercial registers will now cooperate in a more institutionalised way, rather than on a voluntary basis as they have until now. Moreover, I regret to say that in the past one could not always rely on the entries in commercial registers of other Member States, particularly where the registration of branches in other Member States was concerned. We have now incorporated a requirement stating that, in future, entries must be made without delay or at latest within 21 days – provided, of course, that the conditions are met. Every company and every branch is to be given an identifier. The existing national commercial registers are not just kept only in their national language, but they also differ in many respects de facto
 and de jure
; for example, as regards their legal significance and the reliability of the data recorded. The directive aims only to interconnect the national registers in technical terms, not to harmonise the national systems. Nonetheless, for practical business life it is an extremely helpful measure that will encourage further integration of the internal market and will improve legal clarity and legal certainty for companies and citizens. I hope that the considerable technical work and software work that will be required for this can be achieved on time, by the year 2014. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

I abstained from voting on paragraph 6 of the motion for a resolution on the meeting of the European Council of 30 January 2012, calling for a road map for the introduction of stability bonds. I believe that such a road map would be wrong at present because it would simply ‘reward’ the excessive indebtedness of some Member States and lead to the morally unjustifiable joint and several liability of other Member States. Naturally, in the distant future, the euro area is interested in a joint liquid bond market as an alternative to the market for US dollar bonds, making the euro an internationally secure currency and replacing the dollar in this respect. The right conditions for such a move are still very far off, because, at present, some southern European Member States have no understanding of reasonable budgetary, fiscal and stability policies.

Madam President, securing better access to justice is one of the main objectives of the European Union’s policy of creating an area of freedom, security and justice. In a modern, globalised and digital economy, the confidence of the citizens in justice is a crucial factor. The Mediation Directive represents a milestone in this connection. Now, every judge in the EU has the opportunity to ensure, in every phase of the process, that two parties to a dispute voluntarily and on their own responsibility strive, with the assistance of a mediator, to settle their differences amicably. The directive ensures that utilisation of the mediation process will prevent the expiry of limitation and prescription periods. Moreover, the agreements reached as a result of limitation and prescription could be given the status of enforceable official documents. Also important are sound training of the mediators in the field of quality assurance and the strengthening of citizens’ trust in this system. Most Member States announced transposition after the deadline for transposition had already passed. However, it is not only the fact that transposition takes place that is important – how transposition is effected is the most important thing. To that end, specialists and legal practitioners must be consulted in order to ensure the greatest possible improvement of the directive. Alexandra Thein,

 Madam President, Mr Duff, first and foremost, on behalf of our group I would like to thank you most sincerely for the many years of work that you have put into this project and for the energy and enthusiasm with which you are trying to persuade us to support it. We all know that we will have to get to this stage at some point. You, yourself, asked earlier on whether now is the right time. I think that, first of all, we really must adopt a report in September. We all know that it will still probably take years, perhaps even decades, until this is actually implemented. However, if we do not start now, we might not even succeed in putting it in place in the next few decades, either. Personally, I would like to still be around to see us become a real Parliament with a single transnational list, because even the German Federal Constitutional Court has called for this and observed that we will only have true legitimacy if we are able to be elected by any citizen of the Union. However, in order to still reach a compromise, I would recommend that – in order to accommodate the small States – we extend the group of people who are allowed to stand as candidates on the transnational list slightly, perhaps to 10%. Our group Chair, Mr Verhofstadt, mentioned this somewhat light-heartedly in his speech yesterday. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 The German Free Democratic Party delegation in the European Parliament assumes that the inclusion of Romania and Bulgaria in the Schengen area will further improve freedom of movement within the EU. Now that both Member States have achieved positive evaluation results in all areas of the Schengen review, there should be no more obstacles to delay inclusion further. There is no denying that technically securing borders will not automatically make them secure as long as problems persist in combating corruption in the justice and policing system. However, this challenge also concerns Member States already in the Schengen area. For this reason, the German Free Democratic Party delegation believes that criteria such as the fight against corruption must receive greater attention when evaluating the Schengen mechanism, and any misdemeanours must be punished appropriately.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it will be an important step in the right direction when we vote on the transparency register tomorrow, but no doubt this will not be the last word on the matter. Firstly, I am pleased that we have chosen a new name for the lobby register of the European Parliament, which dates back to 1996 and which is now to be known as the transparency register. I find it regrettable to see who will be required to register in order to obtain a one-year building pass – the list includes public institutions and bodies. As I have stated before, I can understand why it is necessary for a law society to register, but I find it harder to understand why public bodies which have never been active on a party-political level, and never will be, are also required to register. In the final analysis, irrespective of all the transparency achieved, it all comes down to the moral compass of each Member of this House, as this dictates what he thinks is right, whom he meets and whom he decides not to meet, whom he listens to and whom he decides not to listen to. After all, people also contact us using many other different communication channels. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, very few of our citizens are aware of the existence of European parties and foundations. Until now these have simply been umbrella organisations for their national member parties, established according to national laws, mainly Belgian laws in this case. What is it that these European parties do? They discuss European issues, hold party conferences and play an indispensable role in reforming the European Parliament’s electoral system. According to the Treaty of Lisbon, they are required to help establish European democracy – a political forum at European level. The own-initiative report to be voted on tomorrow calls on the Commission to reform the legal basis for these European parties. In future, these parties will be based on a European legal statute and will have a European legal personality. As liberals, we have campaigned to ensure that a clear distinction is made between recognition as a European party and an entitlement to funding, as there was a certain greed in evidence. It is also important that European parties should follow democratic principles in their internal workings, something that cannot be taken for granted. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 In the vote on the Lange report, I am abstaining on paragraph 31 because of the ambiguous wording of the vote, which refers to Eurobonds as well as project bonds. However, taking it as a whole, I am voting for the report, as I have nothing against project bonds in themselves. Project bonds serve as finance for extensive innovation, infrastructure and reindustrialisation projects. This is not a question of instruments for the communitarisation of debts, as would be the case with Eurobonds. Alexandra Thein,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we will pass our third resolution against the criminalisation of homosexuality in Uganda. Within a short space of time gay people have been declared fair game in Uganda. Even children or minors are affected. This is all due to the irresponsible actions of a US-based Christian sect and the call by local newspaper Rolling Stone for a hundred people whom it named as being gay to be hanged. Now David Kato – one such person publicly named as being gay – has been hammered to a pulp on a public street; this is, in fact, what we were hoping to prevent with our last resolution. We call on Uganda firstly to hold an independent investigation into the murder of David Kato and not to arrest just anybody for the crime. Further, we call on Uganda to prosecute those who call for the public murder of gay people. We also call on Uganda to revise its legislation. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I come from Berlin, and the whole world rejoiced with us Berliners when the border in our city fell and the borders opened everywhere in Eastern Europe. Now, in the case of Egypt, we reacted too late, too cautiously and, above all, too unemotionally. Where was our joy? Every other word from us was simply about ‘maintaining stability’. However, freedom is the most important thing for every person in the world. We Germans in particular know what we are talking about. What we had in Egypt was not stability; it was oppression. Freedom and stability can go hand in hand any time. Therefore, we should not dictate to the Egyptians who they should elect. Provided the elections proceed in a fair and democratic way, we will have to recognise the result and must not be so arrogant – as we were at the time in Palestine or even in Algeria – as to decide whether or not we will recognise those who are elected. We must recognise the choice that is made. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 In overall terms, the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament supports the waste disposal directive. However, the subject of photovoltaic modules remains a problem. There is no understandable reason for excluding the solar industry from the regulations. We have a wide range of legislation governing waste streams. Therefore, it is not clear why a complete industry, which is expected to produce significant waste streams, is being excluded, particularly as the solar industry is likely to be responsible for a large amount of waste in the near future, when the first solar cells installed on large numbers on European roofs have to be replaced. Solar cells may contain toxic substances which can be reused. For this reason, I have abstained from voting on the report. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, today we are discussing a motion for a resolution on the situation of Christians throughout the world in relation to freedom of religion. The European Parliament supports fundamental freedoms and human rights all over the world. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is one of the driving forces behind this support and this distinguishes us from the conservatives who are focusing specifically on the situation of Christians. In general terms, this is not just about the position of Christians. From a liberal perspective, this concerns freedom of religion as a whole. By this I mean all the religions throughout our entire world. It is about protection for religious minorities and the obligation of every state to protect to the best of its ability the members of those religious minorities which are under threat. We also have problems in Europe. I come from Berlin, and there alone, we have had six arson attacks against mosques within the space of six months, fortunately not resulting in any deaths, following the uproar sparked by a social-democratic former central banker. However, the German state is attempting to provide the best possible protection for religious buildings. In the same way, Egypt is also increasing the measures it is taking following the second major terrorist attack against Christians. Of course, we cannot have a policeman standing in front of every church, mosque or synagogue. I very much regret the fact that in many countries, including my own, Jewish buildings have come to look like high-security institutions. For this reason, it is important that we as politicians take responsibility for the attitude to religious minorities in our countries and that we promote an open, friendly approach to all religions.

 Madam President, Commissioner, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union ban discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union and Article 19 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union oblige the bodies of the EU and all the Member States to fight discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. Lithuania is a Member State of the EU and has thus undertaken to share these common values of the 500 million citizens of the Union. Firstly, I welcome the fact that following our first resolution in 2009, the planned act entered into force in Lithuania in a less severe form and that we have not yet become aware of any instance of this law having been applied, and that its application in respect of the ban on the Christopher Street Day Parade failed and the parade took place. I am all the more astonished, therefore, that new legislative measures are now being proposed under which speaking publicly about or providing information on homosexual relations could effectively result in fines of up to EUR 2 900 and there will no longer be equal opportunities for homosexual people – but at least for women. I therefore welcome the Commission’s strategy to combat homophobia and would particularly like to thank Commissioner Reding for emphasising the importance of protecting these fundamental rights through her attendance here in plenary when the time is nearly midnight.

 Mr President, only recently, we held an international workshop in the large plenary chamber of our Parliamentary building in Brussels on Parental Responsibility and the Protection of Children, which I had the honour of leading. In Europe, there are more and more vulnerable and abandoned children who should not be living permanently in orphanages. It is therefore our duty as legislators to strengthen the right to international adoption within the EU in order to help these children. Article 24 of our Charter of Fundamental Rights also demands this when it states: ‘Children shall have the right to such protection and care as is necessary for their wellbeing’. Although we have the Hague Adoption Convention and a Council of Europe convention, these are not enough. In practice, major legal problems still arise in connection with international adoptions. In these cases, only international regulations which eliminate the differences in national regulations that still exist and replace them with clear and simple principles can help. In this regard, and with all our legislative zeal, we must not lose sight of the fact that the EU must cooperate with the Hague Conference on International Private Law in order to ensure a coordinated procedure. Thus, the EU should not reinvent the wheel in this area. I welcome the Commissioner’s statements in this regard. Alexandra Thein,

 Mr President, the United Nations Convention on Human Rights, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as well as the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, ban discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. The European Union not only has obligations in relation to human rights within its territory, but also an international duty to insist on compliance with these rights and to criticise abuses when dealing with third countries, particularly when we provide financial support through the European Development Fund to third countries like Uganda, which have entered into partnership agreements with us. Accordingly, we actually have the right to comment when these third countries fail to meet the human rights requirements set down in such partnership agreements. Hence, Uganda must respect international human rights standards because it was party to the Cotonou Agreement, which sets down our organised development aid to the ACP countries. Just one year ago, we called on Uganda not to follow through on its plans for a law to criminalise homosexuals. One year on, the situation has deteriorated. There is still the threat of long prison sentences or even the death penalty. With others, I myself demonstrated in front of the Ugandan Embassy in May of this year. This had no effect. We wish to emphasise once again that the EU is generally opposed to the death penalty and to homophobic legislation of this kind. Alexandra Thein,

 Mr President, what is meant by better lawmaking? We want to make simple and transparent laws that EU citizens and companies can understand. In this regard, it is important, above all, to respect the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. We want to regulate at European level only what cannot be regulated at national or local level. An important element of better lawmaking is, above all, having a clear idea of the impact of the planned regulations. Only with this can we achieve the best possible effects and, at the same time, keep any negative impact to a minimum. The impact assessment must therefore be prepared by the Commission with the greatest possible meticulousness. It is right, therefore, that, under pressure from the European Parliament, an independent board was set up to monitor the quality of impact assessments. However, this board is intended to be accountable to the European Parliament. For companies, authorities and citizens, the regulations are associated with costs, whether it is in relation to providing information, labelling products or complying with monitoring obligations. If the costs are too high, it cancels out the benefit of a policy. We therefore have the ambitious goal, which is also the right one, of reducing administrative costs by reducing red tape by 25% by 2012. To achieve this goal we need to act at European level, and the chances of achieving it are good. However, at this point it should also be mentioned that a good third – some people say two thirds – of the administrative burden that is derived from the EU is due to the fact that the Member States simply enact too many unnecessary administrative and bureaucratic regulations when transposing EU law. EU bodies and Member States should therefore actively work together to prevent unnecessary red tape. The transposition of Community law must also be fundamentally and actively scrutinised. Above all, the national parliaments should also fulfil their obligation for involvement in accordance with the Treaty of Lisbon. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Israel for taking seriously the many concerns about its proposed legislation and for at least watering down the provisions slightly. Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have, for many years, been required to disclose their sources of funding in a completely transparent way and even to publish this information on their websites. The planned legislation, even in its watered-down form, is ultimately aimed only at specific NGOs: firstly at human rights organisations and secondly at those which receive public funding. This includes, for example, public money from the United Nations or the European Union. In contrast, far-right groups or non-governmental organisations which are privately funded and which, for example, support the building of illegal settlements, are not subject to any legal restrictions and do not have to make their funding sources public. The problem with the proposed legislation lies in this unequal treatment. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, firstly I want to reject the numerous accusations from outside and, in some cases, from within Parliament, claiming that we are discussing this subject at the wrong time, after the peace talks have begun. The parliamentary question which I helped to draw up was tabled at a time when none of us thought that direct peace talks would start up again. I have been involved in this area since the early 1990s and this subject has been under discussion in Parliament for a long time. This is ultimately all about preventing the Lower Jordan River from finally running dry. The lower part of the river has already been reduced to a mere trickle. It consists only of waste water and contains no fresh water at all. All the scientists are agreed that the Lower Jordan River will be as good as dead in one or two years. I find it disturbing that the resolution addresses Israel, Jordan, Syria and the Palestinian Authority on equal terms. The Lower Jordan River area is located entirely in zone C, which means that the Palestinian Authority does not even have a right to access the area, never mind any administrative rights or any influence at all over it. It has already been said that the Palestinian Authority can do nothing in this area. Therefore, this resolution should be aimed at other countries. When a country, in this case Israel, uses 75% of the water available in the Lower Jordan River, although part of the water has already been taken by other countries, and leaves almost no water for the Palestinians to live on, this is a political issue. This problem was supposedly resolved in the Oslo II Agreement and we have not made any progress since then. The specific difficulty at the moment is that the Palestinians are constantly attempting to drill wells, which are immediately destroyed, and also that the Israeli water authority, which is a monopoly, is not drilling wells for the Palestinians, but only for the illegal settlements.

Madam President, Commissioner, the financial crisis has highlighted that a uniform financial supervisory authority is an absolute necessity for the European Union. The three EU-wide supervisory authorities which are envisaged for banking, insurance and securities should thereby be provided with the right to intervene directly in national institutions, such as Deutsche Bank. These intervention rights are restricted to absolutely exceptional cases and will hopefully never be used. As a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I regret that the committee responsible has not given any consideration to our constitutional objections regarding the envisaged intervention rights, both at European and national level, especially in the wake of the Lisbon judgment of the German Federal Constitutional Court. A recommendation from the Committee on Legal Affairs, whereby the Commission, as guardian of the treaties, would act as the final decision-making authority within the framework of a set procedure, or, in other words, have the last say, was not followed. On this point, the Committee on Legal Affairs recognises that the technical expertise required to make judgments is indisputably available in the national and European supervisory authorities and not in the Commission. I hope that during the current negotiations, too, a solution will also be found to this constitutional problem. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

Along with the majority of Members in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I have decided to vote in favour of the Sommer report. It is true that the Liberals were not able to achieve their goals in every area. The adoption of origin labelling for meat and milk in processed products is a regrettable move, because it imposes significant costs on producers and seems almost impossible to implement in practice. However, for me, the positive results of the vote outweigh the negative ones. For the first time, we have uniform regulations on food labelling throughout the entire internal market, with no possibility of individual countries going it alone. In addition, one of the decisive successes of this vote for me is the fact that the misleading traffic light model was rejected. A mandatory colour coded nutrient declaration will not be permitted either at a European or a national level. Uniform Europe-wide labelling rules will bring clear advantages for companies and consumers. The cost of manufacturing and selling products will fall because manufacturers will only have to follow a single regulation. Consumers will benefit from uniform nutrient labelling when comparing products that come from within Europe. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the security and law enforcement authorities are working ever closer together to improve the cross-border prosecution of crimes in order to protect the safety of citizens in the European Union. In this regard, I could mention the European Arrest Warrant, for example. In return, however, the fundamental rights of citizens accused of crimes are being left out of the legislation. Up to now, all attempts to secure the guarantees afforded by the rule of law in criminal proceedings throughout the EU have failed to achieve the requisite unanimity in the Council or to receive mutual recognition. With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, we now have new opportunities for protecting the basic procedural rights of citizens in criminal proceedings. Now, for the first time, the European Parliament has the power of codecision, and only a qualified majority is now required in the Council. As you know, we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are in favour of protecting and continuing to extend citizens’ rights. Therefore, we have also worked to ensure that, in future, all EU citizens will have the right to an interpreter and to a written translation if they are arrested by the police or brought before a court as an accused person in a Member State whose language they do not speak or understand. It is vital not only that criminal proceedings be better coordinated across borders, but also that the rights of citizens in criminal investigations and proceedings – for example, the right to a fair trial – be adequately available to citizens throughout Europe.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I simply cannot understand how anyone can be against freeing micro-entities – and I stress micro-entities, not small or medium-sized businesses – from annual accounting obligations. Here we are not talking about the export-oriented medium-sized company from Baden-Württemberg with a hundred employees, but small craft enterprises, the flower shop, the baker around the corner, the newly founded IT start-up business. For years, politicians have been repeating over and over, both at national and European level, that precisely these micro-entities must be relieved. Relieved from unnecessary costs, in this case, unnecessary costs for a tax advisor, not from the otherwise essential costs – in Belgium it is lawyers who complete these annual accounts, in France auditors – and relieved from an unnecessary amount of work and administrative burdens, now more than ever in the current financial and economic crisis. Now that the Commission has finally tabled the proposal, which Parliament has called on it to do for so long, all of a sudden, the sceptics and nay-sayers express concerns. Only seven per cent of the micro-entities that we are talking about are involved in cross-border activities. Therefore, with regard to the principle of subsidiarity, there should not be any regulation at all at European level. To make matters worse, the accounting rules have continued to be oriented towards the needs of large and medium-sized businesses, and have been totally inappropriate for the micro-entities we are talking about here from the outset. I hear the arguments of the opposition, firstly, that the micro-entrepreneur might need a loan and then not be able to present his bank with anything. I say to you, anyone who is familiar with Basel II knows that for the bank, the annual balance sheet is at best a nice bonus, but nothing more. Secondly, the supposed creditor protection: creditors who depend on the annual balance sheet are in the minority. In all my time as a lawyer, when a business of this size is sold, I have never experienced a buyer depending on the significance of annual accounts in whatever form. Thirdly, the southern Member States of the European Union – yes, precisely those that right now are the subject of constant inglorious reports in our newspapers – want to maintain the old regulation. They can do this as the regulation is optional. However, states that demand annual financial statements from micro-enterprises because they do not have effective tax administration and exercise no control, apart from the receipt of the annual financial statement, should hardly be surprised if they have missing tax revenue or tax fraud. I therefore call on all MEPs, in particular, the Social Democrats, to approve this sensible regulation, especially as Mr Lehne from our Committee on Legal Affairs took all concerns into account through compromise regulations, subsequent to which no further relevant arguments were put forward.

According to the resolution of the European Parliament on the draft general budget for the financial year 2010, adopted on 17 December 2009, a vote was taken today on the amending budget for the European Parliament, following the revised calculations made by the Parliamentary administration. The FDP in the European Parliament abstained, because there was a paragraph in the package of amendments concerned that we could not reconcile with our convictions. The FDP had already expressed its opposition to an increase in the secretarial allowance to EUR 1 500 during the discussions in committee. It is out of the secretarial allowance that MEPs’ assistants are paid. The FDP considers that the argument that more money is needed due to the additional work that MEPs have to do with the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is unsound, as there is nothing in past experience to support this. Certainly, due to the Treaty of Lisbon, which has just come into force, Parliament will overall need extra capacity for legislative work, but with the introduction of the Assistants’ Statute from the beginning of the current parliamentary term, there is still no proof that MEPs actually need more assistants. For this reason, there are grounds for concern that further demands and supplementary increases, or an extension of office capacity, will follow. For this reason, the FDP in the European Parliament abstained. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

This is regrettable, particularly on Israel’s part, because, however controversial the Goldstone report might be, any state that calls itself a democratic state based on the rule of law is obliged to allow such serious accusations to be subjected to an independent investigation. An internal military investigation by the Israeli army, which is itself under suspicion, is not sufficient. If the EU takes its own principles of respect for human rights and international law seriously, it must increase the pressure on both sides, including in the context of its bilateral relations, and insist that the investigation that has been called for into possible violations of international and humanitarian law is carried out according to the principles of the rule of law. War crimes must be punished under international law, as has been said here many times. If necessary, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court will have to carry out the investigations on the basis of Article 12(3) of the Rome Statute. However, irrespective of the Goldstone report, there is currently no reason to continue the siege on Gaza. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mrs Malmström, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I am a member of the delegation for relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council, in other words, the Palestinian parliament. Last week, our delegation was refused entry to Gaza by Israel. The situation in Gaza is very disturbing, particularly now that winter has come. Only 10% of the population can obtain the supplies they need by smuggling goods through the tunnels and this is exactly why the tunnels are tolerated by everyone. Before operation ‘Cast Lead’ the situation was exactly the reverse and 90% of the population of Gaza could take care of themselves. As an occupying power, Israel should be responsible for providing for the population in all the occupied areas. Israel is shirking its responsibility under international law, which means that the international community and, above all, the EU have to step in. If we are supplying food to 90% of the population of Gaza, we have a right to see where European taxpayers’ money is being spent, whether it is being used appropriately and whether it is reaching the people who need it.

 The German Free Democratic Party members of the European Parliament have abstained from voting on the Copenhagen resolution for the following reasons. The resolution contains statements about financing for climate protection measures in third countries without defining the specific criteria or purpose of the financing. We cannot justify this to taxpayers. In addition, we believe that blanket criticism of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) is wrong. The ICAO is the organisation which deals with aviation matters at an international level. Both the criticism and the statement about the alleged failure of ICAO negotiations are incorrect and inappropriate. The call for specific arrangements for a CO2
 trading system for the aviation industry goes against current EU legislation and overburdens the EU’s negotiating position in an international climate agreement with unrealistic demands. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

I voted for the Protocol as I believe that it will benefit the European Union. The Protocol is not the right instrument to address the issue of human rights abuses. Such considerations should be included in the human rights clause of the agreement itself. It is sufficiently clear that Israeli settlements in Palestinian territories should not profit from this Protocol. The Protocol does not imply recognition of these settlements under international law. Britta Reimers,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we now have three years of discussions and negotiations under our belts in a process that occasionally stalled and sometimes got quite tough. We set ourselves the goal of simplifying the quality systems, ensuring the reliability of quality and also establishing a way to get better prices for farmers. We did not succeed in controlling marketing standards or the regulation of supply. We now intend doing this in the common organisation of the markets. Overall, however, it must said that we have taken a first step towards a uniform quality policy. The long time spent in negotiations also shows how much we have struggled among ourselves to reach an agreement and that it is not always easy to make progress at first reading. The agreement has now also been confirmed by the Council. Speaking on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I have no choice other than to support the compromise before us and to ask you to support the amendments. We have failed to achieve a lot of what we wanted. The ALDE Group was not happy with the introduction of another new quality characteristic like the mountain products, however when one considers what has been achieved overall as a package, then we can support this. I think our colleagues will also be satisfied with this. Britta Reimers,

 Mr President, Ms Reding, ladies and gentlemen, the last reform of the sugar regime was a very positive development and the industry adapted to the market as a result. However, the complaints from all sides show that we need to go further and that we must continue to develop the sugar market, because the Commission’s forecasts were not accurate. The African, Caribbean and Pacific States have not been supplying Europe with sugar. Instead, they have sold it to other countries, because markets all over the world have changed. They have undergone huge changes in recent years, but not in the way that was predicted. Demand has grown in many third countries and we were not able to foresee this. This means that demand for sugar has increased all over the world and, therefore, that there have been reductions in supplies to the European market. The problem is that sugar is not the only product of the agricultural industry, and so farmers have also had to adapt increasingly to the requirements of the market. They are considering alternative crops. For example, in my area of Germany, energy crops are being cultivated and they are genuine competitors for sugar beet. In the course of the market reform, we should discuss whether it is time to abolish the quota regulations that apply to the sugar market and to give it more freedom in future. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we need to take note of the fact that we are discussing two subjects here. I will not, at this point, say anything about the voluntary labelling of the meat; I will stick mainly to the electronic identification of the animals. In that connection, Mr Schnellhardt, I need to disagree with you quite stridently. Sheep farmers are telling us very clearly that they have major problems with electronic identification, as there are technical shortcomings with it. The tags are not coming out of the animals, but the technology is malfunctioning. The fault that occurs as a result is blamed on the farmers. That is not acceptable, and it is a situation that we must avoid in the case of cattle. It is therefore right that we should leave this system as voluntary in cattle in future, too, until the system has matured. As a farmer, I am not saying that the system should not be developed or introduced, but allowing something to mature takes time. Moreover, it is important – for public health in particular – to call electronic identification into question if it does not work. As regards public health, it is quite clear that we need certainty. As long as that certainty is not in place, we should stick to a voluntary system. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Since a postponement of the vote on the ACTA in order to be able to evaluate and take into account the pending ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union was not possible, I abstained from voting. With regard to tackling product piracy and strengthening copyright, ACTA is something that I could support. Nevertheless, the fears and concerns of a section of the population, which feels its freedoms will be restricted by ACTA, must be taken into account.

It is important that we take up a clear position in this transitional year. I would also like to emphasise that I welcome the constructive way in which we have worked together and I hope that we can continue to work even more constructively in future, because in the past, we were often only able to make progress on agricultural reform in fits and starts.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, ever since it was decided to abandon the milk quota, people have been watching you closely, Commissioner, to see how you behave and what action you are taking to exit the scheme in a rational way. Is there really any pattern discernible here? We have had a year of regional over-production and a rise in global production, which is hardly surprising since there was previously a shortage on the market, leading to higher prices. In addition, over the last two years there has been a rise in operating costs of about 20 %, principally due to direct and indirect rises in energy costs. The market reacted in the normal way to the increased supply and came under pressure. This caused prices to drop. The market is now stabilising again because the farmers are displaying an ability to manage the market and are slowing their production more than is usual for the season. The criticised price decreases have led to a rise in demand in the market. The decline in the euro exchange rate promotes marketability in the global market, making European dairy produce competitive. In the case of cheese, stocks have been reduced to such an extent that more milk is now needed for cheese production. In other words, this is a normal market cycle. Now we come to the Commission: if the market is working, why do we need a super levy? Is its sole purpose to acquire funds for the EU? Has the time perhaps come to put the super levy on a European footing, finally transferring it from a national administrative level?

 The German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament has spoken out clearly in favour of the introduction of a debt redemption fund. However, participation in such a fund must be associated with clear and strict rules, such as were contained in the proposal made by the German Council of Economic Experts to the German Government in autumn 2011. Watering down the criteria for participation is neither productive nor effective. Linking the introduction of a debt redemption fund with the eurobonds project and the treatment of economic imbalances is unfair, and is rejected by the FDP in the European Parliament in the strongest possible terms.

Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, it is utterly astounding that we are to decide here on the future of the common agricultural policy, but have had essential criteria for this decision withheld from us. There is nothing to prevent a new delimitation of less-favoured areas being carried out. It is also acceptable to try to base this on fewer criteria than is currently the case. However, if these are to be limited to eight criteria, made up of climate-related and geological criteria, it is unacceptable for MEPs to be denied the opportunity to scrutinise whether these criteria are indeed appropriate. We need maps of the new distribution of less-favoured areas in order to be able to examine whether this new distribution based on the eight criteria makes any sense at all. However, the withholding of the map material will obviously arouse distrust as to whether there really is any desire at all to enable Parliament to exercise its right of codecision. As a farmer, I have serious doubts from a purely professional point of view as to whether these simple criteria will enable this sort of area classification to be made appropriately. There are, after all, other criteria that could convey disadvantage, such as a lack of infrastructure, labour market access or general historical farm structures. Moreover, different combinations of various criteria could lead to very different results. It is high time that we were able to evaluate the Commission’s proposals in an objective way in order to be able to improve them if necessary. Otherwise, I would agree with my fellow Members who wish to leave less-favoured areas out of the current agricultural reform discussion. Britta Reimers,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, within the last year, a new viral disease has been discovered in sheep and cattle that leads to deformity or even still-birth among lambs and calves. The disease is apparently communicated by midges, which also seem to have been responsible for carrying it into the EU. The affected farms have suffered serious damage, in some cases even fighting for survival, and have been left to fend for themselves until now. We are all agreed that technically correct monitoring is essential for new diseases so that it is possible to determine, on a scientific basis, whether or not it is a new epizootic. This requires time, however, and time is precisely what the affected parties at local level do not have. They need help. Funds based on mutuality, such as an animal disease fund, require mandatory notification in order to be able to distribute financial assistance. When will the Commission finally develop a standard strategy for new diseases that clearly defines when remedial measures and assistance can be provided to those affected by new diseases, in addition to the monitoring services? We are running out of time. The disease is continuing to spread. Trading partners outside Europe are responding with export embargos, so that the damage is also spreading to non-infected farms. The insemination and breeding livestock trade is restricted, despite the fact that the disease is spread by midges and direct infection seems unlikely. How does the Commission intend to proceed in relation to export embargos? Climate change and increased trade and mobility in society will lead to a rise in diseases entering our territory. We need a rational concept to reduce the consequences. We need answers for those affected that will help them and us all. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 I have voted against the motion for a resolution on the feasibility of introducing stability bonds because I am of the opinion that the creation of Eurobonds would send out the wrong signal. Since the introduction of the euro, low interest rates have led to higher debt levels in many euro area countries.

Therefore, I believe that the introduction of Eurobonds would make the current crisis worse. Britta Reimers,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Nicholson for his successful handling of the negotiations. We have decided on the abolition of the existing cost-intensive and market-distorting milk quota system and analysed the findings of the high level group for milk. The dairy package that has resulted from the negotiations is an important first step towards a market and competition-oriented dairy sector. The formation of inter-branch organisations is being promoted, with these organisations to be given the ability to negotiate contracts on behalf of their members. The negotiating power of milk producers is to be bolstered – in future they will be able to negotiate on an equal footing, if they so wish. It is also good that we will not be overshooting the mark. These contracts will not be permitted to make up more than 33% of the national and 3.5% of the European market. This ensures that there will be no new imbalance and that the necessary market freedom is retained. As there is no general requirement for contracts, farmers’ individual commercial freedom to make decisions remains secure. This is an important element of a functional market. We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will support the dairy package, and I ask you all to vote in favour of this package in tomorrow’s vote in plenary.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we need functioning markets with scope for competition in Europe. We will only achieve this, however, when everyone has equal rights. The role of farmers in the market is that of relatively small sole traders. Upstream and downstream of them, by contrast, we often see quite large business structures. I therefore welcome the fact that the Commission is, for once, looking into the market not only from the consumer point of view, but also from that of producers. If we have imbalances, we need to find ways to tackle them without giving rise to excessive bureaucracy and without creating new imbalances elsewhere. We all know how sensitively markets react. In these times of the debt crisis, in particular, that is something we see day in, day out. It is therefore important to test the waters carefully if we intervene. Markets need sensible frameworks in order to facilitate a minimum level of balance. However, they also need enough freedom to act and to be able to do so. Agriculture cannot be excepted from this principle. Only a balance of freedom and responsibility will enable all market participants to make the most of their advantages and thus help bring about long-term growth and prosperity.

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since their discovery, antibiotics have played a major role in the treatment of infectious diseases in human and veterinary medicine. However, the super weapon seems to be losing its effectiveness. I agree with the authors of the motion for a resolution that we need to be more prudent and more careful with antimicrobial agents. The aim must be to limit the use of antibiotics to the essential curing of infections. We also need incentives for further research and development of new agents and alternative solutions. However, it is vital that we all pull in the same direction.

 I am 100% behind Mr Duff’s resolution. It is right and important to draw attention to the situation of the population of Western Sahara. The Moroccan authorities must provide information on the extent to which its economic activities relating to the natural resources in the territory of Western Sahara are for the benefit of the population of the territory and in accordance with their wishes. The status of the region under international law must be clarified. A court ruling on the territory of Western Sahara would bring about clarity in respect of relations between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco. Nonetheless, this resolution comes at the wrong time. Had it been passed, the resolution would have de facto
 blocked the EU’s fisheries agreement with Morocco, since this expires on 28 February 2012, and it is unlikely that the European Court of Justice would have passed a ruling by this date. Had this resolution been passed, it would have sent out the wrong signal to our Moroccan partners. Morocco is the only country in North Africa to have succeeded in initiating reforms to bring about democracy by peaceful means. This process should not be disrupted. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 In terms of social and economic policy, I believe it to be fundamentally right to increase the proportion of women in management positions. However, I have deliberately voted against the report, because paragraph 16b calls for the Europe-wide introduction of quotas for women. This is going too far. A mandatory quota will interfere on a large scale with companies’ freedom to do business and is therefore questionable from a constitutional perspective. In addition, an across-the-board quota does not take into consideration the specific circumstances of each company and industry. For example, it would not currently be possible to impose a standard quota in the construction, engineering or IT industries in Germany. In this area, it is essential to focus initially on training and study opportunities in order to bring about a significant increase in the proportion of young women employed in these traditionally male-dominated industries. In addition, we need to improve conditions for working parents, in particular, by introducing family-conscious, flexible work models and developing the child care infrastructure. Against this background, I would rather see a voluntary undertaking by companies and cooperation between the worlds of politics and business instead of an inflexible, mandatory quota.

In my opinion, it exacerbates the problem of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), rather than resolving it. We need a standard, EU-wide solution.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his persistent and positive work. Where the future of agricultural policy after 2013 is concerned, we have to decide the direction in which we want to go. Do we want an agricultural sector that faces up to the challenges by acting in an innovative, modern, courageous, self-aware, responsible and independent way in the market? Or do we want an agricultural sector that continues to be drip-fed by Europe and which needs its hand to be held and encouraging words from Mummy with each step it takes into the future? That is the course we are currently setting. To cope with the challenges of the future we need to promote modern technologies in the agricultural sector instead of having endless debates on ideologies. If farms are to be enabled to plan with certainty then we cannot keep changing course every couple of years. It is too much of a strain on our farmers’ finances. Everyone here must surely be aware that each political change of direction results in new laws and directives, which in turn demand investment by farms without at the same time increasing their incomes. We should not care whether a farm is large or small; instead we should be concerned with whether it is run in an economically sound manner. We should not care whether it produces conventionally or organically, so long as it handles resources responsibly. We should also not care how many animals are kept, so long as those animals are treated well. The important thing for us must be that we have sufficient good quality food in the future at affordable prices in Europe. After all, Europe is not alone in the world. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 The German Free Democratic Party delegation in the European Parliament assumes that the inclusion of Romania and Bulgaria in the Schengen area will further improve freedom of movement within the EU. Now that both Member States have achieved positive evaluation results in all areas of the Schengen review, there should be no more obstacles to delay inclusion further. There is no denying that the technical securing of borders will not automatically make them impermeable as long as problems persist in combating corruption in the justice and policing system. Accordingly, this challenge also relates to Member States already in the Schengen area. For this reason, the German Free Democratic Party delegation believes that criteria such as the fight against corruption must receive greater attention when evaluating the Schengen mechanism, and any misdemeanours must be punished appropriately.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for many companies in the European Union, the continual rise in fuel prices represents an additional burden. European fishermen in particular are suffering as a result of this price rise because they cannot simply compensate for the additional costs by increasing their catch or by charging better prices. The current political situation in North Africa and the Middle East has exacerbated the problem. We therefore need to investigate the effects of the rise in fuel prices on the economy and employment in the EU. Which sectors are particularly at risk and what sort of support could be provided without it distorting competition? We therefore call on the Commission to look into this. It is important that we support the European fishing industry, among other things, in order not to increase our dependence on imports from third countries. We are on the verge of reforming the common fisheries policy and therefore, we are under a particular obligation to be cautious and not to act prematurely with regard to this matter either.

 Mr President, Mrs Damanaki, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that Parliament is finally to vote on this issue and would like to thank the rapporteurs for their work. The amendment to the Council regulation on the financial measures in the Community is one of the main tools we need in order to implement the common fisheries policy. This is true in particular for the areas of international fishery relations, data collection and scientific studies. The control systems of the common fisheries policy and their implementation are particularly important. The rapporteur has made every effort to convince his fellow Members of the need to increase the co-financing rate to a maximum of 75%. We have been unable to acquiesce to his wishes. The existing regulations have proven themselves in practice and already allow for some exceptions. The Member States already make use of the opportunity to avail of co-financing and there is no need for any further incentives. It is important that the amendment to the regulation should clear the way for a coherent legal framework. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

Madam President, market fluctuations are important for the proper functioning of markets in order to create incentives for the buying and selling of goods. For us farmers, commodity futures trading is a basic component of the buying and selling of harvested crops. It provides an important opportunity to achieve planning certainty through the early setting of prices and quantities. In contrast to the situation in our prosperous industrialised nations, rising food prices are a particular problem in the poor regions of the world where people have to spend a large proportion of their income on food. We must not intervene in the markets every time the prices change in an attempt to combat natural fluctuations. However, without internationally applicable framework legislation for the financial markets, we cannot even start to think about regulating the commodities markets, because if there is too much money in the financial market it will find suitable equivalents, and commodities are currently highly regarded. Therefore, we should not be surprised if agricultural commodities are now also a sought-after trading objective. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the current dioxin incident is more than just a scandal. The people of Europe have been shown their reflection. How long have we been complaining that there is an extreme fight for prices and survival going on in agriculture, fuelled by the insatiable demand for ever cheaper food. For a long time now, this fight has been more than simply a trial of strength. Individuals are increasingly resorting to criminal means and methods. However, we will all lose out in the end as a result. We can enact more laws and directives, we can carry out more checks at even more cost, we can impose more severe penalties – none of these things will succeed against the criminal energy fuelled by such a tough fight for existence. We must finally tackle the causes of this problem. We must at last put an end to the constant demand for more and cheaper food. As a farmer, I have experienced the powerlessness against the criminal activities of certain individuals – as in this case – on my own doorstep. Together with my professional colleagues, I have shuddered at the thought of who will be next in line and innocently drawn into this maelstrom. I would therefore like to ask the Commission: what do you and your colleagues intend to do to restore the value of food? I welcome your proposals, but with these you will not solve the main problem.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have known for twelve years that battery farming practices would be banned in the EU from 1 January 2012 onwards. How can it be that twelve years have not been enough for some Member States to implement this ban in good time and to prepare their poultry industry accordingly? This is just one of many examples of how poor implementation leads to frustration. Egg producers in Member States who have implemented the changes in good time are already experiencing competitive anomalies that run counter to the principles of the EU. I am calling on the Commission to require that the relevant law should be upheld in all Member States and to do all it can to ensure that it is implemented. Eggs should no longer be produced in battery cages after January 2012 and the then illegal eggs should no longer be allowed to reach the shops, putting an end to their negative effect on competition. The farmers who have changed their practices to comply with EU requirements should not experience financial disadvantage while those who flout the changeover reap the economic benefits. It is impossible to explain to people in Europe why EU law does not apply equally in all Member States and why some Member States are always seen to be dragging their feet. The recent crises show where this can lead us. We need a Europe that acts in a concerted way, rather than one in which every member can do as it pleases, regardless of the rest. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Madam President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, one of our top priorities as Members of the European Parliament is to reduce bureaucracy and simplify legislation and regulations in all the political areas of the European Union. This is the only way in which we can manage taxpayers’ money efficiently and increase the acceptance of our political decisions among the citizens of Europe. For this reason, it is important for farmers to feel the direct effect of simplification measures of this kind in the agricultural sector. Their job is to produce food, not to write books. At a time when local authority budgets are becoming increasingly tight, it is also important for us to reduce the amount of work to be done by their administrative staff. Regulations must be drawn up in such a way that they are not padded out unnecessarily. In addition, we must ensure that the sanctions we impose are in proportion to the breach of regulations. An efficient, long-term policy is characterised by the fact that it places a greater emphasis on advice than it does on punishment. This is the only way that we can give our citizens and our farmers the incentives to implement new findings and to fulfil society’s requirements. We need to take all of this into account when we discuss the future common agricultural policy. We also need to focus more closely on ensuring that there is no duplication of formalities and controls and that forms are only filled out when they provide real added value for the administrative bodies and for the farmers themselves.

 Madam President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, providing protection for bees is in the best interests of the agricultural sector and many farmers are also beekeepers. We have seen a decline in the bee population in many regions of Europe. We must identify the causes of this problem and take the necessary countermeasures. It is a good thing that the budget funding for the national bee programmes up to 2013 has been increased from EUR 26 million to EUR 32 million. However, that is not enough. We must ensure that these programmes are continued after 2013. In order to achieve this, it is also particularly important for us to improve and simplify the process which allows researchers, beekeepers and farmers to share specialist knowledge. We should focus as soon as possible on combating the diseases and parasites to which bees are subject. We must not leave the beekeepers to fight this battle on their own. We urgently need better and more standardised statistics from all the Member States throughout the EU. This is because we need to work with facts and not just with speculation. As the number of beekeepers is constantly falling, we also need to invest more in education and training. We should provide more support for young beekeepers and also for full-time beekeepers, to ensure that the profession has a future and does not die out. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports this resolution. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks to the rapporteurs. In view of the high level of imports of fish and fish products into the EU, it is essential that we maintain and support our local fishermen, as well as the domestic aquaculture sector. We urgently need improved catch methods in order to secure the long-term livelihood of both our seas and our fishermen. It is equally essential that we enable aquaculture to expand further. We are in urgent need of more effective data collection and more intensive research, since only once we know what is actually going on will we be able to make the right decisions for the future. Our lack of success in combining economics with ecology – which are not actually that different – is often down to excessive bureaucracy and insufficient knowledge. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 The motion for a resolution on the crisis in the livestock sector which has been adopted by the European Parliament calls for the introduction of new market management mechanisms in the livestock industry and of safety nets in all the cereal sectors. I oppose these market interventions. However, the motion for a resolution also includes important liberal requirements for pragmatic thresholds for GMOs in imported feeds and a review of the ban on feeding meat and bone meal. Therefore, I did not vote against the resolution, but instead abstained in the final vote. In order to guarantee a supply of feed for the European livestock sector, we must relieve farmers of their burden of red tape and create a framework of legal certainty. A market focus in the agricultural industry will also mean that farmers can take responsibility for their own businesses and need not expect constant protective interventions in the market to be made by politicians. If agricultural policy is based only on individual interests, the result will be a spiral of exemptions which it will not be possible to finance and which will distort the market. This will turn farmers into the victims of a bureaucratic, state-run control system. In order for the market to function effectively, we need a clearly defined framework for the entire agricultural industry and not just for individual areas. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, integrated maritime policy is a forward-looking area. The oceans are being used increasingly intensively for transport, maritime economic activities, offshore energy and fishing, and the development of these areas must be coordinated. The space available is limited and, therefore, the various maritime sectors must take a responsible and thoughtful approach to working together. The use and the protection of the seas must not conflict with one another. These two areas are mutually dependent, because the oceans can only support us if they are healthy. I would like to highlight the positive cooperation between countries bordering on the Baltic who are working together to promote the dynamic development of the fisheries, the environment, the infrastructure and tourism in coastal regions. We must continue to focus on the fishing industry, which is in a weak position and is often regarded as being a low priority, but which, because it provides us with food, represents a vital link in the coastal economy. I would like to congratulate Mrs Meissner on this positive report. Britta Reimers,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Convention on Future Multilateral Cooperation in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries established a very important organisation: the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation, or NAFO. Its aim is the conservation and optimum utilisation of the fishery resources in the Northwest Atlantic. The convention has since been amended and brought more into line with other regional conventions. Modern concepts such as stock management have been incorporated. I feel it is important that the structure of the organisation is streamlined and that the obligations of the contracting parties are clearly defined. It is also good that the possibility of resolving conflicts through a dispute settlement procedure is provided. The fishing possibilities accruing to the European Union under the convention are of great interest to the EU. Parliament should give its approval under the new powers granted to it by the Treaty of Lisbon. As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I commend Mr Wałesa’s report to the House. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the distribution of profits in the food supply chain has become unbalanced, and generally to the detriment of farmers. That is the correct conclusion drawn in this report. Unfortunately, the rapporteur has focused on the old instruments of agricultural policy. He believes that farmers’ incomes can be improved by regulating supply in the manner of a planned economy. Experience tells us that planned economies go hand in hand with greater bureaucracy, but our farmers want to produce – they do not want more paperwork. Measures that are not based on the basic principles of a social market economy have failed in the past. A planned economy has not worked in the agricultural sector in recent decades. A social market economy, on the other hand, offers farmers the opportunity to run a successful business. If we are to improve the situation of farmers, then we must ensure that the European farming sector is competitive in the long term. To achieve this, it is essential that we improve the bargaining position of farmers vis-à-vis the other actors in the food supply chain. This can be achieved by means of a fair and transparent market that is also capable of holding its own in the global market. At present, I have my doubts as to whether I can vote in favour of the report. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank our rapporteur for his constructive cooperation and for the important aspects highlighted by his report on the future of the CAP after 2013. This report calls for further development of the existing common agricultural policy rather than the development of a new policy. This is a good thing. The primary function of agriculture is and remains the production of food for our citizens. The ever-increasing need for public goods, the growth in population numbers and the simultaneous shortage of natural resources make this more difficult to achieve. Farmers are required to produce more and more with less and less. This is impossible without increasing efficiency. The European Parliament, the Commission and the Council are responsible for securing the necessary framework conditions for this. If we in Europe want to maintain a healthy and diverse agricultural sector in the future, we will also need to take account of the needs of farmers, namely by imposing as little bureaucracy as necessary and by allowing as much entrepreneurial freedom as possible to enable them to earn a reasonable income for themselves.

 Mr President, Commissioners, I would like to congratulate Mr Cadec on his successful and balanced report. I would also like to thank him for his excellent cooperation. There are major challenges involved in regulating the import of fishery and aquaculture products into the EU. With a volume of 12 million tonnes and a value of EUR 55 billion, the EU fisheries market is the largest in the world. This market is growing rapidly and is increasingly dependent on imports from third countries. It is therefore important for us to control the conditions under which the products from third countries are produced and imported. We have now submitted two amendments in plenary. These relate to the need for us to recognise the special economic situation in the peripheral regions of Europe. However, we do not hold market liberalisation alone responsible for the difficulties. The huge introduction of fish products onto the EU market, which has been described as unfair, also has no direct effect on... (The President cut off the speaker) Britta Reimers  (ALDE

I support the action of the European Union in reorganising the current remuneration policy to provide long-term success and more accountability for decision makers. However, this must not lead to a situation in which policy determines salaries. This should remain the task of the authorities which are already in place, such as the board of governors and the general meeting of the banks. The proposed remuneration policy must therefore not replace existing structures, but at most complement them where necessary, insofar as this is beneficial to the quality of economic decisions.

 It is certainly important to tighten the regulations on internships. The representatives of the German Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament have supported this. Young people often work for months on end without payment, hoping that they might still get a permanent job afterwards. This is an unsustainable situation. Internships should not destroy jobs. However, today’s plenary vote is going to pave the way in the future for a complete ban on unpaid internships. We believe that this gives a wrong message. It should still be possible to do a three-month unpaid internship, for example. There are numerous non profit-making or social organisations where a young person can acquire exciting, interesting experiences. However, such organisations are often unable to pay any remuneration for the internship. The key factor should be the duration of an internship. In the case of any internship lasting longer than six months, the employer can rely on productive output from the intern. From then on, remuneration should also be paid. The decision made today is impracticable and goes too far. We therefore do not support this part of the resolution. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mr Milana, the rapporteur, on his report. In a world in which fish stocks are becoming smaller and the demand for fish and fish products is rising, aquaculture is becoming more and more important. The report underlines the important role of European aquaculture in satisfying our needs and our demand. The growth in European aquaculture has proven to be insufficient. The Community legal framework is responsible, among other things, for development in the European Union coming to a near standstill since 2001, while the rest of the world has seen considerable growth. The Member States could evidently not be persuaded to model the national and Community legal framework in a way that would allow aquaculture in the EU to be developed in a dynamic way. Bureaucratic obstacles and a substantial administrative burden are the consequences of this legal framework. I therefore call on the Commission to adapt the directives relating to the designated Natura 2000 areas as soon as possible, in such a way as to enable sustainable aquaculture in these areas too, thereby making a positive contribution to their management. A total ban on aquaculture in these areas is unacceptable. There are always complaints about the excessive requirements involved in impact assessments for the establishment of new farms or for the expansion of existing farms. That should not be the case. Furthermore, we can see that the damage caused by the voracious cormorants in many areas is jeopardising the existence of traditional fish ponds. To ensure that this is not also the case in the aquaculture that is still to be developed, we need the European Cormorant Management Plan that we have been calling for for a long time to finally be adopted. My last point concerns aquaculturists in developing countries. These aquaculturists must be made more aware of a policy on quality and higher production standards – particularly as regards environmental protection, hygiene and social standards – in their production.

 Mandatory origin labelling of meat, poultry, dairy products, fresh fruit and vegetables and processed products made from one ingredient, which is called for in the report on the provision of food information to consumers, puts an unreasonable burden on food processing companies. For this reason, I have voted against the report. Food is produced across national borders within the European internal market. For example, in the dairy industry, milk from different countries is collected and processed. Separate labelling of the batches that are being processed from different countries is technically impossible. This will place bureaucratic obstacles in the path of European companies which are successful on the global market.

 Combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography is vitally important. We must use all our strength to combat the availability of child pornography in communications networks. The permanent and effective control of child abuse is both a political responsibility and a precept of the rule of law.

 In the vote on the Scottà report on agricultural product quality policy, Amendment 5 was accepted, which called for the mandatory labelling of the origin of foods made from only one ingredient. This requirement involves significantly more work and higher costs for the agriculture industry and food processors, without bringing any real added value for consumers. For this reason, I have voted against this amendment. Britta Reimers  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when discussing quality logos and mandatory designations of origin for food, we must not forget that our political decisions need to be implementable in practice. I cannot see how Amendments 4 and 5 can be implemented in practice and I will therefore be rejecting them. Quality logos should, in principle, be viewed as beneficial if they are voluntary. They give producers and processors of goods the opportunity to be successful in niche markets. However, we need to take account of the fact that, through the market dominance of a few chain stores, many voluntary private logos are interpreted as quasi standards. This robs producers and processors of their entrepreneurial freedom and also narrows the choice for consumers. There is a similar situation with regard to the mandatory indication of the place of origin for agricultural products, such as milk. Implementing this requirement in agriculture and in the processing industry would scarcely be possible from a technical point of view. We need to be careful that good intentions do not descend into excessive bureaucracy. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is only one step on the long road to the reform of the common fisheries policy. I would like to thank the rapporteur for the report and our coordinator for doing such an efficient job. I am in favour of fundamental reform of the common fisheries policy. However, if we lack the courage to do this, it is important to me that we retain the principle of relative stability. Furthermore, I would like to mention specifically the major problem represented by the greedy cormorants and the management plan that Parliament has already called for. The fishing industry is of fundamental economic and cultural importance to our coastal regions. Therefore, achieving a balance between the economy and the environment is of great significance for me in the context of the forthcoming reform of the common fisheries policy.

According to the resolution of the European Parliament on the draft general budget for the financial year 2010, adopted on 17 December 2009, a vote was taken today on the amending budget for the European Parliament, following the revised calculations made by the Parliamentary administration. The FDP in the European Parliament abstained, because there was a paragraph in the package of amendments concerned that we could not reconcile with our convictions. The FDP had already expressed its opposition to an increase in the secretarial allowance to EUR 1 500 during the discussions in committee. It is out of the secretarial allowance that MEPs’ assistants are paid. The FDP considers that the argument that more money is needed due to the additional work that MEPs have to do with the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is unsound, as there is nothing in past experience to support this. Certainly, due to the Treaty of Lisbon, which has just come into force, Parliament will overall need extra capacity for legislative work, but with the introduction of the Assistants’ Statute from the beginning of the current parliamentary term, there is still no proof that MEPs actually need more assistants. For this reason, there are grounds for concern that further demands and supplementary increases, or an extension of office capacity, will follow. For this reason, the FDP in the European Parliament abstained. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

The German members of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe voted differently from the group as a whole on two points. The first concerns Amendment 3 from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. The FDP members voted against, because a radical devolution of fisheries policy such as proposed in the motion with the transfer of powers and responsibility to Member States and to local decision makers cannot be reconciled with the European common fisheries policy. The idea here is precisely to find common forward-looking solutions at an EU level. FDP members supported Amendment 33 because it supports the important principle of relative stability, which is important for Germans. This concerns the basis for quota allocation.

 The German Free Democratic Party members of the European Parliament have abstained from voting on the Copenhagen resolution for the following reasons. The resolution contains statements about financing for climate protection measures in third countries without defining the specific criteria or purpose of the financing. We cannot justify this to taxpayers. In addition, we believe that blanket criticism of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) is wrong. The ICAO is the organisation which deals with aviation matters at an international level. Both the criticism and the statement about the alleged failure of ICAO negotiations are incorrect and inappropriate. The call for specific arrangements for a CO2
 trading system for the aviation industry goes against current EU legislation and overburdens the EU’s negotiating position in an international climate agreement with unrealistic demands. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a farmer, I see the tabled amendment of Articles 78 and 79 as a deviation by the Commission from its hitherto sound route through agricultural reform at the expense of efficient and forward-looking farms. It is dangerous to tamper, simply because of a desire to do something, so close to the final phasing out of the milk quota system, a system that has really been to the disadvantage of dairy farmers hitherto. It has also been left behind by developments on the ground, as the market is currently finally beginning to recover. I therefore reject this amendment. It is easy to see how the Commission is seeking to exploit Parliament’s call for urgent measures for its own ends. It is doing this by attempting, shortly before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, to ensure for itself permanent scope to act without Parliament’s consent through this amendment of Article 186. I therefore reject this amendment. However, I could live with Parliament granting the Commission scope to act for a limited period in cases of crisis. This ability would also be available to Parliament in future times of crisis, with very rapid effect, through Rule 142 of its Rules of Procedure. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the world economic crisis has thrown the global market off balance. As milk producers we are suffering the effects of prices having hit an all-time low. We are hearing over and over again that the adopted milk quota regulations should be amended. As a dairy farmer myself, I can only warn you against doing this. The Commission’s intervention measures have also succeeded in preventing milk prices from falling even further and the market seems to be relaxing. However, I do not think that this intervention is really a good means of achieving this, because it will result in stocks piling up which could burden a recovering market later on. I therefore call on the Commission to explain how it is going to deal with this problem. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we all know, most people are frightened of sharks. However, sharks have populated the world’s oceans for centuries, and I believe that we should not try to imagine a world without them. In my view, we have spoken for every person in Europe by voting by such a large majority to prohibit shark finning today. Shark fin soup is a particular delicacy, and shark finning was therefore a common practice in the past as well. After finning, the sharks are dumped back in the sea. This is not only barbaric; it is also a massive waste of resources. The fins are the most valuable part of the shark because they are the ingredients for soup, which is a lucrative business, but this practice cannot be allowed to continue. With this large majority, we have sent a very clear message today that this practice cannot continue. In fact, a ban has been in place in Europe since 2003, but there were a great many exemptions. We can remove these exemptions if we specify that the sharks must be landed with their fins naturally attached to the body. That is the only way to put a stop to this barbaric practice.

Mr President, we have some very interesting reports on fisheries reform before the House today. I would like to comment on three of them. Firstly, as we all know, fishing is one of the oldest crafts practised by humankind. Even now, many forms of fishing are practised by small-scale and medium-sized operations and artisanal fishermen. We put SMEs at the heart of our policies in Europe and I think it is right that this report also focuses very strongly on their needs. That is my first comment. Secondly, with regard to the external dimension of the Common Fisheries Policy, fish is already an important source of protein in many countries; this applies particularly to developing countries and their populations. With a growing world population, it is important in future to ensure, to an even greater extent than before, that people who rely on local fish as a source of protein can actually catch fish off their own coasts and that only the surplus is available to European fishermen, for example, under fisheries agreements.  My final comment relates to shark finning. It is unacceptable, it is barbaric, and it should be banned. I think there is general agreement on that. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mr Torvalds has said that the common fisheries policy (CFP) as it currently stands is one of the EU’s greatest failures to date. I think he is right. He has also said that it is an economic, social and environmental catastrophe for our fisheries. The fishing industry is not just a means of producing or catching food. It is the oldest trade in the world and, of course, we want to preserve it for the future. Therefore, I would like to thank all the rapporteurs. I believe that we have taken an important step forwards today and I know how committed Ms Damanaki is in this area. For example, we need aquaculture as a response to overfishing. I am very interested in an integrated maritime policy which is all about maritime environmental planning. There are some interesting concepts in this area involving, for example, integrating aquaculture into offshore wind farms. This may be something for the future, but we must ensure that we can expand this sector in the most effective way possible. Finally, I would like to tell you about a small success story from Germany. The North Sea and Baltic fisheries policy has resulted in stocks of cod, herring and plaice gradually recovering. I hope that in future, all the fish stocks in Europe will also recover.

 Since a postponement of the vote on the ACTA in order to be able to evaluate and take into account the pending ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union was not possible, I abstained from voting. With regard to tackling product piracy and strengthening copyright, ACTA is something that I could support. Nevertheless, the fears and concerns of a section of the population, which feels its freedoms will be restricted by ACTA, must be taken into account. For that reason, the decision of the Court of Justice would have been an important decision-making criterion for me. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr President, it has already been pointed out that we do not have a single European railway area, although many people assume that we do. In fact, all our citizens probably assume that we do. We have a lack of tracks in some areas, we have different gauges, we have different technologies and we also do not have fair competition. There are some countries where it is very difficult for other competitors to enter the railway market. That is something that we must do something about. I would like to offer special thanks to Commissioner Kallas. He has grabbed the bull by the horns and set something in motion that has actually been due for 9 years, as we have noticed that the Member States are not implementing what we decided. I would like to thank Ms Serracchiani, who has really done us all a great service here. We now actually have a process in which we emphasise a strong regulator. We have always said that that is the most important thing. The second most important thing is the separation of networks and operators, which is something that we have to discuss and on which we await the Commission proposal before we can see how far it corresponds with the reality on the ground. It is very important that we should have within the package what has become known as ‘mini-unbundling’, in other words, more transparency with regard to funding streams. Mr Ertug just addressed this issue, which I believe is very important. We must do everything we can to obtain a truly complete single European railway area. Gesine Meissner,

 Mr President, with the digital tachograph, the truth is that we actually agreed on many points during the negotiations. I, too, would like to offer my sincere thanks to Ms Ţicău, who was very committed in her negotiations with us shadow rapporteurs. We also really are in agreement about major points – the fact that this is about adapting practically everything, the fact that a technological innovation facilitates an improvement in control checks, which also need to be tightened up, as well as greater requirements for transparency in relation to what can now be installed, what we can check. I am thus in agreement with much of what has been put forward. There is just one area with which I do not agree, and I would like to concentrate on that area now. I will start off in something of a general way. In the Europe 2020 strategy, we constantly stress the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises. There are many of these companies, and they create the jobs and the training places. In 2009, a proposal for cutting red tape specifically for these small and medium-sized enterprises was awarded a prize here. Under the proposal, there were to be options for derogations in respect of tachographs for the Member States, whereby a tradesperson who, for example, drives a 3.5-tonne vehicle himself/herself, requires no tachograph if he or she is located only 50 kilometres from his/her place of work. That should now be extended to 150 kilometres. This proposal was awarded a prize. There was actually a great deal of agreement here – albeit not with everyone – that it was a good thing to move in this direction, that this really would mean a cut in red tape. Now, though, the Commission has only proposed 100 kilometres, unfortunately. In committee, we initially amended that to 150 kilometres with a narrow majority. We had a majority for 150 kilometres, for exactly that proposal. That now hangs in the balance. We have now provided on a general basis that the rules should only apply once over the 100 kilometres line – and rightly so – but, at the same time, the weight limit is to be reduced to 2.8 tonnes. The current situation in Germany is that, while the regulations do specify 2.8-tonne vehicles, there are so many derogations provided that the likes of small-scale painters and electricians are not subject to the regulations at all. That would change under these proposals. Because of that, I believe that we must vote against Amendment 134 and in favour of Amendment 129, which I proposed. In that way, we will be moving in the direction of cutting red tape and really doing something for small and medium-sized enterprises. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr Grosch, we agree on a great many issues. You just said that we need common applicability. I absolutely do not agree with that. You also said, however, that it should apply to professional drivers and not to the other groups. It seems to me that that is already not the case at present. Let us take the example of a master roofer, as a non-professional driver, who drives his materials himself and has a 2.8-tonne vehicle. That is a light goods vehicle, and many people have those, and let us then imagine that he drives over 100 kilometres once every three years, namely 103 kilometres one way, and so actually has to fit a digital tachograph. Does that sound proportionate to you? Do you, moreover, believe that safety would be jeopardised if that were not the case? Gesine Meissner,

Mr President, we have already heard from many quarters that the Sahel region is a particular source of problems in Africa. The people there are living in inhuman conditions, which is something that we cannot simply accept. We need to do something to prevent this. The fact is that the people there are caught in a spiralling trap: they are facing drought, preventing them from keeping animals, they are coping with waves of refugees, terrorist attacks and unstable governments – in other words they are encountering a security problem of unimaginable magnitude. A number of EU citizens have been affected, falling victim to attack. This is not our sole concern, however, as we are particularly concerned with the plight of the people living in such enormous difficulties. We need to take action, particularly to protect women and girls, who are the victims of violence, and who are also denied education. This is truly a Herculean task for all policy areas in the EU, affecting development policy and security policy equally, as organised crime seems to be the most lucrative business in this area, as well as many other external policies. We need progress, which is why we have gathered today for this debate. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 I can offer a short answer to this. This is something we should really consider, because I believe that when we talk about human rights violations here we sometimes feel quite helpless; because many policies are moving in this direction and are proving inadequate, the question is: what additional steps can be taken?

 Mr President, I believe that Ms Wikström has achieved a great deal in her report. It is obviously important to set up a central body which can find a solution in these cases and identify the correct location in the case of legal issues concerning the country responsible for resolving media conflicts of this kind. I believe that Ms Wikström has done a very good job. It is a pity that so few people have chosen to speak on this subject. Of course, there is a great deal of agreement in this area and so perhaps it is not necessary. This really is an important step forward that we are taking in Parliament and I am pleased about that.

Madam President, Commissioner Malmström, I very much respect your efforts to improve the agreement. Nonetheless, I believe that the agreement in its current form is not good enough. I could, in essence, continue from where the previous speaker left off. Of course when someone comes into your home, you will want to know who they are and what they want. However, you do not necessarily want to store data about them for long periods, also allowing others to access this information. Commissioner, you have stated, for example, that the data will be depersonalised after six months. That is correct. However, as you said yourself, this only occurs after six months. We need to take numerous concerns into account. It has also been stated that this data is gathered anyway. I do not see this as a reason to sign up to this agreement. There have been no complaints to date, according to Mr Voss. Likewise, I do not see this as a reason to sign up this agreement either. There is no need to rush. Negotiations with the US are not always a meeting of equals. I am aware of this from the EU-US air transport agreement. We agreed to this, despite its inequities, because it offered us economic benefits. In this case, however, I agree entirely with Ms Weber: it is better to have no law at all than a bad one.

 Mr President, chocolate and cocoa are something to be enjoyed not just by children, but also by adults. It is true that we are now in Strasbourg, but we are often in Brussels, where many people like to buy Belgian chocolate and to give it as a gift. Most of them do not think about where the cocoa comes from, under what conditions it is cultivated, and how the chocolate is manufactured. This debate has already made it clear that we must understand that the cocoa which we import has, in many cases, been produced using child labour. As Ms Köstinger has said, this is not just about finding out whether the children are there with or without their families and whether or not forced labour is involved. We must also be aware that the conditions under which these children work are damaging to their health. Cocoa is produced under conditions which are extremely harmful to health, including that of children. We need to stop this from happening. We must do everything we can to buy cocoa fairly from countries like Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire which are attempting to bring about better living conditions for their people. This has already been said on several occasions and, therefore, I think that introducing a quality mark would be the right approach to take. I am pleased that there is widespread agreement in Parliament on this subject. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Madam President, Ms Bauer said earlier that nothing has changed. We do talk about equality every year, that much is true. Many things are changing a little bit, though. I get the impression that there are more men in the Chamber for the debate this year than last time, and that is a very positive thing, in my opinion. I would like to offer my sincere thanks to Mr Gustafsson, the chair of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, who fights in a very committed fashion for women’s rights, and also to my Liberal colleague Mr Schmidt, who will be speaking later. We are, after all, talking about fairness, and men, too, can see that things are unfair and are critical of that fact, which I think is excellent. There is another thing that is different this year. Last week there was the Gender Pay Gap conference in Brussels, and one of the speakers there began her address in a very unusual way. She said that men are less well qualified, yet they receive more money and pay more tax. Women are better qualified, they have university degrees, yet they receive less money and they pass less tax. She went on to question whether maybe it was perhaps the wrong approach to subsidise places in higher education for women if they then go on to pay less tax. She meant this as a joke, of course. What she meant was the exact opposite, and that is also the way that it has to be seen. When 60% of qualified graduates are women, can we afford for so few women to have the opportunity to develop into good jobs? Can we afford that? The truth is that this is crazy. After all, what we are doing is throwing away economic opportunities galore. It has already been said that, with one third female membership of executive boards, the working atmosphere and the success of companies are demonstrably improved. That is the case for businesses, but of course it could also be the case for politics. I therefore wholeheartedly thank the rapporteur, as well as Ms Reding and all those who champion this cause. We need more fairness in this area. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

Madam President, last year, when I drew up the report on integrated maritime policy, the accident in the Gulf of Mexico had just happened. At that time, we were already considering what we could do in order to be able to intervene better in such cases and how we could also implement some form of preventive measures. At the time, we came up with the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA). I would therefore also like to offer my sincere thanks to Mr Fleckenstein for his excellent work. It really is important for us to look at what institutions we have and to consider how we can involve them further and in different ways. The sea is, in general, being used more, and, in future, it will be used significantly more still, because it also contains raw materials. It is important not only for shipping, but also for energy production. In this regard, however, it is important to consider how we can protect the sea. If we have an institution that is perfectly capable of doing this with additional powers, then we ought to instruct it to do so. It will obviously need funds for this, but that is why it was right for us to say to the Commission during the budget debate when it wanted to cut back on the funding for the agencies that that was not on. We already knew, with regard to EMSA in particular, that we would be giving it an additional task. This is therefore an excellent report. We ought to give Mr Fleckenstein the negotiating mandate soon. Gesine Meissner,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Grosch, the work that has been done here is truly excellent. There were 413 amendments, and we genuinely all supported the majority of the 32 compromises. It shows that we all know that it is important to take as united an approach as possible with regard to the subject of transport. Of course, we have different ideas in the various groups about the details of individual matters, but by and large, we all said that transport is important. It really is the backbone of the internal market. It is a foundation of European policy that we say that we want free movement of people, goods and services. For this, we clearly need to make various improvements, which we will continue to do in subsequent reports. We can truly say that it has just become clear – and it is also clear in this report – that we need all modes of transport. Naturally, we want transport to be more efficient, more environmentally friendly and safer. That is something that we all need to take into consideration. However, in order to be able to continue to take the internal market forward, we really need all modes of transport, even if one area might produce higher emissions than another. That has become very clear in this case. There are essentially very few points on which we do not agree. One of them concerns road trains. This is currently very elegantly worded. I know that not all parties will agree, but in this regard, it is the case that we need a European modular system. In other words, we wanted an option to have a larger volume or perhaps also a bit more length and a bit more weight in the lorries. Not everyone thinks that is a good idea. However, in some areas of Europe, that has already been put into practice – and successfully. This system cannot be used everywhere. On behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I would like to refer to an amendment that we tabled after the vote. I think it is more correct, and should also meet with much approval, to say that it is not a question of us asking the Commission to submit something relating to the railway package describing the relationship between the network and operators, but rather that it should actually be about the separation of the network and operators, which we also addressed in the recast of the railway package. That is a correction, so I would imagine that everyone would be able to go along with it. Thank you once again. I look forward to tomorrow’s vote. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
).

 Madam President, Commissioner, I am pleased that we have been able to meet up again. I stood here one year ago in my capacity as rapporteur on the further development of an integrated maritime policy. We have now reached a position where we can actually anchor a fixed maritime policy in European policy making and where we will have the appropriate financial framework. This is the major advantage gained from Mr Koumoutsakos’s follow-up report. For me, integrated maritime policy is not just what you might call a truly major concern, but also an enormously important future task for the European Union. It has already been pointed out that more of the earth is covered by water than land: the ratio is about 30% land to 70% water. There is a great deal of added value to be gained from water. This includes marine transport – 95% of all transport involves the sea – as well as, of course, fishing, research or offshore energy sources. We have a very broad range of options open to us when it comes to using the sea as a resource. We have just one earth and one mass of water, which is why we need to husband it as prudently as possible. This is a major challenge that we face. In practical terms, 40% of the EU’s gross domestic product comes from the IMP, the integrated maritime policy. As I have already said, our major success this time round is that the IMP now has a fixed basis. Although we have not achieved the hoped for EUR 50 million, a figure I believed to be a certainty last year, we have received EUR 40 million, most of which will be spent on cross-border projects. After all, it is important that cooperation should be practised that embraces various countries. Naturally I must express my sincere thanks to Mr Koumoutsakos. We made a good team when negotiating in the trialogue, which has now closed. We achieved an awful lot because we stuck together so well. Thank you again. I wish us both well with the integrated maritime policy. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, we have just been discussing the integrated maritime policy and, of course, fishing also plays a role there. Since I have been dealing with this topic for some time, I am aware that fishing is usually the last policy to be decided. Fishermen naturally play an important role in our food supply, however. It is also important for small and medium-sized enterprises that they should be able to work in a secure area and that illegal fishing should be prevented as it makes their work and their position in the marketplace more difficult. What we have heard is quite true: this issue does not just affect cooperation with developing countries. It goes without saying that this is significant because these countries also import fish. It is also important for us, however, because we need to prevent illegal fishing. For this reason, I should like to pick up on one of the points Mr Milana and Ms Lövin raised. I know that not everyone equally favours the European coastguard service. However, I do believe that we need better cooperation on this front in Europe at least. This was already called for in a Parliamentary report on integrated maritime policy dating from 2008. I have brought this up repeatedly and the Commission also needs to table a proposal in this area. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Madam President, Mr Kallas, I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Serracchiani. This was a tough task for her, as this really is a difficult portfolio. As has already been mentioned, the first railway package was established 10 years ago, when all Member States agreed on how the railway market in Europe could be opened up. The crazy thing is that a review carried out in 2009 indicated that only four states had actually met the provisions contained in the package. Two countries do not count as they do not have a rail network. The remainder have failed to stick to their own resolutions. This is why we need to take action once again. It is evident that we need a comprehensive railway sector in Europe, both in the interests of the internal market and in the interests of our citizens. What we find is not just gaps in the rail lines and incompatible systems, but also legal and organisational hurdles. It is these hurdles that we have tried to eliminate here. The good news is that we now have a strong regulator at European and national level. This regulator must be independent and must also be able to take action quickly. A lot of people have said this. We have also noticed that although the separation of networks and operators may be the right solution, a lot of comparisons are required in order to establish the nature of this separation and to ensure that we have a consistent system throughout Europe. This is something that will need urgent attention next year. There is one thing that we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe disagree with – Mr Tremosa has already pointed it out and we have also asked for a separate vote on this issue – and that is Article 6(4). Mr Kuhn has already indicated that he wants transparency in relation to the financial flow. We do not want to see public monies being invested in areas other than infrastructure. This is not assured by the current wording, however. This is why we really do need to vote against the last section, as otherwise we shall have no transparency. This is not in the interest of progress in the rail market. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
).

 Mr President, Commissioner, as has already been stated here, China is a super power and for that reason is very important for the Member States of the European Union. I know that, when it comes to human rights violations in China, some people would say we should leave the Chinese in peace. They have a different culture and do not share our value system, hence we should not seek to impose our values on them. When, however, we find that people are voluntarily setting themselves on fire, when young people of 18 and 19 years of age who simply want to live according to their faith have no other choice than to take their own lives, then it is no longer possible to remain silent. The fact is that the representatives of the Dalai Lama are constantly calling on our support, placing their hope in the European Parliament, even though they know that even if we debate the issue here, nothing will happen and nothing will change for a long time. All we can do is repeatedly point out the injustices happening there and call on anyone who has contact with China to keep putting this issue on the agenda. After all, I believe one thing is quite clear: if everyone brings up this issue again and again, then China will be unable to ignore it and something must eventually happen. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, if Ms Rafah Nached is sentenced, then this really will be a sign of the despotism and brutality of the Syrian state, as well as its helplessness and paranoia, as a previous speaker has already said. After all, what does a state have to fear from a woman who is old and infirm and who is only doing her job by helping traumatised people? What is so dangerous about this? She has been accused of having a destabilising effect on the state. In this case, however, the government, the dictatorship, is completely at a loss and, in a completely misguided move, is attempting to make an example of her. As my colleague Mr Preda has already pointed out, we now find ourselves in the realms of the surreal. We all welcomed the Arab Spring and the democratisation of the region. Of course we Europeans are pleased to see such developments and are trying to support this movement, including though a variety of contacts. However, we must also protest when individuals are imprisoned without grounds. This is truly a violation of human rights, and we must not accept it. Gesine Meissner,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

Madam President, I am much obliged to the Commissioner for his presentation. Commissioner, you said that in this case, this proposal largely meets all Parliament’s demands. In my opinion, that is not the case, and also in my opinion, it is not the case either that all the privacy rights of passengers have been safeguarded. That is why we have just tabled an oral question on this. In fact, as Mr de Grandes Pascual stated, we had a report in which we discussed and set out what form scanners should take where these are permitted to be deployed as an additional security measure at airports. In this report, we also said that people must have a free choice as to whether or not they go through them. Health and human dignity must be protected; data and privacy must also be safeguarded. In fact, what has now been proposed is exactly what we did not want. We did not want to have scanners that show real images – whether or not these are blurred. I am familiar with these images; I have been to the US and have seen such scanners. I do not want something like that placed in Europe’s airports. These scanners do, in fact, allow quite a lot of a person’s body to be seen. To me it makes no difference whether or not the person looking at them is in another room and does not see the people in real life. It is a violation of privacy and intimacy, and we expressly discussed the fact that that is exactly what we do not want. Despite this, the Commission’s proposal now states that something along these lines is to be permitted in order to implement our decision. Naturally, we are upset about it. That is why we are asking you to reconsider. There is the option of having simple stick figures, as they are known – in other words, schematic illustrations; either a green OK or a stick figure with red dots – showing, for example, that an arm should be investigated because something suspicious is indicated there. That really is something that we would like, without images being stored. That would protect people’s privacy as well as protecting data. We are astonished, and we are not happy that something different is now being proposed. If the installation of something that is actually quite different is being considered, then we need a legislative process. We are talking about the citizens of Europe and that is why the representatives of these citizens need to be involved in a proper procedure. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, the honourable Member has said that he also wishes to protect privacy, but that he wants to avoid monopolies. Does he really believe – knowing the way the European market works – that if we want to have something on the market, such as a particular type of scanner, it will remain the case that only one company makes them? Does he not think that more companies would then start producing them simply in order to be able to compete for this market? Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
),

 The German Free Democratic Party delegation abstained from the final vote on the own-initiative report on European road safety 2011-2020. This non-legislative text contains a large number of recommendations for increasing safety on Europe’s roads. Naturally, we support this goal, as we also want to reduce the number of fatalities and injuries on the roads. Some measures are quite over the top, however; for example, the call for a general 30 km/h speed limit in built-up areas, the mandatory carrying of warning jackets for all vehicle occupants, or the use of rear-facing child seats for children under three years of age. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr President, I would like to respond directly to Ms Stassen, who is the only one so far to say that we do not actually need tourism in Europe. I believe that we do indeed need it, and, moreover, it will not undermine the competitiveness and autonomy of the individual Member States. It is indeed the case that Europe is currently the number one tourist destination in the world, and, naturally enough, we would like it to stay that way. We want it to stay that way with all the diversity that we have. The diversity that we have in Europe can be seen from the previous speeches. These alone have made it worthwhile to be part of this debate, because if anyone thinks that 10 days is sufficient in which to see Europe – thus, the Acropolis, the Tower of London, the Eiffel Tower and perhaps Neuschwanstein in Germany – he or she is mistaken. Europe offers much more and it has developed a great deal more in terms of tourism. I would now like to mention something in particular that we have in north Germany, where I come from. We have cycling tourism, we also have nature-oriented tourism, not only holidays on the farm, which certainly also awakens a real understanding of nature, but, for example, also tourism in very sensitive areas such as the Wadden Sea beside the North Sea. That is a globally unique area. There you can really see how, right next to main shipping routes, a very sensitive form of tourism can be developed that also awakens an understanding of the diversity of nature. This is something that we need more of. Something that has not had any, or very little, mention is the fact that we also have old mines and old industrial heritage sites, for example, that you can view and where you can learn a great deal about the history of Europe and the working environment. Thus, there is a very broad spectrum, and in that regard we ought to consider how we can bring this to the outside world and how we can maintain Europe as a very attractive tourist destination in future, too. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the White Paper, Commissioner Kallas sets out various possibilities for the future of transport. For instance, he describes how there is a need for incentive systems in order to give transport a more environmentally friendly form, and he also states that new sources of funding are needed, including, for example, in order to be able to work according to the ‘polluter pays’ principle. The Eurovignette Directive that we are debating today is one way that both of these points really can be achieved. This was a major Belgian effort, I believe we can say, begun under the Belgian Presidency of the Council with three important Belgians involved and, above all, because of the rapporteur, who succeeded in opening a door to the new routes. As it happens, I would have wished Belgium’s major effort greater success than what we now have. What we actually managed to achieve is a small and weak compromise. Although we do now have earmarking to a very limited extent – 15% of infrastructure costs and 15% of external costs must go to the TEN-T networks – it is really far too little. All national transport policy representatives say that we need considerable resources in order to be able to sustain our infrastructure networks. It is self-evident that the resources collected in this area should also be able to be invested there. That is a point on which we can all fail to be satisfied. The fact is that, in this connection, we have nonetheless taken a step in a direction in which we will be able to move further at a later date. That is also the reason why we intend to vote in favour of this compromise. It was a tough struggle, though. It very definitely could have been the case that we ended up with nothing at all on the table, since a few Member States would have preferred to have nothing at all. This is therefore a success, and it will have our backing in the vote today. (Applause) Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr President, I would first like to agree with Mr Verhofstadt. It is indeed shameful that these human rights debates, which are actually very important to us Europeans who believe in values, always take place on Thursday afternoons when most people have already left. I would like that noted in the record once more. It is something that we must change. Right now, however, we are talking about China and there we are more or less powerless, as has already been said. Mrs Lichtenberger spoke of a brick wall. Mr Posselt, I do not believe by the way that it is really in the Chinese interest – as you said – to help bring about a breakthrough in human rights. It is apparently not in the interest of the Chinese Government, although it is undoubtedly in the interest of the Chinese people. We are talking today about many people: Ai Weiwei and Liu Xiaobo have already been mentioned. We have frequently debated in the past how we can bring about a human rights breakthrough. It is not just a matter of instructing Baroness Ashton to speak out against the human rights abuses in China at every opportunity. All our foreign ministers and representatives must do so, and we need to stick together. I think that is the only way that we can actually have a small influence on China. Otherwise, as a strong economic power, China will play us off against each other and we will achieve nothing whatsoever. That would be a very bad thing, especially for the people concerned. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
).

 Mr President, I would first of all like to offer my sincere thanks to Mr Simpson. In the Committee on Transport and Tourism, we know that, if our Chair prepares a report, we will not actually have anything to say against it. He always takes a great number of things into account, and the only thing we can say is: excellent Brian, we can support that. In this case, it has been variously said that it is a technical report. That sounds so boring. I do not find it at all boring. Although it is technical, it describes tourism, which really is a very important economic objective for us in Europe. It has already been mentioned that 40% of people worldwide travel to Europe. Thus, Europe is an important region for tourism, and therefore it is, of course, vital to know why these people travel to Europe. If, with our new competence under the Treaty of Lisbon, we now want to develop a new European framework, we must be familiar with the data and also be able to exchange this data in a harmonised way. That is the purpose of this report, and it also shows the new developments, for example, in terms of same-day visits or bicycle tourism. We also want to include our industrial heritage. All of this must be included in future so that we will really know how to set our objectives. Therefore, thank you very much – it is a good report and I believe we are able to support it. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr President, it has been very clear in the debate that violence against women is not a trivial offence; it is quite clearly a violation of human rights. It has already been said that even children are sometimes indirect victims of violence against women. They can even be direct victims of violence against women, because the main cause of still births and miscarriages is certainly the effects of violence against women. It is not only a question of domestic violence; there is also forced prostitution, honour killings – where there can actually be no question of honour – human trafficking, genital mutilation and much more besides. The trigger for this report, for which I am very grateful to Mrs Svensson, was, in this case, not only the fact that it was noticed in the context of the report on equality that equality is also put at serious risk as a result of violence against women, but also the fact that, through the Treaty of Lisbon, we now have the opportunity to enact a directive and to establish a common legal framework in Europe. That is urgently needed for us to make significant progress here, because this is a cross-border European problem that we must combat. Gesine Meissner,

Madam President, firstly I too would like to thank the rapporteur. We have already discussed the fact that, following the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament now has the opportunity to vote in favour of air service agreements of this kind or to reject them. We cannot change the contents, but we can accept or oppose them. This does not always make things simple, but it is at least a new task, which we are taking very seriously. It makes sense to replace a number of different bilateral agreements with one standardised EU agreement. It is clear that there are no boundaries in airspace, which is a good way of explaining this. The European Union is also a strong economic community and so it is sensible to discuss agreements made by the EU with different third countries, which is what we are doing now. We have a number of very different agreements on the table today. I will start with Vietnam. This is the least complex agreement. It concerns different accesses and services and also safety regulations, but it is a relatively short agreement, which is why I am only mentioning it briefly. The most comprehensive agreement is the one with Canada. In this agreement it was not just a case of ensuring free access to air services which can be used in different ways, but also of covering issues such as the environment, safety and also market access and ownership. In that respect we have long since passed the first stage of 25% and already reached the second stage of 49% ownership of each other’s air services market. Now we are about to enter stages 3 and 4. In stage 3 it is possible to establish airlines in another country and another region. Stage 4 would allow a European airline to fly from A to B within Canada. We have not come nearly as far as this with the USA, despite the fact that we have been negotiating with the USA for a long time. I would like to make one more point. Mr Kallas said that we were all very much in support of this issue, but in the case of the USA our reaction is more restrained, because the agreement does not represent a true partnership. The USA wants to take more from us than it is prepared to give. We need to continue negotiating on this. Apart from this issue, we will vote in favour, because it is clear that progress has been made. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 In today’s vote on the text of the directive on consumer rights, some members of the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament abstained. The compromise adopted undoubtedly contains many improvements on the original draft from the European Commission. For example, we have succeeded in ensuring that small businesses are not affected by most of the new rules or burdened with additional bureaucracy. However, the text adopted today also contains rules that would heavily burden companies without increasing consumer protection. Article 5, for example, will mean that a company will have to provide very extensive pre-contractual information even when goods are purchased in store. This will hardly benefit consumers, as they can assess the product directly in the shop. Article 22a places companies under obligation, in the case of distance contracts, to supply their goods to customers in any Member State. Such an obligation contradicts the freedom of contract and exposes small and medium-sized enterprises in particular to considerable legal and financial risks. Furthermore, the FDP was unable to succeed in its core demand for the complete deletion of Chapters IV and V of the directive. The FDP calls for these provisions to be amended during the trilogue negotiations with the Council and Commission. Gesine Meissner,

 Mr President, we have just spoken about natural disasters in the previous agenda item. In this case, it was a force of nature that brought air traffic to a complete standstill. Eyjafjallajökull – everyone probably knows of this volcano now – erupted last year and brought a large proportion of air traffic to a complete standstill. Incidentally, I just noticed once again during the previous speech that we have an excellent chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, because what he said is very similar to what I wanted to say. I will now try to change my speech somewhat. It was indeed chaos – Mr Simpson has already said that. As Europeans, with high-tech capabilities and with so much already coordinated, we were, in fact, helpless when it came to dealing with this disaster and finding solutions to it. We realised that there were too few agreements in place. We then set up a task force. The questions that concerned us with regard to this issue were whether the task force actually has any valid results already that could be discussed and has it published any studies? I do not know of any at least. Have all of the international experts on such volcanic eruptions actually been consulted? After all, as we already discussed here in plenary last year, there are other parts of the world where volcanic eruptions are much more frequent than in Europe and they somehow manage to have up-to-date data and to coordinate the whole situation. There is also something else that causes me concern. On 4 May, it was also mentioned in the Council of transport ministers that we need a linked-up European transport system. That can, of course, help in such cases. How far have we come in terms of being able to respond better in the event of a further volcanic eruption? We cannot predict this, of course. It will just happen. I have one further question: do we know exactly what technology we would need to be able to deal with this situation better? In Germany, we now have appropriate devices at all weather stations that collect the data and are able to pass on this up-to-date data very quickly to the people responsible at the airlines and also to pilots so that they can decide whether or not it is safe to fly. One further point which has not been mentioned yet but which I think is important in this context is the following: this ash crisis, and the subsequent problems it posed for the air transport industry, affected 10 million passengers and, of course, also many companies. Some passengers were stranded and were unable to continue their journeys. The question therefore arises as to how things stand with regard to passengers’ rights. We have rights for air passengers, but I have the impression that, in this case, they have not always been fully utilised. Perhaps we should also revise these passenger rights once more. There are a lot of questions here. Mr Hahn, I do not know whether you will be able to answer them now, as transport is not actually your area. Otherwise, I am sure that the questions I raised in addition to the written question can be answered later. You will notice that this subject is of great concern to us. After all, the air transport industry is very important, and we therefore need a Single European Sky. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 In the vote on the Lange report, I am abstaining on paragraph 31 because of the ambiguous wording of the vote, which refers to Eurobonds as well as project bonds. However, taking it as a whole, I am voting for the report, as I have nothing against project bonds in themselves. Project bonds serve as finance for extensive innovation, infrastructure and reindustrialisation projects. This is not a question of instruments for the communitarisation of debts, as would be the case with Eurobonds. Gesine Meissner,

 Mr President, a long procedure has now come to an end, which is good news. There are some positive aspects to all of this. One is that the basic rights for people with disabilities include the right to information and the right to access. Another positive feature is that the damages paid by small and medium-sized businesses have been kept to a reasonable level, which was not originally the case. It is also good that we have reached an agreement, because otherwise, we would have been stuck in the conciliation procedure and there would have been no regulations at all covering one specific area of transport. However, I would also like to pick up on some negative points, as we have not been able to produce a genuine European solution. Although we say that the free movement of people, goods and services is a European principle, we have not reached a European solution in this area, if three countries are not included and other countries do not have bus routes of this length. The right of people with disabilities to be accompanied, which is something they often need in order to be able to travel, is only guaranteed over long distances. In addition, the clause on major natural disasters, which does not apply to air travel, because damages had to be paid in the case of the ash cloud, has been applied to buses and coaches. This means that poorer passengers in particular who are making short journeys will not be compensated and have no rights. That, of course, is not a good thing. Therefore, because of this mix of positive and negative features, we abstained from voting during the midnight session in the conciliation procedure and we will do the same today.

Madam President, I would like to explain why the majority of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has abstained from voting on this directive. It is good that we have made a decision and that the rights of people with disabilities are being respected. However, that is only the case over longer distances. Many of the other points are not worthy of a European directive. For example, because the directive only covers journeys over 250 kilometres, there are many countries where it does not apply. Cyprus, Malta and Luxembourg have no rights, in just the same way as some other Member States which do not have bus routes that are longer than 250 kilometres. The free movement of people, goods and services is one of Europe’s central principles. Now it is the poorer passengers who are not protected, because some Member States have no system of passengers’ rights. This is why we have abstained. There are some positive aspects, but also many negative aspects, and this is the reason for our abstention. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
),  
in writing.

 This regulation is a step in the right direction as it creates an EU set of rights for bus passengers. However, except for some basic rights, it applies to regular services equal to, or longer than, 250 km. Such a limited scope can hardly be a basis for truly European legislation in the interest of all bus passengers and ALDE cannot support such a deal. We also oppose the force majeure
 clause exempting carriers from the obligation to provide accommodation for passengers in case of cancellations or delays if these are caused by severe weather conditions or major natural disasters, as it can set a precedent for other EU passenger rights legislation. Even though this is not a triumph, it is an improvement, especially for travellers with disabilities and reduced mobility. We managed to ensure non-discriminatory access conditions, disability-related training for the staff of carriers and terminal authorities who deal directly with passengers and compensation for damage or loss of mobility equipment on all routes, regardless of distance. Keeping that in mind, and with a view to creating a harmonised EU set of rights for all passengers, we did not oppose the agreement and abstained in the final vote. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
).

 Mr President, Mrs Malmström, we definitely do not need walls to resolve the asylum problem. A proposal was made to erect a wall, which is why I have chosen to speak. Anyone who says something of this kind has completely failed to understand European values. For us, this is all about protecting fundamental rights and human rights. We cannot say about people who have fled from their country and sought asylum in Europe, for whatever reason, and about people who have voluntarily climbed into an overcrowded boat and put their lives at risk: ‘We want to send these people back before they have even arrived’. We need sensible asylum processes for these people which function properly. We cannot leave the southern European countries, where these people arrive, to cope with the problem alone. I agree completely with my colleague, Mrs Hirsch, on that point. From another perspective, it is wrong to say that we want all these people to stay outside Europe and we do not want to take them in. Demographic change is taking place in Europe and in future, we will need integration and also asylum seekers who want to stay here. This is not just an issue of humanity, but also of common sense. For this reason, we need to come up with solutions to this problem quickly. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
).

Madam President, I have now been in Parliament for a year and I have dealt with various dossiers, but none of them have been as difficult as what we have on the table here. At this point, I would like to offer my sincere thanks once again to Mrs Mathieu and Mr Cercas, the two rapporteurs from the relevant committees. This really is a very difficult matter, and the reason for this is that naturally we have very high ideals in Europe. We want to treat everyone who lives and works here fairly and equally. That, in principle, is something we can all agree on as a starting point. However, the question remains as to how much we can really implement this in detail. We have already been reminded that with the Treaty of Lisbon, we now wish to draw up a common policy on asylum and migration. Asylum policy is something close to our hearts, and not just because of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. We also need a migration policy for economic reasons, because demographic changes are taking place and we have a very urgent need not just for highly qualified workers, but also for less skilled workers. Basically, the great difficulty here is what to do. As has already been said – Mrs in ’t Veld mentioned it – the Member States stated back in 1990 in Tampere that they wanted to develop a common structure. Nothing has yet been placed on the table. In other words, what we have today is a compromise – we are not completely happy with it, but in my view, it is a way for us to move forward. Speaking personally, I can well understand why some are saying that we need more time for discussion. I am not completely happy with it either. It is particularly important to me, for example, that everyone should have access to training and further education, because this is absolutely crucial – not just for the persons concerned, so that they can work in the labour market, but also for us with our real need for workers. In the case of social security, for example, where we already have so many different systems anyway that have not even been harmonised within the EU, it raises the question of how we can really create a common set of rights for third country nationals in all cases even if we want to. It is difficult, and that is why I see the compromise that is currently on the table as a good thing. We really should vote in favour; then at least we will have something. Gesine Meissner,

 Mr President, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn, the arrival of a container full of trainers on an island somewhere, which was received enthusiastically by the residents, has in the past made headline news. In another case, a contingent of rubber ducks floated ashore. These are, of course, the pleasant examples of ships’ cargoes going missing, but the fact is that in many cases lost containers can cause serious damage. It has become clear that we must do something about this. The Dutch Government was concerned about this problem and set up an investigation to find out why it was happening. The investigation identified a number of causes. Although there are EU regulations which specify how cargoes should be secured and although all ships have the manual containing the regulations on board, only 46% of ships have their cargoes properly lashed down. This means that we do not need any new rules. You were right about that, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn. In many cases, the weight of the cargo has not been correctly balanced. Another reason is that many crews in the short sea shipping sector unlash cargoes before they have reached their destination to speed up the unloading process. Stacking errors can also be a cause of the problem, together with old or damaged equipment. All of this can, of course, have a major impact on the environment. Around 70% of items lost from ships at sea sink to the bottom, but this gives rise to the question of what damage they are causing on the sea bed. A total of 15% of the goods reach land. The remaining 15% float around in the ocean and obviously represent a major hazard for other ships, platforms and the environment. This means that when accidents happen at sea we must investigate the extent to which containers were involved. Then we need to speak to shipping companies and port operators to ensure that they comply with the regulations. In addition, regular inspections must be made. Two thousand containers really are too many and I think that carrying out feasibility studies would take too long. We must take immediate action, because the situation simply cannot go on as it is. Gesine Meissner,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn, ladies and gentlemen, I wish that the Chamber were full to bursting, not on my account or because this is my first report, but because of the subject matter, which is unfamiliar to many people, but nevertheless highly important. Hardly anyone has heard of integrated maritime policy, but it is a decisive subject for us all, because it really is true that our future lies in the sea. A total of 70% of the earth’s surface consists of water. Population levels are growing, not in Europe, but throughout the rest of the world and by 2050 they will have reached 9 billion. The earth is becoming too small and many experts have already discovered the significant potential of the oceans. Our objective must now be to keep the resources of the seas safe for future generations by means of the integrated maritime policy. So far only 10% of the oceans and their resources have been explored, but we already have 50 000 products which come from the sea. Efforts are now being made to produce energy from the sea and to extract raw materials for medicines, cosmetics and industry. While we are developing our overall maritime policy, it is important to ensure that the sea does not strike back, as it did in a sensational novel by bestselling author Frank Schätzing. We have the opportunity to turn the maritime economy into the largest area of growth in our economy as a whole. For this reason, people are talking today not only about green jobs, but also about blue jobs and blue growth. The coastline of the EU is 23 000 kilometres in length and one third of the population lives by the sea. Green shipping and offshore energy are areas where Europe has extensive expertise which can be developed further. For this reason, we need an integrated approach so that we can achieve all of these objectives with great care. Which individual areas are covered by integrated maritime policy? The first of these areas is transport. Shipping can be described as the powerhouse of European transport, because 95% of global trade and 40% of internal European trade travels by sea, via ports with hinterland connections and logistics. Further growth is being forecast and therefore we must ensure in particular that we can reduce emissions by developing greener ships. The next area is shipbuilding. We have a great deal of expertise in this field, as I have already mentioned. We must make sure that we use this expertise productively to secure existing jobs and create new ones. Of course, maritime policy also includes fisheries and aquaculture. Fish are not just a source of food. In addition, aquaculture is the area of agriculture and fisheries which is showing the highest levels of growth. It is important for us to be aware of this. In the field of energy there is a great deal happening on and around the sea. We have oil and gas pipelines, oil platforms and offshore wind farms and there are already plans to fit tankers with sails so that they can cut their energy consumption by 20% by using wind energy. Wave power is an area with future potential and microalgae, which can be used as biomass, represent an almost unlimited source of energy. In the area of research there is a focus on using blue biotechnology to develop medicines. We already have painkillers and anti-malaria drugs and work is currently underway on cancer medicines. Protecting our coasts is an important issue which is also covered by integrated maritime policy. Our coasts are threatened by storm tides and we need to protect them, not only against the tides, but also against oil, piracy and smuggling. In addition, we must deal with the problem of asylum seekers in Italy. Finally our coasts are also, of course, very popular tourist destinations and we are working on developing a sustainable tourism concept for the coastline. You can see that there are many individual areas involved here, all of which are related to water. The objective of the integrated maritime policy is to develop these areas carefully and in harmony by working together. Many people are not aware of this, but it is hugely important. The European Union has already achieved a great deal in this respect, but it needs to do even more. For this reason, I have focused in this report not so much on the individual areas, but primarily on what has happened in the last few years since the 2007 Blue Paper was published, what still needs to be developed and what has to be continued. These are the areas which I will mention again briefly in my conclusion. Gesine Meissner,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I think it is good that you have been counting, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn. I did not know how many speeches had been made, but 37 really is a lot. I would like to thank everyone who has taken part in the debate today. Right at the beginning, I also forgot to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their work. We really have worked together very constructively and I enjoyed it very much. I have covered a lot of subjects in the report, because it is very important to me to have a convincing majority in this crucial area. Many of the speeches on different subjects have highlighted the fact that we need joint action on research, planning, implementation and control of maritime activities by means of joint governance, spatial planning and monitoring. This is what the report is all about. However, it is a very varied subject. I should now like to discuss a few of the speeches. Mr Fleckenstein raised the problem of the sulphur emissions. We have included it in the report because it was important to us that there is no distortion of competition, but we also need to make sure that shipping is more environmentally friendly. However, what you said about shipbuilding, Mr Fleckenstein, is not quite true. It is not the case that the Liberals and the Conservatives did not want to include this. It was simply a question of how we should implement it, of whether we should create a new fund at a European level for refitting old ships or whether we should put in place a strategy. That is the current wording. The subject of my amendment was also raised, which I introduced in order to include emissions trading in the report. In the committee it was rejected by a very small margin, but in my opinion we are all convinced that we must continue to follow this route. For this reason, I am hoping for support in these areas. Mr Kohlíček, you said that it was difficult to link all the areas together, but I know that this is possible. A group of stakeholders and business people from all the different maritime areas meets twice a year to share ideas. These are prominent players at a European level and they all very much value the opportunity to come together. My last point concerns the reference to the fact that there are so many different regions. I have included the position of islands in the report and it is not true that this has been omitted. The only area not covered by the strategies is the North Sea. I live closest to the North Sea and, therefore, I wanted to mention that when we talk about the Black Sea, the Mediterranean and the Danube, we should not forget the North Sea. Finally I would like to express my thanks, in particular for the remark that we should take moral responsibility for the sea and for future generations. This is why I have chosen the title ‘We need a new awareness of the sea’. If we continue to work on this, we will be able to achieve a great deal. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking today about the working conditions of women, which we want to improve in Europe. I will specifically address the Thomsen report, for which I was shadow rapporteur; in other words, the subject of ‘precarious women workers’. This year is the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion. It is an established fact that poverty disproportionately affects women. Naturally, we cannot, on any account, allow this to remain the case. Poverty among women may be the result of various things. It may result from the fact that women are not paid as well as men. Naturally, that is not the only cause. Women also take more career breaks, for example, when they have children and take time off to bring them up. Women also perform the lower skilled jobs. Things are particularly serious in the case of women whose employment conditions are precarious, because in some cases, they may not even have an employment contract or may have irregular employment contracts; they may have no protection whatsoever and they may have little access to information. The situation is particularly bad for women with a background of migration. This can lead to the poverty continuing, so that they also end up poor in old age. We need to break out of this spiral, which affects women more than men. One of the ways this can be done is through education and training. Every woman – every girl – needs to get a qualification, whatever their background, and they need access to a profession which will genuinely secure them a proper living. Lifelong learning must generally be possible for women too. We also need to ensure that we have more women and girls going into the better paid professions. These are frequently the professions that are more heavily dominated by men. In other words, access to education in any event, and access to social security systems – that way, we can achieve many improvements for women. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
).

 Mr President, Commissioner, you have stated that human rights are core values in the European Union. Last December, we proudly signed off on the Treaty of Lisbon and the legally binding Convention on Human Rights associated with it. What you have said is absolutely correct and of vital importance: we must defend these human rights at every turn and we must also allow these principles to guide our trade activities. As you have pointed out, this is a difficult matter. However, as has already been stated, a list of camps producing laogai products already exists. I have a book here with all the relevant information. It shows which prison manufactures which products and under which trade name. Hence, it is possible to research this issue. That is why, for example, the Laogai Research Foundation, which is active both internationally and within Europe – I say this for the benefit of President Müller, who is with us here today – has written to Commissioner De Gucht to ask him to enable the UN Special Envoy to visit the camps of his choice and to examine the question of whether it is possible to halt tariff preferences for such products on a temporary basis, following the example of the US, which is somewhat more courageous on this issue than we are. I would like to know what progress has been made with the Commission’s promised investigation into this issue? (Applause) Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
).

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by addressing a matter that our shadow rapporteur, Mr Kacin, was unable to mention due to a lack of time, but which he nevertheless feels is very important. It is imperative, in this connection, not only to investigate the causes of accidents but also to protect victims and their families. My group, in particular, has spoken out very strongly in favour of information regarding the circumstances of accidents being provided quickly, at least to the relatives, and in favour of this information also being provided in the case of same-sex partnerships. In general, we have already noted that the report drawn up by the rapporteur is indeed a groundbreaking one. We cannot praise it enough. The fact of the matter is that the previous directive is 16 years old. Many technical developments have been made in the meantime and we need better aviation safety. In order to be able to investigate accidents, we need information that can be independently assessed. The United States has had an independent investigation agency of this kind for a long time, as well as the guarantee of protection if someone gives evidence that could later be used against that person as a party involved. We have now achieved this. I would like to thank Mrs De Veyrac most sincerely for her excellent work. Gesine Meissner,

 Mr President, we live in a Europe where we want people to be able to live together happily and to have access to all areas of life that are important to them. As you know very well, we are experiencing demographic change in Europe. In future, there will be fewer people living in many areas than there are now. Nevertheless, we want all citizens to be provided with the services that they require and that they need in order to be able to have their say. This includes – very importantly – the postal service, which is to be guaranteed by means of a universal service. Firstly, there is the question of how we can ensure the provision of the service in remote rural areas with little money in the coffer, and at affordable prices. We also need people to deliver this post who are paid a reasonable wage for doing so. That is not a simple task for the Member States. However, we have decided that that is what we want and you, Commissioner, have indicated that a large majority of the Member States have also agreed to it. We now also need to make it possible for users to complain. I can see a problem with this. It has not yet been mentioned. However, the directive states that if something goes wrong, citizens should have a body they can complain to. It is not so easy, either, to maintain the appropriate infrastructure in this regard, particularly where there are not many people. Commissioner Barnier, you said that you are still new to this office and that you will at least take everything into account. I believe you. However, you have to understand that we are extremely sceptical, particularly in the Committee on Transport and Tourism. Mr Simpson said that the same thing happened in the case of the railway package – the previous Commission was responsible for monitoring its implementation – practically nothing was implemented and nothing happened. In other areas, too, things have not always proceeded in the way we would have liked them to. I know that, because I was also previously in politics in Germany. Decisions are made which are extremely good and which everyone is agreed on, and then no one thinks to check to see whether it is implemented and whether it is implemented quickly in the interests of the people of Europe and in the interests of workers. That is what we want from you. Therefore, show us that we can trust you. We will be very pleased if that turns out to be justified. Gesine Meissner,

 Mr President, as a previous speaker rightly said, it is important that passengers’ rights are protected in Europe, regardless of what mode of transport they are using. It is simply a logical conclusion for us to move from air and rail transport to passengers’ rights on ships, buses and coaches. Yet another speaker has already mentioned the fact that we have unfortunately not succeeded in dealing with both subjects as a package, as we had originally planned. Although we were able to reach a compromise on the rights of passengers on ships and complete the trialogue, this was sadly not the case with bus and coach transport. I would like to look specifically at the rights of bus and coach passengers, because I am also the shadow rapporteur in this area. I very much regret that we have not managed to achieve a compromise, because in the trialogue meeting, we were able to bring the position of the Council, on the one hand, and the positions of the European Parliament and the Commission, on the other, much closer together. We were concerned – and this is also very important – about protecting passengers’ rights; above all, we wanted to ensure that people with restricted mobility and with disabilities can always make use of transport, including buses and coaches. A range of measures are needed to make this possible and this is what we have been calling for. I believe that this is particularly important because in future, there will be more people with disabilities and restricted mobility, simply as a result of the ageing population. This is a very important point. Of course, we must also take into account the fact that consumers’ rights involve having an offering available. In particular, those small and medium-sized companies which provide coach trips are not able to do everything. For example, they cannot provide unlimited compensation. There is also the question of how they will cope with advance payments. We managed to bring our positions closer together in this area and this is why I regret the fact that we have been unable to reach an overall compromise. As the rapporteur said, it is important that we consider both passengers’ rights and the options open to transport providers. I would very much like to see some sort of agreement reached during the forthcoming mediation process, because I agree absolutely with Mr Simpson when he says that the exclusion of buses and coaches is unacceptable, given that other means of transport are covered by the regulation.

 Mr President, I believe that Mr Koch is right when he says that intelligent transport systems will take us into a new era. In the last year, I have come across lorries that can talk to one another. It sounds crazy, but this really is the intelligent transport management system of the future. Special devices enable lorries to identify for safety reasons whether there is an obstacle or a pedestrian crossing the road in front of them. They can then pass the information to the lorry travelling behind, so that it can brake in good time and prevent an accident from occurring. Of course, this is not yet on the agenda. In this case, the major benefit of Mrs Jensen’s report is that it gives us an overview of the current situation and an insight into what we will need in future in order to improve safety, prevent congestion, reduce accidents and take more effective action on the environment. My final point concerns something which I have experienced myself near Hanover in Germany. On the motorway, there is an intelligent transport system consisting of variable speed limits. These tell drivers what speed they should travel at in order to prevent traffic jams. This is good for drivers and for the environment and also reduces the number of accidents. We need systems of this kind and much more. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
).

 Mr President, Mr Kallas referred to a European maritime transport space without barriers. I believe that this is something that we all want. We also need it urgently and this report is another step in the right direction. It is a fact that 95% of our exports and 40% of intra-European goods are transported by sea and therefore pass through ports. For this reason, it is clearly absolutely essential for administrative procedures to be simplified and harmonised within this growth area. This report will meet both these objectives, which is why it cannot be praised highly enough. I regret the fact that Mr Sterckx was not able to achieve everything. Two points which were very close to his heart and which many other Members supported, as we have heard, are the simplification of the pilot licensing system, because this would be a really sensible, practical solution, and the lack of a common language. I believe that English really is the right language. It is unacceptable for accidents to happen in which people can even lose their lives simply because many seafarers speak different languages. It would be much better to introduce a common language in this very environmentally friendly area of transport, in just the same way as in the air transport industry. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, this has really been an afternoon devoted to transport and this is the report which basically summarises everything. Many people say that the greatest achievement made on behalf of the citizens of Europe is the internal market. As Mr Kallas has said, the transport routes are the arteries of the internal market. Therefore, it is, of course, important to ensure that these transport routes are safe, that they are developed in an environmentally friendly way, and that we take a general look at what can be improved in future using intelligent transport systems, for example. We must think about how we can structure the more environmentally friendly areas, such as rail and sea transport, in a more effective way, how we can move more transport away from the roads and into these areas, and how we can reduce the environmental impact of the emissions from sea transport. At the same time, we must also consider how to meet the specific needs of urban transport, which are very different from those of international transport. The future of urban transport may lie with managers who travel on e-bikes that also provide them with exercise. Of course, we need quite different options over longer distances, which would also fulfil a cross-border function. This is a good and very forward-looking report. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Providing consumers with information about food is undoubtedly important. However, the debate in Brussels has become a lobbying battle between large companies from the food industry and consumer protection organisations. There was no place in this debate for the reality of everyday life for consumers. The representatives of the German Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament are in favour of a minimum of labelling. Consumers should be able to make their purchasing decisions on the basis of transparent, legible information. Colour coded labelling influences consumers and does not form the basis for transparent information. The so-called guideline daily amounts (GDAs) also have their weak points. Instead of having neutral information about the amounts of nutrients per 100 grams or millilitres printed legibly on packaging, Parliament discussed whether the daily requirements of a 40-year-old woman could be used as the point of reference or whether the colour coding of nutrients was a useful decision-making tool. The proposed, far-reaching, mandatory requirements for the origin labelling of ingredients cannot be implemented in practice. We have also rejected the idea of special national provisions, because the labelling system should, as far as possible, be standardised. For these reasons, we were not able to vote in favour of the proposed report. Gesine Meissner,

 Mr President, Mrs Georgieva, you have presented this existing agreement and have said that there has been significant progress. We in Parliament take a less generous approach than you, as you have already heard. It is important that this agreement is in place, because the EU and the USA together account for about 60% of global air traffic and the USA is an important partner of ours in general terms. The problem is simply that, in a partnership, the conditions for both partners should be roughly the same. However, it is not possible to say that the conditions are the same when the USA has a 49% share of our market and we are only allowed about a 25% share of theirs. It is clear that this represents an imbalance. A small delegation went to the USA and took part in negotiations in the spring of this year. The Americans said to us that, if we wanted greater market access, we would have to lift the limitations on night flights and change the noise restrictions. We explained that for us, this is a question of subsidiarity which has to be respected. Basically, we can only negotiate on other issues if we have a reasonably level playing field. Four points were mentioned. The environment: we can make some joint progress via the emissions trading system, simply because we have such a large share of the world market. Social standards: something has been achieved in this area and passengers’ rights were also mentioned. Competition: this still leaves something to be desired. As far as security is concerned, I would now like to talk about data. The American concept of data protection and privacy is different from ours. We understandably want our concept of privacy to be respected. We looked at the body scanners while we were in the USA. There, it is normal for the scanners to show an image of the entire body, with only the face being concealed. This was completely inconceivable to us. We want privacy and data to be protected in every case. This has to be respected. We in Parliament, with our new powers from the Treaty of Lisbon, will be happy to discuss this with you.

 Mr President, Mrs Georgieva, you have now moved from air travel to rail travel, which is our second subject this evening. I must say that it is often the case in politics that fine words are followed by actions that leave a lot to be desired and that is what has happened here. In the European Union, we have a lot of excellent objectives. We have already achieved some of them, but others we are far from fulfilling. There is still a great deal to be done with regard to the internal transport market and rail transport in particular. We had good intentions, but we have to ask ourselves whether the European Union is a paper tiger. Or perhaps we do not have the wherewithal to get to where we want to go? In the past, competition on the rail market has been very varied. We need an independent regulatory body. This has functioned quite well for the rail system in Germany, but that does not mean that there is no room for improvement. We really need the option of dividing up the lines independently, so that everything runs smoothly and there can be real competition. That is one of the points that I wanted to make. It is, of course, embarrassing for us that, out of the 27 Member States, only the United Kingdom, Finland and the Netherlands have implemented the directive. The two Member States which have no railway system – Malta and Cyprus – were obviously unable to do so. All the others have not done their homework and have obviously got away with it, because we have not reprimanded them. Therefore, it is important for the European Union to put in place appropriate sanction mechanisms, otherwise we will not be taken seriously. It is also important to make it clear to the Member States that everyone will benefit from this. In principle, everyone wants the rail market to be opened up to competition. That is what everyone says. However, when it comes to taking action, nothing much happens. We must make progress on the finances. It finally became clear in Saragossa recently that there is a general lack of funding available. It could be our job to subsidise cross-border projects and we must, of course, call on the Member States to do more. We know that the situation is difficult everywhere at the moment, but this is what Europe needs. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
).

Madam President, we have heard a great deal already. It is true, as Mrs Figueiredo said, that this is a directive that was intended to be aimed at employees. That is correct. However, there are also self-employed people who are not classed as employees. It is important for people in Europe to be able to decide how they want to work – whether as an employee or as a self-employed worker. That is only right. Naturally, the self-employed also have to play by certain rules. Digital tachographs are already present in all heavy goods vehicles and the equivalent vehicles that we are talking about here. If we were now to include self-employed workers in this directive, it would unduly restrict their freedom of choice. That is why my group is in favour of excluding the self-employed from this directive at all costs. We consider Mrs Bauer’s proposal, and the proposal from the Commission, to be right. That should be taken into account. We want to protect small and medium-sized businesses, and in this case, we can do so by adopting the proposal. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
).

 Madam President, Commissioner, we are in complete agreement about the need for an internal market in rail freight transport as well. This is very important. We have had this on paper for a long time, but unfortunately we do not yet have it in practice. If we still have a few differences of opinion, that is due to the fact that we have different experiences in the various Member States in terms of the functioning or non-functioning of the rail network. I come from Germany, where it would be terrible if freight transport took priority over passenger transport. That would have a very negative effect on local public passenger transport. At the same time, we are very well aware that we need a continuous system in Europe. This is something that we want as well as need. There is just the question of how it will be implemented, how many corridors it will have and then, of course, also who will now lay down the one-stop shop rules, who will allocate the train paths. There are completely different opinions on this. Some people think that we would create a parallel system if we had a one-stop shop per corridor and not functional national one-stop shops, which should perhaps be included. That is the only source of dissent that we have. Otherwise, we all agree that we need this freight transport in Europe. Gesine Meissner,

 Madam President, Commissioner, we have already held a debate about the ash cloud and the associated problems for aviation in the immediate aftermath of the volcanic eruption. We observed various things in this crisis. We observed, for one thing, that aviation really is essential for the transport sector, as it is not only passengers that get stranded, but goods, too, can be left untransported. In Germany, for example, BMW had some production bottlenecks due to not receiving deliveries. We observed that we need every mode of transport, including aviation. For another thing, we observed that it is a significant crisis for the airlines if it is not possible to fly for several days. A five-day break, the airlines said, could be coped with. A 20-day break, however, could perhaps have caused a collapse of the entire industry lasting quite some time. We need not talk about compensation just yet, the airlines themselves said, but if it had lasted longer, that would have been necessary. Passenger rights have been subject to varying comments from different speakers. They have now put to the test the rule that, in such extraordinary cases, too, everything can be done for passengers in relation to information, compensation and recompense to the extent that they need it and in the way we originally laid it down here. There are still two subjects in particular that I would like to go into. The first is the Single European Sky. We do not have a single European airspace, and that is something that was painfully absent this time, too. A single European airspace clearly would not have prevented the volcanic eruption, we all know that, but we would certainly have been better able to bring about the smooth evacuation of passengers. We have appointed a Functional Airspace Blocks (FAB) coordinator, of course. He is now starting work, and we all very much hope that his work will relatively soon be able to lead to a single European airspace. The question is also how long will it take until we actually achieve this? Perhaps you are not in a position to answer that precisely. We have also discussed before whether better European coordination of the railway sector – something that we have long been wanting and, on paper, have long had – could have helped passengers to get home more quickly. In this regard, too, we observed quite clearly where our difficulties lie. I will now move on to my final question. Do we have good crisis management arrangements for cases like this? We have the institute in London, which is actually there to provide information when there are earthquakes. It also deals with volcanic eruptions as a secondary responsibility. Now it has been producing computer projections based on second-hand data, and it has been criticised for that. What can we learn from other parts of the world where volcano eruptions are more common, such as the United States, Indonesia and others? What other measurements do they take? According to my information, they are better prepared for such situations. Perhaps we had not planned for this in Europe, but we do then have to learn the resultant lessons. We are a hi-tech location, we have a lot of opportunities, and researchers in Germany, for example, have called for a specialised monitoring network for those aerosols, those minuscule items, that volcanic ash contains. What else do you think that we can do? How can we improve our technologies in the interests of aviation, the people and goods? Jürgen Creutzmann,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European single market, Europe’s greatest achievement, is celebrating its 20th anniversary. Border-free travel, work and study, a huge market for businesses and consumers: the single market gives us more freedoms and is a driver of trade and productivity. However, the benefit that the European Union derives from the single market could be doubled if further barriers to trade – especially in the service sector – were to be removed by promoting the digital single market and integrating infrastructure. If we examine infrastructure in the single market, two things become clear. Firstly, it is fragmented: few countries place a priority on cross-border links. Let us take the example of rail traffic: a goods train travelling from Italy to Sweden has to change its locomotive and crew up to four times. Secondly, the integration of national systems is extremely costly. Physical and regulatory hurdles must be overcome. The Commission’s proposals currently being discussed for trans-European transport, energy and telecommunications networks address these and other problems. However, these ambitious aims can only be achieved if enough money is made available. Investments in infrastructure are the best use of EU funds, because they encourage sustainable growth, employment and European competitiveness. This is why it is so important that the Member States, as part of the ongoing negotiations over the multiannual financial framework, do not make any cuts in the Connecting Europe Facility. SMEs must also benefit more from the European single market. Ninety-nine per cent of European enterprises are SMEs, but only 25 % export within the single market. The further completion of the single market holds no dangers for Member States. On the contrary, it is an opportunity for more growth, more jobs and thereby more prosperity for people in Europe. Jürgen Creutzmann,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in many political areas we already speak with a single European voice at international level. Unfortunately, this is not true with regard to external energy policy. It is regrettable that the Commission’s proposal and the ambitious position of Parliament were rejected by the Member States. In formal terms the Council may be right in claiming that the European Union does not have executive powers. However, it must be clear to all of us that we must all pull together in the energy sector if we are to meet the challenges of security of supply and affordable energy in the long term. As globalisation progresses and various actors in the energy markets flex their muscles, even the large Member States must realise that in the long run we can only succeed by acting in concert. This is even more the case for the smaller Member States. We knew from the start that our parliamentary position was very ambitious. We had to expect resistance. However, it gives one pause to realise that the Council saw no room for negotiations. Having weighed up all the options, we can agree to the results of the negotiations. After all, we have the opportunity to agree at least a legal framework, a basis on which we can build in a few years’ time. I believe that this is better than a failed legislative text that would have forced us to start again from scratch next time around. For this reason, we will vote against the amendments tabled by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament. I would like to express my sincere thanks again to the rapporteurs for their commitment and for their efforts to support the Commission in this. Jürgen Creutzmann,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the protection of intellectual property rights is of life and death importance to the European economy. Increasingly frequent infringements of rights and the constantly increasing trade in rights-infringing products threaten the growth of our economy and, with it, also jobs. Counterfeit products damage not only the industry affected, but can also represent a serious threat to the health and safety of consumers. This is often forgotten when this matter is discussed. The customs authorities at the EU’s external borders are in a comparatively favourable position to retain rights-infringing products before they reach the internal market. That is why it is so important that this regulation should be adapted to meet the new challenges of our times. The Commission has recognised the need for action and produced a sound proposal last year in which it extended the scope of the regulation, increased legal certainty for transiting goods, and put forward a special procedure for small consignments in view of the burgeoning online trade in counterfeit products. In my view, however, there is still considerable potential to further improve the conditions for the affected actors. I am referring, in this regard in particular, to the customs authorities, rights holders and consumers. With my report, I pursued four goals; namely, increasing protection for consumers, relieving the burden on customs authorities, strengthening the position of rights holders and observing data protection. With regard to the first objective, in contrast to the oft-cited view, the enforcement of intellectual property rights is in the interests of consumers more than anyone. This is because counterfeit products generally do not meet the statutory requirements and are generally not subject to any quality control. As a result, these products often endanger the health and safety of consumers. During our committee’s consultation, we were shown horrific pictures of consumers seriously disfigured after using counterfeit toiletries. It is not going too far to say that counterfeit products can even put people’s lives at risk. By way of example, one German carmaker brought to my attention the deadly risk that counterfeit braking systems entail. With regard to the second objective, the customs authorities can only effectively enforce the various intellectual property rights if they can quickly and efficiently instigate proceedings. We therefore put forward a series of proposals in order to ease the work of the customs authorities. In principle, a procedure to destroy the goods and launch proceedings that is as standardised and simplified as possible should be used for all cases of infringed rights. The procedure proposed by our committee makes it possible to destroy products without a court having to determine an infringement of rights, provided that the rights holder confirms the infringement and – a very important detail – that neither the party reporting the infringement nor the holder of the goods objects. This ensures the protection of rights and a procedure in accordance with the rule of law. Moreover, the special procedure for small consignments makes it easier to destroy goods, as the customs authority no longer needs to contact the rights holder in each individual case. This is of benefit both to the customs authorities and the rights holders. The conditions for information exchange between customs authorities in the Union and the competent authorities in third countries should also be improved. That will make it possible to prevent the production and sale of counterfeit goods closer to the source. With regard to the third objective, with the new regulation, we are also aiming to strengthen the rights of the holders of intellectual property rights. It is they, after all, who generate significant growth and jobs in Europe through their innovations. If we Europeans want to continue to be competitive, we need to promote innovation by effectively enforcing intellectual property rights. We have a series of proposals to that end: a) Rights holders are to be given better access to information about goods seized.
 b) They may also use this information to determine the identity of the rights holder, both in connection with criminal proceedings and out-of-court settlements. c) The biggest improvement is to be found in the reversal of the burden of proof in the case of transiting goods. I will go into that again later in my summing up. Jürgen Creutzmann,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I am still a little shocked by this debate. Mr Engström, it goes without saying that the customs authorities will not become the arbiters of patents, as the Commissioner has stressed once again. Similarly, I do not understand the concerns of social democratic Members. I believe that their worry is completely unfounded as, when it comes to generic products, for the first time, the text states quite specifically that the customs authorities may not obstruct the free trade of medicines and, in particular, generic products. We further reinforced this basic principle in our report. I also thought it important – and there were some points to debate in this regard – to ensure the rule of law. This is, after all, a highly important criterion, in other words, that those whose rights are infringed can also take legal action against customs decisions. On another note, I have been pleased to see that the Council has adopted many of our amendments in its compromise text, for example, Commissioner, when it comes to the delegated acts for small consignments. We proposed two kilogrammes and three items, from which the Council has made three kilogrammes and five items, so we will certainly reach a positive result in this regard. I hope that plenary will back this report with a large majority tomorrow so that we can immediately enter into negotiations with the Council, and that, as the Commissioner said in his speech, at the end of the year, a regulation will then enter into force that offers benefits all round, which is to say, to consumers, data protection, businesses – that has been stressed once again in the speeches we have heard – but also the customs authorities. Our contribution was reducing the red tape for the customs authorities in order to help them to be able to resolve cases. I believe that we succeeded in doing so. Jürgen Creutzmann  (ALDE

 The German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament has spoken out clearly in favour of the introduction of a debt redemption fund. However, participation in such a fund must be associated with clear and strict rules, such as were contained in the proposal made by the German Council of Economic Experts to the German Government in autumn 2011. Watering down the criteria for participation is neither productive nor effective. Linking the introduction of a debt redemption fund with the eurobonds project and the treatment of economic imbalances is unfair, and is rejected by the FDP in the European Parliament in the strongest possible terms.

 Mr President, Mr Potočnik, cooperation between the European Union and Switzerland is something dear to my heart. That is why it is important to deal with these issues hampering cooperation. We have heard that the provisions for the granting of residence permits for eight European countries no longer correspond to the agreements. We regret this action on the part of the Swiss authorities, particularly in view of the fact that this is just one of many measures that threaten the transposition of bilateral agreements between Switzerland and the European Union; Mr Potočnik has outlined the problems already. It is evident from this that, within the Joint Committee, the Commission still needs to deal with the still outstanding measures for the free provision of services in Switzerland and the implementation of an internal market. If we succeed in making progress here and in reaching an agreement between Switzerland and the European Union that sets down binding rules when it comes to points under dispute, then this can only be to everyone’s benefit. The decision by the Swiss authorities is not just unwise in political terms, but also from an economic perspective. We know, for example, that there are many well-qualified young Polish citizens who would have had the opportunity to work in Switzerland in future and to contribute to prosperity there. I hope that Switzerland will revise this decision and withdraw it again. Jürgen Creutzmann,

 Mr President, one of the most serious problems for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is access to finance. The Commission’s cohesion policy should be able to help resolve this problem. There are various programmes which have already been mentioned. A study by the European Parliament on the effectiveness of the Structural Funds and other measures aimed at regional SMEs has evidently highlighted some weaknesses. These include a failure to distinguish between different types of SMEs – such as micro-enterprises, but also self-employed people – major bureaucratic obstacles during the process of applying for finance, together with the reporting and monitoring requirements, the need for advance funding for projects and a lack of standardisation of the rules and procedures across different subsidy programmes. This leads me to make a few requests to the Commission. We should be able to simplify the process of obtaining finance from the Structural Funds. We need to improve the access to Joint European Resources for Micro to Medium Enterprises (JEREMIE). The contribution of EUR 50 000 required from the applicants is too high. We need to relax the requirement for advance funding for projects. We also need to take a more targeted approach to providing finance for different types of SMEs, to reduce the amount of cofinancing required and to close the financing gap between the individual depreciation cycles. In addition, we need more support to help SMEs to help themselves in the area of financing. Professional organisations could make a contribution in this respect. We must help SMEs to become stronger and to increase their capital. They have to do this in order to obtain loans from the banks. Mr Hahn, it is, of course, also important that Basel III is implemented in such a way that it does not obstruct the process of lending to SMEs, but instead creates opportunities for companies to access loans easily and under favourable terms. Jürgen Creutzmann  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today’s vote will introduce a regulation which brings direct added value for the citizens of Europe. During the next summer holidays, mobile phone calls from abroad will be significantly cheaper and, for the first time, there will be price transparency outside Europe, which is also important. For me, an essential feature of this regulation is that we have not repeated the mistakes of Roaming I and Roaming II. It has become clear that simple price limits, which actually have the same effect as price fixing, do not lead to more competition. Therefore, it is important for us to focus now on unbundling roaming services and national contracts for mobile communication services. We are creating a market which will lead to low prices of its own accord by providing genuine consumer choice and introducing new market players. Of course, we still need a safety net for prices as a transitional measure and to protect consumers from abuse. However, more competition also requires more market players and they will not come onto the market while the price limits are too low and there is too little scope for innovative offers. It will also not help consumers if operators do not have enough money in future to invest in new, faster networks. Ultimately, we do not want to fall behind in Europe. For these reasons, I welcome the fact that we have found a sensible solution and I would like to thank Ms Niebler specifically for her important contribution to this common-sense regulation. Consumers will notice the benefits of the new Roaming Regulation in their wallets. By 2014, there will be significant falls of up to 45% in the cost of incoming and outgoing calls and, as early as July 2012, consumers will be paying almost 20% less. Particularly in the case of data roaming, there have been no limits to misuse until now, which has, in some cases, resulted in horrendous prices. A cap will be put on these in future. We must continue to work towards completing the internal market and, if possible, finding a solution which means that in future, we do not need roaming charges at all.

 Mr President, I should like to start by expressing my deep gratitude to all the shadow rapporteurs, who made this report possible through their excellent cooperation. The committee agreed to this report with an overwhelming vote of 30 in favour, one against and one abstention. Online gambling is an international phenomenon that is growing on a daily basis. Consumers find it easy to gamble online with providers who are either completely unregulated or who are registered in other countries where different rules apply. As a result, some individual Member States are no longer able to guarantee sufficient protection for their consumers. Children and young people or gambling addicts are particularly affected by this. In addition, frequently illegal foreign competition causes Member States to lose many millions of euro in tax revenue every year. This comes at a cost to the promotion of charitable projects, combating addiction and support for amateur sport. Finally, legal uncertainties make it difficult to offer cross-border gambling services within the internal market. Given that there are no European licensing standards, it is necessary to decide on a case-by-case basis whether practices in the Member States comply with European law. The existing level of legal uncertainty is made clear by the large number of contractual violation cases in recent years. That is why there is an urgent need to close the existing gap between legislation and reality. The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has come to a clear conclusion. The Member States need to cooperate much more closely on this issue. This will not be enough to resolve the problems outlined, however. In addition, the European Union will also have to play a significant role in future. This has been demanded by our committee with an overwhelming majority. In addition to other measures, an EU directive is also to be considered that will set shared minimum standards for consumer and youth protection, combating crime in the area of online gambling. Although the committee emphasises the principle of subsidiarity in its report on online gambling, the Member States need to regulate online betting for themselves insofar as possible within their own territory. However, this means that certain rules will need to be met in accordance with the judicial rulings of the European Court of Justice: restrictions in the legal range of gambling services, through state monopoly for example, are only permitted if they are coherent and proportionate. We cannot have a situation where a state explains away its monopoly by arguing that it wishes to protect consumers from the negative effects of gambling, while at the same time intensively advertising its range of state-backed gambling options. The best example of this can be found in Germany, where we have a state monopoly on gambling and lotteries, but with frequent advertising informing consumers of the current size of the jackpot, naturally encouraging players to invest their money in the lottery. To avoid such situations in the future, the European Union should set down quality standards for state licensing models. If a Member State decides in favour of a state licensing model, this model must comply with the principles of transparency and fair competition. In other words, all providers of gambling services that comply with the relevant conditions should be able to apply for a licence. At the same time, trust between the national regulatory authorities needs to be strengthened so as to achieve greater cooperation. In addition, the Commission is called upon to examine ways to use legislation to prevent the flow of payments between illegal providers and their customers. This could be achieved, for example, if each Member State were to draw up a white list of licensed gambling operators in its territory. Banks and credit institutions would only then be permitted to authorise transactions with these approved operators. I believe that this is a sensible and realistic alternative to the blocking of Internet sites, something that we, as liberals, would not favour. This measure would also be an important step in securing tax income from legal gambling, combating organised crime, and protecting the consumer from unregulated gambling. Everyone, regulated providers, the public purse and consumers alike, would benefit from the measures called for in the report. Nonetheless, the European Commission needs the full backing of the European Parliament in order to present the necessary initiatives. It is for this reason I am hopeful that there will be a broad majority in favour at tomorrow’s vote, giving the Commission a clear mandate for action. Mr Barnier, it is over to you.

In my opinion, it exacerbates the problem of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), rather than resolving it. We need a standard, EU-wide solution. We do not need renationalisation, which will prevent us from achieving our internal market objectives. In addition, it will weaken the position of the EU in future World Trade Organisation negotiations.

 The German Free Democratic Party delegation in the European Parliament assumes that the inclusion of Romania and Bulgaria in the Schengen area will further improve freedom of movement within the EU. Now that both Member States have achieved positive evaluation results in all areas of the Schengen review, there should be no more obstacles to delay inclusion further. There is no denying that the technical securing of borders will not automatically make them impermeable as long as problems persist in combating corruption in the justice and policing system. Accordingly, this challenge also relates to Member States already in the Schengen area. For this reason, the German Free Democratic Party delegation believes that criteria such as the fight against corruption must receive greater attention when evaluating the Schengen mechanism, and any misdemeanours must be punished appropriately.

Mr President, Mr Rehn, the joint question on the review of the Small Business Act shows that there is still a great deal to be done to ensure that medium-sized companies in Europe have freedom to act, particularly on a national level. However, I am pleased that in recent years, we have succeeded in implementing almost all the provisions of the Small Business Act in the European Union. Most recently, a new directive on combating late payment in commercial transactions came into force in March, which will make an important contribution to improving payment practice in Europe. Now the Member States have two years to implement the new directive. I would like to call for this timeframe to be shortened, in particular, in the Member States where this would not present a significant problem. Instead of delaying implementation for two years, it could be completed, where possible, within one year. The Member States have not yet been able to agree on the statute for a European private company. Therefore, I very much welcome the fact that the Hungarian Presidency is following up this issue and making it one of the focal points of its work. This form of company in particular could enable small and medium-sized enterprises to save a great deal of money. I am thinking, in particular, of accounting, establishing a company and ongoing legal advice. Therefore, I would like to say again how pleased I am that the Hungarian Presidency is focusing on this area. The issue just mentioned by Mrs Riera Madurell is also important, and that is public procurement. Here, we can still achieve a great deal for small and medium-sized enterprises. There are many bureaucratic regulations in this area and it is often particularly difficult for small and medium-sized businesses to take part in the public procurement process. We need greater transparency and we must also try to make the most of the opportunities presented by the modern media and, in particular, the Internet. Jürgen Creutzmann,

Mr President, Mr Barnier, I would like to respond to my fellow Member’s remarks. Instead of a social clause, the committee has proposed investigating the impact that the measures in the internal market will have on employment. This is much more important than applying general formulae. If we want to make progress with the internal market, we must pay attention to social issues and put the emphasis on them in everything we do. For this reason, an impact assessment which specifically takes these requirements into account is particularly important. I would like to make one more comment. I was surprised to hear the President speak about economic governance, which is still translated in German as Wirtschaftslenkung
. This term is also used to mean central state control of the economy. We have had very bad experiences of state control of the economy in one area of Germany. I am certain that we can only develop the internal market further if we coordinate all our national economies. That is abundantly clear. However, we will not be able to make progress with the internal market by means of economic governance. Today, we are discussing how we can bring some momentum to the internal market. This is long overdue, because we will be celebrating the 20th anniversary of the internal market next year. Therefore, I welcome Mr Barnier’s statement in which he said that he wants to focus on a few specific measures that have not yet been implemented and that will give a new impetus to the internal market. The internal market represents a huge opportunity for all of us. It can lead to the creation of more jobs and our goal must be to find work for people. This is the very best social policy that we can put in place, because people who are employed will also develop self-esteem. Therefore, we must do everything we can to make sure that progress is made in this area. We need a balanced package of measures which brings advantages for businesses and for citizens. On the one hand, we want medium-sized companies in particular to benefit more from the internal market than they have done in the past. Therefore, we urgently need an EU patent system, so that companies can at last protect and sell their innovative products throughout Europe for a reasonable cost. In addition, businesses need more funding to develop innovations. A European venture capital market is just one of many measures that can be taken. The harmonisation of value-added tax and the corporate tax base that we are now discussing will also give a boost to the internal market. On the other hand, we also need to take specific measures which will increase citizens’ trust in the internal market. We must improve the recognition of professional qualifications, possibly by means of the European professional card. This will make it easier to work in another Member State and will create more mobility for citizens within the European internal market. We also need a European market surveillance organisation, and I would like to emphasise this point, because the Member States are constantly failing to put the dossier into practice. We do not want dangerous products to be sold on the internal market. If we can adopt this proposal with a large majority, we will be able to give a new impetus to the internal market.

 Madam President, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, the largest single market in the world in terms of economic power has developed in the globalised era into a crucial location advantage for the European Union. That is why it is so important to oppose protectionist tendencies and to expand the single market further. In view of the excessively indebted national budgets, there is nothing left for Europe to do but to strengthen the economy by means of structural reforms. Since its establishment in 1992, the single market has already generated additional growth of 1.85%. Implementation of the measures that have been announced is intended to bring about further growth of 2 to 4%. We can divide the Commission’s 50 proposals for single market initiatives into three categories: firstly, into the many specific proposals that will, in any case, enhance the single market for enterprises and citizens. These include the creation of a fully operational internal energy market which, for Europe as an economic and industrial centre, is particularly important. Then there is a European professional card and a European Skills Passport to facilitate mobility within the European Union, which will become more and more important in future in order to maintain Europe’s competitiveness in a globalised world, and the strengthening of electronic commerce by means of better management of copyrights and new guidelines for the effective implementation of the Services Directive in order to create new jobs. Secondly, there are, however, also many proposals which are worded in too vague a manner for us to be able to assess them yet. Therefore, we still need to wait for the Commission’s specific proposals. I include here the revision of the EU rules for public procurement, measures for services of general interest and also – Mrs Gebhardt – the deliberations on a European approach to collective redress. I do not know whether we ought to go down the same erroneous path as the United States. Thirdly, the communication also contains proposals which, in my view, are counterproductive in terms of strengthening the single market, because they burden enterprises with additional bureaucracy. We therefore need to discuss these proposals, and we are ready to do so. Jürgen Creutzmann,

Madam President, Commissioner Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow, the European Parliament will adopt a directive on combating late payment that will make history. It is the first directive that can quite simply be explained in three sentences: firstly, public authorities will, as a matter of principle, have to pay within 30 days in future if no shorter payment targets have been agreed and if no special circumstances make a payment target of no more than 60 days necessary. Secondly, when agreeing payment targets, enterprises have freedom of contract within 60 days and payment targets of more than 60 days are no longer permitted, except if expressly agreed and if it does not pose a serious disadvantage to the creditor. Thirdly, if the aforementioned payment deadlines are exceeded, recovery costs of at least EUR 40 and interest of at least 8% above the European Central Bank base interest rate can be charged without a prior reminder. This directive will help small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe to a great extent to improve their liquidity, and they will not need to accept as much credit from the banks. Debtors with a strong market presence will no longer be able to force small and medium-sized enterprises into granting longer payment deadlines, and that is a good thing. Furthermore, individual Member States will not only be able to retain shorter payment target deadlines in the form that has been customary up to now; we assume that, in fact, they will be retained, because we cannot imagine that the Late Payments Directive will lead to a deterioration in payment practices within the Member States. Enterprises that do business within Europe know that, in future, their claims will be settled after no more than 60 days. This is a huge step forward and a further step towards the completion of the European internal market. We can be very satisfied with the adoption of this legislation. It will help small and medium-sized enterprises and it will help the European internal market. Jürgen Creutzmann  (ALDE

 Madam President, Commissioner, in Pakistan, we have witnessed devastating floods, and we must help the suffering, destitute people of this country. In this regard, what saddens me, in particular, is the fact that there are regions in Pakistan that the central government is not allowing any proper aid to reach. Thus, for example, the region of Gilgit-Baltistan, north of Jammu and Kashmir within the Pakistani border region, has also been badly hit by heavy rainfall and its effects. According to information I have received, in Gilgit-Baltistan alone, 500 people have died and 50 000 people have been made homeless. Four bridges have been washed away and many areas of land have been completely cut off from the outside world. So far, however, aid equivalent to only around EUR 10 000 has reached Gilgit-Baltistan. Therefore, the European Union should not just hand over its aid to the Pakistani central government but provide direct support to the non-governmental organisations that are also looking after the interests of the remote regions of Pakistan.

Along with the majority of Members in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I have decided to vote in favour of the Sommer report. It is true that the Liberals were not able to achieve their goals in every area. The adoption of origin labelling for meat and milk in processed products is a regrettable move, because it imposes significant costs on producers and seems almost impossible to implement in practice. However, for me, the positive results of the vote clearly outweigh the negative ones. For the first time, we have uniform regulations on food labelling throughout the entire internal market, with no possibility of individual countries going it alone. In addition, one of the decisive successes of this vote for me is the fact that the misleading traffic light model was rejected. A mandatory colour coded nutrient declaration will not be permitted either at a European or a national level. Uniform Europe-wide labelling rules will bring clear advantages for companies and consumers. The cost of manufacturing and selling products will fall because manufacturers will only have to follow a single regulation. Consumers will benefit from uniform nutrient labelling when comparing products that come from within Europe.

 Combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography is vitally important. We must use all our strength to combat the availability of child pornography in communications networks. The permanent and effective control of child abuse is both a political responsibility and a precept of the rule of law. The German Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament is of the opinion that it is necessary to remove such criminal content as quickly as possible. Jürgen Creutzmann  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, Commissioner Dalli, the fact that we are discussing three own-initiative reports on consumer protection and the internal market today shows that, despite all of our successes in these areas, there is still much that is in need of improvement. Admittedly, the Member States’ transposition of the internal market directives has, on average, greatly improved, but seven Member States have failed to meet the target set by the Commission of reducing the transposition deficit for the internal market directives to 1%. The main problem, however, has more to do with the application of EU law than with its transposition. Thus, in the event of treaty infringements by Member States, it takes, on average, 18 months – in other words, still far too long – for them to comply with the judgment of the European Court of Justice. This can be seen from the current internal market scorecard, and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe finds that unacceptable. This deficit will lead to problems for citizens and, in particular, for small and medium-sized enterprises, which depend on harmonised rules within the internal market, but which meet with unexpected, time-consuming and bureaucratic obstacles when they want to operate across borders. This is why it is important for SOLVIT to be developed further. SOLVIT is an online problem-solving network in which the Member States work together in a pragmatic way to resolve problems that have arisen as a result of the misapplication of internal market rules by public authorities. All Member States must ultimately provide the financial resources and adequately trained staff for the SOLVIT centres. The ALDE Group calls emphatically for people to be made more aware of SOLVIT in the Member States in order to facilitate the cross-border sale of their products and services. For this purpose, the involvement of the relevant associations in large-scale information campaigns is just as necessary as a uniform, easy-to-understand and easy-to-find Internet portal for receiving all kinds of complaints.

 According to the resolution of the European Parliament on the draft general budget for the financial year 2010, adopted on 17 December 2009, a vote was taken today on the amending budget for the European Parliament, following the revised calculations made by the Parliamentary administration. The FDP in the European Parliament abstained, because there was a paragraph in the package of amendments concerned that we could not reconcile with our convictions. The FDP had already expressed its opposition to an increase in the secretarial allowance to EUR 1 500 during the discussions in committee. It is out of the secretarial allowance that MEPs’ assistants are paid. The FDP considers that the argument that more money is needed due to the additional work that MEPs have to do with the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is unsound, as there is nothing in past experience to support this. Certainly, under the Treaty of Lisbon, which has just come into force, Parliament will overall need extra capacity for legislative work, but with the introduction of the Assistants’ Statute from the beginning of the current parliamentary term, there is still no proof that MEPs actually need more assistants. For this reason, there are grounds for concern that further demands and supplementary increases, or an extension of office capacity, will follow. For this reason, the FDP in the European Parliament abstained from voting. Jürgen Creutzmann

 Mr President, Commissioner, if what you are calling for is further development and harmonisation of the internal market, then we need to have a common set of rules. There are three aspects to online gambling which ought to be considered in this debate. How can we best protect the interests of our citizens and consumers? How can we best prevent fraud and criminal activity? How can we best protect our citizens from harm? The European Parliament resolution of 10 March 2009 on the integrity of online gambling has indicated methods and ways to proceed with regard to this issue. Now, as before, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe endorses the principles concerning the integrity of online gambling contained in Parliament’s resolution of 10 March 2009. In accordance with a ruling of the European Court of Justice, each Member State is free, under certain conditions, to regulate online gambling itself and the resolution of 10 March stresses that emphatically. National rules are better suited to combating match-fixing fraud, although this type of fraud cannot be eliminated entirely, as demonstrated by some recent examples in Germany. It has to be said, though, that gambling markets are much better regulated at national level, according to the tradition and culture of the country concerned. Players are offered better protection against addiction, fraud, money laundering and match-fixing if they can play through major online gambling service providers, who always, by definition, operate across borders. We cannot regulate everything according to the internal market concept and particularly not the prevention of underage gambling or gambling addiction. Online gambling provides increased opportunities for corrupt practices, such as fraud, match-fixing and illegal betting cartels, as online games can be set up and dismantled very rapidly. Illegal offshore betting operators present a particular problem in this regard, as it is almost impossible for them to be regulated or controlled. Profits from gambling should primarily be used for the benefit of society in order to promote amateur sport, amongst other things. It is best to leave this to the competence of national administrations. Continuous funding, for culture and professional and amateur sport, for example, gives individual Member States some justification for permitting gambling. However, a precondition for that is that the risk of addiction must be highlighted and proactively combated. As the full impact on consumers of the specific forms of gambling services offered online is not yet known, we need to take urgent action to fill this knowledge gap. It is essential in this context that Member States really do fulfil their tasks. Market surveillance is also key, when it comes to online gambling. If we in the European Parliament can agree that Member States have the right, under the principle of subsidiarity, to regulate their gambling markets according to their own traditions and cultures, we also then have to ensure that this is actually happening, through efficient control and market surveillance. Jürgen Creutzmann,

 Madam President, Commissioner, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports the views expressed in the opinion of the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment to the effect that the ALARA principle, in other words, the principle of ‘as low as reasonably achievable’, should apply in the assessment of carcinogenic substances. Secondly, there is consequently a need for the Commission to examine whether this principle is also satisfied by the limit values laid down in the Toys Directive. Thirdly, if this does not happen, we call on the Commission to ensure that, until the Toys Directive has been transposed by all the Member States in 2011, the limit values are laid down in the Toys Directive in such a way as to rule out any risk to the health of children from softening agents in toys. Fourthly, the principle enshrined in the Toys Directive, whereby chemicals that are potentially carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction are impermissible, must be implemented with regard to accessible parts of toys. This must actually be achieved by the limit values set, as otherwise such a directive is worthless. Fifthly, this calls, in particular, for better and more efficient market surveillance, because it is usually toys that have been imported into the EU that exceed the limit values set by the Union. However, efficient market surveillance would also enable toys manufactured within the EU to be tested to see whether they, too, comply with the limit values. Sixthly, it is totally unacceptable, should this be the case, that lower standards should apply to imports into the EU than, for example, into the US. However, the threat by the German Federal Minister for Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection, Ilse Aigner, to go it alone and prohibit so-called ‘toxic toys’ herself is, in my view, completely the wrong way to go about it and totally counterproductive when it comes to creating confidence in the European internal market. Merely cultivating national popular opinion not only destroys confidence in the European Institutions; it also damages the German Federal Government, because it approved the Toys Directive.

 The German Free Democratic Party members of the European Parliament have abstained from voting on the Copenhagen resolution for the following reasons. The resolution contains statements about financing for climate protection measures in third countries without defining the specific criteria or purpose of the financing. We cannot justify this to taxpayers. In addition, we believe that blanket criticism of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) is wrong. The ICAO is the organisation which deals with aviation matters at an international level. Both the criticism and the statement about the alleged failure of ICAO negotiations are incorrect and inappropriate. The call for specific arrangements for a CO2
 trading system for the aviation industry goes against current EU legislation and overburdens the EU’s negotiating position in an international climate agreement with unrealistic demands. Jürgen Creutzmann,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s response is, of course, not only discouraging, as Mr Schwab said, but also very disappointing. When it comes to the transposition, we need to realise that if you say that around 50% are on schedule, then we have to assume that the other 50% are a long way from achieving that. Take my own country, Germany, for example: the individual Federal Länder 
are currently transposing this directive. In Rhineland-Palatinate, where I live, I had the opportunity, on 2 September, to participate in the first reading for the transposition of the Services Directive for this Federal Land
. As you can imagine, it will be impossible to achieve the transposition on time, and I believe that the other Federal Länder
 are in a similar position. The crucial factor for us, of course, will be how the transposition is carried out. If Article 13(2) stipulates that ‘authorisation procedures and formalities shall not be dissuasive and shall not unduly complicate or delay the provision of the service’ then we must take great care to ensure that this does not happen in practice. A decisive factor, for example, will be how the single points of contact are equipped. Will they have language skills? Will they work closely enough with the administrations to also be able to deal with the concerns put to them? We very much doubt it. In fact, the committee should now be asking which countries are behind schedule with this, which countries make up the 50% and when do they expect to achieve this. It would then be better to create a moratorium, or something similar, for these countries. I am certain that, in most countries, this directive will not be transposed by 1 January 2010, even though these countries have had more than four years to do this. That is a major problem and it is very disappointing. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

 Dear colleague, that is a very good point. I would like to answer you in English. I have considered that, and as Liberals we are always fighting against bureaucratic burdens.

Mr President, the delegated act as adopted on 30 September 2013 foresees that public-private partnership bodies are to receive an indirect discharge via the Commission, instead of an individual discharge as they receive now. We fought against this as a team of rapporteurs, and I thank Ingeborg Gräßle for this good compromise. We rechecked with the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Controls which, acting under Rule 51 and unanimously, adopted the motion for resolution objecting to the delegated act. An alternative approach was now agreed upon by the Parliament, Council and Commission teams, which they are to endorse via a trilateral joint statement which foresees that, firstly, Parliament, the Council and the Commission agree that the joint undertakings should continue to be subject to a separate discharge by the European Parliament upon recommendation of the Council, and secondly, that the Commission will include derogations in the financial rules of the joint undertakings to reflect the separate discharge. Subsequently, the Commission will propose corresponding modifications to Articles 209 and 60 of the Financial Regulation. Thirdly (and last but not least), the Commission Delegated Regulation of 30 September 2013 on the model financial regulation for public-private partnership bodies will enter into force in order to allow joint undertakings to benefit from the simplifications introduced in the new financial framework. As just mentioned by the Presidency, the Council will endorse the joint statement on 20 January. In the light of this, the Committee on Budgetary Control and, I believe, the Committee on Budgets are ready to endorse this trilateral joint statement on the separate discharge for joint undertakings. In the name of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I request the withdrawal of the resolution objecting to the delegated act which was initially planned for vote tomorrow in Plenary.

 Mr President, Commissioner Šefčovič, Parliament has always actively supported the Danube Strategy. The Danube Forum, of which I am the Chair, has 60 MEPs. Therefore, I am pleased to be the first signatory of the oral question to put the subject of the Danube on today’s agenda. There has been some progress with regard to the Danube, such as the bridges I saw this summer between Widin and Calafat, on the international Danube bicycle tour. However, this progress is moving at a snail’s pace. There are still major difficulties: mayors in Bulgaria tell us that construction works on the Danube require consultation with seven ministries in Sofia. Other Danube residents have the impression in their Member States that the Danube is being marginalised in capital cities and not being placed in the foreground. This is why we are asking the Commission for more substantial results and measures. In the current programming period, the Danube Strategy should be provided with resources and for the future period we need a dedicated budget line for the Danube. We have specific projects, such as the Danube Manager, for which administration capacity needs to be developed. Small and medium-sized enterprises should be supported while they cooperate. There should be technology transfer centres. More than anything else, we need more opportunities for citizens to meet. We note that these citizens’ meetings must be supported otherwise they do not function. I have written to Chancellor Merkel and Commissioner Lewandowski to propose the formation of a Danube Youth Foundation. I therefore pose the question: can the Commission imagine itself financially supporting such a Danube Youth Foundation? Many young people would like to meet up, but cannot afford the tank of petrol or the train tickets they need to get to a meeting. Ladies and gentlemen, parliaments should play a greater role. I hope that we in the European Parliament will act as leaders and invite the other national and regional parliaments to join in, so that we, too, take greater ownership of the Danube Strategy than ever before.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the level of dissatisfaction in the wake of the Rio conference is significant. We recognise that Europe cannot force its ideas in relation to environmental policy on the rest of the world. This phase of disillusionment can also be seen as an opportunity, however. Europe can act as a role model. That is my first point. My second point is that we need to focus more on adjusting to the new situation brought about by climate change, as well as working towards climate protection. Above all, I believe that Europe’s development organisations, research institutions, universities and private enterprises can make a significant contribution; after all, we need to see economic development and environmental policy as two sides of the same coin. Weaker countries will only be able to pursue environmental policies if they also make progress on the economic development front. So, let us press forward with environmental technology. This is something Europe can offer other countries. Perhaps we need to question the idea of greening. Perhaps we should create blue growth that is mainly based on technology. As the world’s population continues to grow, this will only be possible if we see economics and environmental policy as inextricably linked.

 The German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament has spoken out clearly in favour of the introduction of a debt redemption fund. However, participation in such a fund must be associated with clear and strict rules, such as were contained in the proposal made by the German Council of Economic Experts to the German Government in autumn 2011. Watering down the criteria for participation is neither productive nor effective. Linking the introduction of a debt redemption fund with the eurobonds project and the treatment of economic imbalances is unfair, and is rejected by the FDP in the European Parliament in the strongest possible terms.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, do you know Mr Hanselmann? If not, you should get to know him. Around 20 years ago, Mr Hanselmann founded a company with three colleagues from the University of Paderborn. Now it has 1 000 employees. He received a loan from the state subsidy system in North Rhine-Westphalia to set up his company. This shows that state subsidies for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and subsidised loans are helpful. We need an initiative in Europe to promote the start-up of SMEs. The aid available must be made simpler. It must have lower thresholds and involve less red tape. One approach could be innovation vouchers. In addition, we must reallocate the unused money from the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund so that SMEs in Greece, for example, can obtain loans. However, to be able to do this, we also need different banking systems. One possibility would be cooperative banks and savings banks which the outlying countries in particular do not have. We need both things: a solution for the outlying countries and a policy for highly innovative companies in wealthier regions which will reinforce their strengths. That is what is currently required.

 Mr Lamberts, when you say we need growth and we need to create structures to allow states to borrow money again, it is also the case that the states which will be lending the money are afraid that this is just a bottomless pit.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating the 2010 budget and the European Court of Auditor’s report in this regard. This report contains both encouraging and less encouraging elements. Firstly, with regard to the funds that are directly controlled as well as managed by the Commission, it can be seen that the error rate is falling. This is the case in agricultural policy in particular, where an encouraging result was achieved with a 2.3% error rate. On the other hand, in cohesion policy, which has been a problem area for many years, we have an error rate of 7.7% – and two thirds of these errors should have been rectified by the Member States. That should not allow us to cease in our attempts to influence the Member States in this regard to ensure that the error rate is reduced. At this point, I would like first of all – on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, but also as committee chair – to thank Commissioner Šemeta as well as the President of the European Court of Auditors most sincerely for their excellent cooperation. I expressly agree with those Members who welcome the fact that the Council is also here today, represented by Mr Wammen from the Danish Presidency. The cooperation with the Commission and the European Court of Auditors is exemplary. The cooperation with the Council, Mr Wammen, is in need of improvement – and it is on the part of the Council that this improvement is required. I would like to ask and encourage you to pass that message on to the other members of the Council, too. As Parliament, we expect an improvement in use of funds for which we have shared responsibility, and for the Council now to accommodate Parliament here in the trialogue so that in future, we can reduce the error rate. After all, we must also finally make some progress on the discharge of the Council. It is not acceptable for there to be public expenditure that is not subject to any democratic scrutiny. ‘No taxation without representation’ was the battle cry of the American Revolution. Democracy requires there to be no public expenditure without democratic scrutiny. You mentioned the principle of reciprocity, but that is clearly not appropriate in terms of the relationship between the Council and Parliament, as the Treaty of Lisbon clearly stipulates that the Council recommends, but Parliament decides. That is not reciprocity; it is not symmetry, but asymmetry. Here it is important for Parliament, as the directly elected body of the citizens, to have its rights upheld. Michael Theurer,

 Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I would like to welcome the President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), Werner Hoyer, and to congratulate him on his committed and convincing debut. Following monetary stabilisation, we must now focus fully on real growth in the economy. One of the key aspects of this is the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises. The EIB supported 115 000 small and medium-sized enterprises in 2010 with funds totalling EUR 10 billion. A credit squeeze nonetheless persists for medium-sized businesses, particularly in the crisis countries and on the periphery of the European Union. We in the European Parliament expect the EIB to do all it can to provide greater support to small and medium-sized enterprises. We would be interested to learn more about the significance of the guarantees for small and medium-sized enterprises and the options with regard to the Risk Sharing Finance Facility. We also believe it is important that the EIB should play a role in financing infrastructure in the context of the EU project bonds. In summary, we believe that infrastructure, technology and innovation – in short, blue growth – should be at the centre of EIB strategy. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was an own-initiative report by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe which pointed out that the absorption capacity of certain Member States was not very high. As rapporteur on that report, I pointed to the causes of that situation. It is now necessary that the Commission take appropriate action here. We will also support the Commission in finally taking action in problem countries – in Greece, Romania, Bulgaria and in southern Italy. A reallocation of resources towards small and medium-sized enterprises, dual vocational training and tackling youth unemployment is absolutely the right course to take. That has to be our starting point. However, the vital thing is that capacities are built up, if we are to solve these problems. The impression the citizens of Europe have is that – as in Greece – all-out austerity is not working and that the government simply agrees measures which then remain unimplemented. However, it is crucial that, to use a car analogy, we do not put our foot down on the accelerator only to find that nothing happens. Now we need to engage a gear, so that the engine can provide thrust to the wheels! After all, we need to take action to develop a real economy: that is, to improve competitiveness, so that the problem is tackled at the root. Michael Theurer,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development
. – (DE)
 Mr President, Commissioner Rehn, ladies and gentlemen, in the discussion regarding the economic and financial crisis, which has led to the introduction of the European semester, the focus for the public is on the question of monetary policy and the sovereign debt crisis. For the Committee on Regional Development, however, it is important for more light to be shed on the question of the real economy. We want to eliminate the causes of the differences in competitiveness that result in some countries lagging behind. That is the central focus of European policy, and it must remain so in future, too. It is disgraceful that some countries do not utilise the Structural Funds. We need to investigate the causes here, as Parliament also determined in connection with my report on the absorption rate. It is not just a question of cofinancing; it is also a question of decentralising the responsibility for decision-making and of increasing administrative capacity. In this regard, the Committee on Regional Development is grateful to the rapporteur for including our proposals, because we now need to tackle the root of the problem and eliminate the causes of the imbalances. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Michael Theurer  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, the differences in competitiveness are undoubtedly also due to the different responses of Member States to global economic changes. It would be carrying things too far to investigate this, as even the opinions of the experts differ. The fact is that, even within Member States, individual regions are developing differently. Therefore, the Committee on Regional Development believes that current cohesion and regional policy offers a good approach for providing assistance to regions, cities and communities and the companies established there to enable them to adapt better. However, on investigating the actual effects it emerges that some Member States – such as Estonia or even Poland, which are achieving very good results – deal with the Structural Funds better than others, which find it difficult to absorb the funds – for example regions like Calabria and Sicily, as well as Greece and Romania. In the committee’s view, what is now needed is for us to tackle these problems specifically in order to utilise the Structural Funds better and to deal with the causes of the problem.

 Madam President, Commissioner, first of all, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Rühle, for her report and for such good cooperation. In view of the current debate, this is an appropriate moment to point out that public procurement is a very important way of achieving fair prices for public services and for the procurement of goods for the public sector. Competition is one element of using our scarce resources economically. It is thus a positive aspect of this report that public procurement is to be simplified. This should also facilitate access to public procurement for small and medium-sized enterprises. The measures for achieving this includes consistently allowing self-declarations, the division of contracts into lots – in other words, an SME-friendly tendering procedure – and the introduction of an electronic procurement passport. Moreover, when awarding contracts, the contracting authorities should give greater consideration to the quality of the goods and services to be procured, in addition to the price. It is also sensible for contracting authorities to attach greater weight to future life-cycle costs. In other words, it is no longer simply a matter of the cheapest offer, but rather the most economic offer over the entire life cycle. Greater consideration also needs to be given to environmental sustainability. These are the positive points. However, we in the ALDE Group feel there are some points that need revising. There are calls for the bureaucratic requirements on subcontractors to be increased. We see this as a major problem. We also want to have an open market worldwide that cannot be distorted by giving preference to domestic bidders. In return, we want other countries to open up their markets. We are also critical as regards award criteria introduced through bureaucracy; in other words, where certain local authorities are allowed to introduce their own criteria. It is in the interests of the market as a whole to prevent this. Michael Theurer,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, President Barroso has already highlighted the significance of small and medium-sized enterprises: 99% of all enterprises in Europe employ fewer than 250 people. Small and medium-sized enterprises are thus the backbone of employment and training. With the Small Business Act, the European Union began an initiative to improve national and European legislation for small and medium-sized enterprises. It was in this context that the test of the impact of legislation on small and medium-sized enterprises was introduced. Now, however, a study by the European Parliament has shown significant variation in the way that this SME test is being implemented in the individual Member States, and that in some cases, it is being implemented badly. Only five Member States have made this SME text a binding requirement. Fourteen Member States apply it half-heartedly, irregularly and with varying quality, while eight Member States practically do not carry out the test at all. That is why we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have tabled this question and are calling for the Commission to start an initiative to make this impact assessment a genuinely binding requirement in the Member States. We want the costs of administration and red tape to be quantified, in order to work towards reducing these. Small and medium-sized enterprises need to be saved from national and European legislation that burdens them with more and more additional costs for bureaucracy and administration. We are in favour of implementation being made very flexible, so that the Member States have room to manoeuvre. However, the aim must be for the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises to be taken into consideration as part of an integrated approach to law making. We also want the Commission to set an example by being the driving force behind this SME-friendly implementation of legislation. We in the European Union should take the lead in making laws that are genuinely capable of being implemented by small and medium-sized enterprises in practice. Michael Theurer,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at a late hour this evening, we are debating a subject that is of absolutely crucial importance for us. In any case, 37% of the EU budget goes on cohesion policy. Let us take a closer look – today, in the middle of the period, in 2011 – at how much in the way of resources has actually been taken from the Structural and Cohesion Funds so far. We can see that, unfortunately, in many Member States, the absorption rate and absorption capacity are well below what should actually have been paid out already by this stage. We have new Members States, such as Bulgaria and Romania, which have a poor absorption rate, but it is not only the new Member States; there are also Member States that have been in the Union for a long time, with regions such as Calabria and Sicily in the founder State of Italy, that with a rate of 7% – if we are to believe the budgetary controllers in the Committee on Budgetary Control – are well behind. This raises the question: why are these regions unable to spend the financial resources that we make available? There is Greece, too. Here in Parliament we have been highlighting where action is needed for months and have been pointing out that a country like Greece is not absorbing these resources, and we are pleased that the Commission, which to start with did not attach the necessary importance to this matter, has now given it high priority. With regard to Greece in particular, President Barroso has pointed out that, out of 20 billion, 15 billion has not been spent, and Commissioner Hahn has also just been there. We have considered what we can do to help these regions. The first thing to consider, as always, is the subject of cofinancing. The fact is that the regions are finding it difficult, in this global economic crisis, to finance their own share and Member States like Greece, which appear to be on the brink of insolvency, are also finding it difficult to finance their own share. There is no question that help must be provided here. However, it is clearly not just a matter of cofinancing, because there are also regions in Greece that really do not want an increase in European Union subsidies, are happy with the current rate of 80% and would rather implement more projects. Thus, it is not just a question of cofinancing; there are many different reasons. The procedures are too complex and need to be simplified as a matter of urgency. There is also the problem that, in many Member States, the central administrations of the governments in the capital cities take too long and the regions and regional authorities at local level have insufficient decision-making options in order to use the resources. Take Romania, for example, where the local authorities take 20 to 30 days to process applications, the regional authorities take around 60 days, but the central government takes 260 days. All of this provides an argument for delegating responsibility from the top down and introducing a strong local self-administration. Where are the Council, the Council Presidency and Mr van Rompuy this evening, in fact? He has taken the floor with regard to other matters. We are talking about 37% of the EU budget here. The EU is putting off payment obligations of EUR 250 billion. How are they to be fulfilled? The President-in-Office of the Council from Poland could have attempted to answer this, as Poland, of course, has shown how the absorption rate can be increased. There are also examples of good governance. Poland has managed it – its absorption capacities have increased – but so has Estonia. As Parliament, we are of the opinion that the Member States are now called on to ensure, as a matter of urgency, that the resources that we as Parliament have made available for the citizens in the regions are actually spent, also in the interests of increasing competitiveness and stabilisation of jobs and employment. In this regard, we expect the Commission to push forward with the method adopted and to very strongly urge the Member States to bring this matter to a positive conclusion. Michael Theurer,

 Madam President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased that, at my initiative, this oral question has received so much support here in Parliament and that it is being answered so promptly by the Commission. Thank you very much, Mr Tajani, for your response. As you know, because of globalisation, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are facing increasing competition from other countries, including from emerging economies outside the European Union. This involves major challenges, but also significant opportunities. In order to remain competitive, to secure growth and to support the sustainability of our companies, SMEs must take part in international activities. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is convinced of this. This concerns imports and exports, foreign direct investment and, of course, also acting as or using foreign subcontractors. However, only a small proportion of European SMEs are doing business with third countries. A total of 99% of the companies in the European Union are SMEs. However, only 29% of the SMEs in the EU import products, of which 50% import from countries outside the internal market. Only 25% of the SMEs in the EU are involved in exports, of which 50% export to countries outside the internal market. This means that our SMEs are not yet fully integrated into the global market. There are still opportunities to be exploited in this area and we now need to consider how we can encourage SMEs to do more business outside Europe. Not many SMEs are familiar with the public support programmes, such as the Enterprise Europe Network, or with information resources, such as the Market Access Database and the Export Helpdesk. There are also similar programmes available at a national and regional level. We need to know what concrete measures the Commission is planning in order to ensure that SMEs are better informed about the available tools and programmes. We would also like to know what the Commission intends to do to make the confusing subsidy system more transparent and clearer for SMEs. Following the decision made by the Court of Justice of the European Union on 10 December 2009, the Commission intends to include product-specific list rules in the implementing regulations for the Modernised Customs Code, in other words, to make these rules legally binding. The intention is to replace the current regulation, which has proved its worth over several decades and which specifies that the origin of a product is based on its last substantial processing or working, by countless product-specific origin rules for products imported into the EU. We are concerned that this will lead to an increase in red tape and, most importantly, will put SMEs at a disadvantage. We believe that this is not in line with the Small Business Act for Europe. Therefore, we are calling for a simplified form of this system which is beneficial for SMEs. How does the Commission intend to ensure that safety-related adaptations and changes to the Modernised Customs Code do not conflict with the existing simplified procedure and lead to competitive disadvantages? This is all about the position of SMEs on the world market, which will ensure their continued existence and allow them to safeguard jobs here in the European Union. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

 Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bütikofer, for a very good report. Commissioner Tajani, you have given a very clear signal this evening, which gives us hope. After all, we were disappointed with the presentation of the Commission’s strategy in the beginning. However, the raw materials strategy is a vital ingredient for business, employment and jobs here in the European Union. That is why a coherent strategy is essential. It goes without saying that we need the three pillars: security for our sources of raw materials, a recycling strategy, including greater efficiencies, as well as a joint approach so that partnerships can be established with the main raw materials suppliers of this world. The amendments tabled by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe focus on the idea that we should include more members of the scientific community in this strategy because there are many modern techniques for using raw materials found on the sea bed in the world’s oceans that still need to be researched and developed. This is precisely where Europeans have something to offer raw materials suppliers in developing countries and emerging economies as part of a common raw materials strategy. As liberals we believe it is important to remember that small and medium-sized enterprises require our particular help. Big business can secure raw materials for itself, while small and medium-sized enterprises need a joint strategy. Hence our call on you: let us work together to unite the Member States under the umbrella of the EU and establish long-term partnerships with the countries with the raw materials. The aim of the raw materials strategy must be to bring economic policy, environmental policy and international trade, together with development policy, under one roof. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mr Oettinger, ladies and gentlemen, even 25 years down the road, Chernobyl continues to be a cause for concern. Fukushima will also be a source of anxiety for years to come. The debate surrounding these major accidents is a sign that nuclear technology has inherent risks that it may not be possible to control. This is leading to a rethink in energy policy. However, it is also evident that unilateral action by individual countries is a mistake. We need international strategies, or at least EU-wide strategies when it comes to safety. That is why I fully support the Commissioner for Energy, who has made a number of important proposals in this direction. I would call on everyone here to work together to produce common principles so that the existing nuclear reactors really are safe, so that power failures are not allowed to happen and so that earthquake safety and other risks can be better estimated. We should then take a pro-active approach in bringing these principles to the attention of the international bodies. Michael Theurer,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Baltic Sea strategy set the ball rolling, the Danube strategy that we have debated this year in Parliament was the second step and now it is the turn of the Atlantic region. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in Parliament supports this macro-regional approach and was actively involved in this resolution. What we are concerned with here are improvements to the protection of the seas and the environment, and naturally also maritime affairs and fisheries – but it goes beyond this into lots of other areas, and three pillars in particular. The first of these is cooperation between Member States, so that synergies can be better exploited. Secondly, the Atlantic links the EU Member States and regions bordering the Atlantic with transatlantic partners such as Canada and the US and with other neighbouring countries such as Norway and Iceland. Thirdly, it is also concerned with bringing about closer links between stakeholders in the regions. We should emphasise the aspect of bringing together and networking towns and communities, regions, Member States and, above all, citizens, civil society and businesses, so that these actors can bring this framework – that is, the macro-regional strategy – to life. After all, the intention is not to create new institutions or new bodies; the idea is to have an effect using existing funding. The resources that exist are bound to contain unexploited synergies and opportunities that can be used as a basis for our activities. It is precisely because of this that the ALDE Group considers this strategy to be urgently needed, because it affects international trade. Goods from all over the world come across the Atlantic into the European Union. Naturally, this trade must take place in an ecologically sustainable way. Moreover, there are likely to be large reserves of raw materials in the Atlantic that we may be able to utilise, provided there is sustainable protection for the environment. We call on the Commission to draw up and submit a strategy for this area as soon as possible. Michael Theurer,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are currently witnessing a historic situation, because the Free Trade Agreement with South Korea that we are debating and that we intend to adopt is the first Free Trade Agreement that has been debated under the new Lisbon system, which grants Parliament full power of codecision. This makes an important area of policy – trade policy – more democratic. We, as Parliament, consider this to be important. The debate here in Parliament has also shown that, as regards safeguard clauses, we were able to include important concerns expressed to us by workers, companies and associations in an improved safeguard clause that is intended to protect the interests of industry and, above all, jobs in the future by creating a level playing field and fair conditions for competition and avoiding asymmetries. That is what we as the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have concentrated on. As shadow rapporteur for our group, I am pleased that we were able to be successful in this regard. The duty drawback mechanism, which caused us concern to start with, has now been explicitly included in the safeguard clause and there is the option for industry, and also for Parliament, to call on the Commission to carry out an investigation. A monitoring process is planned, which is intended to be established in a transparent way via an online platform, and there is greater scope for the investigation of the factors that will decide whether significant damage has been done to European industry. Mechanisms for monitoring to be carried out by the Commission, particularly for sensitive sectors in the event of increased imports, are also provided for. We can start with this and focus on the advantages associated with the South Korea agreement, such as the considerable reduction in duties – the Commission expects enterprises in Europe to be able to save EUR 1.6 billion. I would therefore like to thank Commissioner De Gucht, who has personally worked hard to enable us to reach a compromise, including with the Council. I would also like to thank the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, especially Mr Sturdy and Mr Zalba Bidegain, for their excellent work. We have achieved something really good here.

 Mr President, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn, ladies and gentlemen, we must preserve the world’s oceans as an ecosystem. However, the oceans and the concept of globalisation are not mutually exclusive. Shipping routes are essential to our prosperity, because they are the arteries of world trade. There is a lot to be done in this context in order to ensure that we protect the environment and that our transport routes are secure. In future, we will also have to secure our supply of raw materials. Scientists are predicting that valuable raw materials can be found on the sea bed and in the sea itself. The important consideration is to extract them in an environmentally friendly way. The third aspect I would like to look at is the link between the oceans and inland waterways. I believe it is important to establish a connection with inland waterway transport. The development of the Danube plays a major role in this respect. As the longest river in the EU, in combination with the Rhine-Main-Danube canal, it can link the Black Sea with the North Sea. We should be creating a connection between integrated maritime policy and inland waterways. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, my fellow Members have explained that it is an urgent human rights issue that the import of these products into the European Union should be halted. I am also of the opinion that, in the context of such inhuman conditions, the question arises as to whether these products are being sold at dumping prices. I believe that we should look at the need for anti-dumping measures. In addition, we in the EU should make it quite clear that, irrespective of the commercial issues involved, the conditions in these labour camps are unacceptable to us. Naturally we should concern ourselves not just with the products themselves, but with improving conditions for the people interned in these camps who have no recourse to the principles of the rule of law. We should once again make this very clear to the People’s Republic of China. Michael Theurer,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I would like to thank Commissioner De Gucht as well as the rapporteur, Mr Zalba, for their positive cooperation in connection with the Free Trade Agreement with South Korea and the safeguard clauses. I would first like to emphasise that we Liberals and Democrats here in the European Parliament would like to see the agreement ratified and adopted as soon as possible, because we are in favour of free trade and because we see an agreement with South Korea as providing great opportunities for both the economy of the European Union and that of South Korea. Where the safeguard clauses are concerned, however, we need to take the concerns raised with us by European industry very seriously. We believe that the safeguard clauses represent an instrument that is capable of taking account of these concerns. We hope that the vote this week will send a signal that the political forces in Parliament are united and that these safeguard clauses will result in a well-functioning agreement being concluded here. We therefore call on the Council and the Commission to move towards us on the important outstanding issues. Above all, we do not want to see the duty drawback system being abused. We cannot allow duty drawback to provide an open door via South Korea for cheap products, particularly cheap primary products from China and other Asian countries. Moreover, we want the South Koreans to dismantle their non-tariff barriers to trade – such as the CO2
 regulations for cars – so that we do not have new barriers to trade coming in through the back door. We want social and environmental standards to be upheld. Naturally, the matter of comitology must also be settled; that is, for the later application of the agreement. Here, we want to see a strong role for Parliament. We also want industry itself and the Member States to be able to initiate such investigations and monitoring in future. One last point is a cause for concern: in the coming days, the Council will debate the provisional application of the agreement and possibly also vote on this. I must sound a note of warning here that, under the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament must give its consent. Provisional application would be contrary to the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon. I therefore call on the Council not to approve provisional application of the agreement, but to wait for Parliament to make its decision. We have done everything in our power to make a timely decision possible, and we should demonstrate this again by showing a united front in the vote. Michael Theurer  (ALDE
),

I support the action of the European Union in reorganising the current remuneration policy to provide long-term success and more accountability for decision makers. However, this must not lead to a situation in which policy determines salaries. This should remain the task of the authorities which are already in place, such as the board of governors and the general meeting of the banks. The proposed remuneration policy must therefore not replace existing structures but, at most, complement them where necessary, insofar as this is beneficial to the quality of economic decisions.

 It is certainly important to tighten the regulations on internships. The representatives of the German Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament have supported this. Young people often work for months on end without payment, hoping that they might still get a permanent job afterwards. This is an unsustainable situation. Internships should not destroy jobs. However, today’s plenary vote is going to pave the way in the future for a complete ban on unpaid internships. We believe that this gives a wrong message. It should still be possible to do a three-month unpaid internship, for example. There are numerous non profit-making or social organisations where a young person can acquire exciting, interesting experiences. However, such organisations are often unable to pay any remuneration for the internship. The key factor should be the duration of an internship. In the case of any internship lasting longer than six months, the employer can rely on productive output from the intern. From then on, remuneration should also be paid. The decision made today is impracticable and goes too far. We therefore do not support this part of the resolution.

 Combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography is vitally important. We must use all our strength to combat the availability of child pornography in communications networks. The permanent and effective control of child abuse is both a political responsibility and a precept of the rule of law. The German Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament is of the opinion that it is necessary to remove such criminal content as quickly as possible. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the current debate on a functioning system of European economic governance, the long-term perspective is being neglected, in my opinion. Now is the right time to incorporate the short-term stabilisation measures into a long-term strategy. We need a vision of a market economy. The fundamental principle of the social market economy is already laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon. We must now bring it to life. The social market economy was the successful model behind Germany’s economic miracle. Walter Eugen, the guiding light of the economic miracle, remarked as early as 1950 that the economic activity of the state should focus on designing the regulatory systems for the economy and not on managing the economic processes. Therefore, I am calling for a regulatory approach, in other words, measures taken by the state to influence the basic conditions of economic activity by means of general legislation. It is not the state which creates jobs, but it must create a regulatory framework for job creation and this is what we need to focus on. Competitiveness is not the start but the result of economic activity. Michael Theurer  (ALDE
).

 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, as we have heard, the financial markets need to be packaged in a new regulatory framework so that in future, we can avoid the excesses that have led to the crisis. However, if we highlight the underlying causes of the indebtedness of governments, then it becomes clear that, here in Parliament, we talk too much about public debt and too little about how we can achieve prosperity and growth. What determines our growth? Our growth and prosperity depend on people in the European Union developing products and generating new ideas that can also be sold on the global market. It is therefore right that one chapter in the EU 2020 strategy is Innovation Union. We need to focus on inventions and on how we can reinforce research and development. With that, it is important that we enhance the synergies of research funding and regional development policy. A great deal more could be done in those areas. Together with the Liberals and the German Free Democratic Party (FDP), I would argue that we focus on small and medium-sized enterprises. We should see to it that we, as the EU, spend our funding so that SMEs really get access to that funding and so that there is a technology transfer between universities and colleges and SMEs. We should encourage people to take their destinies into their own hands through personal responsibility and self-initiative. Governments cannot create jobs; they need to be created in the economy itself. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Takkula has just said, cyanide technology is a common method in mining. However, as we have heard, it is highly dangerous. The disaster that Mrs Băsescu just mentioned contaminated the Danube at the time and shocked us all, and you know that I campaign strongly for the Danube region. For that reason, as a trade politician, I wonder what can we do about it? In the European Union, we only have limited gold mining capacities. The goal is to make a difference worldwide with technical innovations. Here, there is high technology, I know. In Germany environmental technologies were developed that will help to avoid cyanide in the future. We must make these European high technologies commercially viable and we must make them affordable. I see great potential for trade in this. We should not confine ourselves to the European Union, but ensure that here, we also achieve a breakthrough in international trade, in the interests of the environment and our economy. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate about the euro, the debate about Greece, has defined recent days. I would like to draw your attention, at this point, to what strikes me as a disturbing piece of news, namely that 40% of Germans now believe that the introduction of the euro was a mistake. We have to be disturbed by that, because the introduction of a Community currency is not a one-way street. Europe’s integration process is not irreversible. I believe that we must keep the promise that we gave the German people when they gave up their national currency, namely, that the euro would be just as stable as the German mark. I am also firmly convinced that we in Europe need a discussion about the social market economy, about the regulatory framework. We should not be talking about how we are making Germany less competitive. Instead, we should be discussing how we can make the whole of Europe competitive so that we can be successful on global markets. That is what our aim must be; that is why I am calling for a debate on the social market economy in Europe. Michael Theurer  (ALDE
),

 The European Commission’s negotiations relating to the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) have raised a few questions. Although the agreement deals with justified concerns, namely combating the counterfeiting and smuggling of products and brands, it needs to be more firmly based on our European principles. It must not lead to the harmonisation of copyright law, patent law or trade mark law in the EU – on the contrary, the principle of subsidiarity must remain our most important principle. Trade agreements must not be misused in order to curtail the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals. Before Parliament can give the approval that is required for the ratification of this agreement, significant improvements still need to be made, and not only in terms of content. Parliament must be involved to a greater degree in the negotiations and the negotiation documents must be made available to us in full. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

 Mr President, the Goldstone report describes human rights violations by both sides. Over 1 400 victims in the Gaza Strip are obviously too many. However, I am also certain that, without the rocket attacks on Israel, there would have been no military response. During a visit to the country by the Delegation to Israel, we discovered that Israel does not take military action lightly. The main accusation of the Goldstone report, that Israel deliberately and continually attacked civilians, does not hold water. The question of the extent to which Hamas used civilians as shields has not been adequately investigated. However, the report mentions that the Israeli army provided warnings by means of telephone calls and flyers. Hamas did nothing like this in connection with the rocket attacks on Israel. However, we also need to ask whether the UN itself did enough in Gaza, for example, to prevent the Hamas rockets being fired in the vicinity of UN facilities. I do not believe that the Goldstone report is a basis for further terrorist attacks on Israel – it does not justify that. It perhaps does not help any further, either. However, it is clear that, here in the European Parliament, we must demand respect for human rights and call on both sides to return to the peace process. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

Madam President, Commissioner, firstly I would like to congratulate you on your appointment as commissioner. We are pleased to see such an astute and successful politician and a well-known Liberal on the Commission. You will need all your powers of persuasion to bring a new impetus to international trade policy in the EU. We must fight against any protectionist tendencies. History clearly shows that countries which have taken part in world trade have enjoyed better growth than those which did not. We are also facing a new world order. Some of the players involved, for example, China, have State capitalist systems, but may be using quite different methods in this arena. Therefore, I call on the Commission to develop a new strategy for world trade. It is clear that we must move forward with the Doha development round, because a multilateral approach is the right one. However, we will need all our efforts to make progress in relation to China. Michael Theurer,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon is opening a new chapter in the cooperation between the Commission, the Council and Parliament. The right of codecision of the European Parliament that has been directly elected by the citizens of Europe gives us the opportunity to bring democracy back into decisions on trade policy. This is the right thing to do, because it will have consequences for employees and consumers in the Member States. Free and fair trade forms the basis for Europe’s prosperity. We must therefore firmly oppose any protectionist tendencies. Free trade agreements like this one with South Korea can make an important contribution to stimulating world trade, growth and employment. However, it is in the nature of agreements of this kind, that, depending on their specific structure, they bring more benefits for some sectors of industry than for others. It is our job in Parliament to weigh up carefully the impact on different industries and sectors within the EU. In order to do this, we need the relevant data and impact assessments and it is the Commission’s task to provide them. However, despite many requests from the committee and in the plenary session, we have not yet received data which we believe to be satisfactory. This is the reason why the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has joined with other groups to ask this question. According to the information that we have received so far, the agreement offers opportunities for the service, mechanical engineering and plant construction, chemical and agricultural industries in the European economy. However, the concern is that the agreement will have a negative impact on the car industry and the textile and electronics sectors. The free trade agreement with South Korea is the only agreement with a developed country which does not include a ban on duty drawbacks. This may lead to one-sided cost benefits for South Korean industry. As the Commission has assured us on several occasions, the provisions on the duty drawback include a safeguard clause, which allows for a waiver on the basis of certain criteria. However, we urgently need to clarify this in the interests of the companies involved. The system must be applicable in practice. It must not be the case that the safeguard clauses are worthless because the companies cannot provide the necessary proof. As the agreement seems to contain one-sided regulations and as it sets a precedent for future agreements, for example, with India or with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, we feel that the specific wording of the safeguard clauses, the procedure for settling disputes and the other regulations relating to the application of the agreement are of central importance. We are therefore calling on the Commission to submit the free trade agreement together with the provisions on its application to Parliament for approval. We want a decision quickly. For this reason, a provisional version of the agreement must not be allowed to come into force. I know from discussions with companies what an important impact the implementation has. Therefore, my question to the Commission is as follows: Will the development of the European External Action Service lead to it playing a stronger role in trade policy? In our opinion, at least, this should be included. Michael Theurer  (ALDE
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against tax fraud is a necessity. Of course, tax evasion and tax fraud are not the causes of the economic and financial crisis. It seems important to me to make it clear once again in this House that we must regain the confidence of the taxpayer through simple tax systems and through low and fair taxes. However, that is not to say that we should not actively fight tax evasion and tax fraud, because any tax evasion undermines our sense of justice. That also brings us to the subject of tax havens. Germany’s neighbour, Switzerland, has voiced concerns that it is being placed under pressure. On this point, I would like to ask the Commission specifically: are proposals being made, or rather, are measures being taken to place Switzerland under particular pressure? My personal view is that Switzerland cannot afford to treat the EU any less well than the USA. Therefore, that means that Switzerland must actually join in our concerted efforts to fight tax evasion.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the importance of the Danube Region is evident by the very fact that 80 million people in six EU Member States and in four neighbouring countries live along the Danube. In the Black Forest – 100 km away as the crow flies – the Danube begins and then flows down to the delta and into the Black Sea. Therefore, we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe support the call for a Danube Strategy and, as the European Parliament, we are also making an important point this evening by having the subject of the Danube Strategy on the agenda. Twenty years after the collapse of the Iron Curtain, after putting an end to the division of Europe, the Danube is once again a symbol of unification. From a founder member of the EU, Germany, via Austria, which joined in 1995, through to the new Member States in Central and Eastern Europe that joined in 2004, the Danube also connects neighbouring countries like the accession country Croatia as well as other neighbouring countries that have aspirations for accession. It is therefore almost possible to see the reunification of Europe along the Danube. Ladies and gentlemen – and this is something to which the ALDE Group attaches a great deal of importance – we now need to take the appropriate measures to also make the Danube Strategy a regional policy priority in the new funding period. There are many ways to go about this. One option is for small and medium-sized enterprises to conclude more mutual partnerships. There are, of course, other major tasks in the area of infrastructure. This is particularly important to the ALDE Group because, as a result of the division of Europe, the historical transport links were broken and have not been modernised. Therefore, the development of the Danube as an inland waterway, the modernisation and improvement of its ports, locks and passability will provide an environmentally sound method of transport. However, work still needs to be done on the road and rail network. It is also particularly important that we involve the municipalities, towns, districts and the citizens in this. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, funding for the regions and structural funding form part of our practical economic policy and make Europe widely visible. In local authority areas, towns and municipalities in the regions, different players are working closely together. For this reason, we must retain this integrated approach for the entire European Union. I call on the Commission to focus much more closely on small and medium-sized enterprises and to involve the local authority areas, the towns and the municipalities much more in the future cohesion policy. We will definitely need to invest in the infrastructure in future, but most importantly, we must ensure that innovation and technology transfer are guaranteed for small and medium-sized enterprises. In future, we should also enable jobs to be subsidised. These are the crucial issues in choosing a new direction for the structural and cohesion policy in the European Union. Michael Theurer,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, two weeks ago, the Seventh Session of the World Trade Organisation Ministerial Conference was held in Geneva. I had the opportunity, as the representative of the delegation of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, to attend the conference and, as co-author, to contribute to the present joint motion for a resolution. There are four lessons that can and need to be learned from these experiences. The economic and financial crisis also brought a sharp fall in world trade. A speedy conclusion to the negotiations in the Doha Round is therefore crucial in order to give new impetus to the world economy. The revival of fair and free world trade is something that Doha can, and indeed must, achieve. The European Union has gone a long way to accommodate its partners, in particular those in the developing countries. For example, we have promised to abolish all export subsidies for agricultural products. Now we need to bring the negotiations to a conclusion. For this to happen, we need a signal of political will. In the ALDE Group, we are determined to achieve a conclusion to Doha. Now! It is therefore vital to join forces in order to bring the Round to a conclusion. The European Union can and must play a leading role in this. We should also take on a bridging role, for example, to bring together the United States and the emerging economies and developing countries, just as we call for in our joint resolution. We must now also raise the public’s awareness. We need broader support from the citizens. We should emphasise the advantages of global trade, as free and fair world trade is good for all of us. I do not see any alternative to Doha. The alternative would be competition for bilateral agreements, which would put access for the weaker countries and the inclusion of human rights and environmental aims at risk. That must not happen. We therefore need a conclusion to the Doha Round now. Michael Theurer  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have drawn up a major resolution which covers a number of themes. However, one important point – trade – is only touched on briefly. I believe that international trade is a decisive factor. The fall in world trade is one of the causes of the economic and financial crisis and I would like to see a greater focus on world trade, even now in the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC). It is not the case that the US and the European Union agree on every area. On the contrary, we have only a few trade agreements, there is a risk of bilateralism and there is the possibility that the Doha Development Round will not be continued by the US. Therefore, we should address the critical points and I hope that the TEC will introduce some new stimuli to revive international trade. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

 Mr President, I would like to congratulate you warmly on your speech. The process of bringing an end to the division of Europe was the result, on the one hand, of the desire for freedom among Central and Eastern European countries and, on the other, of course, of the attractiveness of Europe as an economic model. I believe that we have too little confidence, too little confidence in the future. If we cannot achieve this in Europe, then who can? We should explain with greater conviction that we can work on resolving our problems with confidence. We have a great deal of potential and there are still opportunities for growth throughout the world. While there are still people in the world who need goods and services, there will still be opportunities for growth. We can make sure that in Europe, we have a slice of this cake and everyone involved will benefit. I would like to encourage all of us to have more confidence in Europe as a successful model and I would like to ask you to convey this idea in your speeches. Michael Theurer,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank you, Commissioner Ashton, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, for the information that you have given us this evening in the extraordinary committee meeting and here in plenary. Clearly, the free trade agreement with South Korea is close to being concluded. From a Liberal viewpoint, and particularly from the point of view of my own German Free Democratic Party, the objective of free and fair world trade is of great importance, particularly right now, as, in the course of the economic and financial crisis, we see tendencies towards protectionism, tendencies which must be resolutely countered in the interests of prosperity and jobs in the European Union. In this context, the question arises of what significance the Commission attaches to the free trade agreement with South Korea, as there has, for a long time, been a focus on progress in the Doha development round, without any agreement being reached so far. That is the reason behind my question, Commissioner Ashton: do you see concluding the free trade agreement with South Korea as a first step towards further bilateral free trade agreements, and does that, in your view, mean a move away from Doha? Or are such bilateral agreements merely a supplement to or expansion of the European Union’s free trade policy? As you know, furthermore, the clause on the refunding of duties is a cause of concern in a number of Member States and sectors of industry – in particular, in the car industry. This clause could lead to supporting business in low-cost countries such as India and China, thereby threatening European manufacturing. Can you see a way that these concerns on the part of a number of Member States in respect of such refunding of duties can still be addressed? Nadja Hirsch,  
rapporteur

 Mr President, it is necessary to change the year, because we have already decided that 2015 should be the European Year of Development. Therefore I propose, together with the other shadows, the following oral amendment ‘supports the Commission in its plan to declare 2016 the European Year of Integration.’  So we have only changed the year.

 I abstained from today’s vote, as the report presents the internet as a source of dangers to children and young people in too one-sided a way. It also intends to protect them by taking measures whose effects on freedom of expression on the internet cannot be foreseen. Too little reference is made to the huge opportunities that the internet offers young people, in the areas of education and participation for example. I also consider effectively disempowering parents by means of an ‘educational alliance’ among families, schools and civil society to be a crucial point. Instead of creating an artificial safe area for children, we should make sure that children and young people are empowered to use the internet confidently and independently. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE

 In addition to supporting the ‘eight hours’ campaign, the alternative resolution also contains a call for a legislative proposal introducing a ban on cloning. On balance, I decided to support the alternative resolution, despite the call for a ban on cloning, as limiting the transport time for farmed animals to eight hours is something that takes absolute priority. For one thing, the European Parliament has supported a written declaration in this regard. In addition, more than 1 000 000 people throughout the EU have put their signature to the ‘eight hours’ campaign. It is therefore only logical that the demand of the majority in Parliament and one of the first citizens’ initiatives should be reflected in the EU Animal Welfare Strategy. Nadja Hirsch,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is actually absurd. With regard to this important subject of a resettlement programme, we have achieved agreement across all of the groups. Many of the Member States are already implementing resettlement programmes. In other words, there is broad consensus that this is necessary and, above all, that it is not only an urgent, but also a highly volatile situation – as demonstrated in particular by the current situation in Africa. Thus, it is actually absurd that, even though there is agreement from almost all sides, this can founder simply as a result of the technical implementation. It is the duty of both the European Parliament – we are aware of this and that is why we have tabled a proposal – and the Council to assume responsibility here and to push this matter forward. I have experienced the Polish Presidency to be very creative, also in connection with the asylum package. It has tabled new proposals. For that reason, I am really placing my hope in the fact that you will now see the opportunity and present us with a proposal that is workable for the Council, the Commission and for us as Parliament, and that now, as we are in any case all in agreement, we can finally also tackle the implementation and – as Mr Tavares also said – can finally bridge that period that costs some people their lives. That is something that we need to be aware of in relation to this matter. I do not mean to be dramatic here, but each additional day that it takes us can cost someone’s life. Nadja Hirsch,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

Madam President, Commissioner, a good education policy is the best kind of employment policy. It is true that many highly qualified people are currently unemployed, but despite this, the people who have no education or few qualifications are also the ones who have little or no chance of finding a job, even when the economy recovers and the labour market takes off again. Therefore, it is precisely these people that we should be concerned about. It is our responsibility to ensure that these people have the chance of a new life. I would like to point out that 14.4% of pupils in the EU leave school early and this is an average, which means that in some places, the figure is much higher. What is happening to all these young people? They will have no opportunity in the foreseeable future, regardless of whether or not the economy is growing, to live an independent life or get a well-paid job. For this reason, we must invest in this area. I believe that, while it is a good thing for the European Parliament to call for this to happen, it is primarily the responsibility of the Member States. It is up to us to demonstrate which projects are already running successfully. At the moment, there is a model pilot project which involves looking after early school leavers and providing a youth guarantee. The project is attracting attention to this subject and giving it a high priority. This is a key issue on which we need to take action. In addition, there are, of course, all the people who already have a job. We must not forget that in many countries, the talk is of people retiring much later. My generation will probably retire at 70, if at all. This also means that it is not enough to train once for a job. We must invest in further education and make flexible and attractive training available within the European Union, so that people can continue their education alongside their family life. These are all factors that we need to take into account and I am confident that we will be successful and will take a step in the right direction. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE

Mr President, Mr Mleczko, it is not the case that we are starting from nothing. We should always remember that we in Europe have a good minimum standard in comparison with many other countries. Regardless of that, the Commission has submitted a new proposal. It is simply a result of the timing that the situation with regard to equality has changed. Therefore, the Commission proposal was a wise move, a step forward, which sent out a clear signal, but, at the same time, it was sufficiently moderate, at 18 weeks and 75%, that it would have been practicable. Unfortunately, I can only agree with the other speaker. Here in the European Parliament, a small majority put together a huge wish list. At the moment, it is sadly the case that we must either stick with this wish list or get nothing. I would like to make it quite clear to you that I would rather we took the new Commission proposal as our basis, so that we can at least move forward. Each individual country can then decide whether to add other provisions. Then it will be up to every individual Member State to raise its own standards even further. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE

 The German Free Democratic Party delegation in the European Parliament assumes that the inclusion of Romania and Bulgaria in the Schengen area will further improve freedom of movement within the EU. Now that both Member States have achieved positive evaluation results in all areas of the Schengen review, there should be no more obstacles to delay inclusion further. There is no denying that the technical securing of borders will not automatically make them impermeable as long as problems persist in combating corruption in the justice and policing system. Accordingly, this challenge also relates to Member States already in the Schengen area. For this reason, the German Free Democratic Party delegation believes that criteria such as the fight against corruption must receive greater attention when evaluating the Schengen mechanism, and any misdemeanours must be punished appropriately. Nadja Hirsch,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, tomorrow, we will vote on the role of vocational education and training in the Europe 2020 strategy. In this connection, it is worth taking a brief look at the position we are starting from. We currently have a level of youth unemployment of 21%, in other words, almost double the normal average. We have an EU-wide school drop-out rate of over 14%. The participation of women in gainful employment is still very low. Many people with disabilities, as well as migrants, are without jobs. The goal of the Europe 2020 strategy is precisely to tap this potential in terms of workers and to bring them into the workplace so that the EU, too, can deal with globalisation. Thus, it is also our job to ensure that initial vocational education in particular is of high quality. The discussion began in connection with the Copenhagen process, followed by the Bruges Communiqué, and now it is up to us to see to what extent this area can also be incorporated into the Europe 2020 strategy. An absolutely key element is the fact that young people must have the opportunity, not only in their studies, but also in their vocational training, to undertake part of their training in another EU Member State. It is a key element because someone who has already worked in another Member State will also take the opportunity later on to regard the European labour market as his or her labour market, with all the opportunities that that offers. It is therefore an absolutely key aspect that we must pursue. The second major area is, of course, that of further training. On account of demographic change, people are having to work for longer and longer – or they can work for longer, but everyone has to take that decision for themselves. People are living until they are much older and will continue with their careers for much longer, and in order to be able to carry on in skilled work until they are older, they will also need to undertake further training. There is currently a very low level of participation in further training initiatives. Here, too, it must be ensured that the willingness of both employers and workers exists and increases when it comes to taking advantage of further training and continuing to gain education by means of lifelong learning. For this, of course, the options on offer also need to be flexible. We must take everyone into consideration. Further training must fit in with other elements of people’s lives and it must be possible to do it alongside work and family life. For that reason, we clearly need to create flexible opportunities in future. The area of universities has received a great deal of attention – in connection with the Bologna Process, for example – and a similar situation faces us in the area of vocational training, including with regard to mobility. We could almost say that no one has noticed this. Nevertheless, alongside the universities, the area of vocational education and training is particularly important and we therefore must not ignore it. For that reason, I would like at this point to thank my fellow Members from the other groups once again for their very committed cooperation. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE

Madam President, the borders have been removed for the first time in Germany and Austria and we finally have free movement for workers from the countries of Eastern Europe. On the one hand, borders are being torn down, while on the other you are trying to build barriers yet again. I find it impossible to accept that two Member States and two gentlemen looking to make a name for themselves have managed to bring the issue of the reintroduction of border controls back to the debating chamber. There is no going back on this matter and we cannot allow ourselves to be put under pressure by this single-issue discussion. The refugee problem cannot be automatically resolved by returning to a regime of border controls. Pardon me. These people have risked their lives in making their way to Europe and they will also succeed in bypassing border crossings. The only ones who stand to gain from the reintroduction of border controls would be the human traffickers because the refugees would have to find new ways to cross the borders, providing the human traffickers with a new source of income. I cannot accept the fact that we are seriously contemplating this matter and I would call on the Commission not to compromise here. Nadja Hirsch,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, Mrs Malmström, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs most sincerely. We had very many debates. In the end, we reached some very good compromises, even though we all know that it is not always quite so easy, of course. On behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, however, I would like to say that, in any case, we still have the goal of establishing a common, EU-wide asylum system by 2012. That also means that we must now make some real progress and also send a clear signal to the Council that we have not lost sight of this goal and that we are, of course, still prepared to enter into negotiations. That goes without saying. However, I also believe that we need to make it clear that, above all, we want a common asylum system. It is not acceptable, as has already been said, for it to be almost like a lottery depending on where an asylum seeker makes his application. It is not acceptable – and in this regard I am pleased that, at the last minute, we achieved success here – for every individual Member State to have its own national list of what constitutes a safe third country. Either a country is safe or it is not – and then it still must be examined in each individual case whether it can, in fact, be a safe third country for the particular person who has made an application or whether, in this individual situation, it is perhaps not possible to simply say that is the case as such. I am also convinced that, ultimately, the Member States will benefit from this, but so will the asylum seekers, who will have the chance, in future, to receive a ruling directly at the first instance in a fair and nevertheless rapid application procedure if this is implemented in the way that we envisage it. I believe this also to be a right; asylum is a right, not a favour. We must take an absolutely clear position on this and then also have a clear procedure. Above all, I welcome the fact that we have managed to further extend the rights of minors. I am in favour of that and so is the ALDE Group, and I will be pleased if we get a good result in this regard tomorrow. Nadja Hirsch,

 Mr President, the resettlement programme is something that we worked extremely intensively on, investing a lot of energy, across all group divides and allegiances. We were unanimous in wanting to send out a clear signal on this matter. We also made it our top priority simply because it is such an important issue: people’s lives are at stake. Nonetheless, the situation and ongoing developments in North Africa mean that we are called on once again to produce results in double-quick time. We have already lost one year. We have made the best use of the time available to provoke a civil and social debate because, in the final analysis, we also need the support of the Member States, regional authorities and the local population if such a programme is to become established in the new Member States, too. This discussion and the social consensus that has gradually resulted cannot be abandoned just because the Council and other key players are unable to agree and have reached an impasse. The issue is too important. We have instigated this debate and, true to our liberal credentials, our aim is to make this matter a genuine priority. I believe that we have agreement across all the groups in Parliament. We have signalled our position and now await a clear course to be set by the Council so that the issue will be placed on the agenda and that the other Member States that have so far not played an active role will now be encouraged to get involved. The feedback that we have received during our discussions indicates that these Member States are willing to come on board. For this reason, the main concern on the part of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe – although I believe I can speak for all the groups involved because the level of cooperation was really excellent – is that this matter should be given priority and the debate that we have engendered on a broad social level should be encouraged, rather than jeopardised by continuously the matter being continuously put on the long finger.

 Madam President, as the rapporteur for the opinion on the report on equality, I concentrated on the labour market. Unfortunately, the pay differential is still 17% and women are still not always represented in management and supervisory boards. There is an urgent need for action here. We can no longer afford to waste the potential of females in society, whatever their age. We have a good level of education and the state invests in these young women and mothers. We really do need to make progress here and demand that companies finally put their fine words into action. To this extent, I welcome the fact that companies really are taking a step in the direction of a voluntary quota. However, on the other side, any report on equality should not forget that men are also disadvantaged in some respects. In particular, boys are not always given the opportunity to develop in school. Deficits exist in the area of housework and childcare and men can become more active here, too. This is one task we should all adopt for ourselves. Each of us, whatever our gender, should be given an opportunity to find our niche and live our lives as we see fit. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mrs Malmström, we are talking today about the judgment passed by the European Court of Human Rights. This is ultimately about Belgium, but it concerns every Member State of the European Union. Germany has also decided no longer to send asylum seekers back to Greece. As one of my fellow Members has mentioned, we must ask ourselves whether we want to build walls around Europe or whether we want to maintain and develop the right to asylum, something which I, as a Liberal, strongly support. However, this also means that we must give every asylum seeker the chance of a properly organised process. We must realise that it is unfair and shows a lack of solidarity if we allow the southern countries to bear the entire burden alone. Because of their geographical position, these countries have been exposed to an increased influx of refugees. In Lampedusa, this is because of current events in Tunisia. However, this is also an ongoing situation which the local asylum authorities cannot cope with. The recent liberalisation with regard to Kosovo also resulted in a huge influx of asylum seekers into Germany just a few weeks ago. We also had the problem that we could not initially process all the applications properly. Therefore, if we really want to retain this right to asylum, we must restructure the system to ensure that it offers greater solidarity in future. Dublin II cannot continue in its current form.

 Madam President, Mrs Malmström, we were all pleased, as were the citizens of Europe, about the revolution in Egypt and Tunisia and the fact that values such as freedom and democracy were suddenly on the agenda. Images from these countries have dominated the news over the last few days. However, for two or three days, we have also been seeing pictures of the streams of refugees and people in boats on our television screens and in our newspapers. We must act quickly to ensure that we do not miss this historic moment and that it is not only the pictures of refugees which remain in our memories. We must remember what these countries have really achieved. We must explain to the public that although a lot of people are coming here, the majority of them will go back, because they have no right to asylum as we define it. Of course, we have to ask ourselves the question which is frequently posed about economic migrants. One thing is clear. If these young people have no future prospects, they will come back. Perhaps not the same people, but constant streams of new migrants. This is why we need to deal with this problem now. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE

 In overall terms, the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament supports the waste disposal directive. However, the subject of photovoltaic modules remains a problem. There is no understandable reason for excluding the entire sector from the regulations. We have a wide range of legislation governing waste streams. Therefore, it is not clear why a complete industry, which is expected to produce significant waste streams, is being exempted. For this reason, some of the FDP Members of the European Parliament have abstained from voting on the report. Nadja Hirsch,

 Mr President, we have agreed in the European Parliament that we want a common European asylum system to be in place by 2012. This also involves having the same or similar conditions in all the Member States. However, the implementation of the system has met with resistance and that is primarily due to the fact that during the discussions on the asylum package, we were given inadequate information, sometimes no information at all, or even conflicting information. We had very little data as the basis for the financial estimates relating to the Procedures Directive and the costs in the Member States. Our aim is to call on the Commission to provide Parliament with a study or with the necessary information. This concerns areas such as the interpreting service and also legal advice. It is not clear what effects this will actually have in the Member States. On the other hand, during the process of revising the Procedures Directive, it has become clear that we can produce a high quality, fast procedure which is of benefit to both sides, because it helps decisions to be made quickly so that the situation is clear to people and there is a low error rate. Our objective as liberals is to give the Commission our complete support for its plans. However, we need arguments, including in the discussions with the Member States, which will demonstrate the effects of the revision of this asylum package and, in particular, the Procedures Directive. For this reason, we are calling on the Commission to give us genuine support to ensure that this asylum package becomes reality by 2012, so that we can establish a common European asylum system.

 Madam President, Commissioner, as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I, too, would like to express my sincere thanks to the two rapporteurs. Thank you for your cooperation. I think we have put together a good document today. We can take a decision on something today that can really put paid to human trafficking. However, the challenge will be getting the Member States to put this directive into practice. It is crucial that the enforcement bodies, such as the police and the courts, are made aware of how to actually recognise and to prosecute this crime. This is vital, and it is also very important to raise public awareness – as Mrs Matera has already mentioned – so that people are aware of the fact that human trafficking is happening within the EU. It is not just happening somewhere else; theoretically, it could also be happening right outside my front door. Another important point that, as Liberals from Germany in particular, we had difficulty with – although this has now been resolved in a positive manner by empowering the Member States – is the criminalisation of people who make use of this sort of service, because if someone is liable to prosecution, he can refuse to make a statement in a subsequent trial. If someone makes use of this right to refuse to give evidence – for example, a man who had been with a prostitute who had been endangered through human trafficking – information will be lost that could be used further to finally uncover this network of human traffickers. It is therefore a good thing that this rests with the Member States, and I would like to thank you very much for your cooperation. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE
).

Madam President, the question that we must ask ourselves is what is this directive intended to achieve? There is relatively substantial agreement that there should be health protection for mothers-to-be and new mothers. The great debate concerns the areas in which the aspect of equality should also be included. On the other hand, as the European Parliament, we also need to be aware that we are adopting a directive that will be in force not just for five years, but perhaps for the next 20 or 25 years. However, I hope that by then, women’s working conditions will be substantially better and companies will be keen to employ young mothers – not least because of a shortage of skilled labour – and, above all, will also build up the appropriate infrastructure for this. We need to bear in mind this perspective too. Notwithstanding this, I also realise that at present, we do not have a majority that is prepared to adopt this perspective. In view of this, we will probably arrive at a point where we agree on a compromise such as eighteen weeks, a higher rate of statutory payments or the continued payment of 75% of salary, which will indeed bring about an improvement in some European countries in particular. A much more important point, and one which goes beyond the aspect of maternity leave, is the framework conditions surrounding young families. This means childcare facilities; in Germany, for example, there are still not enough of these. That would be a real equality policy that gives women a chance to go back to work. Nadja Hirsch,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, I think it is right and proper for us to be championing the cause of a coordinated cohesion and regional policy. This is extremely important in order to deliver efficiency and to be able to use the money well, despite the limited amounts in question. I must warn, however, that the plan is to achieve this efficiency by applying one and the same set of rules to everyone. The funds are very varied, have very different target groups and different contents. With that in mind, coordination is very important but the same rules are not. That is exactly what we are experiencing with the European Social Fund at the moment, which is to say that it would be extremely well received by just those little communities, municipalities, if – just as the speaker before me said – for these small bodies on the ground, in particular, such an enormous amount of time and effort did not have to be spent in order to actually be able to access and use this money. That is exactly what we need though, as unemployment, poverty and socially excluded people are to be found in every Member State of the European Union, not just in certain regions, but in every Member State. With that in mind, I find it particularly important that the European Social Fund, in particular, should truly continue to be available to minorities, which, to an extent, also includes young people, but also the elderly and often people from an immigrant background, in future and actually, that it should be more available, in order to give these people the chance to enter the labour market, as that is precisely what we are aiming to achieve. The Europe 2020 strategy represents our attempt to achieve greater inclusion in the labour market for the different groups. I hope that that will not remain simply a goal; instead, we now have to genuinely provide the measures and the instruments to achieve it. The European Social Fund is a very effective tool in this regard. We just need to optimise it and, above all, make it useable. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE

 I cannot support the animal experiments directive in its current form. It is true that this version is more progressive that the old directive from 1986. However, in comparison with the huge scientific and technical advances made over the last 24 years, the measures for replacing animal testing seem very feeble. There are too many exceptions. In addition, the wording is weak and allows too much scope for interpretation and implementation. It is also absurd that Member States cannot put in place animal welfare measures which are stricter than those required by the EU. Market distortion is given as the justification for this. This sends the wrong message to the citizens of Europe, to the research community and to industry. On the one hand, the state must take into account the changes in citizens’ ethical awareness. On the other hand, more pressure must be exerted on the research sector and on industry. No one wants to put the status of Germany or Europe as a research location at risk, but investment costs are not a valid argument for postponing the further development and use of methods which do not involve laboratory animals.

 The German Free Democratic Party is fundamentally in favour of positive labelling (process labelling) of genetically modified organisms at a European level in order to ensure the necessary transparency for consumers. However, in this case, we were not able to vote in favour of the report, because it proposes unequal treatment for different sectors. It calls for labelling for foods of animal origin, but not for those of plant origin. Unfair labelling of this kind for products of animal origin could distort the market to the disadvantage of one side. This counteracts our efforts to ensure fair competition and is clearly in conflict with the principle of equality enshrined in our legal system.

 It is certainly important to tighten the regulations on internships. The representatives of the German Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament have supported this. Young people often work for months on end without payment, hoping that they might still get a permanent job afterwards. This is an unsustainable situation. Internships should not destroy jobs. However, today’s plenary vote is going to pave the way in the future for a complete ban on unpaid internships. We believe that this gives a wrong message. It should still be possible to do a three-month unpaid internship, for example. There are numerous non profit-making or social organisations where a young person can acquire exciting, interesting experiences. However, such organisations are often unable to pay any remuneration for the internship. The key factor should be the duration of an internship. In the case of any internship lasting longer than six months, the employer can rely on productive output from the intern. From then on, remuneration should also be paid. The decision made today is impracticable and goes too far. We therefore do not support this part of the resolution. Nadja Hirsch,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, what we all discussed on this subject was that we simply must convince more Member States to take part in this programme. I believe there is much to be achieved in this regard by explaining the programme and also highlighting its benefits, as those who take part have thus far always said that they will continue to do so and that they welcome the programme. It is very important to make clear which people this relates to. It relates to people who do not, themselves, have the power to come to Europe. These are women, children and the sick, who find themselves in refugee camps outside the EU and need our help. I think it is very positive that we will be deciding to make a larger proportion of the European Refugee Fund available in future. At the same time, I also believe that it is very important that this money, if it is paid to the national Parliaments, the nation states, in other words, must not just disappear into the budget, but it really must be used in order to build a durable structure, that the money, in fact, even has to be passed on to the local authorities and to the towns and cities where the integration actually takes place, where the nursery places and housing are provided. It is a very important point that the towns and cities and the local authorities, as our allies, must be involved in this discussion. The Member States are perhaps more inclined to reject this in the short term than the local authorities on the ground. In the predictability that this brings with it, I see an important element connecting us – the EU – and those on the ground bringing about the integration. All together, this could certainly give a boost to the resettlement programme, something that I think is very positive. Above all, there is one thing that needs to be stated very clearly, which is that the citizens cannot be left behind – people and associations must be found who ease the path of people who want to start a new life locally and who show them how their new town works or where the nearest swimming pool is. We need a cross-society consensus that we want to take part in a resettlement programme, that it is a good solution, and that people will actually bring about integration on the ground.

According to the resolution of the European Parliament on the draft general budget for the financial year 2010, adopted on 17 December 2009, a vote was taken today on the amending budget for the European Parliament, following the revised calculations made by the Parliamentary administration. The FDP in the European Parliament abstained, because there was a paragraph in the package of amendments concerned that we could not reconcile with our convictions. The FDP had already expressed its opposition to an increase in the secretarial allowance to EUR 1 500 during the discussions in committee. It is out of the secretarial allowance that MEPs’ assistants are paid. The FDP considers that the argument that more money is needed due to the additional work that MEPs have to do with the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is unsound, as there is nothing in past experience to support this. Certainly, due to the Treaty of Lisbon, which has just come into force, Parliament will overall need extra capacity for legislative work, but with the introduction of the Assistants’ Statute from the beginning of the current parliamentary term, there is still no proof that MEPs actually need more assistants. For this reason, there are grounds for concern that further demands and supplementary increases, or an extension of office capacity, will follow. For this reason, the FDP in the European Parliament abstained. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE

Madam President, firstly, congratulations to Mr Füle on his appointment as Commissioner. I would also like to congratulate Mr Swoboda, the rapporteur, on his report. It is a very balanced presentation of the progress made in Croatia. At the same time, it clearly indicates the areas where Croatia still has work to do in order to be able to complete the accession process. It is also significant that statistics taken from a Eurobarometer survey carried out in the autumn of last year show that 84% of Croats are dissatisfied with democracy in their country. This means that not only are reforms to the judiciary required, but also an improvement in the situation of minorities. It is also important to ensure that the freedom of the press is guaranteed. These reforms must be initiated and implemented and, above all, they must be supported by the population. In formal terms, the criteria can certainly be met very quickly, but the entire population must be behind the process and must welcome Croatia’s accession to the EU. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE

 Madam President, we have the European Year against Poverty and Exclusion. Women are still at a very high risk of becoming poor or having to live in poverty. There are many small steps which land them in that position: girls tend to choose jobs which do not pay so well. They then decide to have children, which often leads them to only be able to work part-time. Alternatively, they might decide to look after their parents or grandparents, which again puts older women in a situation where they are unable to return to work. These periods add up and, as a result, women’s professional careers progress much more slowly. This is also reflected in the fact that they have lower pensions, for example. There are many aspects to this, and many have been included in this report. The really important message we need to put across is that there are already many opportunities out there, but girls and women need to make use of them. The awareness that a girl is studying engineering, and that she is brave enough to do so – that is what we have to promote in schools. This also applies particularly to immigrant women. I would also like to make another point: if you look around the Chamber today, you will see that two thirds of us attending this debate are women and one third are men. We must also win men over to taking a much greater interest in this subject, so that, one day, we can have the two remaining thirds of men attending and supporting women’s issues. Nadja Hirsch,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her commitment and excellent cooperation, as this really is an important subject. As we have said already, human trafficking is perhaps the very worst form of crime. Europol’s figures, cited in the question, show that there has been no improvement in this field. The opposite is true, in fact. In the area of forced labour, specifically, the figures are going up, whilst the figures on the trafficking of women remain unchanged. It is thus absolutely clear that there is an urgent need, above all, for consistent action. In order for such action to succeed, it is necessary, first and foremost, to adopt an integrated approach in the most varied of areas. One absolutely essential element is to increase awareness – including amongst the population within Europe – that human trafficking takes place right in the middle of Europe, in every country. We need, above all, to get to work on education in this regard, as we did, for example, for the football World Cup in Germany, in order to bring the issue of forced prostitution to light, and to show that this really happens everywhere, and also to inspire debate amongst the populace so that there is an awareness there which will lead to the victims being helped. My second point concerns the protection of victims. Precisely when people are rescued from such a dramatic situation, the Member States, too, must ensure that there is medical and psychological care for them so that they are supported in going back to their countries of origin where appropriate or so that the way is opened to asylum or other similar possibilities here to find a new home and to begin a new life.

 The German Free Democratic Party members of the European Parliament have abstained from voting on the Copenhagen resolution for the following reasons. The resolution contains statements about financing for climate protection measures in third countries without defining the specific criteria or purpose of the financing. We cannot justify this to taxpayers. In addition, we believe that blanket criticism of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) is wrong. The ICAO is the organisation which deals with aviation matters at an international level. Both the criticism and the statement about the alleged failure of ICAO negotiations are incorrect and inappropriate. The call for specific arrangements for a CO2
 trading system for the aviation industry goes against current EU legislation and overburdens the EU’s negotiating position in an international climate agreement with unrealistic demands.President. −  
Dear colleague, I do not have any doubt that those who can speak, will speak, but it is not a convention. The Rules of Procedure stipulate that it is up to the chairing President to decide when and how it is allowed. Excuse me, but that is for clarification. Alexander Alvaro  (ALDE

Mr President, this is turning into groundhog day. Every seven years, we have renewed squabbling over money. As Jutta Haug has rightly said, the Member States bicker like children. Once again, we are becoming embroiled in discussions over whether there should be 5 % more or 5 % less for agricultural subsidies and essential investment in research and development, instead of talking about the priorities and where the European Union should be going in future. The fundamental problem is becoming increasingly obvious. Our Member States are all egotists. The question is always: ‘What can I get from the European budget?’, not ‘What can I contribute in terms of added value to this budget?’. Instead of shared European interests, the EU is dominated by 27 sets of national interests.  Unless we manage to formulate some shared interests for the European Union, we will set the course for its ultimate demise. That is something that no rational Member of this House could possibly want. The multiannual financial framework must be seen as an opportunity to define these European interests. President.

I voted in favour of this report because I believe that the discharge decision for the European Medicines Agency (EMA) cannot be based upon additional requirements, such as the guidelines of the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development), when the implementation of those requirements has not been officially requested by either the EU legislator or specific arrangements within the Agencies during the respective discharge procedure. The European institutions are therefore invited to examine whether it is advisable to incorporate and to commit to additional guidelines in a possible common framework for all European institutions and bodies. On the basis of the data available, I agree that discharge can be granted to the Executive Director of the European Medicines Agency in respect of the implementation of the EMA’s budget for the financial year 2010.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time we have met to discuss this issue, although it may be the first time that we have met at this hour. The question now arising, slowly but surely, is this: when will our debate about data retention finally be at an end? A great many Member States and their constitutional courts have decided that it is not compatible with national constitutions. The Irish High Court referred the matter to the European Court of Justice, and countless citizens in the Member States have not only expressed disquiet and incomprehension about data retention but reject it outright.  I hate to say it, but our assessment all those years ago, when this issue was first discussed in 2005, was correct. We have legal issues which are unresolved; we have economic issues relating to data retention which are unresolved; and we have technical issues which are unresolved. Above all, we have social issues which are unresolved. The Commission’s evaluation report clearly showed the extent to which the approach to data retention, procedures and use vary between the Member States. In some countries, for example, the coastguard can access dossiers of retained data; in others, authorities can make a verbal request. The evaluation report also showed that everything has been achieved, except for harmonisation on issues of data retention. The question whether it is needed at all is still unanswered. In that sense, the authors are rightly asking when we can expect a new initiative from the Commission. It is time to stop flogging a dead horse, which is what data retention is. I would hope that we will have the opportunity to discuss a reform before the end of this legislative term and, in particular, to hear the Commission’s proposals during this debate. I hope we will find out more this evening. I do not want to speak for too long, so let me finish by saying this: I am sure you will have noticed from my comments that we are all getting very tired of this issue. I personally would greatly welcome it if we could find a solution to this sorry state of affairs at European level and perhaps even deal with the issue in an objective manner. Alexander Alvaro,

Mr President, many thanks, Mr Voss, for your input, which is very interesting, especially as regards the role of the Justice Minister. Would you not say that it is the Justice Minister’s responsibility, if she sees that an item of legislation is incompatible with the law and, furthermore – as noted by the Irish High Court, which would not have referred the matter to the European Court of Justice otherwise – possibly incompatible with EU law as well, to suspend the legislation until the matter has been clarified, rather than transposing what is possibly bad law?

Madam President, Mr Lewandowski, the draft budget for 2013 includes funding of almost EUR 150 billion for commitments alone. These commitments are directly related to the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy and they have increased by 2.7% to EUR 64.5 billion in total. The figures under Heading 1, sustainable growth, in particular, have risen by 3.5%. The central programmes for growth and investment, small and medium-sized businesses, employment and young people and new initiatives, for example, the planned pilot phase for the project bond initiative in the fields of transport, energy and ICT, should help to resolve liquidity problems and, therefore, to promote investment and growth, which Europe currently needs more urgently than ever. The payments in the draft budget amount to a total of EUR 138 billion. In the last year of the current financial framework, the draft budget includes higher funding for payments than in 2012, in particular, in the Seventh Framework Programme, where the increase is around 28%, and in the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, where the increase amounts to about 12%. These correspond exactly with the estimated payment applications from the public and private partners, which are responsible for projects in these areas. The proposed increase of 6.8% in the total payment appropriations is the result and the inevitable consequence of the EU’s commitments under the terms of the Treaties to enable all the larger programmes to continue and to take into account the outstanding commitment appropriations from the current year and from previous years. This is conscientious and responsible budgeting. We are also setting priorities, such as the programme for supporting ICT policy, which will be concentrating in 2013 on increasing the spread of these technologies and ensuring that they are used as effectively as possible, in line with Europe’s digital agenda. Overall, this programme will support Europe and the draft budget is a positive approach which we will hopefully be able to adopt together with the Council. Incidentally, if you will allow me to, I would like to conclude by saying that we would have saved a significant amount of money if we had held this debate in Brussels and not in Strasbourg.

− I would be happy to oblige, Mr Pirker. Firstly, perhaps you will have noticed that I did not preside over this debate from the outset. Accordingly I regret that I did not realise that you did indeed have the discipline to be here from the start. The Rules of Procedure themselves state that if we have a five-minute ‘catch-the-eye’ procedure, then five speakers are permitted. It is basically a matter for the President to decide how to handle this. I do not know the eight colleagues from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) (PPE) who requested the floor. I actually made what I thought was the fairest choice. I chose a woman so that there would be a balanced representation of the genders, because the other groups were all represented by men. I am not sure if my answer will satisfy you, but I have to follow some rationale in making a choice. With eight members of the PPE Group requesting the floor, I freely admit that my choice was not based on who had been here for how long. As I was not presiding at the start of the debate, but only took over the chair at a later stage, I was not aware of this. I can assure you, however, that I will take this into consideration the next time, particularly in your case. If a Member has had the discipline to attend a debate from start to finish, then he should be given the opportunity to speak. I apologise that this was not the case this time.

Mr President, inevitably, we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe find it difficult to reach a decision on issues like this. For us, this is a matter to be pondered and we follow a rational path, weighing up the arguments rather than being swayed by dogma. We are the only group in this House to follow such practice. We are aware that legal certainty, legal clarity and the question of the clarity of the wording are decisively important, in other words what is contained in this agreement and what the decisive points will be for us. There are deficiencies with regard to the question of further usage and retention periods, as well as with regard to the area of application, which is open to interpretation. The wording is not clearly defined. As a group we are known for our attachment to freedom, specifically the freedom of the individual. Security is always the servant of freedom. It is never the other way round. Responsibility is an essential element in this context. It is our responsibility to protect and balance the interests of our citizens. In our view this agreement does not achieve that and I believe that our rejection makes it clear that we shall oppose this erosion of freedom and responsibility. President.

 Mr President, thank you, Mr Lewandowski, for the proposal you have submitted. It is not easy to present a budget when so many different interests are involved and Mr La Via has succeeded in highlighting the majority of Parliament’s priorities. In my opinion, there are three decisive aspects to the budget guidelines: the budget must be balanced, it must be sensible and it must be responsible. Mr Lamassoure has just referred to the fact that we have had two austerity budgets in a row. This is absolutely the right thing to do in this situation. During this period, the Member States have only been able to provide limited resources. At the same time, as the previous speaker rightly pointed out, we need to make investments. These are, of course, complementary measures. First of all, we need to create the necessary structures, which are based on a responsible approach to the use of taxpayers’ money, so that we can make investments. Otherwise, we will be throwing good money after bad and this cannot be in our interests. Therefore, I believe it is important that we remind ourselves of this in the guidelines from the parliamentary side. We played a significant role in ensuring that the Member States agreed on automatic sanctions after the summit on 1 and 2 March and this must now be put into practice. I would like to see the Commission and not the Council taking responsibility for this, because then we could be sure that it would be implemented. At the same time, however, we need to give the Member States support with regard to European added value. The issue of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) has been mentioned. They form the backbone of the European economy. It is not the large organisations and the multinationals that create jobs. It is the medium-sized companies which ensure that Europe’s engine for growth and employment continues to function. Therefore, we need to make targeted and sensible use of money. More funding does not necessarily mean better policies. Finally, I would like to express my full support for what Mr Lamassoure said about the need to resolve the problem of the outstanding commitments or reste à liquider
. Most importantly, as far as the budget is concerned – and it is a pity that the Member States are not represented – it would make sense for us to draw up a sensible budget right from the start, so that we do not find ourselves in a difficult situation because amending budgets are required. President.

 Mr President, since 14 of the 15 blue cards have unfortunately gone by the board, I would like to ask Mr López Aguilar whether he can explain to me why Mr Weber, who represents the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), supports law and order, but is not prepared at least to take the group in the direction of carrying out a serious legal test under Article 7(1) which would be a proper solution to the case. You are a former minister of justice and an experienced person. Perhaps you can explain to me why Mr Weber is not in favour of this. Alexander Alvaro  (ALDE

Madam President, Commissioner, good morning. It is good to see you in this last week of business in Strasbourg for this year. As Mr Fernandes has rightly said, 2007 was the year the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund was established, since which – it is unfortunate that my fellow Member from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is no longer listening – EUR 307 million has been distributed – out of a fund of EUR 2.5 billion. Money alone is not the solution when it comes to tackling economic crises and the consequences of globalisation. Structural reforms in the labour market, economic reforms, taxation reforms and social reforms are the elements that can be used to take control of globalisation. Do not be fooled into thinking that money is the horn of plenty that can be used to solve all problems in the long term. If we see the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund as a way to reward the conduct of companies like Nokia, which has moved from Bochum in Germany to Romania and, ultimately, out of the European Union, receiving monetary support on two occasions, that is the wrong approach, and we will certainly not allow that to happen. Mr Fernandes is quite right and I share his views on the prospect of the European Parliament becoming the field where national election campaigns are fought. I note what has happened in France. I also believe, however, that this is a matter for France and does not need to be discussed here. That is why my group will reject the oral amendment if tabled. There are still more than 40 Members of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in this House. This means that we can also reject this oral amendment. I would much prefer it if we were to sit down together and work out how we can integrate the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund intelligently into European budgetary policy within the parameters of the Multiannual Financial Framework, ensuring more growth and more jobs, rather than perpetuating unemployment with the money we have.

 Mr Rübig, I believe that these are precisely the kinds of proposals that we can build on. If we work together – for example with the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), although I am also certain that it would be possible to collaborate with the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance – to produce suggestions for how we can finance and support medium-sized enterprises, young entrepreneurs and start-ups, as well as encouraging quality in the existing business community, then I believe we will arrive at a common denominator, which is precisely the path we should take.

 Madam President, actually this is the problem, and we in the Committee on Budgets have asked, in the reports dealing with EAGGF – especially through amendments – for evaluation mechanisms to be put in place, because we as a Parliament do not know exactly how many people have been reintegrated into work with the help of the European Globalisation Fund (maybe Commissioner Lewandowski knows). We know how many workers we have helped and how many redundant workers have been receiving money out of the Globalisation Fund, but we do not know how many have actually been reintegrated into work. Just to correct one thing: I did not say that companies are doing good; I said that the European Globalisation Fund is actually taking away the burden from enterprises to elaborate specific social plans. This is something which worries me probably as much as it does you. Alexander Alvaro  (ALDE

 Mr President, I am pleased that the Polish Presidency was able to conclude its term in office so successfully. When you receive more praise from all the groups for your Presidency than I, like Mr Schulz, have ever heard in the 15 presidencies that I have had the good fortune to experience, then it is clear that the ‘P’ in Poland stands for ‘professional’. We would like to thank you for the work that you have done in that area. Unfortunately, a lot of what you have achieved in your Presidency has been overshadowed by the general focus of attention on the euro crisis and the debt crisis in Europe. However, you did something very important that has not yet been mentioned. In the preparations for the multiannual financial framework of the European Union, your Presidency involved Parliament at a very early stage for the first time. I had the pleasure of leading a European Parliament delegation in Sopot. We in Parliament were involved in these discussions at an earlier stage than we have ever been before. That is important to us. We hope that the same thing will happen in future, too. In the areas of justice and home affairs, in which I have also been working for many years, you have achieved a significant amount of success in connection with combating child abuse as well as in other areas. I could say that you are concluding your Presidency with a results sheet of successful action that I would like to see followed in a similar way by other European states and companies. I would like to thank you, and I look forward to our continued cooperation in a different context in the Council. Alexander Alvaro  (ALDE

 Mr President, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Council Presidency, Mr Lewandowski and, in particular, the two rapporteurs who, together with the Chair of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Lamassoure, have done an excellent job. The tough negotiations that formed part of the conciliation procedure lasted for 17 hours and the European Parliament spent two hours of this in discussions with the Council. Perhaps it would be sensible next time around if the Council did not hold its negotiations during the conciliation procedure, but instead reached a common position first. That would make the job easier for all of us and would extend the Saturday morning slightly. Nevertheless, we have nominally agreed on a sensible budget. We have accommodated the Council’s requirements. At the Council’s request, the payments were limited to EUR 129 billion and the commitment appropriations were set at EUR 147 billion, which is what Parliament wanted. We should not be under any illusions, however. We are pushing a very dangerous avalanche along. The Council is prepared to finance the commitments that have been entered into by means of supplementary budgets, but I would prefer a commitment to establishing a budget from the beginning with a clear financial basis, so that we do not need constant amending budgets. This simply postpones the problem. Another problem that has emerged is the fact that the European Union needs more investment in research and development. Everyone, including the Member States, clearly supports this. However, this will not work with a capped budget, unless we are prepared to abandon our dogmatic approach to preserving the status quo and our subsidy mindset. If we do not restructure the budget in favour of research and development and the Europe 2020 strategy, we will not be able to meet these priorities. At the same time, we have also shown that, at a time when citizens have to tighten their belts, the European Parliament can do the same. I would like to thank Mr Fernandes in particular, who has made an excellent job of initiating this process. We have achieved a good result and we will be able to vote in favour of this budget. However, we still have to discuss whether this is the right approach in the long term. Alexander Alvaro  (ALDE

 The representatives of the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament will only vote in favour of the Hübner report on amending COM(2011)0482
 on condition that, when raising the applicable cofinancing rates by ten percentage points, there is an exception for those Member States explicitly affected. This exception must not be able to act as a precedent in any way and should be revoked in respect of the Member States in question once the severe financial and economic crisis and its liquidity squeezes have been overcome. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Mr President, I would like to recall that about three years ago Franziska Brantner and I set up what we called ‘Friends of the European External Action Service’, a temporary platform where academics, NGOs and future diplomats of the EEAS could come together and discuss how this should be structured. Some of the things that we came up with are on the agenda today. One is political deputies. We recommended this, but at the time it did not find favour with those who initiated the service. It became clear very quickly that ubiquity is not something that one can expect of the High Representative in what we always called an impossible job – three hats at the same time is simply impossible to fulfil without serious political deputising. Today this is the first point in the recommendation that we are writing as a Parliament. The second issue that we discussed – and which was indeed realised – was to have a broader leadership structure rather than one all-powerful General Secretary. If it was Pierre Vimont we would not have a problem with that of course, but we did not want to have an éminence grise
 behind the scenes who would not appear in Parliament etc. We wanted to have the opportunity to give you as much information from as many sources as possible in your leadership functions. We believe that, even if this is modified, the principle is still valid.  A last point – and my colleague here the Earl of Dartmouth just mentioned this  – is that our Member States are indeed closing down embassies and consulates and that this is where the External Action Service can provide added value because our Member States will continue to be represented by a service that is their own.

I actually have two questions. Firstly, you complain about a lack of solidarity, although aid of about EUR 10 billion has been given to Cyprus, a country of less than one million people. I think that is proof of solidarity. Do you agree with me? Secondly, are you aware of the Council of Europe’s report that has just been leaked, concerning money laundering and the lack of effort on the part of the Cypriot authorities to combat money laundering effectively? We are seeing some pretty dramatic figures online right now. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Mr President, the Taoiseach is here; Chancellor Merkel was here; Prime Minister Monti was here; President Sarkozy, when still in office, was here. David Cameron is hiding in Holland. He seems to be afraid of a real debate about the future of Europe with the elected representatives of the peoples of Europe. I would like to say to Martin Callanan of our Tory friends to invite him to come here to have this debate here rather than in The Hague. Your being here earns you our respect and loyalty but not only that. Sie haben sechs Sparhaushalte nacheinander verabschiedet. Sie haben alle Auflagen von IWF und Europäischer Union erfüllt. Sie sind am Kapitalmarkt zurück, Sie haben wirklich viel getan! Aber Ihr Schuldenstand wird in diesem Jahr ungefähr 120 % des Bruttoinlandsprodukts erreichen, und Sie wollen deshalb die irischen Schulden europäisieren. Ob das richtig ist, sei dahingestellt. Es ist allemal legitim, es zu versuchen. Es wirft nur eine Frage auf: Kann Irland wirklich ein ehrlicher Makler sein, wenn die Last der nationalen Interessen so schwer auf Ihren Schultern drückt? Vergessen wir nicht, in zwölf Monaten wird hier der griechische Premierminister sitzen. Welche nationalen Interessen wird er mitbringen? Das ist ein großes Problem. Sie haben eben in Ihrer Rede gesagt, Sie wollen eine erneuerte und umgebaute Europäische Union. Das klingt bei Ihnen erheblich glaubwürdiger als wahrscheinlich bei David Cameron am Freitag. Ich habe einige Vorschläge, was man machen könnte. Zum Einen: Lassen Sie uns die rotierende Präsidentschaft abschaffen. Sie werden sehr gute Arbeit machen. Das ist Ihre siebte Präsidentschaft, Sie haben eine hervorragende Europaministerin. Aber das System ist ein Problem. Zweitens: Gestern hat hier der österreichische Bundeskanzler, der auch hier war, um über Europa zu debattieren, gefordert, dass alle Rabatte abgeschafft werden sollen bei der Finanzierung der Europäischen Union. Lassen Sie uns das System erheblich einfacher machen! Beim dritten Punkt geht es an Ihre Glaubwürdigkeit: Sie haben gesagt, Sie wollen eine Europäische Union, die weniger komplex, weniger institutionell ist. Der erste wichtige Schritt dahin ist eine kleinere Kommission. Wir haben jetzt 27 Kommissare, es werden immer mehr. Das ist der erste wichtige Schritt, und hier spielen Sie eine ganz besondere Rolle! Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Mr President, I second the last remark. It is good to have you here in this job, Stavros, it is good that we have you as an EU Special Representative for Human Rights. I think that is very good. Die Menschenrechtspolitik der Europäischen Union war ja eine Zeit lang wirklich in der Kritik.  Die Stunde der Wahrheit war der Arabische Frühling. Wir haben in den Spiegel geschaut, und was wir gesehen haben, das hat uns nicht alles gefallen. Wir haben darauf reagiert, mit einer Menschenrechtsstrategie, mit einem Aktionsplan – das ist gut. Mit einem Sonderbeauftragten für Menschenrechte – auch das ist gut. Wir unterstützen die Zivilgesellschaft und Nichtregierungsorganisationen – auch das ist gut. Wir wollen uns koordinieren und wir wollen an einem Strang ziehen – auch das ist gut.  Aber hier habe ich eine ganz konkrete Frage an Frau Kozakou-Marcoullis, mit der Bitte um Antwort: Wir wollen uns koordinieren, wir wollen uns abstimmen, wie machen wir das praktisch?  Sollten wir uns nicht – Sie haben den Europäischen Demokratiefonds erwähnt – in unserer Politik und in unseren Instrumenten wirklich darauf verpflichten, dass die Demokratieförderung von EIHDR und EED eng abgestimmt wird, dass miteinander geredet wird, um Doppelungen zu vermeiden? Ich bin sicher, Sie werden mir da zustimmen.  Und Sie haben auch Diskriminierungen auf der Basis von Kastenzugehörigkeit erwähnt. Wir werden morgen hierzu eine Dringlichkeitsentschließung haben. Würden Sie mir auch zustimmen, dass die Europäische Union in ihrer Politik und ihren Instrumenten kastenbasierte Diskriminierung aufgreifen und bekämpfen sollte? Herzlichen Dank für Antworten auf diese beiden Fragen. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Mr President, we are voting on quite a large number of amendments tabled by one particular group that usually attaches great importance to strict compliance with the Rules of Procedure. In this House, roll-call votes are generally reserved for issues of particular and major importance. It would therefore be sensible for the EP’s Services to contact the group concerned to establish whether each of these roll-call votes is, in fact, necessary. In my view, what the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group is inflicting on us here is completely unnecessary. (Applause) Alexander Graf Lambsdorff,

 Mr President, Prime Minister, Mr Barroso, we have heard a great deal about how the house of Europe is built of the bricks of solidarity, but houses must be built on solid foundations. That has been the distinctive line of the past six months: the link between solidarity and solidity. I would therefore have liked you to have said a bit more about solidity, Prime Minister, and to have talked about how we can exert better, stricter control over the situation that we are in – the debt crisis in the Member States that has dragged our currency down with it. You mentioned the ‘two-pack’, and that indeed took place during your Presidency. In the case of the ‘two-pack’, we, as the European Parliament, called for a debt redemption pact. I believe we need to take a brave step forward if we want to be successful here. However, the Council’s decisions of last weekend leave a lot of questions unanswered. Mr Swoboda mentioned the growth pact. I know that it is something he is particularly concerned about. Der Spiegel
 called the whole thing a sham. A total of EUR 50-55 billion is supposed to come from the Structural Funds, but even Commissioner Hahn says he does not know how such figures are arrived at. I am not convinced that it is genuinely solid, that it will restore confidence among our citizens. Liability and control go together; that is the really crucial thing. We want to liberate forces for growth, we want the European patent. However, and in this Mr Swoboda is absolutely right, what the Council has decided is completely absurd. A court that sits in three different places – London, Paris and Munich – is downright grotesque, and it shows that quite clearly the Member States are not capable of coming to sensible decisions on such an important, innovation-driving matter. I have one question. A new system of banking supervision is now to be established on the basis of Article 127(6) of the Treaty. I thought we had a European Banking Authority. Are we now going to have a banking supervisory authority with two seats as well? Are we going to get two different banking supervisory authorities? Precisely what form does the Council imagine this is going to take? You will find it pretty difficult to explain the proliferation of seats of various organisations to this Parliament and get support for it. In other respects, I would like to offer my sincere thanks for your committed Presidency. There are some other matters that you have progressed with real success. I have not mentioned Schengen, which was undoubtedly a sore point in your Presidency. However, the enlargement policy in respect of Serbia and Montenegro is undoubtedly one of the positive aspects.

Blue-card question.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I should like to ask Ms Harms whether what she describes as a comfort – the prospect of joint liability, common risk – does not necessarily also entail shared political control, or should be viewed in parallel with this. After all, the debts for which we are jointly liable today are the taxes of tomorrow. No taxation without representation. That is a very important point. My second, very specific, question is as follows. You said that bank risk should be separated from sovereign risk, and that we have now succeeded in this. However, the European Stability Mechanism, which is currently recapitalising the banks, is borne by sovereign states. In other words, sovereign risk is being distributed differently, but it is still there. What is your assessment of this? I take a very critical view of it, and where the conclusion of the Euro Group is concerned, I am decidedly sceptical as regards how vague it has been kept and what impact it will have in practice. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, firstly, congratulations to Mr Lewandowski. However, the person I really want to wish all the best is not you, but rather your namesake, Robert, of Borussia Dortmund – I hope he manages to score to take Poland into the quarter finals. That really would be something to celebrate. We have just heard a few things about the Council and the future of Europe that this Council is to decide on, that are to be debated. Listening to what Mr Bokros has said here, I believe this to be very important. The crucial thing as regards everything that we are debating in relation to the multiannual financial framework, in relation to the budget, is whether the private sector is going to invest again, whether the private sector will regain its confidence in the European economy and its prospects. This is the decisive factor. Public budgets can only provide incentives at best. The Social Democrats sometimes need that explaining to them. You cannot buy growth; you can only enable growth. That is why it is crucial that the structural reforms that President Barroso mentioned come about. The second really crucial thing is the debt redemption pact; a clear, effective debt redemption pact linked to clear conditions which will relieve the burden on the budgets in the Member States, which at present, despite all their efforts – in Italy, for example – simply cannot emerge from the constraints of their refinancing. We therefore need a clear and effective debt redemption pact. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff, Britta Reimers and Michael Theurer  (ALDE
),

 The German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament has spoken out clearly in favour of the introduction of a debt redemption fund. However, participation in such a fund must be associated with clear and strict rules, such as were contained in the proposal made by the German Council of Economic Experts to the German Government in autumn 2011. Watering down the criteria for participation is neither productive nor effective. Linking the introduction of a debt redemption fund with the eurobonds project and the treatment of economic imbalances is unfair, and is rejected by the FDP in the European Parliament in the strongest possible terms.

 I have two very specific questions. One is whether Mr Rouček is aware that the Czech Government has granted political asylum to Mr Danylyshyn, the former Ukrainian Minister for the Economy. This is only granted when the person is suffering from political persecution. I would also like to know what he thinks of this fact. My second question concerns whether it is relevant that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament or the Social Democratic Party of Europe has a cooperation agreement with the Party of the Regions. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, as Mr Siwiec has just said, this is not the first debate that we have held on the subject of Ukraine and, as has so often been the case before, large parts of this debate have been unproductive and predictable. Why is this? The answer is quite simple. The Batkivshchyna is a party which follows the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and, as we have just heard, the Party of the Regions has an agreement with the Socialists. In other words, the PPE group is now making a big fuss, puffing out its cheeks and running a poster campaign to create a good photo opportunity, while the Socialists are giving speeches about the situation in Ukraine which they ought to be ashamed of. This is a softly-softly approach which glosses over the reality of the situation. This type of debate does not do justice to the strategic or the humanitarian dimension of the problem. Ukraine is a large country with a population of 50 million. It lies between Russia, the European Union and the Black Sea. For 20 years, it has been stagnating in economic, democratic and social terms. Of course, that was also the case under the Yushchenko/Tymoshenko government. I believe that we now need to put the focus on the political and humanitarian dimension. We must ensure that democracy has a chance at the elections in October. However, Mr Füle, the electoral campaign is already under way. I would like some very precise information from the Commission and the European External Action Service about how they plan to implement the measures that you have just described, in other words, the close monitoring of the electoral campaign and the elections themselves. I would like our two guests, Hryhoriy Nemyria and Yevgenia Tymoshenko, to take away more from today’s debate than just the usual disputes between left and right. To Ms Tymoshenko, I would like to say in particular that I hope her mother receives the medical treatment she needs. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Blue-card answer.

The subject of our debate today is the case of Ms Tymoshenko, a political and humanitarian case which gives rise to the most serious concern, and Members who I otherwise have a great deal of personal respect for, such as Mr Rouček and Mr Vigenin, are giving speeches which do not in any way do justice to the severity of the case about the various minor reforms that are taking place at the moment. The situation would be exactly the reverse if the government in Ukraine were different. That is what I mean. We must be open and clear about this. Regardless of who is in power in Ukraine, the country is too important for us to discuss it here from a party political perspective. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr Schulz, I hope you have noted the fact that I did not express a naïve hope, but that I called on the Commission to make it entirely clear how it intends to monitor the election process.

 Mr President, there are three important issues for the summit tomorrow. The first is to continue consolidating the national budgets. That is not an end in itself, Mr Bullmann. If investment levels are currently low or even at zero, as you say, then there is a reason for this. We are paying interest on the debts that we have accumulated in the past instead of building schools. We are paying interest instead of building roads. We are paying interest instead of investing in innovation and research. We need to continue consolidating the national budgets so that we can begin investing in these areas again. The second important topic is structural reforms. Productivity, efficiency, competitiveness, entrepreneurship and an appropriate level of taxation for businesses will all help to ensure that the Member States and their markets are competitive. It concerns me that the labour market reforms in Italy have come to a stop. We need to abolish Article 18. I do not understand how anyone can be opposed to that. The third point is growth. How do we intend to finance it? The UK is not prepared to go along with the financial transaction tax. This amounts to false accounting. The European Investment Bank is a much better solution. In addition, the Commission must finally submit proposals as to how we can mobilise the available money in the Structural Funds for use in Greece and the other countries, because we have already been talking about this for two years. We gradually need to introduce some concrete measures. We have been talking about this for two years without anything being done. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

I simply wanted to ask Mr Lamberts whether he might consider assuming that the Members of the House, whatever their nationality and whatever their political affiliation, pursue honest motives in their political activities, and whether he might refrain in future from slanderous and belittling remarks.

 Mr President, what do Düsseldorf and Dortmund, Herten and Essen, Arnsberg and Würselen have in common? They are all places where the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) Members of the European Parliament for North Rhine-Westphalia live. The people of North Rhine-Westphalia hear from Ms Kraft that the SPD’s aim is to protect and promote both industry and the region as an industrial heartland. At the same time, these Members from Dortmund, Düsseldorf, Essen and other places are now about to vote for a massive increase in the price of diesel, this despite the fact that Germany and Europe lead the world in this energy-efficient and environmentally friendly drive technology. The consequences of this price increase are clear: rising prices, a decline in internal demand, a threat to technological superiority and to the survival of the industrial base. If this really is the Social Democrats’ industrial policy, then we can say good night to North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany and Europe. The truth is that this makes no economic or environmental sense. If we consider rising fuel costs, which have already reached record levels, then we must recognise that we are inhibiting internal demand, despite the fact that the Social Democrats are always looking to stimulate growth in this area. This makes no sense from an environmental perspective either. We all know that diesel-powered vehicles travel further on less fuel than petrol-driven vehicles. That is why I would call on the Social Democrats to reconsider the consequences for the people, the consumers and the drivers of Germany and Europe of their vote tomorrow. It is high time that the SPD espoused an economic policy that targets success, not just on election posters, but also in specific political action. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I support the motion tabled by Mr Swoboda to remove this report from the agenda. Some points in the report are so incomplete that it needs further debate. The current wording of the report makes it clear that diesel would become considerably more expensive. This is definitely not the sort of economic policy signal that car drivers and industry want to see. Therefore, I believe it is right to discuss this report further and to focus on the uncontroversial areas when it is next referred to Parliament. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Madam President, my group tabled the original amendment. We regret that it is not possible to name the Zaman
 newspaper here, because this was the only paper to suffer attack in Cologne, Paris, London, Rotterdam and Zurich. As a group, we intend to vote in favour of Mr Obiol’s amendment nonetheless in order to show clearly that the freedom of the press is a central objective for us. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, my report appears in the voting lists as an own-initiative report. However, according to the Rules of Procedure, it is, in fact, a recommendation to the Council. That is a different matter. We would not need to vote on the report because, according to the Rules of Procedure, it is deemed adopted if there are no amendments tabled by the groups. I would ask that the documents be corrected in order to put this right. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, we all agree that we want a stability culture in Europe. That is at least what we are constantly hearing. We also need to assess what has been achieved with the fiscal compact, which represents an important step towards the stability culture. It is not a turning point and it is not the solution. It is also not a universal remedy. We can all agree on that. However, I believe that it is an important step forward, and this needs to be said for the sake of truth. We want balanced budgets with very low primary deficits, if these cannot be avoided. We want a debt brake in the euro area countries. We want automatic sanctions for offenders before things go wrong. We want old debts to be reduced and the results to be reported to Brussels before new debts are incurred. We want the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) to come into effect earlier. We must also make sure that only those countries which join the fiscal compact have access to the ESM. These are all important elements of a stability culture in Europe and, with the ‘two-pack’, we are attempting to implement this under European law, including a debt redemption pact, which is something my group is specifically calling for. We want to stimulate growth in Greece and the money to do this is available. Between EUR 16 billion and EUR 18 billion – the numbers vary – can be provided from the Structural Funds. I believe that we finally need to get started with this. Everything that Mr Reichenbach and the Troika have so far achieved in Greece is not enough to give a real boost to growth. Then, today, there was a debate in the German Parliament which surprised me, because the Social Democrats are threatening to vote against the fiscal compact unless it includes a particular tax, which would justifiably be controversial. I believe this would be a huge mistake. I also think it is important for the Social Democrats to become aware of their responsibilities in terms of stability policy and to vote in favour of the compact without playing party political games. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the central issue for us is to make progress on the road towards a stability culture. I would like to finish by congratulating you, Mr Van Rompuy, on your reappointment. Everyone agrees that you are doing an excellent job. However, I am still of the opinion that your position, as it is enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon, is a mistake. I would prefer to have a President of Europe who, if possible, was also directly elected. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, as Mr Wammen has just said, the Spring European Council meeting is traditionally the European Union’s rendezvous with social and economic reality in Europe. However, we have all heard that the finance ministers yesterday cancelled their meeting in Brussels at which they intended to approve the second aid package for Greece. What does that mean? What does it mean for Greece and for Europe? I believe that our common goal is to keep Greece in the euro area and I would like to respond to Mr Daul on this subject. I do not agree with what Ms Kroes has said about Greece remaining in the euro area, but the reason why she has said it and why so many people are so impatient, is the behaviour of her sister party, Nea Dimokratia, in particular. If they could just call Mr Samaras to order, it would be very helpful. I believe it would be better for all of us. We want Greece to stay in the euro area, but it is important to make one thing clear. In the past, the Greek Government has made a lot of promises, but has delivered very little. The introduction of another austerity package does not by any means indicate that what is being promised will actually be put into practice, and that is exactly what this is all about. It is about structural reform, which will lead to further aid being made available. If it takes the right course, Greece can count on our support. However, we no longer need preliminary work; instead, we are looking for action. It has been said here that the situation in Greece is genuinely dramatic. In addition to the savings which are needed, Mr Swoboda, from 1991 to 2007, in other words, before the crisis, Greece had an average annual national deficit of 6.6%. Greece is now having to pay the bill for its poor policies in the past. Of course, we do not envy the Greeks. That is absolutely clear. We want to get the country and the economy going again and the trade unions will be an important part of this. Trade unions have played a constructive role in increasing competitiveness in Germany over many years. Economic performance has fallen by 7% over the last three months. This is why we now need genuine structural reforms, in other words, a tax reform which is worthy of the name. Progress must be made with privatisation in important sectors such as energy generation, ports and lotteries, every area where the state is too heavily involved. The proposed cuts in the bloated civil service are also needed. Parts of the Greek political system have been based on this. People simply found positions for their supporters in a ministry, a public authority or a public company. In other words, the state sector is completely bloated. I would like to remind everyone in this context that it was the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe which called for a sort of Marshall Plan some time ago. We call it the Hercules Plan and we will be happy to work on it. However, after the last Council meeting, our group also made three very specific proposals for measures to promote growth and create jobs. These proposals are addressed to the Council: the implementation of the European patent, the deployment of unused funding from the European Union budget and a plan to reduce the risk of infection within Europe. We want a debt redemption pact for the whole of Europe. We expect the Council finally to tackle this problem.

 Mr President, I am looking around and I do not want to exclude any of the Members who are sitting behind me. It is important to make it clear that we must not attach too much importance to these remarks. It is obvious that many people really have run out of patience. We want to see something happen in Greece. We are prepared to help and to show solidarity, but the phase of promises must be replaced by a phase of taking action. I believe that this is what lies behind these remarks. They are made on a pars pro toto 
basis. This is not just one voice speaking. Many, many people are saying the same thing. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, I would be very grateful if Mr Cohn-Bendit could explain to me what he believes the Taliban are. I am not familiar with the phrases ‘liberal Taliban’ and ‘neoliberal Taliban’. Mr Daul has just outed himself here as a liberal. I do not believe that he is a member of the Taliban, not even the neoliberal Taliban. We should stop all this nonsense. What is really important, and I would like to say that Mr Cohn-Bendit is right about this, is that we should all treat each other with respect. That also applies to the different peoples of Europe, including the Greeks, the Germans and the others. Treating each other with respect within the European Union should always be more important than wonderful rhetorical flights of fancy which are actually rather disrespectful.

– The FDP Delegation has abstained in today’s vote on the motion for a resolution on the feasibility of introducing stability bonds. We believe that the introduction of Eurobonds would set the wrong incentives. Since the introduction of the euro, low interest rates have led to a substantial increase in debt levels in many eurozone countries. Eurobonds would take the pressure off highly indebted eurozone Member States to consolidate their budgets and introduce much needed structural reforms. Therefore, we believe that Eurobonds would aggravate, rather than alleviate, the current crisis. However, we did not vote against the resolution as many of our concerns have been taken on board by the rapporteur. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Mr President, Mr Swoboda, I would like to ask you to take note of the fact that the same states which are currently in particular difficulties in the midst of the debt crisis are also the states with the highest youth unemployment levels. Please also take note of the fact that labour market policy is the responsibility of the Member States and that imposing sanctions in areas where companies have to hire people definitely does not make sense but simply aggravates the situation. Please also take note of the fact that the citizens of France will elect their own president. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, I was particularly pleased about the Council’s decision to impose sanctions and an oil embargo and to increase the pressure on Iran. I consider this to be the sensible and right thing to do and I am amazed to hear many fellow Members saying that there is no proof of military intent or that it is not possible to distinguish between civil and military use. We only need to look at the facts. Iran has 5 000 kg of uranium that is enriched to 3%. That is what is needed for energy production. However, it already has 75 kg that is enriched to 20%, and the only explanation for that is that it is planning to use it for military purposes. The enrichment needs to be pushed to 90%. That is technically complex, but by no means impossible. All of the facts, including the most recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), indicate that military use is intended here. In other words, we have a predictable period here in which the whole scenario will enfold, and it is therefore right for the European Parliament to now increase the pressure. The same applies with regard to the delivery systems, commonly known as missiles. The Iranians are obviously working on medium- and long-range missiles. This brings the urgency of the situation even more clearly into focus. It would have been better if the oil embargo had been put into effect immediately – although I fully understand the need of some Member States to find means of diversification. However, that will also give Iran the opportunity to find ways round this. I am pleased that the joint parliamentary resolution received broad support. I am also pleased about the particularly constructive role of the IAEA, in particular since Yukiya Amano took over the position of Director General. That is extremely helpful, and I am also pleased to see the positive and constructive role that Turkey has been playing recently with regard to this matter. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, Prime Minister, I would like to start by thanking you. Immediately upon entering office, you reversed the snap decision of the previous regime to reintroduce border controls between Denmark and Germany and Denmark and Sweden. I believe this was a very good decision. My group favours an open Europe. This was good news for those citizens living in the border regions. It was also good news for business, particularly the transport companies on either side of the border. Thank you for what is a really positive step. In my second point I find myself agreeing with Mr Langen: please defend the Community method. You have already seen what happens when we revert to the intergovernmental patterns of the 19th century and the attitudes associated with them. At least this is what has been reported in the media in relation to what Mr Sarkozy had to say to you. If this is the new tone we can expect from the intergovernmental method, then this is another argument in favour of the Community method. There is one important point to make, however. In setting out your priorities for the Presidency of the Council you state that you want the European Union to have a strong, consistent external profile. I believe it would be good if you could use the opportunity afforded by this Council Presidency to initiate a debate on whether you really wish to maintain your opt-out from the Common Security and Defence Policy. It is strange that every country except Denmark is a member of the European Defence Agency. I would be extremely grateful if you could take advantage of this opportunity. Finally, my group, together with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, is pursuing a procedure against Hungary under Article 7(1) of the Treaty. It is then up to the Council, however, to make any recommendations. Article 7(1) only provides for recommendations. I would encourage you: place this on the agenda and organise the necessary four-fifths majority of Member States. This is the only way we will make any progress with regard to Hungary.

 Mr President, Mr Weber, I have absolutely no doubts about your commitment to the rule of law. However, today I do doubt your political judgment. There is a new national justice agency in Hungary. It is responsible for appointing judges and for allocating cases to specific courts. This national justice agency has a director. It is managed by a lady. Perhaps you would like to tell us who she is, if you know. If you do not know, ask your neighbour. She is the wife of Mr Szájer and I find this very strange in the context of discussions on the independence of the judiciary. (Applause) Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Orbán, I would like to make one thing clear straight away: Hungary is not Belarus, you are not Mr Chávez and it is possible to live a good life in Hungary. Nevertheless, we do have serious concerns. I am intending to link my criticisms to specific points, as Mr Weber has called on us to do. You said that no one had criticised the constitution. There are now 25 ‘cardinal laws’, which raise some issues to the level of the constitution because a two-thirds majority is required to change them again. One of these is the flat tax. I am a Liberal and I think a flat tax is an excellent idea. However, it is not acceptable to take a tax policy issue out of the political debate and include it in the constitution. This undermines and impairs the citizens’ democratic right to vote, to choose a different government at the next elections and to bring about comprehensive change. Tax law is a question which must stimulate central political debate and democratic disputes. This situation is unacceptable because it undermines democracy and that is why it is so serious. Incidentally, you have said, and this was the point which concerned the judicial system, that this is all about the independence of the judiciary and about facts. The Prime Minister has said that he has done everything possible to consolidate the budget. How can he then reduce the retirement age for around 300 judges from 70 to 62? That will cost the state a lot of money. Of course, new judges will have to be appointed to fill the vacancies. That is all well and good. We have our own ideas about who they will be. I think we understand that very well. A year ago we expressed our criticism of the media law. We were told that the pluralism of the media was not at risk. Now Klubrádió is being closed down. It has already been closed in Budapest and the frequencies are now being shut down in the countryside. Mr Orbán, you have said that you have written a letter to Mr Barroso in order to discuss the situation calmly and objectively. In the BILD newspaper today you explained that you are yielding to power. (The President cut off the speaker) Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, I am rather surprised. This morning on the German radio station Deutschlandfunk
, Mr Schulz was celebrating the agreement on the ‘six-pack’ as the hour in which the European Parliament demonstrated its importance and I completely agree with him about this. However, he failed to mention that the left wing of this House did, of course, vote against the ‘six-pack’ and has now also taken up a position opposing the results of the summit, balanced budgets and effective sanctions. This does not add up. I am sorry, but we have a debt union. We must have balanced budgets. We need sensible mechanisms which will allow us to achieve this. That is what was decided at the summit. In overall terms, the results are an effective way of allowing us to move from being a debt union to becoming a stability union. However, on one point I agree with him and my other fellow Members: this will become a government agreement. As a result, the risk of a democratic deficit and of a lack of acceptance by the citizens is very real. Therefore, it is very important that the parliaments, both this House and the national parliaments, are very closely involved in this process. My third point, Mr Barroso, concerns something that is important to me. Of course it is essential that what is decided in this fiscal compact is transferred into the Treaties. To do this, we just need the agreement of the United Kingdom at some point. However, it may possibly be the case that we will be forced to do things the other way round. We may need to see this fiscal compact as the founding of a new European Union, as closer integration and as the starting signal for a new project. Nevertheless, I would like to make it clear that we want the British to be involved. Mr Daul, the countries where Liberal parties are in government are those where the public finances are largely in good shape: Estonia, Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and Sweden. These are the countries where the Liberals are in government. In the countries where the Conservatives are in power without Liberals to apply corrective measures, such as Italy, Greece and Portugal, things look a little different. The Liberal position is very clear in that respect. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, I take every appropriate and inappropriate opportunity to praise Ms Wortmann-Kool. To put it simply, no one disputes the institutional point. Of course, this was one of the European Parliament’s finest hours. However, we are not only discussing institutional questions here today; we are also talking about overcoming the euro crisis and about the route towards a stability union. (Heckling from Martin Schulz)
 This is an important point. I am amazed by the tough stance taken by the entire left wing of this House in opposing the results of the summit, including Mr Steinmeier, who described the whole thing as a fiasco. With the best will in the world, I cannot understand this. It is in our common interest that the Member States in the euro area have balanced budgets and that they are monitored. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 – (DE)
 Mr President, before I come to the topic in question, I would like to mention that our former fellow Member and Vice-President, Mr Lambrinidis, is here in the Chamber. He is holding a conversation at the back and we are pleased to see him. He is not listening, because he does not understand German, but that does not matter. When I attend events in my constituency, I always ask my constituents: Which has more soldiers, the European Union or the United States? People generally give the wrong answer. The Member States of the European Union have 2 million soldiers under arms, while the United States has 1.4 million. We are armed to the teeth, but we are only spending on these soldiers one-third of what the Americans are spending. That is plainly nonsense. For this reason, pooling and sharing makes perfect sense. However, it is also clear that we cannot leave this to the armed forces alone. The process must be under political control. In this respect, this report makes a major contribution to the political debate and I would like to thank Mr Lisek. However, I would like to express my criticism of one point and that concerns offsets. The opinion expressed in this report cannot replace the legally binding provisions of the directive on defence procurement in the European Union. I have read the Commission’s guidelines on the use of offsets and it is essential that we follow them. Regardless of whether they are civilian or military, direct or indirect, they always have the effect of distorting competition and, under the terms of Article 346, are only permitted in very few exceptional circumstances. Therefore, I believe it is important for us to emphasise this once again, to stick to it and to vote accordingly.

 Mr President, as I know how excellent our interpreters are, it cannot have been due to the interpreting, so it must have been down to you Mr Van Orden. I clearly said that the Member States have 2 million soldiers and that we are only spending on these soldiers in Europe as a whole one-third of what the Americans are spending. It is obvious that this does not make sense. Even the United Kingdom is very happily pooling and sharing strategic transport aircraft, nuclear testing and aircraft carriers with the French. I believe that this debate is important and I would like to thank Mr Lisek for his positive report. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Madam President, I believe there is cause for concern with regard to this summit. The role of the US in the global economy is far from agreeable. While we here in Europe have learnt from the debt crisis to be responsible with our public finances, we see the American Central Bank continuing to open the floodgates and flood the American market with dollars. Easy money was one of the causes of the crisis in 2008. The whole affair is, unfortunately, continuing along the same path, just like the US public debt situation. The risk of inflation must not be ignored. I also think it is regrettable that the US has still not managed to carry out any permanent reform of its Medicare, Medicaid and social security systems. In this context ahead of an election year in 2012, a weaker dollar is, of course, not what the US wants. A revaluation would absolutely not fit in with President Obama’s jobs programme. The advice to Europeans to please stabilise the euro should also be seen against this background. After all, if the euro loses value against the dollar, US exports will have a harder time on the global markets. At the same time, there is a rise in protectionist efforts in the US – this is also a trend that we absolutely must counter, and therefore it is good that the Commissioner for Trade has spoken here today. I consider this to be extremely important. We Europeans and Americans still have the most significant trade and investment relations with one another. A second point that is important for my group is the fact that, with Google, eBay, Apple and Amazon, so-called information empires have arisen. With regard to the handing of the data, it is important for us, together with the US, to find a new approach for these private players too, and I believe that this is of great interest to our citizens. This matter must be addressed seriously. I forgot to mention Facebook, which should clearly also be included here. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 – (DE)
 Mr Rübig, I wish I could give you an encouraging answer. My fear is simply that if the Republicans actually manage to remove President Obama from office, we will not see any particular improvement in the US public finances in terms of revenue, whereas if things were to go on as before, the Democrats will continue their irresponsible policy in relation to expenditure. Therefore, I do not believe that the macroeconomic situation in the US will take a turn for the better. We will have to humbly wait and see who the Americans ultimately vote for next November.

Madam President, Ms Schaake is one of our most competent Members when it comes to issues relating to the Internet, freedom of information and data protection. I would like to take the opportunity to ask you whether you think it would make sense to draw up an action plan with the US that would ensure the protection of data and the privacy of users of these major providers. Could this be an objective for this or another EU-US summit? In my view, it could be. I would like to hear your opinion on this and perhaps a few elements that could be agreed on in such an action plan. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what we are now experiencing is something we have warned about for many years in soapbox speeches. We are leaving the coming generations an impossible debt burden. This is irresponsible. All the political parties have said so for many years. We can see from the example of Greece that the problem is no longer waiting for the next generation – it is now confronting this generation and we can see what this means. Tightening one’s belt is painful, however we need to move towards a stability union. There have been some good developments that are going well and where things are working. Ireland is heading in the right direction. We have introduced a budgetary control watchdog, the European Semester. We have agreed a stability pact with teeth – something also to be welcomed. Last night marked an important step along the way to stability union. We agreed that the banks need to do business on a more solid basis. They are to be forced to fulfil their responsibilities and will be recapitalised, however they must have a solid 9% of equity capital. Greece is to have the haircut. It was clear that this would have to happen. We will also have permanent monitoring of the reforms in Greece. Italy has announced pension reforms. We must be clear about the fact that we are still on the path to stability union. All of these things must be implemented in order for us to move forward. I would like to close by congratulating Mr Rehn, the new Vice-President. I am certain that he will play a key role in taking us along the path to this stability union. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I have to say that the wishes of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have never been met so quickly by the Commission. The chair of our group has only just requested the documents that describe the proposals in detail and here they are. We have asked for the documents because I would like to reassure myself that I have correctly understood one point which is particularly important to me. The Commission proposals, which, on the whole, are excellent and far-reaching, include the following statement:  Deciding a sustainable solution for Greece within the euro area, through an effective second adjustment programme.  (DE)
 We need a lasting solution for Greece within the euro area and we can achieve this by making Greece’s debts sustainable. In other words, this is the famous haircut. It is insolvency or, if you prefer, ‘re-solvency’. That was precisely our position. This is why we were accused of being populists a few weeks ago when we said that debt reduction would be needed to allow Greece to emerge from the crisis. The Commission is rightly combining this with robust implementation and supervision mechanisms. This is the right thing to do. We want solidarity, we want to keep Greece in the euro area, but we also want solidity and we want to be able to monitor it, because solidarity cannot be a one-way street. That is extremely important to us. I am pleased that the European debate is now moving in this direction. I am also pleased that our position, which all the experts have long since confirmed is the right one, is now also being confirmed in the political arena. I always get a warm feeling when I hear the Tory Members of this House, like Mr Kirkhope, calling for strong European solutions to recapitalise the banks. Issues like national sovereignty and the United Kingdom and its special position always come to mind in these circumstances. However, I am pleased that there are occasions when even London believes that Europe is useful. I would just like to see this happening more often. I have one final point to make, which is that the news agencies are already reporting that the opposition and the governing parties in Slovakia have agreed to support the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the increase in its scope. This also pleases me. The spectacle of the last few days clearly shows that the requirement for unanimity is a means of setting up blockades. We need majority decisions, including when it comes to stabilising the euro. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
).  
– (DE)
 Mr President, the interpreter, at least, did not word it as a question, but nevertheless, I am happy to provide an answer. No, the solidarity between the Member States of the European Union and of the euro area makes various demands on us and on our voters. However, we are prepared to meet those demands because we want a stability union for Europe and, within this stability union, solidarity is a two-way street. This means that we are prepared to take on these guarantees. As far as the question of the banks is concerned, I am unhappy about the developments in the banking sector, just as everyone who takes a close look at it is. It is true that some of the things which were being done before the crisis are still going on now. However, one thing is absolutely clear. Without a functioning banking sector, we cannot develop a strategy for growth in Europe. As a result, the actions that we have just taken – paying the next tranche to Greece and organising a haircut which does not completely cripple the banking sector – are necessary to allow us to emerge from the crisis by means of economic growth. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Ms Harms, are you aware that the Prime Minister of the Netherlands has proposed a Commissioner – Mr Rehn, to be specific about it – as a sort of European finance minister? We believe that this is a good idea. My second question to you is as follows. You have spoken here about imbalances and about the investments that need to be made. How do you explain the fact that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will be voting here today against a better, tougher, stronger Stability and Growth Pact, which will stabilise the eurozone, while we in Berlin are being given wonderful advice by the Socialists and the Greens? (Applause) Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, you have made a very good speech, Mr Barroso. What is important now is putting it into practice, in other words, the follow-up, as Mr Verhofstadt has said, and ensuring that something really happens here. I believe that we agree almost unanimously that we need more Europe in order to be able to overcome this crisis. However, we need the right Europe and for us that means that we want a stability union rather than a debt union. We need to include a ‘debt brake’ in the national constitutions. We still need, and here my opinion differs from that of the Chair of my group, different interest rates, because they act as an economic ‘debt brake’. We also need an organised process for national bankruptcy. We need rules which determine what happens when a country becomes unable to pay its debts, so that we can keep it in the eurozone. That is the crucial point. We need a stability pact with teeth and with automatic sanctions. I would like to say one thing. The plan by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to vote against this tougher stability pact here today is a continuation of Gerhard Schröder’s policy of 2003, which aimed to destroy the stability culture of Europe. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, some excellent work has been done in a difficult field. I am a little surprised by Mr Cohn-Bendit, who spent five minutes berating you, describing your role as that of a blackmailer and calling on you to resolve the problems immediately, before leaving the Chamber. He could at least have waited to hear what you had to say in reply. The fact is that some excellent work has been done in this field. There is one thing that we must not forget: what were our fears? We were afraid that the European Union would once again create an impression that our Member States would not pull together, just as we failed to act cohesively in the war in Iraq or as we are doing now in Libya. Germany and France had already made their positions clear in individual statements. On the contrary, the European Union is pulling together. You have earned the trust of both sides in the region, the Israelis and the Palestinians. This is a diplomatic feat in itself and it is true to say that we can only play a constructive role through trust. It is also true that we, the European Union, can only play a constructive role if our Member States are united. Both of these points are on a good footing thanks to your work. Overall, you have done a good job. There are three more important things I would like to mention: we want a united European Union – you are making good progress in this direction. As Parliament stated in its resolution, we want a negotiated solution in the United Nations. We do not want a vote with winners and losers. We regard this as vitally important. Thirdly, we must have a timetable. We say that the Palestinians should get their upgrade during the 66th General Assembly, in other words, they must be recognised. We should allow the Palestinians this moment of joy, Mr Swoboda. However, I should say, whenever reference is made to 1947, that immediately afterwards, in 1948, Israel found itself under attack from all its Arab neighbours. If we achieve recognition for Palestine as a peaceful state and secure borders for the state of Israel, then this will be a reason to celebrate for the Palestinians, for the Israelis and for us here in Europe who played a constructive role, thanks to your efforts. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
).  
– Madam President, just a short question to Mr Davies. Would he concede that, on the Palestinian side, it is fair to speak of two faces as well? Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE) 
Mr President, Mr Tusk, Mr Barroso, you have been quoted, Mr Tusk, as saying that the Polish Presidency will primarily be characterised by the way it reacts to crises. It seems to me that your speech today showed that you have more than just crisis management on your agenda. You want to give Europe a direction. I believe this is a good thing, and my fellow Members on all sides of the House have emphasised this. You delivered a great speech. I would like to thank you warmly for that. You mentioned the debt crisis in Europe, calling for European solidarity. We, in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe give our emphatic backing to such solidarity. However, I would remind you of the other side of the coin. For us, this clearly means solidity. It was a lack of solidity and dubious lending policies over many years that led to this crisis. That is why our key demand is for a stability pact that genuinely has teeth. It is ironic that in 2003, the German Chancellor and the French President watered down the Stability and Growth Pact and that the present German Chancellor and French President decided while strolling on the beach in Deauville that the pact for the future should once again be toothless. Mr Tusk, do not let this discourage you! Set to work – as Mr Verhofstadt has pointed out, the direction is clear. A second area where I would encourage you to press on boldly is one of the focal points of your Presidency: progressing the common security and defence policy. You will hear some sceptical, reluctant reactions from the capitals of Europe. Do not let this discourage you. The Americans are withdrawing. We have Libya, we have Syria, Eastern Moldova and Georgia – we Europeans have a lot on our collective plate. Strengthen the European External Action Service, promote democracy and human rights, continue to develop security policy instruments and the European Defence Agency. Push for progress in the interest of Europe! There is much to be done. I wish you the best of luck. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, you have mentioned that you will be holding Quartet negotiations on 11 September and I am very pleased about that. I am equally pleased, although perhaps also a little surprised, because you are setting your sights very high. You have already clearly stated that you expect this meeting to result in a statement that will bring the Palestinians and the Israelis back to the negotiating table. You have publicly set yourself a very challenging objective and I very much hope that you achieve it. Why am I hoping for this? On the one hand, for the sake of the people in the region and, on the other, because I am concerned once more about the common foreign and security policy. Mr Sarkozy has announced that he will behave in a certain way and the German Government has said that it will do something quite different. If we then find ourselves in a situation where the Palestinians present their concerns to the General Assembly, I am again worried about the unity of the Member States on a central foreign policy question and it is you who will bear the brunt of the criticism. Therefore, I wish you every success in these Quartet negotiations. My second point is that you have said that democracy is important and that the people in the region want democracy. That is certainly true. However, I believe that we should not lose sight of the fact that what the people really want is dignity and we should focus all our attention on this issue. They want to be able to live in dignity under the rule of law, with no arbitrary confiscation of property. They want habeas corpus and they want to be free from constant threats by the secret police. They want jobs and the prospect of a positive future, so that a free trade agreement with us really will bring results. Of course, they also want democracy and the option of shaping their own political system. However, that is one part of a bigger picture. Finally, they also want peace and an end to this terrible violence. I would like to emphasise once again that we should take the measures proposed by Mr Verhofstadt here in relation to Syria. It would be very good if we could work closely together with Turkey and make genuine progress. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

Madam President, I, too, wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs De Keyser, for her excellent report. This report has a normative section and an operative section. In the normative section, we try to establish a European consensus on what, from our point of view, constitutes democracy, what it absolutely must encompass. The Council has been unable to come to such agreement for years, because the Member States have very different traditions. Nonetheless, I believe that we can all agree that what we have included in recitals C to O are clearly elements of democracy which must be taken into account when promoting democracy. The operative section deals with the instruments. What instruments are available to us? The EIDHR has been mentioned. We find that it is often too slow, too bureaucratic, too complicated and has scope for improvement. The Instrument for Stability could also be faster. The report states that we always react in an immediate and integrated manner to situations; however, it took weeks before election workers could be sent to Tunisia to provide technical assistance under the Instrument for Stability. There is still a lot of work to do here. That is why the European Endowment for Democracy is being discussed, because we want a faster, more flexible instrument. I believe – and this is important and applies to all the groups – that there are some who are more enthusiastic, while others are somewhat more reticent. We need clarification from the European External Action Service, from the Commission and from the Polish Presidency of the Council, which considers this an important project. Where are the boundaries between the instruments that we have and what a European Endowment for Democracy is supposed to do? Who does what with which instruments and when? Mr Howitt addressed the question of election observations in this context. I believe that this is very important. Please look at paragraphs 60 to 63: they contain this House’s view on election monitoring. We want stringent criteria for selecting countries; we are of the opinion that they are not always stringent enough. We want comprehensive political concepts. We want recommendations to be followed-up. I think these are some of the points that need to be highlighted. What happens next? This report contains numerous calls for action, by the EEAS and by Parliament. How can we make sanctions more effective? How can we make the instruments more effective? What are we doing for women and democracy, for gender equality? What are we doing in the EEAS delegations across the world? There are numerous calls for action to be drawn from this report. Let us get to work. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff,

Mr President, Prime Minister, President of the Commission, my group is of the view that the Hungarian Presidency has achieved some truly important successes. This was a difficult presidency, with the financial crisis, Fukushima and the developments in North Africa. We have your government to thank, Mr Orbán – particularly your foreign minister, Mr Martonyi, who is sitting alongside you, and also your Minister of State for EU Affairs, Mrs Győri – for the fact that really outstanding work has been done here. This is particularly true as regards economic policy. What has been achieved in terms of stabilising the euro has undoubtedly been a great success, although it remains an important task. The adoption of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and also the Treaty establishing the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) – these are great and important achievements. The implementation of the first European Semester, the coordination of Member States’ budgetary policy – this is progress par excellence
 when it comes to preventing the indebtedness that has been commonplace in the past. There is one outstanding matter, which you yourself have mentioned: the so-called ‘six pack’ – the economic governance package. Our group will insist on this and we will continue to insist that we strengthen the Stability and Growth Pact, and consequently we will also stand firm on the issue of the reversed qualified majority. I believe it was right to postpone the decision for the time being and to continue the negotiations. Joseph Daul has said here that we need a convincing economic policy package if we are to have a stable euro. We feel that the Stability and Growth Pact is key to this. It needs teeth, and that is why the negotiations should continue. There are a few other policy areas in which you were very successful during your Presidency. Croatia has been mentioned, and the conclusion of the accession negotiations. I can only endorse what Mr Swoboda has already said: this is a most significant step forward for the whole region. After three years, the directive on consumer rights has at last been finalised. Progress has been made on the energy efficiency plan. One further very important matter from our point of view, and also in the view of Europe’s small and medium-sized enterprises, is the European patent, which President Barroso has just mentioned. A whole raft of really noteworthy successes achieved under your Presidency. Prime Minister, when we met in Budapest we said to you that we would assess your Presidency fairly, but that naturally we would also look at what is going on in your country. From the point of view of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, we regret that your Presidency has been overshadowed by the controversy surrounding the media law. We would have liked to have seen a different media law. Although the Commission brought about some amendments, to our way of thinking these were not in the key areas. We would also like to have seen the Constitution being drawn up by the process proposed by the Venice Commission. I believe that this watchfulness of each Member State – including my own, by the way – by the rest of Europe must continue if the European Union is to make progress. Freedom dies little by little – whether it is freedom of the press or freedom to travel. In a quarter of an hour customs officers will take up their places on the German-Danish and Danish-Swedish borders in order to reintroduce border controls. That is a development against which we might have wished the Presidency to have spoken out more strongly. This whole area – freedom to travel, asylum policy, revision of the Dublin II Regulation, the attack on the freedom to travel within the Schengen area – is where we would have liked to have seen greater commitment from your Presidency. Overall your Presidency has been a successful one, but we would have preferred it not to have been overshadowed by the criticisms that I have mentioned. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Madam President, Mr Weber’s motion makes good sense. We have completed a truly enormous programme with some major, significant reports. We now no longer have any legislative reports to vote on. It is already after half past one. It would be best to postpone the non-legislative reports to the July part-session. This would be no great loss. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, following the confidence vote yesterday in Athens with the result that we are all aware of, the Bild
 newspaper in Germany printed the headline ‘Greek leader has survived – Europe can breathe a sigh of relief’. I have to say that I was also pleased with the result of this vote, but I think it is far too early to breathe a sigh of relief. This is because we now need to put the substantial austerity package successfully in place in the next week. That is the next big test. Even then, we will be a long way from being able to breathe a sigh of relief. Further steps and measures will still need to be taken before this crisis is overcome. I believe that what has been said here is right. The people in Greece need a light at the end of the tunnel. However, I would also like to make it quite clear that the people in the countries from which most of the aid is coming also need a light at the end of the tunnel. They have the feeling that they are giving and giving and giving and there is no end to it. In Greece the people have the feeling that they are saving and saving and saving and there is no end to it. That is why a growth strategy is so important. That is why privatisations are crucial to break open and liberalise this encrusted economy. That is why it is right for us resolutely to promote and support the reduction of public debt in Greece. Democracy has to endorse this. What is happening with respect to Mr Samaras is totally irresponsible. However, it is right for us to give guarantees for investments, for example. It is also right for us to draw out unused EU funds, Mr Barroso, and make them available to Greece, because ultimately it will not only be Greece but the whole of Europe that will benefit from more growth. If we look ahead slightly, one thing is also important: the Stability and Growth Pact must be strengthened. We must prevent future crises. This is where this reverse qualified majority comes in. No ordinary citizen will understand what that actually means. To put it plainly, either the Stability and Growth Pact has this strange technical element that I have just mentioned, and then the Stability and Growth Pact will have teeth, or else it does not. Then we will not be able to support this package. Reverse qualified majority voting in the preventive phase of the Stability and Growth Pact is absolutely essential as far as we are concerned. Mr Barroso, I am extremely pleased to hear you explain once again that the Commission is of exactly the same opinion. I would like to see substantial support for this project from this House. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Madam President, it is hardly conceivable that our relations with Russia are based on an agreement dating from 1994. We have not succeeded in resolving anything new since then. We alternate between cooperation and confrontation with Russia. Where the neighbourhood is concerned, we deplore the war with Georgia, the pressure brought to bear on Ukraine, the recognition of President Lukashenko in Belarus and the split in the Republic of Moldova as a result of the conflict in Transnistria. At the same time, our cooperation with Russia in the Security Council on the issue of Libya or on Iran’s nuclear programme is pleasing. As regards Russia itself, the new paradigm is what is known as the Partnership for Modernisation. Yet what is modernity without democracy? In the list of priorities that you have just given, Commissioner Füle, human rights came after cucumbers and the rule of law after tomatoes. Is that the best we can expect in this area? Do we expect nothing more of Russia’s democratisation? I believe that as Parliament, we must make it clear that we do expect something; for example, fair elections – there must be progress there. There is, though, one thing that I would like to say quite clearly: such progress is often to be achieved at expert level. Two summits a year is too much. Let us have one summit, as we do with America. We have enough exchange with Russia in the specialist areas. Otherwise, we will have summits with no real content, and that would not be good either. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Madam President, Baroness Ashton, we are still a long way from a common foreign policy which is really worthy of the name. You are being criticised for this, but it sometimes seems to me that you have been made the scapegoat in a situation which is outside your control and which is caused by the fact that the Member States do not have the political will to agree on a common approach. Let us take the example of Libya. First of all, Italy blocked the imposition of sanctions, then France recognised the transitional council in Benghazi without any consultation and, finally, Germany abstained during the vote on the resolution in the UN Security Council. There is nothing you can do to change this, but it gives Europe a negative image. In Syria, we should have imposed stronger sanctions, but here, we also needed unanimity. There are some Member States – Greece, Italy and Spain have been mentioned in the press and Germany may also be one of them – which are opposed to this. In this case, you must stand up here and say: ‘We have only been able to put 13 on the list’. The need for unanimity is paralysing us. It no longer works with 27 Member States. We must make the next quantum leap forward in our common foreign and security policy. I would like to make this quite clear to Mr Tannock and his Tory friends. What can you do? Make public the fact that European cooperation has failed and identify who is responsible. Make use of the community instruments, in particular, to promote democracy. I was surprised to hear you speaking here so openly about the European Endowment for Democracy. We are in the process of drawing up a report on the subject with Mrs De Keyser as the rapporteur and we are evaluating what the requirements are. I must make it quite clear that we do not want a second European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR), which is bureaucratic, slow, over-complex and unpolitical. We need a solution that is unbureaucratic, fast, simple and political. If you can bring this about, you will have our full support. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Madam President, Mr Le Hyaric, I see things in exactly the same way as you do. The unity between Hamas and Fatah really is an historical step forward. It may now perhaps be possible to make progress in the process of reconciliation between the Palestinians and the Israelis. Baroness Ashton has made it very clear that the second flotilla will be a completely unnecessary provocation which could harm this process. Would you and your group now distance yourself from your support for this flotilla in the same way as happened yesterday here in Parliament with the substantial involvement of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left? Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, spring has arrived in the Mediterranean, but in the Gulf and in Syria, winter still reigns. The images of violence which we are seeing are horrifying. Several hundred people have been killed and Amnesty International and the United Nations have produced alarming reports. The calls which the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are making are clear. We want a special session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva to be held as quickly as possible. The Council of Europe and the Member States of the European Union which are represented on the UN Human Rights Council should take up this call. The UN Council is always very quick to act when it comes to taking one side in the Middle East conflict. It is now time for it to face the real challenge presented by these extreme violations of human rights. We need reform, we need a move to democracy, and we need an arms embargo. All of these things have already been mentioned here. I watched the speech made by President Assad of Syria live. This is a medieval-style dictatorship which uses western PR agencies to present its representatives as pseudo-modernising influences in glossy magazines. The agencies and the magazines should be asking themselves whether this is really the right thing to do. Now to Yemen. This is where there is, in my opinion, the greatest danger: the risk of a split between north and south, an active al-Qaeda cell and the danger of a failed state. We already have a failed state of this kind in the case of Somalia and our Atalanta mission is in operation in the Gulf of Aden. Europe has a direct interest in the area and we need to hear more than what the representative of the Council has said here today. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, it has been said here that it is not the euro that is in crisis, but the Member States that have got into debt. That is the nub of the crisis – irresponsible indebtedness that has been carried on for many years. That is what we must now stop. That is why it is right that the European Stability Mechanism must be strict. That is also why it is right that this has been the case in the bail-outs that have taken place. That is also why it is right that Ireland is not given an interest rate reduction. This indebtedness must end. Once again I am hearing the social democrats talk of a distinction between good and bad debt. Of course investment is different to consumption, but at some point too much good debt becomes bad debt too. We need to be fair to future generations, we need sustainable public finances – and then the euro will become stable again. The pact for the euro involves too little Community method. That has been said here, and quite rightly so. I share this view. I would like to say a final word about Libya. The Council has supported resolution 1973. We must now look to the future. I agree with Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra when he says that France has played a very good role. However, had Turkey been invited to the Elysée summit then we would not be having these problems in NATO and the situation would be considerably easier for us all. Moreover, I hope that the newly appointed head of the transitional government in Libya will soon be visiting us here in Europe. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, we have been addressed specifically here. Of course, we have confidence in Commissioner Kroes’s work. Her examination of the secondary law was exemplary. We wish the Commissioner examining the primary law had done her work in the same way, as this is where the problem lies. (Applause from the left)
 The reality of the situation includes those things just mentioned by Mr Swoboda, namely that, in the opinion of both the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the amendments are inadequate. Hungary’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Public Administration and Justice, Mr Navracsics, has himself admitted that this was not a significant amendment of the media law. I could mention the protection of journalistic sources, which still remains unregulated, or the composition and powers of the media authority. All of these are matters that still need to be discussed. I would therefore like to state, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, that we will not withdraw the motion for a resolution, but rather request that the vote take place. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, this debate here in the European Parliament makes one thing clear, and that is that we are not neutral when it comes to this conflict. We are on the side of the democratic revolution. Gaddafi must go and Europe must play an active role in bringing that about. There is a sharing of the workload here at the international level. We are discussing a no-fly zone, something for which – as Mr Schulz correctly identified – the backing of the UN Security Council is required. What do we do if Moscow and Beijing do not grant their assent? Well, then we would have to close this loophole in international law. We would have to take on the responsibility of protecting the unarmed population regardless, with the aid of the Arab League and the African Union, but also with the aid of an active role on the part of the European Union. Military implementation would then be the responsibility of NATO and its partners, but politically and economically, the European Union would continue to also have the key role to play, long after, in such a scenario, NATO and the United Nations had finished playing their major roles. There is one thing that I would like to say quite clearly, and that is that I was very pleased, Mr Schulz, to hear you say that we need a free trade zone. This is because, if we do not allow these people’s products into the EU, they will continue to come across the Mediterranean in coracles and in their masses to overwhelm Lampedusa. We certainly do not want that. Let us, therefore, create the free trade zone, let us allow the products into the EU, so that the people there also have an economic future in their democratised countries. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
).

 Mr President, the contrast is striking! The revolution, the change taking place in the Arab world is fascinating for all of us. We are trying to help. We have discussed Libya today. In recent days and weeks, we have discussed Egypt and Tunisia. Yet, at the same time, we have a standstill in the peace process. Against this backdrop, we must say quite clearly here, Baroness Ashton, that you did us a service when you managed to convene a meeting of the Quartet. To produce movement now, at this period of profound insecurity in the region, and profound insecurity in Israel, was an extremely positive service. I should like to make this very clear. You occasionally have to endure criticism from this House, too. For this reason, some praise is perhaps also in order. As far as the contents are concerned, I should like to make it clear that I do not believe that Israel is sceptically disposed towards democracy in Arab countries. It is merely that these changes have not yet come to an end. When and if there are democracies there, I agree completely with Mr Pöttering and with you too, Mr Swoboda, then there will clearly be a great opportunity finally to get the Middle East peace process going too. Settlement building must stop, that is clear in any case, as must the sophistry with which it is defended. There is a consensus among all groups in this House on that point. Connected to the uprising in the Arab world, we also have experienced protests against the Hamas regime in the Gaza Strip. The situation in the Palestinian Territories is in no way simple. Democratisation must succeed here too. For the time being, we fortunately have a moderate and conservative partner in the West Bank, but that is absolutely not the case in the Gaza Strip. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

Madam President, Mr Füle has just made it completely clear that Turkey and the European Union need one another. We are important neighbours, we are allies in NATO, and many people of Turkish origin live in Member States of the European Union. We must show respect for one another. I very much support visa facilitation for businesspeople and students, just as you have said. I am also in favour of integrating Turkey much more closely into the structures of the common security and defence policy. I would like to see Cyprus bringing an end to its blockade in this area. When we look at North Africa, it is clear that Turkey is a role model for many countries in the region. All of this is very good. Then we come to the accession process and we find that many chapters are blocked. It is extremely difficult to open new chapters. There are only three chapters left and the competition chapter is almost at the stage of opening. What will happen when the last chapters are opened? Will Turkey and the European Union no longer have anything to say to one another? That surely cannot be the case! Therefore, we must consider very carefully how to progress with the accession process and whether or not we can retain the current procedure, which involves Parliament commenting on the Commission’s progress report by means of a resolution. Our 2010 report is highly critical, but also constructive. It deals with fundamental rights which are self-evident, particularly for Liberals: freedom of the press, freedom of speech, expression and assembly, student demonstrations, trade union rights and freedom of religion. For years, we have been calling for improvements in freedom of religion, but far too little progress has been made. The arrest of Ahmet Şık and Nedim Şener and the interference in the work of political foundations in Turkey are giving us great cause for concern. This is covered by the first Copenhagen criterion. It is a central issue, because it is the political criterion. If Turkey cannot move forward with its internal democratic constitution, I believe that we will still have serious problems in some areas, quite apart from the deadlock in the Council. In diplomatic terms, we need Turkey and Turkey also needs us. In democratic terms, there is still a great deal to be done in Turkey. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, the Treaty of Lisbon makes new demands of European Union foreign policy and development policy. One has been mentioned here: coherence. In other words, our various instruments, the European External Action Service, the European Investment Bank and the Commission must act in a consistent manner. The Treaty of Lisbon also provides for greater parliamentary control, greater transparency and joint decisions on these matters. All of this will enhance the quality of the debate on foreign policy, particularly if we have greater transparency as a result of the participation of the relevant committees – primarily the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Development – in this House. One result of this transparency is that this Parliament has resolved to remove Belarus from the list of countries in which the European Investment Act can act without first having another debate here in this House. Are human rights being respected? Have opposition politicians been released? Does the state respect the property of its citizens? Is there freedom of the press? Are entrepreneurs able to act freely? Are there free trade unions? In our relationship with such an important neighbour – one which is located directly on the border of the European Union – these are all matters which need to be debated first, before the European Investment Bank becomes active there. I am very pleased that the House has taken up this suggestion and I call on the Council to do the same. Yesterday we had a debate on Egypt. We debated the instruments and what we could do. Baroness Ashton called for the ceiling applied to the European Investment Bank to be raised. Parliament is happy to pursue this. We need to improve how we work together with Egypt and Tunisia, with North Africa. That is only right. It is also a good example of how this Parliament can react quickly. The same is now required of the Council, which must act accordingly. I believe that our foreign policy instruments, especially if they are market-oriented, together with the loans from the European Investment Bank can do a lot to assist with development and economic growth in North Africa. That is precisely what is needed. If there is growth there, if there is democracy there, then we will also have fewer migrants arriving at our borders. If I may specifically address our fellow Members from the extreme right, I would like to say that your arguments are really far too rudimentary and simplistic – if not primitive. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the course of a revolution is seldom predictable. That was the case with the American and the French revolutions, as well as the major revolution in Europe in 1989/91. It is important for us to be clear about one thing: this is and remains the Egyptian revolution. It is not a European revolution that we would be able to steer. Instead, what Baroness Ashton is doing there is right, namely to listen and not to try to dictate events there as Europe would wish. However, one thing is key: there should not only be an election in Egypt in August, the Egyptians must have a genuine election. It is good that the Muslim Brotherhood has involved itself in the process to amend the constitution, has founded a party and will take part in elections. However, the secular powers must be equally involved so that the Egyptians will have a genuine election in this revolution for freedom. I would like to say a few words about adaptation of the instruments. That is jargon and hardly anyone understands what it means. What does it mean? Firstly, it means providing more money to enable the European Investment Bank to do something. But what else does it mean? We need a European foundation for democracy to enable us, in future, to work more efficiently, more quickly and more democratically with these civil societies. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
).

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, I would ask you to be more courageous. Go to Cairo before the Council of Foreign Ministers. Speak with the government representatives and with the opposition there. Come back to Brussels and tell your colleagues what you have seen and heard. Set the agenda and do not listen to 27 different opinions, with which it is then very difficult to actually do anything. When Mr Mingarelli goes to Tunisia – something that I view very positively – inform us so that we are aware and so that the public is aware that Europe has a presence there. I first found out that the American was there and only then did I hear that Mr Mingarelli was also there. You are the foreign minister for Europe and I would earnestly advise you, on the one hand, to be our foreign minister. On the other hand, as foreign minister for Europe, you must not jump through every hoop that people put in front of you. Comparisons have been made here today with 1989, and I think that is right. I believe that Tahrir Square in Cairo in 2011 is equivalent to Alexanderplatz in Berlin in 1989. A revolution is taking place there. However, if we recall the revolution of 1989 for a moment we will remember that we had the same dilemma then. We wanted freedom, stability and democracy, and we overlook the fact that this process, the transition from a stable dictatorship to a democracy, is rarely peaceful, orderly and stable. From this point of view, diplomacy, organisation and caution also have their place. That should not distract us from the fact that we are extremely pleased about this revolution. It is a revolution against the dictatorship and for freedom. I do believe that Europe can dictate the setup in these countries. However, our joy needs to be apparent, but one thing is also clear, and that is that, even with limited influence, it will certainly not be possible to build a state with Mr Mubarek. With the violence today in Tahrir Square, the last vestige of legitimacy for this ruler in Egypt has been lost. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Madam President, Mr Orbán, in an article which appeared yesterday in a major German newspaper, you cited Otto Graf Lambsdorff as one of your role models. We last met at his funeral service in December 2009. You attended as a private individual and we very much appreciated that. I would like to ask you to honour his memory by respecting, following and defending the principles of the liberal constitutional state in all the measures that you take. You have responded to the criticism of the media law with two arguments. You have said that this is a campaign against Hungary and against you personally and that the campaign is unspecific. I would like to make it very clear on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe that this is not a campaign. It is an issue for Europe if fundamental freedoms are interfered with and called into question in a Member State of the European Union. I would like to say to the Commission and to Mr Barroso that a legal assessment must be carried out by Mrs Kroes. However, the Commission is not just a solicitor’s office; it is also a political body. The assessment must take a political form and it must be completed quickly. Your second argument is that the criticism is unspecific. Mr Orbán, I would like to make a few specific points: slander, defamation and incitement to hatred are against the law in Germany and in other democracies. That is what the criminal law is there for. Please let the criminal law take effect in this case. You need to improve the legal protection in Article 163, change the composition and the powers of the media authority in Articles 123 and 183, together with a great deal of other things. There are many specific points. I suggest that you postpone the application of the law until the Commission’s assessment has been carried out and this must be done as quickly as possible. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, there is one thing that it is important for citizens, too, to understand: the European Union is not in debt. We are talking here about a debt crisis in our Member States. The European Union is the only political level in Europe that is debt free. I would also like it to remain that way. However, we are joined together in a shared destiny by the euro. In this regard, Mrs Harms and Mr Schulz rightly lamented the lack of European spirit. Deauville was a mistake. Germany and France have been blackmailed by the United Kingdom. The Commission must impose the sanctions, not the finance ministers. Mr Van Rompuy, the automatic nature of the sanctions during the preventive phase was sacrificed in Deauville. The finance ministers must take the decision again here. These are the ones who were previously responsible for triggering the financial crisis and the debt crisis in the Member States. What is economic governance? Everyone is talking about economic governance, but what does it actually mean in specific terms? Do we really want the European Union to interfere in the details of our labour market and social policy? There is a big question mark here. Setting the legal framework for entrepreneurship, stimulating growth, they are all well and good, but above all putting public finances in order once again in the Member States – that is the challenge. That is why the European Semester is so important, and that is why it must be implemented. (

 Mr President, of course I am happy to answer that. Mr Schulz is, of course, also a member of the Bureau of the Social Democratic Party of Germany and will also occasionally make statements here which are probably not entirely congruent. There is, however, one thing I would like to say, and it is that, if Mr Schulz can show me who from the FDP was present in Deauville, I would be grateful to him. We made a relatively clear statement on this at the end of the summit. I believe that the key point, namely actually relinquishing the automatic nature of the sanctions in the preventive phase, was criticised by us in no uncertain terms. If we get the change to the treaty, this will be rectified retrospectively. However, the decision made in Deauville was clearly a mistake. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, the European External Action Service is one of the most important decisions in the Treaty of Lisbon. It is now only six weeks until Baroness Ashton will no longer primarily be the Minister responsible for establishing an EU foreign ministry; she will instead be the Foreign Minister for Europe, and that is a good thing. This will commence on 1 December and we wish you every success in this regard. We have had many debates and we have achieved a great deal. It was a fruitful political battle. The lack of democracy associated with the old common foreign and security policy has been eliminated, there is a greater degree of accountability and the quality of the public debate has improved. There will be more stringent budgetary control, the prerequisites for a genuine team spirit have been created and national diplomats can, if they so wish, remain in the European External Action Service. There will be no geographical quotas – you could sometimes get the impression that this is the most important issue here, but it most definitely is not. Germany, in particular, would benefit greatly from a quota, but I am nevertheless against this. A common form of training will be provided. I believe that the prerequisites for a successful EEAS are in place. In other words, the European Parliament is almost happy. We would be really happy if you were now to take advantage of the opportunity and actually establish the appropriate structure for conflict prevention and crisis management that has been promised. Then we would have European added value right from the start. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, this, of course, was a European Council meeting that focused, among other things, on foreign policy. At almost the same time, in the United Nations General Assembly, China and numerous developing countries voted against granting special status to you, Mr Van Rompuy, and also to Baroness Ashton. This ought to be addressed with China at the summit on 6 October and it needs to be discussed in no uncertain terms. However, it demonstrates quite clearly the reality of the situation: the European Union still has a long way to go to achieve political power. We are currently an economic power and, for that reason, citizens expect us to do something in this area to combat the economic crisis. That brings me to the task force. Mr Van Rompuy, you said there was broad consensus. At the end of the month, this consensus will be put to the test. On 29 September, the Commission will present its documents. You have already said that you will present a draft on 27 September. I hope that these will be in line with each other to some extent. Incidentally, I would recommend that you speak Dutch more often; I very much enjoyed your statement on the Community method. As regards macro-economic surveillance, there is apparently consensus in the task force – great! Monitoring of national fiscal policies within the European Semester – that is a good thing and something that we expressly welcome. As regards the sanctions, you say that more work is needed. We all know what that means: there is no consensus. The test will therefore come at the end of the month. Why, as Parliament, do we insist so strongly on the Community method? Mr Schulz has just mentioned this. We are still in the process of weighing up the Lisbon machinery. However, the crucial point is this: the European Council is now a European Union body. What that means in terms of its understanding of itself, we do not yet know exactly. If often appears to us to be a gathering of Member States representing only their national interests. One national interest is very clear: that of the United Kingdom, which is to have as little regulation as possible in the financial sector. The Community method represents our only chance of getting the interests of Europe as a whole to prevail over individual national interests. That is why this House insists on the application of the Community method. In light of your Dutch statements, I am pleased that you view this in the same way. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mr Hughes, we have worked together before and I have high regard for your work. However, in your analysis of the economic crisis and of the measures that are now to be taken, you are seriously wide of the mark, just like the majority of your group. Would you not agree that it was excessive debt – in other words, too much expenditure in pursuing so-called policy objectives – that triggered the current crisis? Would you not also agree that, for that reason, precisely the right thing to do now is to focus on stability and a sound fiscal policy in order to overcome this crisis? Holger Krahmer  (ALDE

 Madam President, a comment on the Rules of Procedure: where are the Greens when environmental associations organise exhibitions in Parliament and confront elected MEPs with the words ‘we are the voice of the citizens’? I sometimes get the feeling that the Greens only accept democracy if the arguments suit them. Holger Krahmer  (ALDE

blue-card question
. – (DE)
 Mr President, Ms Lepage, are you therefore willing to accept that it is a question of physics rather than a lobbying question; that if you burn gas more efficiently than coal, there are fewer CO2 
emissions than with coal-based power generation? This means, for example, that if we ultimately shut down our coal-fired power stations in Europe – a development that is already taking place in the United States – and bring gas-fired power stations on stream, CO2 
emissions will fall. That is my question. My second question, which follows on from the first, is as follows: are you willing to accept that mining less coal possibly also has less of an impact on the environment than shale gas exploration may have, in other words that coal mining has a greater environmental impact than shale gas exploration?

Mr President, Ms Wils, my question is along exactly the same lines: what impression do you have of freely elected MEPs – to think that we are at the beck and call of industry interests, that we are not smart enough to form our own opinion and that we need exhibitions and lobbying before acting as stooges for some lobby or other? Why do you assume that Parliament is being overrun by the interests of lobbyists? Why do you not assume that there can be a fair and open debate on all issues, particularly in connection with the environment, climate and energy? Holger Krahmer  (ALDE

 – (DE) 
Mr President, Mr Groote, there is no technology without risks! The perfect energy generation technology does not exist. I believe the same applies to what we are discussing here today. I am very much in favour of a rational discussion. What we are currently experiencing is a new arrival on the energy markets in the form of unconventional resources, applying mainly to gas, but also to oil. It is neither appropriate to get carried away with euphoria about the great future of gas, nor, as some of my colleagues from the Greens and Left have done here, to paint a picture of terrifying scenarios which bear absolutely no resemblance to reality. I think we should bear in mind that these unconventional resources have the potential to change all the familiar energy supply relationships between suppliers and consumers, and that economic efficiency calculations for existing energy sources are also called into question. We should face up to this development. We should acknowledge that it could also be an opportunity for Europe and not only a risk, and we should prepare ourselves to take up and use new technologies in a positive way, to weigh up opportunities and risks fairly and not to fall into ideological debates. Holger Krahmer,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.

Mr President, my role in this great financial market regulation process is limited to the issue of the extent to which industry is affected by financial market regulation – here I speak on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy – since there is a need for financial market regulation, which we are addressing with this directive and regulation package. However, there is a lot of activism involved in financial market regulation and the Commission’s first proposal on the subject would simply have led, through questions of definition and interpretation, to companies in the real economy – here I am thinking of smaller industrial enterprises such as German public utility companies and agricultural cooperatives – suddenly being treated like banks, for example when they hedge delivery relationships with suppliers and customers on the futures markets. This would have been the collateral damage of financial market regulation and would have been in no one’s interest. In my view it is clear that industrial companies must be treated differently to banks. The majority of futures transactions made by these companies are for hedging purposes, not speculation. Even where these transactions do involve speculation, it must be said that I do not know of a single industrial company or energy supplier that is of systemic importance. The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy was very clear in its opinion on this subject and I must say that I am pleased that these aspects managed to appear in the final package. To that extent, in the end we certainly did well to include this ancillary aspect. Holger Krahmer,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, firstly, I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur. We have recently enjoyed very constructive cooperation on this subject in particular. The result that we have before us today is a compromise, and it is in the nature of compromise that everyone is both satisfied and dissatisfied with it at the same time. Overall, it is a step in the right direction when it comes to the quality of marine fuels in the European Union. We have been making policy on air quality in other areas for years and, in my opinion, we often overshoot the mark and pass measures that are not particularly efficient. In this case, we are on the right track. Nonetheless, I have certain objections here. In reaching agreement so quickly at first reading, we have disregarded some of the arguments and concerns of some players in Europe’s internal market. In 2015 at the latest, when it becomes compulsory to use what are, in fact, sulphur-free fuels in the Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs), which is essentially in the North Sea and the Baltic, there may be consequences of this legislation that can already be foreseen today but which, at the end of the day, we are completely ignoring. It cannot be in the interests of this legislation if more expensive fuel for goods transport by ferry in the North Sea and Baltic results in goods vehicles turning around at the ferry ports and going by road instead, where this is a possible alternative to short sea crossings. We have given no thought to that, and it was not considered when the Marpol Convention was concluded either. We have simply disregarded this argument. Consequently, I fear that we will have to look at this situation again in the northern regions in two years’ time. I think it is important to harmonise things in Europe, but we also have to be clear that this cannot happen at the very highest level. I can quite understand some of the arguments from southern Member States, particularly those bordering the Mediterranean, which are dubious about this idea and feel that they have other priorities than the introduction of sulphur-free fuel. It costs money, and you can only ever spend your budget resources once. Consequently, I see this as a step in the right direction but, in the end, unequal competition within the EU has been written into the legislation here. My final point is that compensating Northern Europeans for their hardships by means of State aid cannot be the way to go since, in the end, this would distort competition between the countries of Northern Europe. Some countries will pay, while others will not. Holger Krahmer  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I, too, would like to thank Mr Gerbrandy for the sound piece of work that he has presented here. I can also support much of what is in the report. I consider it a good thing that we are making the effort to say that we have to overcome the obstacles in the internal market when it comes to removing barriers to the exploitation of resources and the exchange of resources. I also feel, however, that a lot of things that have been said here are not quite correct. I feel I must briefly mention these. Jan, the price of copper is not going up because copper is becoming more scarce, neither are the costs of raw materials at AkzoNobel and Unilever going up because the raw materials are becoming scarcer. Instead, it is because we are printing so much money, and because a lot of money is looking for safe investments and increasingly it does not find these in government bonds – which is why much of it is ending up in the commodity markets. That is one reason why prices of raw materials are rising; not so much because we are about to completely run out of some raw materials and they will no longer be available. I think we need to look more carefully at the causes here. It generally has little to do with a scarcity of resources. There are two things in the report that I find hard to stomach and that I consider to be sending out completely the wrong signals. The first is the call to extend the scope of the Ecodesign Directive. We should stick with the principle that we will find the best solutions through competition and not by political edict – we have already heard the term ‘eco-diktat’ used in this context. The second point is that we in Europe, which is no longer growing and is facing catastrophic developments, should call for new taxes in order to manage our resources.

 That is a matter of political judgment. I would simply remind you that the central bank – this has nothing to do with this debate, but I have been asked the question so I must answer it – printed EUR 1 billion in the months of December and February in order to ease liquidity bottlenecks in the countries of southern Europe. In my opinion, it is apparent that we are on the way to losing price stability. I also think that this policy risks exacerbating the situation in the commodity markets, because a lot of money is flowing into precious metals and commodities there, since some investors see them as safe havens or want to make speculative transactions there too. Holger Krahmer  (ALDE
).

 Mr President, Mr Davies is aware that I am a fundamental opponent of the plan we are about to decide on. Political plans – particularly ones with very long-term goals – have always existed. These plans always had one thing in common: they were superseded by reality. The fact is that it makes absolutely no sense to plan how the world will be in 2050. This presumes too much knowledge. A great many things are bound to happen to us before then that we have not planned and that we cannot know or predict. The targets we set ourselves are, in the final analysis, arbitrary. We find ourselves comparing years and percentages that actually only have one constant feature, namely that they end in zero. Their relevance in terms of climate cannot really be explained in objective terms. We could just as easily deduct five years from the dates or add 5% to the percentage points. This would be just as arbitrary, but a little more ambitious. Why do we not do this? I would suggest that any of us still alive in 2050 should meet once again as venerable ladies and gentlemen to discuss the reality of these plans as part of a night’s entertainment. I have the feeling that would make a very entertaining evening indeed. It is also high time that we realised that European climate policy is a failure in global terms. Our pioneering role is not accepted and no one pays much attention to our standards. I would simply remind you of the inclusion of the aviation industry in emissions trading. We must take a much more reasonable approach. We will only achieve success in climate policy if the rest of the world comes on board. (Applause) Holger Krahmer  (ALDE

 Mr President, I believe that our decision today marks a black day for the European internal market. We are giving up on the concept of the internal market as a result of what is simply a reflex opposition to technology. This is obviously the latest fashion in the EU. We have criticised Denmark today for wanting to leave the Schengen Agreement for populist reasons. Essentially, we are now behaving in the same way. We must be fully aware of what we are doing. We are allowing the European Food Safety Authority to continue authorising genetically modified organisms (GMOs) on the internal market, but, at the same time, we are giving the Member States the legal means to deviate from these authorisation criteria. I hope that this will not set a precedent for other internal market decisions which are due to be made in future. We should pull ourselves together at this point and remember that we must not give up on the European idea at every opportunity. Holger Krahmer,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, in the discussion about whether or not it is sensible to come to an agreement during the first reading, we should not stick as closely to our principles as some Members have recommended. This should depend on the dossier. How are the discussions going? How controversial are they? In the case of the regulation of CO2
 emissions from light commercial vehicles, it is clear that the positions of the institutions were not very far apart. Therefore, it would not have been worthwhile to start the second reading process, except in the case of an issue which is the subject of heated discussions, in other words, the long-term target. The European Commission has never explained properly and it is also not clear from the impact assessments how a reduction in emissions from 203 grams today to 135 grams within 10 years – these are the figures just mentioned by Mrs Hedegaard – can be implemented in an economically viable way. This represents a cut of 34% and goes far beyond our other climate targets. Parliament’s most important job was to bring this target back to reality and to make it feasible in economic terms. This is what we have done. I am pleased that Mr Groote took up my argument, because a fleet average of 147 grams is a long way from what the Commission originally proposed, but it is also by far the most ambitious target set anywhere in the world. We should not try to persuade ourselves that a CO2
 limit for light commercial vehicles will save the world’s climate. I would like to thank everyone, including the rapporteurs, for their hard work. I am pleased that we have achieved a large majority for this compromise. Holger Krahmer,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

Madam President, Europe is rightly regarded as having the safest medicines in the world. With this legislation, which we have been discussing for a long time, for two years I believe, we will further improve levels of safety. I would like to thank Mrs Matias very much for taking on such a complex report as a new Member of Parliament. This was a huge task and she has done very well. It also involved a great deal of teamwork and I would like to thank everyone involved for this. We have produced some very good results. However, we must not lose sight of the fact that we can never achieve complete safety by means of regulations. This is true in every area, not just in the case of medicines. We have rightly concentrated on the essential issues, on the distinctions between different types of packaging and on traceability in the distribution chain. By differentiating between prescription and over-the-counter medicines, we are taking the right approach, because we must remember that every piece of legislation and every attempt to make products safer costs money. Therefore, it is reasonable not to include every pack of aspirins or every over-the-counter medicine automatically right from the start. Instead, the Commission or the agency must be given the task of monitoring the market and investigating developments. I believe that we can be proud of what we have achieved. We have produced a piece of legislation that brings real benefits. Most patients will probably not be aware that they are the result of EU law and, therefore, we must make this very clear.

 In overall terms, the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament supports the waste disposal directive. However, the subject of photovoltaic modules remains a problem. There is no understandable reason for excluding the entire sector from the regulations. We have a wide range of legislation governing waste streams. Therefore, it is not clear why a complete industry, which is expected to produce significant waste streams, is being exempted. For this reason, some of the FDP Members of the European Parliament have abstained from voting on the report. Holger Krahmer,

 Madam President, Commissioner, with this directive, we have before us legislation that has come about surprisingly quickly. I am very surprised that we have reached a compromise already which I and my group – and I expressly underline that – consider acceptable. When all is said and done, this piece of legislation has had a very difficult passage through Parliament. We expanded its scope, only to restrict it again straight away. We have quite incidentally attempted to declare certain substances highly dangerous; perhaps we should ask ourselves whether this legislation is really the right forum for such a debate. Personally, I did not think it a good idea to include PVC and nanomaterials in a directive on ‘hazardous substances’. I therefore think it sensible that this is no longer the case in the compromise. The previous speaker has just said so already, but it really is remarkable that we consider each gram of polluting substances so carefully and are then sometimes very irrational in our debates. Apparently, there are industries in Europe which we are ring-fencing for political reasons. This seems to be the case for enterprises in the renewable energy sector. The fact that we instantly exempt them completely from the scope of this legislation by saying that we have to put up with environmental pollution for the sake of climate protection and our objectives in the area of renewable energy is incomprehensible. It does not add up. I only hope that we do not do the same thing in the case of electronic waste – the decision on which is also imminent here – because that would be even more astonishing. Holger Krahmer  (ALDE

 – (DE)
 Mr President, it is good that we are looking at biocides, because they are hazardous, toxic substances. However, I am wondering why we do not base every piece of chemical legislation that we implement on the same system as that of REACH. We have passed the most comprehensive piece of chemical legislation in the world. The principles have been laid down: collect the data, evaluate it, authorise the product. Why are we using a different system for subsequent chemical legislation and defining new exclusion criteria, which ultimately also results in chemicals that we need and that, in some cases, do not have alternatives, being withdrawn from the market? I think that we will end up in a blind alley if we draw up our policy on chemicals purely from the perspective of toxic substances. Pest infestations can be much more dangerous, in particular, for small children because of the risks of disease transmission, than the few milligrams of biocides which we use to combat them. I would like to see the situation being put into proportion and, most importantly, I would like to see regulations that can be used not only by large companies which have the resources to enter into a discussion with the authorisation bodies, but also by smaller companies which supply useful products for niche markets. Holger Krahmer,

 Madam President, I regret to say that we are debating a failed strategy here. Even at the time we adopted the directive, some voices of warning could already be heard asking whether including third countries in emissions trading without any consultation had really been thought through. Even today, we are ignoring the international situation. We imagine that we only have to grit our teeth and then everything will work out in Copenhagen, subsequent conferences and ICAO. However, it is not that simple. Nonetheless, we have an EU directive that has to be implemented. I would like the Commission to tell me how it intends to do this. I have four specific questions on this and I eagerly await the answers. Firstly, what steps is the Commission planning to take if third countries or third country airlines refuse to participate in the EU emissions trading system? Secondly, what measures are planned to bring about the inclusion of airlines in emissions trading? Thirdly, is it correct that the Commission is investigating or planning the withdrawal of EU flying rights from those airlines or third countries that refuse to participate in the EU emissions trading system? Fourthly, if such flying bans are imposed, how does the Commission expect the third countries concerned to react? May I remind you that the European Court of Justice has received actions from third countries that are simply refusing to be included in the EU’s emissions trading system. It is high time that we took a careful look at the day of reckoning that will come in 2012. I want to know what will happen then. What will we do then? Debating what position we are going to take at ICAO is of secondary importance to me right now. When it comes down to it, ICAO is nothing more than an assembly of the governments of the world that are acting from exactly the same vast differences in interest as they were in Copenhagen and, I suspect, as they will be in Cancún. My question to the Commission is therefore as follows: how are we going to get out of this dilemma? We are trying to implement a law that already exists, but which, in fact, cannot be implemented.

The FDP is basically in favour of positive labelling, or process labelling, for GMOs in food at European level in order to bring about the necessary transparency for consumers. In this case, however, we cannot agree to the fact that unequal treatment of different sectors is being demanded. While labelling is requested for the field of animal production, this is not the case for plant production. Unfair labelling of this kind for products of animal origin could distort the market to the disadvantage of one side. This counteracts our efforts to ensure fair competition, and is clearly in conflict with the principle of equality enshrined in our legal system. Holger Krahmer,

 Mr President, this debate was timed badly. I would like to have seen the Dutch team win, even if for the last time in this World Cup. This is perhaps a bad omen, because we are no longer allowed to watch, so they will probably not win after all. Commissioner, today – or more precisely tomorrow – we are completing a legislative package that we have been discussing for more than two years. It is not just controversy that is responsible for this, but also the European elections that have taken place in the meantime, and also the entry into force of a new EU Treaty which has meant that we have had to adjust a few things. However, I think that, if we can draw a conclusion from today’s debate, it is that we are voting on a compromise which completely deserves to be approved, even if, in some areas, we might do so with gritted teeth. I would like to emphasise two aspects. The first is the environmental requirements in industrial plants. What we are talking about here is the better implementation of best available techniques in Europe. I think that we have found a paragraph of exceptions in the compromise which is currently before us which gives the European Commission – Mr Potočnik, here I am addressing you directly – the tools to ensure over the next few years, better and more firmly than has been the case up to now, that the approximately 52 000 industrial plants in Europe which are affected by this finally make better use of best available techniques than they currently do. I have heard many arguments in this debate. I would like to take up one of these and deflect it, because I cannot comprehend it at all. It has often been said to me that the use of best available techniques is too expensive and that we will thereby endanger the competitiveness of European industry, and even more so in the crisis. I do not like to remember my past, but I come from the former GDR, East Germany. The economic and ecological collapse of the GDR was attributable to the fact that for decades, we neglected to invest in up-to-date technology. I think that every industry and every industrial enterprise, for its existence, needs to invest in up-to-date technology, because otherwise it will become less competitive, and this naturally means also reducing emissions of pollutants. Today, we have the opportunity to bring in a law which will improve this situation from which we are starting. The second part of the directive – and here we have some of the gritted teeth that I mentioned – deals with large combustion plants. We are talking once more – as we did before with the last directive – about renewing exceptions up to 2020, and in some cases 2023, for large combustion plants which do not have to achieve the environmental obligations and, in particular, the limits on air pollutants. Here I call on the Council, but also perhaps all of us here, to consider very carefully how sensible it really is that we regularly bring in ambitious environmental targets, and we discuss them and welcome them here, but always, whenever it comes to implementing them and transforming them into concrete legislation, then a tragedy begins in Europe. Then it suddenly becomes clear to the Member States how much it costs, which bills we have to pay, and then, as a rule, the ones who have done this in advance are punished. There are a number of Member States which now already meet the obligations, and which will, in the end, be left out in the cold. I will say it here once again: whether we are talking about industrial plants or large combustion plants – which essentially means coal power stations – we are not dealing with science fiction. We are not talking about things which are not available; on the contrary, this is up-to-date technology. Best available techniques – what is available on the market given competitive and cost factors – can be incorporated into these plants, and today, against this background, we are completing a legislative package which I think is better than what is currently in force, and therefore I would encourage us all to approve it. I would also like to thank my fellow Members, who, while sometimes pulling no punches, have worked with me on this for the last two years, for their support, their legwork and, above all, for the fact that almost all of the main groups have subscribed to this compromise. Holger Krahmer,

 Mr President, three relevant things have happened while we have been debating: first, it is clear that Europe will be the football world champions. A good omen, I think. Who exactly it will be, we will see. I do not want to express any preference now. The second is that Germany is receiving compliments from the United Kingdom. Chris Davies, many thanks! That also does not happen every day. It is certainly worth noting. Thirdly, all is still well with the world; even the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance finds football more important than environmental protection. Regrettably, our fellow Member, Mr Eickhout, has left us again. However, congratulations to our Dutch friends, of course. I wanted to talk about two aspects of the debate to which I have just been able to listen. The first is that I understand all the worries and woes of my Eastern European friends only too well. As an East German, I am also half-Eastern European. I understand that Eastern Europe cannot immediately catch up on every step of environmental policy that has been taken in the Western European countries in recent decades. In order to get high-level environmental protection, one has to be able to afford it. Yes, that is true. However, I think that – even if we allow for this – it is worth approving this compromise, because it will do justice to the different starting positions that many Member States find themselves in. Secondly, the argument that the use of best available techniques will endanger competitiveness, in particular, with respect to China, is not only false; it is also dangerous. We must deal with the fact that industrial processes in Asia are always cheaper than here. However, we will only meet this challenge if we implement best available techniques in as many branches of industry as possible. Those which do not do this will become less competitive. No one, including this law, is demanding that an industrial enterprise should be switched off tomorrow. No one is demanding a leap from 0 to 100 in order to achieve a particular pollutant limit within a week. We have enough transitional periods, but to say that we must go without for competitive reasons is false. I also think that with this directive, we have set a course not only for environmental policy, but also for industrial policy, a course for which it is worth working in the next few years. Holger Krahmer  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I think that we are making good legislation today. It is good and right that we are taking steps to avoid illegal timber being placed on the European internal market. However, what holds for all environmental laws also holds for this law: we cannot just put in what we want, but we must also always check whether what we put in and prescribe is feasible in the end. Therefore, I think it is right that we have, in the end, come to the compromise that due diligence only needs to take effect at the first instance of placing on the market, and also that only then can the import ban be issued. It would be much too bureaucratic to provide documentary evidence of origin throughout the entire supply chain within Europe. This was on the table at the beginning of the debate. I think that it is not realistic here to constantly keep new accounts and provide documentary evidence, from the timber yard and the sawmill right up to the furniture factory. This produces bureaucracy which, in case of doubt, produces more paper and thereby may even accelerate legal felling. Therefore, we must be moderate in this area and ensure balance. We have succeeded in doing this. I am not in favour of the approach that Mrs Hassi has just spoken of, namely that we can bring in a zero-risk policy. This is not only applicable to felling, and it will not work. Zero risk is not feasible. It produces bureaucracy and, above all, produces new risks. We must ensure that the laws remain balanced and feasible. In this sense, this compromise is a good one. I am pleased that we will be able to approve it with a large majority tomorrow.

 Providing consumers with information about food is undoubtedly important. However, the debate in Brussels has become a lobbying battle between large companies from the food industry and consumer protection organisations. There was no place in this debate for the reality of everyday life for consumers. The representatives of the German Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament are in favour of a minimum of labelling. Consumers should be able to make their purchasing decisions on the basis of transparent, legible information. Colour coded labelling influences consumers and does not form the basis for transparent information. The so-called guideline daily amounts (GDAs) also have their weak points. Instead of having neutral information about the amounts of nutrients per 100 grams or millilitres printed legibly on packaging, Parliament discussed whether the daily requirements of a 40-year-old woman could be used as the point of reference or whether the colour coding of nutrients was a useful decision-making tool. The proposed, far-reaching, mandatory requirements for the origin labelling of ingredients cannot be implemented in practice. We also rejected the idea of special national provisions, because the labelling system should, as far as possible, be standardised. For these reasons, we were not able to vote in favour of the proposed report. Holger Krahmer  (ALDE

 Commissioner, I have two specific questions for you. Firstly, in your paper, I see no analysis of the European negotiating position at international level. Have we really taken note of the fact that Europe’s influence in climate policy has diminished? Have we taken note of the fact that the political and economic weight in this world has shifted sharply in the direction of Asia? Is it possible that we completely overestimated our influence here? Secondly, your paper is remarkable. In the twelve pages that you have completely filled, there is not a single reference to the IPCC Panel. Is that a subtle attempt to distance yourself from this body? I would like to remind you that this panel formed the basis for all the political decisions relating to the directives that we have drawn up here in recent years. Is it not time to call for a broad scientific approach that gives us real scientific statements, not political ones?

According to the resolution of the European Parliament on the draft general budget for the financial year 2010, adopted on 17 December 2009, a vote was taken today on the amending budget for the European Parliament, following the revised calculations made by the Parliamentary administration. The FDP in the European Parliament abstained, because there was a paragraph in the package of amendments concerned that we could not reconcile with our convictions. The FDP had already expressed its opposition to an increase in the secretarial allowance to EUR 1 500 during the discussions in committee. It is out of the secretarial allowance that MEPs’ assistants are paid. The FDP considers that the argument that more money is needed due to the additional work that MEPs have to do with the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is unsound, as there is nothing in past experience to support this. Certainly, due to the Treaty of Lisbon, which has just come into force, Parliament will overall need extra capacity for legislative work, but with the introduction of the Assistants’ Statute from the beginning of the current parliamentary term, there is still no proof that MEPs actually need more assistants. For this reason, there are grounds for concern that further demands and supplementary increases, or an extension of office capacity, will follow. For this reason, the FDP in the European Parliament abstained. Holger Krahmer,

Madam President, it seems to me to be a little symptomatic for the EU in general, but also for Parliament in particular, that we should have knee-jerk debates about situations in certain countries that are in no way new. Unfortunately, it is very often the case that overnight events lead to us here in Parliament spouting out waves of political demands that I sometimes find somewhat dubious. I think that it does not give a good impression of us if a failed bomb attack on an aeroplane only leads us to a general debate on Yemen. We should be clear that it would be fitting to consider a strategy for how to deal with this situation. I also think that the situation in Yemen requires a precise analysis, specifically with regard to the fact that this is a failed state in which the government does not have control of large parts of the country We should analyse for ourselves what risks this involves for Europe. The risks appear to be that terrorists are trained there and the risks also appear to relate to the Yemeni coast, where piracy is clearly taking place. We – and perhaps Baroness Ashton, also – must consider what we can do to counter these risks. As I see it, the main question might well be: how can we bolster the Yemeni Government so that it can regain control of the country and thus contain these risks? All the other debates about the long-term building-up of the country also need to be held, of course, but I do not think that there is really any point in us putting forward a catalogue of demands clean across all political areas – from the freedom of the media to women’s rights – here in Parliament at this point, or that we will be taken seriously if we do so. Doing so will not achieve our goal in Yemen, so instead, we should concentrate on what tangible assistance we can provide in the current situation in order to solve an urgent problem.

 The German Free Democratic Party members of the European Parliament have abstained from voting on the Copenhagen resolution for the following reasons. The resolution contains statements about financing for climate protection measures in third countries without defining the specific criteria or purpose of the financing. We cannot justify this to taxpayers. In addition, we believe that blanket criticism of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) is wrong. The ICAO is the organisation which deals with aviation matters at an international level. Both the criticism and the statement about the alleged failure of ICAO negotiations are incorrect and inappropriate. The call for specific arrangements for a CO2
 trading system for the aviation industry goes against current EU legislation and overburdens the EU’s negotiating position in an international climate agreement with unrealistic demands. Holger Krahmer  (ALDE

Madam President, European climate policy should leave its reverie behind and take note of the international realities. First of all, Kyoto was a failure. It was very symbolic, but delivered no reductions in emissions. Secondly, on the eve of Copenhagen, it is clear that important states in the world are not prepared to accept binding targets for reductions. Thirdly, politics must take note of a debate emerging in science. The same scientists who signed the conclusions of the IPCC panel two years ago today talk of natural influences on the climate – something that the IPCC categorically ruled out two years ago. We should already know how sure we can be of what influences climate change when we make political decisions. I therefore call for a change of strategy. First of all, we need to adapt to inevitable changes to the climate, while we should also move beyond all the ideological discussions about CO2
 and look for international allies in order to accelerate research into new energy sources and clean technologies. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

  Mr President, as an addition at the end of paragraph 24, which deals with the religious issues, we suggest the following sentence: ‘Calls on the Yargitay court to reverse its decision converting the historic Hagia Sophia Church in Trabzon as a mosque and push for its immediate re-opening as a museum’.

 Madam President, it has been an honour and a privilege to be the rapporteur for the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) on the proposal for a directive on the accessibility of public sector bodies’ websites and websites operated by entities performing public tasks. This piece of legislation is long overdue and eagerly awaited both by citizens with disabilities and by our increasingly ageing population who find themselves more and more isolated and excluded from a world where information is accessible primarily online. In Europe this amounts to 80 million citizens with disabilities and another 87 million aged over 65. 167 million European citizens is too great a number to be ignored. Throughout my involvement with this dossier, I have seen what these people face when trying to navigate their way online. I was particularly struck by the difficulties faced by the blind, which was exemplified at an IMCO Committee hearing held in April 2013. Ioanna-Maria Gertsou, a blind woman who owns a school for guide dogs in Athens, came to Parliament for a web accessibility demonstration and got visibly lost on traditional websites. However, despite the fact that assistive technology already exists, Europe has been lagging far behind. We are the European Union. We should be setting the agenda, not struggling, or even failing, to keep up. Less than one third of Europe’s public sector and government websites, and even less than 10[nbsp ]% of Europe’s websites in general, are fully accessible. Making websites and their content useable for all should already have become a priority at EU level. The Commission’s initial proposal was limited in scope and not fully in line with the goals promised in the digital agenda for Europe. The IMCO Committee was more ambitious, and made a number of significant amendments to the text. The directive now covers all EU public sector bodies’ websites and websites providing public services, as now laid down in a new annex. It now covers mobile web and apps and includes a robust enforcement mechanism. The specifications for accessibility are technology-neutral and based on the international Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0, also known as WCAG. This directive is essentially a forerunner in the planned European Accessibility Act, which I know is also being eagerly awaited by our citizens. The scope, along with the enforcement mechanisms and monitoring systems, reflects the binding obligations set out in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the commitments made in the digital agenda for Europe. In addition, with the implementation of a harmonised European approach, making these websites accessible also has the potential to be a highly profitable business. The financial benefits are currently estimated at EUR[nbsp ]2 billion.  Members of this Parliament will vote tomorrow to deliver on their commitment to uphold the rights of disabled people. However, this is only the first step in the legislative process. We regret the lack of engagement by previous presidencies on this dossier. However, I thank Commissioner Kroes for having openly supported our legislative work using one of the most modern ways of rapid communication, Twitter. I thank her for that.  I am sure the Greek Presidency will follow up the good work on this file and it is completely feasible that the Italian Presidency will be able to bring this dossier into legislation. In our increasingly digital world, accessibility is very much a human right. All people are entitled to use the internet in order to exercise their fundamental rights. I hope tomorrow’s vote will cement Parliament’s commitment on this.  Lastly, I must emphasise that cooperation with my shadow rapporteurs last year was both consensual and produced a directive that should be acceptable to all and I thank them for that.

 Madam President, my thanks go to all colleagues, especially to Adam Kósa, the Intergroup Chair, who really contributed to this piece of legislation.  This is both an ethical issue and a commercial issue. It is about basic and fundamental human rights and it is about jobs. Yes, the report is ambitious and I will admit that it has been made more ambitious by Parliament, but it is a feasible report, this is a feasible issue.  The ball, as many colleagues and Commissioner Kroes have said, lies now in the court of the Council of the Member States. Yes, and with our vote tomorrow we will take an important step. And I am very confident that the next Parliament will take up its work where we end it now and will bring this to an end together with the forthcoming Italian Presidency. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

Mr President, as Co-Chair of the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) of the European Parliament and the Sobranie, let me congratulate you on yet another positive report. For the first time our colleagues from Skopje are here in Strasbourg to attend the 11th JPC at the moment and to follow this debate on Richard Howitt’s report. I would like to welcome especially my Co-Chair Kenan Hasipi. Last December, only two months after the positive Commission progress report, we experienced a major political crisis in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The opposition was kicked out of the plenary, journalists had been expelled previously, and voting took place without their presence. The whole political process was disrupted due to parliamentary blocking for many weeks. We have been following the developments very anxiously in Brussels and in Europe, and the EU has made tremendous efforts to act as a mediator between the parties. On 1 March 2013, an agreement was achieved thanks to an EU mission by Parliament’s former President Jerzy Buzek, Richard Howitt and Commissioner Füle. Congratulations, especially to the Commissioner for his commitment and his tough tone, which led to the 1 March agreement and calmed the situation. Our rapporteur Mr Howitt postponed the vote on his report as he feared that the vote could turn out negatively for the country. I respect his decision. Moreover, the JPC was also postponed. This was a sign of mutual respect. Parliament, I think, and our colleagues were extremely tolerant in allowing us to use this time-out instrument, but this measure can only be an exceptional approach. Let us continue to work hard, keeping the country on the European track. It is in our common interest. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

Mr President, when I entered politics one of my biggest idols, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, defined as one of the cornerstones of the European Union respect for the right to sovereignty, especially for the small Members of the European Union. The Eurogroup did not respect this small Member State, Cyprus, and its sovereignty, nor the Cypriot economy and society. The Eurogroup should stop putting in danger this fundamental value of the European Union, namely respecting the sovereignty of the small. That is why we should respect Cyprus in order to safeguard the European Union. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,

Madam President, President Caldeira, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the Court of Auditors for the important work that it undertakes on behalf of the European taxpayer every year. Mr Caldeira, you and the Court are and will remain a valued partner for us as Members of this House, the representatives of the European Union’s discharge authority. A year ago, as we sat here discussing the Court of Auditor’s previous report, I said that the Court’s report presented a positive picture, but there were some grey areas. The picture is becoming steadily brighter, but there are still some spots of grey. The sum of EUR 130 billion was available in 2011, and of this figure, EUR 5 billion should never have been disbursed. That is an error rate of 3.9 %. Compared with previous years, that is an improvement, but it is still much too high. I am at a loss to explain how these figures can possibly be justified in view of the budget constraints throughout the EU. However, there are some positive aspects. The instruments that Parliament, in its discharge reports, has given the Commission, especially in recent years, are being utilised at last and are working. This is happening to an exemplary – extremely exemplary – degree in the field of employment and social affairs. The Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion and its Commissioner, Mr Andor, have since 2008 applied a consistent policy of suspending and discontinuing payments if current projects simply do not work. As a result, the error rate here has fallen to 2.2 %. I would like to congratulate you, Commissioner Andor, on these consistent efforts, which show how it should be done. I would like to extend these congratulations to Commissioner Šemeta as well, for he is of course involving in overseeing these efforts.  I myself, as one of the previous rapporteurs for the budget discharge, together with my parliamentary colleagues, reminded the House that funds that have been disbursed without justification must be recovered. This measure is also being used to an increasing extent, and I would like to congratulate you on this as well. My perusal of the Annual Summaries, which we Members are now permitted to inspect, has convinced me that this instrument is working. As regards efficiency, there are still some problems here. The evaluation report has rightly been criticised by the Court of Auditors for being too vague. I would like to offer Mr Geier, who is reporting on the budget discharge this year, the support of the House as a whole in order to ensure that the procedure is improved. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

The EU single market is one of the most worthwhile European achievements. Between 1992 and 2008 it created about 2.77 million jobs and increased GDP by 2.13 %. These figures clearly show the potential of a smoothly functioning EU single market. The 20 years of its existence that we are now celebrating is an anniversary of which all Europeans should be proud. However, past achievements should motivate us to remove any remaining obstructions. As the rapporteur has clearly shown us, some things in the single market are still in dire straits. The Commission has also produced a working paper containing the 20 main concerns of citizens that they consider impede the everyday smooth operation of the single market to no purpose. The problem areas identified must be solved using an integrated approach. Another problem concerns the issue of how we can ensure that every European citizen can benefit from the achievements of the EU single market, no matter where they live. The trade balance deficits within the EU may in the long term create difficulties for the Union. European policy must steer us in the opposite direction. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, 20 years of the internal market are indeed a reason to look back on this track record. It is exactly as Ms Gebhardt said: the internal market has brought the European idea, the European philosophy, to the fore, there is no doubt about that. It goes without saying that, externally, the internal market is seen as a success. However, if we look inside the European internal market, we will discover that some have benefited more than others. Germany has a very healthy balance sheet. The German Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau
 has calculated that, in Germany alone, the internal market effect represents an annual amount of EUR 30 billion in relation to the euro. On the other hand, we see that productivity in the peripheral countries is declining. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let us take the Single Market Act II and these 20 years of the internal market as an opportunity to consider how we can get to grips with this imbalanced development, these current account differences, within the European Union. If we do not succeed in this, unless everyone sees an advantage in the internal market, the internal market will lose credibility and legitimacy in the long term. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Busuttil, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I warmly welcome this own-initiative report by Mr Busuttil. It is further proof of how important it is that Parliament sets the agenda on important matters. Thank you, then, Mr Busuttil, for this very balanced report. The subject is more relevant than ever, for alongside the things that we imagined would be the engine of European integration when the internal market was established 20 years ago, we can also see that there are imbalances in the internal market. The imbalances where the balance of payments is concerned are also one reason why the euro area has run into such difficulty. The single European market as a whole is also at risk of losing its legitimacy, its role as an engine, if we do not devote particular attention to what has happened now, on its 20th anniversary. The internal market scoreboard could be a useful instrument for indicating where things are going wrong at a very early stage, as a kind of early warning system. It would be a significant first step towards economic policy that is at last coordinated. That is why I also welcome the European Commission’s plans to publish this internal market scoreboard annually. We need to square the circle here. On the one hand, the economies that have nursed their labour markets back to health by making appropriate reforms – those that are more prompt with transposition – must naturally not be punished for their achievement. On the other hand, however, even the best in class will be affected if its neighbour gets into excessive debt in order to buy its products. As an initial step, it would be sufficient for the EU’s internal market regulations to finally be transposed in a more timely manner. In reality, what we need here are realistic transposition and implementation targets – as this report also underlines. Then there is the varying speed of transposition. In May 2011, the Member States took, on average, 5.5 months longer than the transposition deadline to transpose EU directives; today, the figure is nearly 8 months. This time period needs to be reduced, for the sake of equal opportunities alone. In short, the Member States must meet their obligations better and must demonstrate greater commitment to and make greater efforts towards implementing European legal provisions. At the same time, it can be seen that 20 years of the internal market have resulted in a drastic increase in the differences between the competitiveness of the national economies in the European Union. There has been a radical shift in the balance of payments between the strongest economies and what are now the weakest economies, in favour of the strongest. The low interest rate policy conducted since the launch of the euro has reinforced this trend, acting rather like an accelerant. We Europeans have trusted in the healing powers of the internal market, while ignoring the fact that competitiveness has not necessarily improved across the board as a result of this internal market policy. Commissioner Barnier, we need to take action to counter this. The scoreboard provides one way of doing so. The 20th anniversary of the single European market also gives us an opportunity to look into drawing up a plan for more equal balances of payments at national level, and possibly even at regional level in a further step, alongside the completion of the internal market. Only then will we achieve overall economic equilibrium in even the marginal regions of Europe, and particularly in the southern parts of the euro area. Europe’s sovereign debt crisis shows that the surpluses in the north and the deficits in the south will have a blocking effect on each other unless we can resolve this problem in the medium term. I would therefore urge Europe’s economists to give us new theories that reconcile the internal market with reciprocal balance. The internal market scoreboard could provide a decisive starting point for this, but it must not be allowed to become a paper tiger. Let us use the internal market week as an opportunity to think about these things. Let us also use the 20th anniversary of the internal market as a chance to make all of us in Europe – not just the strong countries of the north, but everyone as a whole – fit for the future.

 Mr President, Mr Rehn, I wish to congratulate Werner Hoyer on his brilliant debut in his new job. Mr Hoyer, this is not an easy time for the European Union. This economic and financial crisis calls for adroit economic and political expertise. You have both in good measure. The European Parliament is happy to see you at the helm of the European Investment Bank (EIB). I would also like to thank the outgoing Vice-President, Matthias Kollatz-Ahnen, however, as he has also achieved a great deal. As an example, I would mention the establishment of the European Energy Efficiency Fund. Mr Hoyer, the role of your bank is decisive in overcoming the crisis. We are all aware of this. You have also proven this. I would cite the example of how you overcame the crisis in the automotive sector. Thanks to the scrapping premiums, which were mainly paid for by your bank, we managed to do something good for the environment, while also providing a stimulus for the economy. We are now facing new challenges. We have heard several references to the issue of project bonds. We are constantly talking about the innovative financial instruments we expect from your bank. We need clear rules, however; we expect your bank to issue clear rules for all Member States. We wish you every success in your efforts to obtain a triple-A rating for the bank. As stated in our report, for which I would like to thank Ms Ivanova, we would like to see the EU becoming a shareholder. This may perhaps be a step in the right direction. I wish you all the best for the work ahead. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, Jürgen Creutzmann, Britta Reimers and Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 The representatives of the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament will vote in favour of the Hübner report on amending COM(2011)0482
 only on condition that, when raising the applicable cofinancing rates by ten percentage points, there is an exception for those Member States explicitly affected.

 Mr President, this year’s report from the European Court of Auditors presents a positive picture, but there are some problems. The good news is that many areas are satisfactory, in particular, the major area of agricultural spending, as Mr Fjellner has already said. The bad news is that the predicted deterioration in the area of cohesion has taken place and 49%, in other words half, of all the payments audited in the area of cohesion had errors. That is a great number. A total of 90% of all the payments with problems are made in the Member States. In our committee, we were critical at the time of the fact that the Council was not present. I am looking at the Council bench and the Council is once again not represented. The Council really should be here for this debate. Two-thirds of all the errors occur in three Member States. I would like to congratulate you, Mr Šemeta, for having the courage to name these Member States in the committee. You have said that they are Italy, Spain and the Czech Republic. You have our support for this new policy of naming and shaming. You have followed up another call by the European Parliament and I would like to thank you for this too. You have interrupted payments amounting to a total of EUR 2.4 billion. This is the only way that we will be able to introduce discipline in the Member States. After the process of damage limitation, we must identify the errors and name the culprits. The key words here are effectiveness, efficiency and economic viability. There is also a new chapter where you, Mr Caldeira, make it clear in your report that the Commission often does not achieve the goals which it sets itself. Mr Šemeta, we will be interested to see the evaluation report from the Commission, which is expected in December. However, we would also like to say that in times of financial crisis, we must use taxpayers’ money in a way which is even more effective, more precise, more carefully targeted and more efficient. That is our job. I would like to thank the Court of Auditors for helping us to do this. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,

 Mr President, Mr Korolec, Commissioner, energy is the lifeblood of our national economies. We therefore want price developments to remain transparent for consumers. I regret to say that there are still too many deals and agreements being made behind the scenes. In the end, it is consumers who foot the bill, in the form of severely inflated energy prices. This is not just annoying; it also has real effects on growth and employment. We want a better internal energy market. Europe needs transparent energy markets that are protected from abuse. This is precisely what the regulation on energy market integrity and transparency aims to achieve, and that is what we are talking about here. I would specifically like to thank the Commission and Commissioner Oettinger for their positive cooperation. This is exactly how European legislation needs to be made – in the way that we have brought it about here. I am particularly pleased that the European dimension of energy trading is stressed in the text that will be put to the vote tomorrow. One of the main issues was whether or not we need a special law on this. Do we need a sector-specific approach or could energy trading simply be subject to the general regulations for financial markets? When it comes down to it, however, energy markets have different rules; energy traders are not banks. I am particularly grateful to Commissioner Oettinger for having done all he could to ensure this matter was put to the House quickly. That was essential for a sector-specific approach. The negotiations with the Hungarian Presidency were tough and we succeeded in getting a result at first reading. Parliament – my fellow Members – introduced seven new points into the Commission’s text. The first important point was the introduction of an approval system for a register of electricity traders. This regulation now sets out the requirement of a national register of electricity traders. It also provides for the establishment of a European register which is to be organised by the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER). The Commission is to evaluate the registration system in the future and propose further instruments to improve it. Secondly: there is a link-up with CO2
 emissions trading. The regulation gives the ACER access to existing databases relating to trading in emissions certificates. Although Member States are not required to keep such records and the ACER is not being given the rights of control, the Commission is asked to present a legislative proposal to deal with the deficits in the CO2
 market system. Thirdly: there will be penalties, and we have worked to harmonise these penalties and to achieve minimum standards. Following pressure from Parliament, the damage caused to consumers is to be given particular consideration when deciding on sanctions. In addition, the Commission has been given the opportunity to table a proposal on minimum standards for penalties. Fourthly: the role of the agency and the national regulatory authorities have been strengthened. Parliament wanted to strengthen the ACER, which is why we have pushed for the director of the ACER to be more independent. The director of the ACER is to consult national provisions, but should not be bound by these. A fifth important point: there is a revision clause in respect of staffing and resources. Parliament would like the ACER to be provided with the appropriate financial and human resources to be able to perform its new tasks. This is emphasised in a new recital. The ACER needs to be better equipped if it is to be guaranteed a strong presence in important organised market places. Sixthly: naturally, insider trading is banned, but we have agreed one exemption when it comes to insider trading. This exemption may be applied only in the event of a direct physical loss resulting from unplanned outages. This exemption is allowed in order to provide security in the system, since otherwise players in the market would be unable to discharge their contractual obligations or to act by agreement with the competent transmission system operator. Mr President, I should like to continue speaking now rather than saving two minutes until the end. The seventh and final point concerns delegated acts versus implementing acts. This was a tough one in the negotiations – it was a central issue, and, in part, we were breaking new ground as a result of the Treaty of Lisbon. Parliament has conceded some of its demands concerning delegated acts in favour of a stronger role for the ACER and in favour of more detailed directions in the section on penalties. This was a trade-off that we made. One important element of the final package is that all the aspects relating to data collection will be laid down by an implementing act rather than a delegated act. This also applies to the setting of a de minimis
 threshold for the definition of reporting obligations. Nonetheless, the Commission will reserve the right to make a proposal ahead of any legislative proposal on such a threshold. This is also enshrined in the text as part of a declaration. Overall, we have achieved a good result. I am very satisfied. The Hungarian Presidency was a tough negotiating partner, but with the assistance of my colleagues from all the other groups, we succeeded in achieving a genuinely satisfactory result. I would like to express my warmest thanks to everyone, especially to my Hungarian colleague, Mr Gyürk, because he naturally had a particularly direct line to the Presidency; however, everyone was involved in the trialogue negotiations. We achieved near unanimity in committee. I would be pleased if we could do the same in plenary. Thank you for your cooperation. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,

 Mr President, it only remains for me to thank everyone and, in particular, once again to wish Mr Pototschnig, the director of the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER), who is with us today, every success with his work. He only assumed responsibility for this area in March and it is already becoming clear that the resources available to him may be inadequate, as the two previous speakers and many other of my fellow Members have said. Therefore, we will soon be in the position where we have to provide the ACER with additional resources. I would like to give Mr Pototschnig and his team my best wishes for their work on an issue which is important to consumers. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control
. – (DE)
 Mr President, from the perspective of budgetary control, the European Union is often accused of taking a sloppy approach to spending. Who is responsible for this? In 80% of cases it is actually the Member States, which have joint responsibility for the expenditure. It is often the Member States. We all remember how the British Prime Minister, Mr Cameron, said to the President of the European Parliament that instead of asking for more money, we must first of all make sure that the money is spent more effectively. Which country was the biggest offender in 2010? The United Kingdom. All the British programmes were stopped in 2010. Why is that? It is because the rules are too complicated. Therefore, I would like to ask my fellow Members and, in particular, the Commission to campaign together with the Member States for simpler rules, for more effective and simpler monitoring systems and for the introduction of new components. For example, if research policy were to include an award or a prize for a particularly successful, innovative project, this would make it much easier to monitor. The same applies to cohesion policy, where we could create a leverage effect by providing project-related loans. There are a lot of opportunities open to us for innovation. We should take a brave step forward. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,  
rapporteur. 
– (DE)
 Mr President, Commissioner Šemeta, ladies and gentlemen, the process we are dealing with today – that is, the discharge for the expenditure of the European Commission – is an essential process. In recent years it may perhaps have been taken rather lightly, but in fact granting discharge for all the expenditure of the European Commission for the year 2009 is an essential task of the European Parliament. We are aware that 80% of these funds were spent as a shared responsibility between the Commission and the Member States. Nonetheless, the overall responsibility for this process lies with the Commission. I would therefore like to address you quite directly, Commissioner Šemeta. Firstly, I would like to thank you. I would like to make that clear at the outset. I would like to include my fellow Members who have worked very well together and who have supported Parliament’s position very strongly. However, the discussions that we had were very intense, Commissioner Šemeta. You have only shared responsibility for 2009, yet you have thrown yourself into it. In some cases we have had heated arguments and have gone into very great detail. I should like to emphasise, however, that you have put the discharge at the top of the agenda in the College, in the Commission. The President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, spent over an hour negotiating with us on the details. You yourself played a major part in changing the attitude of the Commission to the discharge and the attitude of the Commission officials to this whole process. I am grateful to you for having said quite openly that the pressure that Parliament has exerted this year will in the final event help you to improve transparency. You now have in your hands a means of exerting pressure not just on the Member States, but also on your own administration – which has until now been a little lax in dealing with these matters. However, I also think that we need to utilise this momentum that we have created together, Commissioner Šemeta – and I would ask you to pass on our thanks to President Barroso – and this dynamism for the other discharge reports. For there is one thing that must be clear to us, which is that for the 16th time in succession the European Court of Auditors has not given a positive statement. That is not insignificant, as it means that you have not actually met the criteria for 16 years running. Nonetheless, we have set key criteria that I would like to mention briefly and that you have met. I am pleased to have Mr Fjellner, the forthcoming rapporteur on the budget discharge, at my side. I hope that he will continue the work with the same impetus. The Commission has begun – and this is crucial, because we are after all talking about 80% shared responsibility here – quite clearly to state erroneous expenditure in the accounts of the European Union for 2009. It has listed these items openly. Building on this new transparency, therefore, we have set five key requirements. The first is a long-running issue – an old favourite – that Parliament has been dealing with for a long time, and that is the national management declarations. As a representative of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I am also pleased to be able to point out that this has been brought about by Dutch members of the ALDE Group in particular. We are talking here about the confirmation by the finance ministers that EU funds have been spent correctly in their home countries. We do not yet have these national management declarations, but we want to get them. In this respect I will be building on my cooperation with Mr Fjellner in the future. Commissioner, you have promised that we will look into whether stricter conditions can be introduced by the next financial perspective in 2014. It is important that you have drawn up guidelines – we are grateful to you for that – that you have shown which countries have actually provided national management declarations – it is not many: basically, only the Netherlands meets the requirements in full – and that you have instructed the Directorates General to show for the first time in the activity report for 2010 what components will be present in a future national administrative declaration, even if this will only take place at working level. The second key requirement is that the commissioners must also accept greater responsibility. You have proposed that the Directorates General be obliged to inform their commissioners of irregularities and I want to thank you for that. The third, and essential, requirement was for the instrument of stopping or suspending payments to be used to a greater extent. You have listed clear criteria for when you will do that. You have shown us clearly how you have already done this in the last couple of years. Thank you for such openness and transparency, which helps us exert pressure on the Member States. Thank you also for the guidelines that will help the Member States. In addition, you promised that when evaluating the performance audit you will set clear standards; this is an obligation that you have anyway under the Treaty of Lisbon. Thank you also for involving us to a considerable extent in the performance audit process. You have also promised to make simplifications, because often the material is so complex that people hide behind the rules and indulge in abuse. Thank you also for having set very specific requirements for the next financial perspective. I advocate that we continue along this path. I believe that Parliament can make a great contribution towards raising the Commission to another level. I wish Mr Fjellner all the best and would like to extend my warm thanks to my parliamentary staff, particularly Bent Adamsen and Dominykas Mordas. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the Commissioner once again on behalf of Parliament for his excellent cooperation. You have now raised certain points once again. We should take these as a starting point for our continued work. However, I would also ask you to pass on our thanks to your colleagues, because we had a very intense exchange with many individuals – I should particularly like to mention Mr Cioloş and Mr Hahn – and both were very cooperative. Please would you pass this message on to them once again. I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Becsey, for his clear words. He spoke very clearly; we may not like what he said, but at least he was clear in what he said and we are grateful for that. I consider it only right that you are here. I do not think there is particular cause to mention it. Nonetheless, it is good that you are here. I have saved my final thanks for the President of the European Court of Auditors, Mr Caldeira, with whom Parliament always enjoys genuinely open and positive cooperation. We very much appreciate that. Our work would not be possible without your background work. Our discharge is based mainly on your contributions. We would like to see you playing a greater role in the future assessment of the performance audit, Mr Caldeira. The future of the European Union depends not just on the funds being spent legally and correctly, but also and above all on their being spent usefully; in other words, effectively and efficiently. That will form part of the performance audit under Article 318 of the Treaty of Lisbon. As Parliament, we would like to see an annual debate on the performance audit of the Commission and we would like you to be invited here to debate it with us as a representative of the European Court of Auditors. My sincere thanks to my fellow Members and to everyone involved. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 In the vote on the Lange report, I am abstaining on paragraph 31 because of the ambiguous wording, which refers to Eurobonds as well as project bonds. However, taking it as a whole, I am voting for the report, as I have nothing against project bonds in themselves. Project bonds serve as finance for extensive innovation, infrastructure and reindustrialisation projects. This is not a question of instruments for the communitarisation of debts, as would be the case with Eurobonds. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Madam President, Mr Tajani, thank you very much for your strong commitment to a European industrial policy. I have been looking over at Mr Lange and thinking that there has been a lot of commotion about an own-initiative report. A total of 500 amendments and 50 compromise proposals have been tabled with the aim of making industry in Europe a world leader again. We can only achieve this by means of an integrated and sustainable policy. We need to ensure that research and innovation are at the heart of our strategy. Therefore, we must put in place a regulatory framework which will support innovation and sustainability at the same time. The major challenge faced by your report was finding the right balance between environmental goals and economic competitiveness, while also avoiding protectionism. I am looking at Mrs Grossetête, because the French always want to introduce a touch of protectionism. At the same time, we need to support small and medium-sized businesses, promote the European patent and prevent knowledge theft, particularly with regard to China. We also want to see fewer regulations being imposed on European industry as a result of red tape. This means that we need to focus on reducing the amount of bureaucracy. Mr Lange, you have succeeded in covering this quite well in your report, so I would like to thank you for your hard work. However, this report can only represent the first step. We need to link the concept of industrial policy, which people in many Member States find it hard to discuss and which the Germans, in particular, have always been unwilling to talk about, with the competitiveness pact, which will be presented to the Heads of State or Government over the next few weeks in order to safeguard the euro area. If we do not manage to do this, then we will have a problem. We must coordinate areas such as cohesion, industry, trade, research and innovation, but also social issues, the climate and the environment. The current example of E10 in Germany demonstrates that this is not happening. This is all about adding bioethanol to petrol. The EU has put in place an important strategy, set itself the 20-20-20 targets, and we have said to the Member States that they must implement it. The Member States, and Germany in particular, were part of the decision-making process and supported everything that was decided. However, when it came to putting it into practice at home, they suddenly cut back the tax incentives and the consumers stopped cooperating. If we fail to convince consumers, as was the case in Germany with E10, then we will not be able to implement climate policy in combination with industrial policy. We need to have the consumers on our side. That is the central message. For this reason, I wish the industrial policy project every success. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 In overall terms, the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament supports the waste disposal directive. However, the subject of photovoltaic modules remains a problem. There is no understandable reason for excluding the entire sector from the regulations. We have a wide range of legislation governing waste streams. Therefore, it is not clear why a complete industry, which is expected to produce significant waste streams, is being exempted. For this reason, some of the FDP Members of the European Parliament have abstained from voting on the report. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Mr President, the Communication and the report are very good, and I would therefore like to express my thanks to Commissioner Dalli and Mrs Matias. Alzheimer’s is a plague of our times, and our biggest problem is that we simply know too little about Alzheimer’s. That is why we need research, research, and more research. We need to pool our strengths and I therefore welcome the Commission’s initiative to create an innovation partnership on the subject of healthy ageing; Alzheimer’s fits in with this perfectly. Many years ago, the US Government designated the fight against cancer as a lighthouse project. They have not conquered cancer, but a great many medicines and a great many therapies have emerged as a result. That is the kind of thing that we need here, and I therefore welcome the fact that we are to concentrate on Alzheimer’s. We need to know how to take preventive action. What can we do in the future to combat Alzheimer’s? That is why we cannot continue to adopt the watering can principle in European research policy. We need to concentrate on specific areas. Alzheimer’s could be one of the major themes that we get to grips with. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

Mr President, Commissioner, energy efficiency has always been the biggest resource proffered to us. It is the sleeping giant with the hidden but enormous potential for the European energy economy. All that is true, and the nice thing about it is that it is so free of ideology. Above all, the approach to this issue can be technology-neutral. All that interests us here, and it is a point that is clearly also a little divisive, is the issue of whether or not the targets are binding. I have to say, Commissioner, in this regard, that I like your two-stage approach whereby you start by trusting in the Member States and by building voluntary agreements and then, if we observe that we will not achieve the targets by 2020, we perhaps get the thumbscrews out. That is the right approach to take. This report, by and large, moves in the right direction – there is little to criticise. There is one issue that I would like to raise, however, which is the role of the regional funds. You mentioned this issue, Commissioner. In the regional funds, together with the Cohesion Funds, we have an immense instrument in our hands in the European Union that we are not making use of. In this field of energy efficiency, we could finally create European added value which we could put to use in an innovative way to get to grips with energy efficiency in a way that has not happened in the past. As the current rapporteur for budgetary discharge for the Commission, I can see just how badly we have wasted money in the sphere of cohesion. Let us put a stop to that waste! I endorse the focus that you are giving to this issue, Commissioner Oettinger, and the fact that you are seeking to bring about greater use of these funds, including for this energy efficiency instrument. That is the only way that we will ensure that there really is cohesion, at least in the energy sector. I feel I must warn against smear campaigns, as we saw with light bulbs and with shower heads. Such campaigns are the kind of things that alienate the citizens. We must thus ensure that we aim to achieve energy efficiency in general and that we keep this objective in mind without pursuing ideological smear campaigns that ultimately lead to the citizens losing their positive impression of the EU.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to congratulate Mr Almunia on the open debate that has taken place in the Commission. There are good reasons why you and the Commission President, Mr Barroso, took part in the debate in the College of Commissioners with a very different year in mind. I am pleased that the Commission is able to discuss issues so openly from a regulatory perspective and then to reverse its decision. That is both admirable and remarkable. It is a good thing that you are supporting the new decision here. There are a number of good grounds for this decision. Nevertheless, the Member States which are affected have been making plans. There are plans in place and I can only say that I am pleased that the review clause has been removed, which stated that we would have to open up the whole can of worms once again from 2012 onwards in the largest Member State affected, in other words, Germany. This means that your debate in the College of Commissioners has also had a very successful outcome. I know that 2018 will eventually come around. I am also pleased about the fact that the mining industry has the security to plan ahead and I will vote accordingly. However, I can see that regulatory policy is the winner here.

 Mr President, Mr Šemeta, Mr Caldeira, I would like to thank the Court of Auditors for this report. Your organisation, Mr Caldeira, provides an essential service for European taxpayers. It is a good thing that the reduction in the error rate has continued this year. This is the result of the reform of the Commission which was pushed through by the liberal Commissioner, Mr Kallas. There are major improvements over the previous year in the area of cohesion and only a slight deterioration in agriculture. However, the Commission should not now simply sit back and do nothing. We must make it clear that the huge improvements are based on a very lucky choice of samples. Therefore, I am concerned that the positive trend will not continue next year. We should make use of the momentum from the first budget discharge under the Treaty of Lisbon to introduce a decisive paradigm shift. I would like to make it clear once again that this year’s report from the Court of Auditors is the sixteenth in a row which does not have positive overall results. How can we finally bring an end to the inefficient and wasteful allocation of funding and to the political connivance in this area? My proposals as rapporteur are as follows: Firstly, the Commission must intervene more strongly in the case of obvious errors and, where these errors are repeated, it must suspend the funding. How is it that a Member State of many years standing like Greece is not subjected to sanctions over a period of 10 years, despite the fact that it is in obvious breach of the provisions of the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS)? Secondly, we must no longer impose double penalties on taxpayers. The beneficiaries of EU funding which has been allocated illegally are only required to repay 10%. In accordance with the 50:50 rule, the Member States contribute half of the amount from their national budgets. This is an insult to taxpayers. Let me give you a few figures. Between 1994 and 2006, the Member States have been wrongly allocated a phenomenal EUR 7.7 billion in the area of cohesion policy. The Commission itself has just made this fact public. Only EUR 709 million has been paid back, which demonstrates very clearly the difference in these circumstances. This is probably correct, because the Member States are not in a position to come up with accurate calculations. The Court of Auditors has confirmed this. Thirdly, all the Member States must finally sign and submit national management declarations. Fourthly, the Commission must be politically accountable. This is why we want signatures at least from Mr Barroso on the synthesis report on annual activities. We also want an evaluation report, which is provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon. There are still some things that are in need of improvement. All in all, I would like to thank the Court of Auditors very much for this report. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,

 Mr President, what exactly does European innovation policy do? What does European research policy do? If we ask ourselves this question and if we were to ask the citizens on the street, we would just get a blank look. This is because it is not clear what added value European research and European innovation brings. For that reason, we welcome the fact that Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn’s proposal begins by providing a definition of innovation. What is innovation? Innovation involves making money, a product or a licence from knowledge. That is something new. I am pleased that the Commission is going down this path. However, we also now need ‘man on the moon’ or ‘woman on the moon’ projects which are understood by the man on the street, so that EU taxpayers understand what we are doing here with their money. In this regard, I see great potential in the issue of increasing the number of healthy life years by two. That would be a project that everyone out there would understand. I am therefore pleased that the first innovation partnership proposed is being devoted precisely to achieving this goal. Two additional healthy years of life – that will be understood by everyone and it is something we should do. In this regard, you have our support. However, I would like to point out, and Mrs Merkies has already mentioned this, too, that if we simply look at the instruments that already exist, there is the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), the Joint Technology Initiatives (JTIs), the so-called Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP) – these are all programmes that already exist. If we add yet another programme, then we will make the whole area difficult to get to grips with. This is something we must not do. The innovation partnerships are intended to make a real contribution to bringing order to this situation and combining everything in a single system. That is why we will only accept this if it is all made clearer for taxpayers. We must always know the answer to the question: what brings more European added value? If that is the case, we will give it our full support. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Mr President, there is an error in the Dutch version of the resolution on the Gallo report. I am listed there among the signatories to the resolution by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left as a member of the GUE/NGL Group. In this regard, I would like to say that, firstly, I am not a member of the GUE/NGL Group, I am not a Leftist and I am no Communist. Secondly, I remain a member of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe – a Liberal – and will vote for the ALDE resolution, as will many members of the other groups in this House. Thirdly, I call on the GUE/NGL Group to also vote for the ALDE resolution. (Laughter) Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank Mr Oettinger and congratulate Mr Vidal-Quadras on his report. With the help of the Spanish Presidency, it has been possible to produce a very good document. Natural gas is important and its importance is increasing. In his speech, Mr Turmes said that we must change our perspective on the situation. In the country which I represent, half of all households are dependent on natural gas, but 40% of this comes from Russia. This is why adding legislation to the existing directive is important. It is also the right thing to do. It will give us prevention plans, preventive measures and emergency plans with three crisis levels. We do not want a repeat of the pictures which we saw in the gas crisis winter of 2009. We do not want to see our European partners and Europe’s neighbouring countries freezing. For this reason, this report forms part of our common European responsibility, which covers not just the EU Member States but also the neighbouring countries. Ladies and gentlemen, the legislation is good, but we also need to take other routes. For this reason, I welcome the announcement by Mr Oettinger that all the infrastructure measures, some of which have been mentioned here, including Nabucco, Nord Stream and South Stream, will receive support. This will allow us to diversify and will ensure that we are not dependent on a single supply. What we need is storage facilities. We definitely need more storage. In Germany, we have 70 days’ supply and that is not the case in every country. We must raise the standards in every country in this respect. The other issue is the energy mix. That remains our greatest challenge, which we must work together to overcome. Thank you very much and I hope that the new legislation will be successful. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Mr President, firstly, I would like to express my gratitude to and respect for Mrs Jeggle, who has been working on this report for years. However, Mrs Jeggle, there is one thing that I must say. As Europeans, we cannot take pride in this report. It is too vague and it permits too many things which a country or a continent that plays a leading role in animal welfare throughout the world should not allow. I foresee a worsening of the situation, in particular, as far as the reuse of experimental animals is concerned. Previously, this was more difficult, but I believe that the regulations have now been watered down. You are shaking your head, but it is true that when you look at this carefully, the small print and the nuances in the wording are the things that make the difference. The severity of the tests is also an area where, in many Member States, things are likely to get worse. Some Member States, such as Germany, the United Kingdom and Sweden, had already gone further than this. We have introduced a pain threshold and the Council has watered it down by permitting exceptions. In addition, the power of the Commission has been reduced with regard to inspections. Nevertheless, I will be voting in favour of this report, Mrs Jeggle, because it represents an improvement on the 1986 directive, which is now 24 years old. The authorisation mechanisms are in place. A licence is needed in advance for three stages of testing, which is a good thing. The procedures have been simplified, which is also a positive step. Personally, I am proud of the fact that we have been able to rescue the subject of alternative test methods from the last parliamentary term. However, we will need to provide more funding for this. This directive will have to be revised within the next seven years. It represents quite a good foundation, but in seven years, we will need to improve it so that we can live up to our reputation here in Europe for having the highest levels of animal welfare in the world.

 Providing consumers with information about food is undoubtedly important. However, the debate in Brussels has become a lobbying battle between large companies from the food industry and consumer protection organisations. There was no place in this debate for the reality of everyday life for consumers. The representatives of the German Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament are in favour of a minimum of labelling. Consumers should be able to make their purchasing decisions on the basis of transparent, legible information. Colour coded labelling influences consumers and does not form the basis for transparent information. The so-called guideline daily amounts (GDAs) also have their weak points. Instead of having neutral information about the amounts of nutrients per 100 grams or millilitres printed legibly on packaging, Parliament discussed whether the daily requirements of a 40-year-old woman could be used as the point of reference or whether the colour coding of nutrients was a useful decision-making tool. The proposed, far-reaching, mandatory requirements for the origin labelling of ingredients cannot be implemented in practice. We have also rejected the idea of special national provisions, because the labelling system should, as far as possible, be standardised. For these reasons, we were not able to vote in favour of the proposed report.

 Combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography is vitally important. We must use all our strength to combat the availability of child pornography in communications networks. The permanent and effective control of child abuse is both a political responsibility and a precept of the rule of law.

 Mr President, Commissioner thank you for your statement. I am very grateful for the initiative by the Spanish Presidency – and this is a very Spanish event as far as I can see – in adopting this series of proposals and leading the way in this regard. Electromobility must play a key role in future. However, as we all know, we are still a long way from achieving comprehensive electromobility. For that reason, we should also not make the mistake of allowing electric-car hype to arise, the claims of which we are not able to fulfil in political terms. Therefore, we should not abandon our focus on improving conventional means of locomotion, as crude oil will probably continue to fuel our mobility for a long time yet. The following points are crucial, however. Firstly, as you and all of the other speakers have said, we need a European strategy for the development of standards. The United States and China are working jointly on conductive charge couplers. We must not lag behind in this regard. We ought to lead the way and should not allow European vanity to take hold. Are the French quicker, or the Germans or the Spaniards? We should all pull together and the Commission should certainly take the lead in this. We need to develop cost-effective, high-performance batteries. Secondly, we need to extend network-infrastructure coverage to all areas. For us, that means that we have to focus our subsidy options on this in a more targeted way in the area of cohesion, in the regions and also in the development of rural areas. Citizens must be able to use electromobility across borders, otherwise they will not use this form of transport. Thirdly, we must also take electric cars into account in our CO2
 emissions calculations. Car manufacturers that are currently carrying out fleet calculations cannot yet include electric cars. We need to be able to take these into account in future. Fourthly, we must provide tax relief on electric cars throughout Europe. This applies to batteries in particular, which are still the most expensive part. We need to carry out research in this regard, but we also need to harmonise our taxes. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

Thank you, Mr President, that was very kind. Commissioner Šemeta, the adoption of the reports on the budgetary management of the European bodies and institutions is one of our most important obligations as representatives of the European people – it is our sovereign duty. The question of what Europe has done with taxpayers’ hard earned money is crucial for the acceptance of the European integration project. I would first like to thank all the rapporteurs for their efforts. However, I see light and shadow in the reports. I see light in budgetary management overall. Meanwhile, it is the case that everywhere the EU controls and manages funds itself, it runs things in accordance with the rules. Whether or not it is efficient is another matter altogether. As the European Parliament, we should pay closer attention to the efficiency of policies, political issues and implementation, in particular, with regard to the 2020 agenda. There is shadow in the area of cohesion policy. Eleven per cent of things do not comply with the rules and this percentage is too high. Therefore, it is very important that the EU tries harder to recover funds paid out incorrectly. The Committee on Budgetary Control has therefore adopted an amendment tabled by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. We want 100% of the money back. For 2010, I have the honour of being the rapporteur for the European Commission discharge. Due to the delayed entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, this will be no easy task. We must monitor very closely whether the new responsibilities of individual Commissioners lead to even less transparency and more concealment of responsibilities. We must and will examine this very closely. Allow me to single out two areas: firstly, the so-called non-governmental organisations and secondly, the gentlemen’s agreement. Between 2008 and 2009, the European Union paid NGOs over EUR 300 million in funds. These include honourable organisations like the Deutsche Welthungerhilfe
. However, there are also some that want to destroy the reputation of the European Union, namely Counter Balance, which has attacked the European Investment Bank. This is not acceptable and we must deal with it. We need a register and a definition of such non-governmental organisations, as they receive a lot of tax money. With regard to the gentlemen’s agreement I would like to thank Mr López Garrido. I would like to thank you for coming. I would also like to point to the historical element: questioning and revising the gentlemen’s agreement after 40 years is a huge step. Given the importance of Parliament due to the new Treaty of Lisbon, it is also a necessary step. We must ensure transparency, here and in the Council.

According to the resolution of the European Parliament on the draft general budget for the financial year 2010, adopted on 17 December 2009, a vote was taken today on the amending budget for the European Parliament, following the revised calculations made by the Parliamentary administration. The FDP in the European Parliament abstained, because there was a paragraph in the package of amendments concerned that we could not reconcile with our convictions. The FDP had already expressed its opposition to an increase in the secretarial allowance to EUR 1 500 during the discussions in committee. It is out of the secretarial allowance that MEPs’ assistants are paid. The FDP considers that the argument that more money is needed due to the additional work that MEPs have to do with the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is unsound, as there is nothing in past experience to support this. Certainly, due to the Treaty of Lisbon, which has just come into force, Parliament will overall need extra capacity for legislative work, but with the introduction of the Assistants’ Statute from the beginning of the current parliamentary term, there is still no proof that MEPs actually need more assistants. For this reason, there are grounds for concern that further demands and supplementary increases, or an extension of office capacity, will follow. For this reason, the FDP in the European Parliament abstained. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Mr President, as the head of the delegation, I would like, first of all, to congratulate Mr Thaler on his very balanced report. Skopje has carried out reforms and is on the way to joining the European Union. We welcome this very much and are very pleased about it. The visa liberalisation was perhaps the clearest and most visible sign. It was a milestone in our cooperation. This objective has only been achieved as a result of close collaboration with the EU Member States. It represents openness, interaction and cooperation. However, we must not forget that Macedonia was granted the status of accession candidate four years ago and since then, we have constantly been asking ourselves when it would finally join the European Union. I would like to call on all the parties to ensure that the name conflict, which is currently the focus of attention, is resolved. We must make use of the momentum generated by the Council decision in December and by the new Greek Government. This momentum is diminishing day by day. I would like to explain to the parties that if we concentrate now on other topics, such as the financial crisis, the goal of Macedonia’s accession will be pushed further into the background. We surely do not wish this to happen and this is why we must continue to make every effort in this area. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mr Kallas, Mr Caldeira, I can see both good things and bad things in the presentation of the Court of Auditors’ annual report on the EU budget. First of all, I would like to thank the Court of Auditors for a clearer, bolder and more political report which is easier for us to understand. The good areas include the management of the budget as a whole. In contrast to recent years, this has improved. This is, above all, the result of better management of funds in the area of agriculture and natural resources, which has been our biggest headache over the last few years. For the first time, Mr Caldeira, you do not give an adverse opinion in your report and that is good news. The report highlights the fact that wherever the EU itself controls and administers the funds, there is proper budget management. Whether it is efficient is another matter. I would like to congratulate Mr Kallas warmly in this respect. It is to your credit and during your period of office that this visible improvement has taken place. Congratulations! However, it is now the responsibility of the Member States in particular to improve their control systems. If there is continuing cause for criticism of budgetary management in the EU, this is not at an EU level – as we have now seen – but at the level of the Member States. This is where the problems lie. Cohesion policy, for example, which is implemented by the Member States and which receives around a third of the funds, is the major problem area. You say that 11% is irregular and the non-attached Member said that the figure was EUR 4 billion. That is not correct. It is over EUR 2.5 billion, which you specifically state is taxpayers’ money that should not have been spent. We must say this quite clearly and we must introduce clear controls. However, the consequence is that the European Commission must continue to exert pressure on the Member States and we will support you in this area, Mr Kallas. We must implement a policy of naming and shaming. We must publicly shame the wasteful Member States, which continue to exist, and describe the situation clearly. Overall, you come to the conclusion that the regulations must be simplified. We would like to support you in this and we would like to add one other request. There must be an increased focus not only on regularity but also on efficiency, to ensure that taxpayers’ money is spent correctly. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am speaking as head of the delegation to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and I will be concentrating on this country. I would like to offer my very warm thanks to Mr Rehn for his courage. His report and his green light for this country represent a bold step forward which has generated momentum. At the same time, elections have been held in Greece and there is a new government in Athens, which gives us a situation and a window in which we can achieve something. However, I would like to ask my fellow Members to react calmly. A meeting is being held on Friday between Mr Papandreou and Prime Minister Gruevski, and if we set expectations too high, we may increase the pressure so much that the whole thing falls apart and we do not want to risk that. We must encourage all sides to continue in friendship along the path that has already been taken. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Thaler, for describing this route so accurately. I would also like to wish my friend, Mr Rehn, a successful future in the Commission. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Madam President, thank you very much for the question. I believe that both sides need to change their spots and it is clear that both sides are ready to take a step forward. We are now expecting a lasting solution. For this reason, I expect the name issue to be resolved clearly and definitively in the course of a five-minute discussion. That is not the problem. The application of the name, the so-called scope, is the major issue and both sides obviously need time to resolve it. I would like to see a lasting solution because the alternative is a short-term solution which could lead to disaster. For this reason, all of us must give both sides friendly encouragement to find a long-term solution with a broad scope and a broad application. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner Kallas, first of all, I very much welcome the fact that the Swedish Presidency of the Council is present, and I would also like to personally thank Mrs Malmström for having made the procedure more transparent. Everything that my fellow Members have said is true – the procedure is more transparent, and even if she expressed herself in a somewhat more cautious manner today, we can still say that we will be granting discharge. There is still a very long way to go. We ask the Council to follow this first step with further steps, especially given that the Council’s competences in the field of foreign and security policy have been much more clearly defined under the Treaty of Lisbon. In future, this policy will also have a face, in the shape of Baroness Ashton. The citizens, however, did not previously know Baroness Ashton, and they, the European taxpayers, will still not know, in future, exactly how much money she has at her disposal and what she does with it. We must change this state of affairs. This, indeed, is an absolute must in a time where we are actually fighting for a transparent, democratic Europe. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Søndergaard for having applied pressure in our – Parliament’s – name, and we will maintain that pressure. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,

 Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, today we are debating a motion for resolution on neurodegenerative diseases. The intention is actually for this to become a directive, and so next time, we should also be debating a directive on this subject. The diseases that we are discussing today – Alzheimer’s disease, although Parkinson’s disease is also referred to in the text – are diseases of the brain which constitute a major challenge for Europe. The long-term costs are set to soar and there is still a lot of research to do. Unfortunately, there is a lot of duplicated research and bureaucracy in Europe. Thus, with this motion for a resolution, we want to eliminate the duplicated research, bureaucracy and fragmentation. The Group of the United European Left – Nordic Green Left has tabled a motion for the research results to be made publicly available. I think this motion is a good one. Unfortunately, the wording is wrong, and I would therefore ask for it to be reworded so that it can be incorporated better. Essentially, there is a problem with regard to European patents. It would be good if the Commission, and the Council, too, could take up the subject of European patents in the areas of pharmaceuticals and bio-research and make it clear that we need this. In any case, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports this motion for a resolution. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

Madam President, I'm delighted to be given the opportunity of taking the floor in the first meeting to be chaired by you. I am very pleased, in fact! Most of all, however, I would like to thank Commissioner Špidla for having spoken German, and I would like to express my heartfelt congratulations to Commissioner Kroes. Many people believe that the Opel-Vauxhall case is a German issue. It is not – it is a European issue! It relates to jobs all across Europe, and special treatment here for Germany would not be right. I am therefore particularly pleased to see that the Commission is willing to examine this case. The issues at hand are questions under European law in relation to competition law and State aid. We do want to save every job, but at what price? As counsel for the citizens and taxpayers, it is unclear in the Opel-Magna deal what long-term commitments will be laid at taxpayers’ doors. The Opel case is also questionable from an industrial policy point of view. It is always only the biggest who receive help. The smallest and those in the middle are left to look after themselves, yet they are the backbone of the economy. The fixation on one investor was clearly a wrong move. Better and more favourable offers were turned down early on – and by politicians, in fact. The Opel case has more to do with electioneering than with economic and industrial policy that is pure and above board from the point of view of EU law. To restate the point, it is important the Commission now plays an active role, even if the German Government does not approve. The Opel deal is a sham. That is becoming ever more obvious. It could mark the most expensive election campaign in the history of Germany. We want Opel to survive, we want it to be healthy and we want to fight for every job, but we do not want there to be costs involved, nor do we want a solution at the expense of our European partners, on whom Germany, as the biggest exporter in the world, is also dependent.

Mr President, Commissioner, dear colleagues, thank you for the opportunity to raise the issue of non-preferential rules of origin with you in plenary today. ‘Better late than never’, I feel compelled to say, as we already tabled this question about a year ago. This was at a time when the internal market and the Committee on International Trade were drafting their report on the modernisation of the customs code. Nevertheless it is still important to have this discussion on the proposed introduction of the ‘list rules’, as my colleague already mentioned, for the non-preferential origin of goods, and hear the Commission’s answers to our questions. This is all the more important as business and customs officials fear the rise of new bureaucratic burdens if these rules for the determination of the origin were to be changed. My colleagues from the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection have been working intensively on the recast of the Union Customs Code and adopted their report with a broad majority at the end of last year. The report states very clearly that the current concept for the determination of non-preferential origin of goods should be maintained. This is, and I quote, ‘when they underwent their last substantial economically justified processing or working’. This definition is very clear and has served as a solid basis in international trade for decades, so why change it? The Commission says the introduction of list rules would bring greater legal certainty for the determination of origin and in anti-dumping cases. Well, in my view this is quite a theoretical approach. Practitioners have been complaining that the legal certainty is not improved, and anti-dumping cases only involve 0.7% of all imports into the EU. So I think we should stick to the saying: ‘If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’. From the perspective of international trade, the proposed changes are particularly sensitive. They would have obliged EU importers to comply with the new EU rules instead of applying the domestic laws of origin as is currently the case. We should be very careful with such requests to our trade partners as it would also mean that EU producers would have to apply the multitude of rules of origin of the multitude of destination countries to which we are exporting. Knowing you, Commissioner De Gucht, I think it is not your intention to make trade more complicated for EU producers. So I would like to thank you for being here tonight and I am looking forward to hearing your answers on the questions we have raised. Silvana Koch-Mehrin,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group

 Madam President, while Russia and the European Union enjoy a very intertwined and intense relationship and today we are not only neighbours, but fortunately we are friends, the Liberals and Democrats also welcome the accession of Russia to the WTO after eighteen years of negotiations. It was high time indeed. I think it is good news for Russia but also for the European Union. Why? Because we can hope for a relationship based on clear rules and clear applicability. If we look at what happened to China after it joined the WTO, we can see that the growth and the success story of China really began with that date a few years ago. So I hope this will happen for Russia as well and that Russia can also envisage an extreme success story after the significant date in August this year. But I would also like to raise two concerns, two challenges. One has already been mentioned by Mr Sefčovič and other colleagues, and that is that Russia does not seem to be willing to live up 100 % to its obligations which come with the accession to the WTO but is instead undertaking some extensive and potentially restrictive trade measures like the examples which have already been mentioned. The second point I would like to make is that we have to look at the business environment in Russia. Russia has always been a very proud nation with a rich culture, with inventions and esprit
; Nobel Prize winners and astronauts have come from Russia. We all know about these important landmarks in Russian history. But why is it that today – apart from maybe vodka, caviar and Gazprom – we do not really know of any Russian brands? Why is it that they do not really thrive? Why are there not Russian success stories? I think this has to do with the applicability of the rule of law and human rights, and I think it is good that it has been raised in our resolution. It comes in a timely manner, because next week we go to Moscow and can discuss it there. Silvana Koch-Mehrin,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, every aspect of European trade policy has changed. The policy has a completely new legal basis and it is particularly obvious that the new Treaty has had major consequences for the European Parliament. The subject we are currently discussing concerns what at first sight are technical questions and these involve complex concepts, such as the introduction of delegated acts and the adoption of implementing provisions. However, behind these concepts lie tangible trade policy interests. We only need to think of the time limits for anti-dumping procedures or for the regulations on anti-subsidy instruments. In these cases, time really is money. The new requirements for transparency in the case of non-confidential information are also of great interest to the general public. Ms Quisthoudt-Rowohl has already mentioned the subject of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). If we had had more transparency in this area right from the beginning, who knows how many of the discussions could have been avoided. I think that at this point, I simply need to give my thanks to the rapporteur, who has guided us confidently through this subject and has managed the cooperation with her fellow Members very well. I hope that we will very soon reach a conclusion in this area. Silvana Koch-Mehrin  (ALDE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, who in Europe is still talking about votes for women? The answer is that nobody is nowadays, as we take women’s right to vote for granted. How was that situation brought about? It was done through legislation, through compulsion, in other words. I therefore think it is important that we should also introduce gender quotas today through legislation. The result would be that we would not have to talk about it any more, as it would be just as self-evident as women’s right to vote. Voluntary self-imposed obligations either do not work or are not even entered into, and this applies just as much to the economy as to politics. In a representative democracy such as Europe, the majority of the population, which is to say women, must actually be represented accordingly in politics. Yet the reality in the parliaments and in the parties is something quite different. When it comes to the economy, numerous studies have shown that an equal distribution of women and men in executive positions considerably improves the economic success of a company. Moreover, it is also the case that the decision on whether or not to buy something is taken by women for nearly every product. As a liberal, I stand for competition, and I stand for a free and fair market economy. However, both of these only work when basic conditions are in place that permit that very freedom and fairness. Those conditions are not in place for women when it comes to executive positions. I therefore look forward, Ms Reding, to the proposals that you will be bringing forward in May on the participation of more women in executive positions. It is, I would say, high time for that to happen. Silvana Koch-Mehrin,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Petitions

 Mr President, in the Committee on Petitions we are concerned with ensuring that the European Ombudsman receives adequate funding. The office of the European Ombudsman is an important European body. It provides assistance to citizens and resolves problems and errors in the institutions. It also brings the EU closer to its citizens. In the 2012 budget there is very moderate increase of 0.47% for the European Ombudsman. For example, no new posts have been requested and no new employees will be appointed. Nevertheless, the Council wanted to make some cuts. Therefore, I would like to thank the Committee on Budgets for reversing these cuts and I hope that we can confirm the committee’s position today. This would send out a signal that the EU needs to move closer to its citizens. Silvana Koch-Mehrin,

 Madam President, this is certainly an important subject; we are all aware of that. Before the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, the national parliaments were constantly complaining that 80% of the laws they passed were actually decided by Europe; that they were simply rubber-stamping it as a kind of agent of the EU. The Treaty of Lisbon has changed that. The national parliaments play a leading role and can exert an influence. The Treaty of Lisbon has made the EU more democratic because it has given greater power to the representatives of the people. This applies to the European Parliament just as much as to the national parliaments. The national parliaments then continued to complain nonetheless; this time, about the increased workload, the mountains of documents constantly landing on their desks with just a few weeks for them to respond. The important thing, however, is that the representatives of the people in Europe’s capitals now have a means of exerting influence over the European Union’s initiatives – and I get the impression that the national parliaments are increasingly realising this and making use of it. Almost two years have now passed since the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force on 1 December 2009, when these procedures also took effect. I and a few of my fellow Members therefore felt that the time was right to ask how the Commission sees the situation now. Is it satisfied with the quality of the response from the national parliaments? How does the Commission deal with this? Does it have sufficient resources – including human resources – to deal with it? Moreover, in some Member States, the regions are important, such as the Bundesländer
 in the case of Germany. How is input from this political level dealt with? Does it have sufficient resonance? Is there also adequate cooperation with the Committee of the Regions? These are the questions put jointly by Andrew Duff, Alexandra Thein, Michael Theurer and myself. I look forward to hearing your answer. President.

 In the vote on the Lange report, I am abstaining on paragraph 31 because of the ambiguous wording of the vote, which refers to Eurobonds as well as project bonds. However, taking it as a whole, I am voting for the report, as I have nothing against project bonds in themselves. Project bonds serve as finance for extensive innovation, infrastructure and reindustrialisation projects. This is not a question of instruments for the communitarisation of debts, as would be the case with Eurobonds. Silvana Koch-Mehrin,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the equality of all human beings is enshrined in the first two articles of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This states: ‘All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood’. What a wonderful sentence. However, even one hundred years after the first International Women’s Day, we still have not achieved this: there is still no sign of true equality between men and women. Granted, we have achieved at great deal in Europe. Today, our primary concern is no longer the legal freedom of women. We have largely achieved this freedom. I would like to express my gratitude to the feminists, both male and female, for their work in the past. Today, our main concern is freedom in action, that men should take ownership of the issue of the compatibility of work and family life, and that seeing women at the top in business or politics is something that should become commonplace. It is fantastic to see how the liberation movements in North Africa look to us, the women of Europe. They look to us to play a pioneering role. It is vitally important that we do not lose sight of our goal: the freedom to live our lives according to our own conceptions. That is when equality will become something we take for granted and when International Women’s Day will be transformed from a day of remembrance to a day to celebrate freedom. President.

Madam President, Mr Oettinger, it is good that you have commissioned the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks to look at this issue again. I am pleased about this. However, the question remains: How can we explain to the citizens of Europe that they have to allow something into their houses under EU regulations which represents a health hazard for their children? You have children and you know how it is. Things often get broken. Mr Leichtfried from Austria and I are very concerned about this. How can we make it clear that this is something dangerous? We do not seem to be able to learn from past mistakes. However, you were not responsible for the original decision, so you can show a willingness to learn without losing face. You could have said that we will withdraw this ban, at least for private households. Would you be prepared to reconsider your decision? President.

 Mr President, competition policy is one of the most important, central policy areas of the EU. Good competition policy enables markets to function properly. Good competition policy also allows consumers to benefit from a wide variety of products at reasonable and affordable prices. Good competition policy also contributes to creating growth again in Europe. That is why it is so important, Commissioner, to include all the areas that you have mentioned in competition policy. It is also important to strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises, as they are the driving force behind growth in Europe. Market barriers must be abolished, which also means doing away with the excessive costs that still pertain where competition is not working, such as roaming charges on mobile phones, where competition still does not exist – something that needs to be changed. Finally, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Eppink, for his excellent work, and to the Commission I would say: be ambitious in your goals. (Applause) President.

 Combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography is vitally important. We must use all our strength to combat the availability of child pornography in communications networks. The permanent and effective control of child abuse is both a political responsibility and a precept of the rule of law. The German Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament is of the opinion that it is necessary to remove such criminal content as quickly as possible. President.

– As far as the list of speakers is concerned, the cause is being looked into. President.  
– Mr Ouzký, many thanks once again for bringing this to our attention. We have looked into it. It was a problem in the allocation caused by the computer system.

 Supplementary questions using the blue card are not permitted during the one-minute speeches. Thus, it was not a point of order. Your fellow Member could perhaps answer your question on a one-to-one basis, but in any case not during the plenary debate. President. - 
 Thank you very much. As you can imagine, as President of the High Level Group on Gender Equality and Diversity, equality is very important to me. We have a list of speakers and we did try to make it balanced. Who gets the opportunity to speak during the debate is, of course, also dependent on who is actually present. That concludes this item.

) (A7-0035/2010
). President.  
– Blue card questions on a personal comment under Rule 151 are not permitted. Your request to speak on this point therefore cannot be accepted. President.  
– Many thanks. We will now continue with the debate. I allowed the personal explanation because the previous point of order referred directly to Mr Martin. We will now go on with the debate and also devote our full attention to it. President.  
– We had a technical problem here, so it was somewhat longer than a minute. However, the clock is now working again, and hopefully everything should now go according to the set timetable. President.

– The next item is the one-minute speeches in accordance with Rule 150. Rule 150 states that we may spend a maximum of 30 minutes on this item. We had more than 74 requests to speak under this item. That will clearly not be possible. Thirty minutes and 74 speakers for one minute will simply not work. Therefore, we have, for the first time, selected in advance the Members who will be granted speaking time using clear criteria, namely that those who requested speaking time in another debate with one-minute speeches but did not get chance to speak will now be granted speaking time where possible, whereas those who have already spoken in other debates will not be granted any speaking time. All of those who have not been granted speaking time were informed of this in advance by e-mail. Therefore, they do not need to be here to wait in vain for their speaking time. I hope that you understand that. This was the only possible way to enable the debate to proceed in an orderly manner. Therefore, those who have been granted speaking time can now begin straight away. President.  
– That concludes this item. Thank you all for your understanding and for the disciplined proceedings. I hope that all of those who did not have an opportunity to speak this time will get the chance to do so next time. President.

– The next item is the statement by the Commission on International Climate Policy post-Copenhagen: Reinvigorating the international negotiations through immediate action. President.  
– Ladies and gentlemen, more Members have not been able to speak than have had the opportunity to do so. There was not enough time. I hope that you understand that. Thank you all for this disciplined debate. Thank you, Commissioner. I hope that we will see each other more often here in plenary. I am sure that will be the case. The debate is closed.

According to the resolution of the European Parliament on the draft general budget for the financial year 2010, adopted on 17 December 2009, a vote was taken today on the amending budget for the European Parliament, following the revised calculations made by the Parliamentary administration. The FDP in the European Parliament abstained, because there was a paragraph in the package of amendments concerned that we could not reconcile with our convictions. The FDP had already expressed its opposition to an increase in the secretarial allowance to EUR 1 500 during the discussions in committee. It is out of the secretarial allowance that MEPs’ assistants are paid. The FDP considers that the argument that more money is needed due to the additional work that MEPs have to do with the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is unsound, as there is nothing in past experience to support this. Certainly, due to the Treaty of Lisbon, which has just come into force, Parliament will overall need extra capacity for legislative work, but with the introduction of the Assistants’ Statute from the beginning of the current parliamentary term, there is still no proof that MEPs actually need more assistants. For this reason, there are grounds for concern that further demands and supplementary increases, or an extension of office capacity, will follow. For this reason, the FDP in the European Parliament abstained. President.

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Spain is now taking on the Presidency of the European Union for the fourth time. You know what it is to cooperate with the European Parliament in a very wide range of situations. We now have the Treaty of Lisbon, which means that the European Parliament is now your key contact partner. In your programme, you say that you want the EU to take root in the will of those who render it legitimate, namely European citizens. That is a very ambitious aim. The path to achieving it can only be found via the representatives of European citizens, in other words the parliaments. I am therefore very pleased to hear you say that cooperation between the national parliaments, the parliaments of the EU Member States, and the European Parliament is the cornerstone of such a path. You want to bring the parliaments closer together in order to bring citizens closer together. That is a good thing. You have a great responsibility in this regard, as you are the first Presidency following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. Other Presidencies will use you as an example. You are therefore creating the blueprint, so to speak. I would like subsequent presidencies to have to measure themselves against you where cooperation structures are concerned. I wish you much success! Silvana Koch-Mehrin  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Reinfeldt, your calm and steady Presidency was a success. You had difficult political issues to resolve and overall you did a good job. The people chosen by you for the important new EU posts can now define these without any preconceived ideas, as they are as yet largely unknown to most European citizens. As an aside, if I may say so, your best decision is sitting on your right. Nevertheless, Mr Reinfeldt, I cannot give your Presidency full marks. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, you increased the development towards making the European Council into a kind of EU ‘supergovernment’. Its comprehensive jurisdiction is increasing, from the environment to financial policy. At the same time, you are closing the doors ever tighter. This is not what transparent debates by representatives of the people look like. The second reason is this: the fact that you pushed SWIFT through the Council just hours before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon demonstrates a clear disregard for the European Parliament and hence a lack of respect for the citizens. Nevertheless, I would like to thank you for the last six months. President.

 Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would also like to thank our colleague Ms Thyssen for her extremely detailed and largely balanced report. We have known for some time that the euro area can only be successful in the long term if it achieves greater integration and actually becomes a genuine economic, financial and monetary union. What that means in detail and what measures need to be taken emerge from the report put forward by Mr Rompuy this summer. This report was drawn up by four Presidents. There is one President missing, however, namely President Martin Schulz, the representative of our House. To me this demonstrates the little esteem in which our House is actually held by the Council. This is also made clear by the fact that the Council is now trying to rush through a very important issue, namely the introduction of a powerful supervisory mechanism for the banking sector at the European Central Bank, with Parliament once again having been assigned nothing more than a role on the sidelines. I do not consider this to be compatible with the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon and I believe that the Council’s ‘sink or swim’ policy towards Parliament is doomed to failure in the long term.

 Mr President, … am not satisfied with the collaboration between Parliament and the Council on this point. The Crisis Committee’s proposals, some of which the Council is now taking up, were hardly commented on by the Council in any way at the time the report was presented, let alone adopted. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

Mr President, Commissioner, two years ago the European Parliament came to the conclusion that the European internal market for financial services also needs European supervision and it proposed establishing this supervision with, but not in, the European Central Bank, so as not to put the Bank’s independence at risk. The Commission now suggests establishing such supervision within the ECB and first focusing its work on the financial institutions of the euro area. The European internal market for financial service providers involves more than just the euro area, however. For this reason I believe it is crucial for us to act as quickly as possible to place not only the financial institutions of the euro area under this supervision, but also the entire European Union. The first step should be at least to place all the countries that have committed themselves to introducing the euro, in other words all countries except Denmark and the United Kingdom, under this supervision. It is important that this supervision should not become a bureaucratic monster. That is why it is crucial that the share-out of tasks between the ECB and the national supervisory bodies should be clarified quickly. It is also necessary to clarify the share-out of tasks between the ECB and the European Banking Authority (EBA). Democratic legitimation has been mentioned more than once here. The key is that the accountability of this supervision is assured without putting the independence of the bank at risk. One more point: the project must be implemented in such a way that citizens have no reason to be even more Eurosceptic. Be careful in your use of national rescue, resolution and deposit guarantee funds. Our citizens see this as their money and want it to be used in their own countries. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have a massive crisis of confidence, and therefore expectations of the last summit were relatively high. The summit was scarcely any different from earlier summits, with one exception: seldom have the negotiating tactics – which sometimes bordered on blackmail – and the differences between the negotiating partners been played out so clearly to the outside world as this time. In the end, agreement was reached on Friday morning. However, it turns out that, when it comes down to it, the consensus reached was only a formal compromise, which was then called into question again just 72 hours after being reached. The Dutch and the Finns have already announced that they do not support the buying of government bonds on the secondary market. The markets, which had, until then, reacted positively, are now also beginning to question and smear the result. I expressly welcome the fact that it was decided at the summit to get serious about creating a real banking union. If we have a common economic area and currency area, then we also need a genuine functioning internal market for financial services. Naturally, that includes bank supervision, but it also includes a banking resolution and rescue fund, and ultimately it also includes a deposit guarantee system. All that will take time, and I hope that the European Parliament will be adequately taken into consideration at least in the first step, the construction of supervision at the European Central Bank, and things will not continue as they have done recently. This summit was definitely not the great breakthrough. It was not a great act of liberation. The citizens are just as uncertain as before, and I fear that we will continue to muddle along. I can only hope that we have enough time in which to find the ultimate solution. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 The German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament has spoken out clearly in favour of the introduction of a debt redemption fund. However, participation in such a fund must be associated with clear and strict rules, such as were contained in the proposal made by the German Council of Economic Experts to the German Government in autumn 2011. Watering down the criteria for participation is neither productive nor effective. Linking the introduction of a debt redemption fund with the eurobonds project and the treatment of economic imbalances is unfair, and is rejected by the FDP in the European Parliament in the strongest possible terms. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis goes on. The measures adopted in recent months, or even years, have failed to convince the markets on a durable basis. There is an urgent need for the Member States to take seriously a disciplined, balanced budgetary policy. The ‘two-pack’ can help to make progress in that direction. It can provide the basis for stability and growth. However, a whole series of amendments are once again being tabled, with the aim of watering down the proposals. We do not need a watered-down ‘two-pack’, however. What we do require is a genuine act of release. This act of release could consist of two elements. The first element would be the debt redemption fund already mentioned by a number of speakers, which would help to consolidate the inherited debts and spread them out over a period of 25 years. The second element would be that we have to achieve real progress in the conversion of the euro area into a true internal financial market, in other words, into an internal market with cross-border banking supervision, a cross-border deposit guarantee fund and a uniform cross-border banking rescue and resolution regime. Wolf Klinz,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, all products and services are taxed, so one might well ask why financial transactions should not be taxed also. I can therefore fully understand the idea behind taxing such transactions. The financial sector has, after all, caused considerable damage in recent years, and is not exactly without blame for the difficult situation that we currently find ourselves in, particularly in Europe. The speculative losses of JPMorgan Chase that recently came to light bear witness once again to the fact that the financial industry really has not yet learnt from past mistakes. It seems that the greed of some players has still not been assuaged. The Commission has tabled a very creative proposal, and the residence principle that it has proposed has been supplemented by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs with the issuance and the ownership principles. Together, these should actually ensure that the risk of financial transactions being shifted out of the EU to other regions of the world can be relatively well averted. Nonetheless, naturally, there are still issues outstanding. Unlike the Commissioner, I feel that we should, in fact, exempt pension funds, because I do not see why savers who are putting aside money for their old age should be penalised. Moreover, there are naturally a few questions regarding the practical implementation of how the tax is levied that have yet to be clarified, and last but not least, how the revenue is actually going to be used. What will go to the EU and what will go to the Member States? In our approach to resolving this, there are two things that we should not lose sight of. Firstly, we must not weaken Europe. Secondly, we must ensure that we do not fragment Europe further. We have to achieve the exact opposite – not fragmentation, but as much progress as possible on the harmonisation of our taxes. A global introduction of the tax is not feasible at present; we know that. Regrettably, we cannot introduce it EU-wide either. It appears that the British veto cannot be broken. The rapporteur’s suggestion that we proceed now by means of enhanced cooperation does not seem to me to be sufficient. If we were to push ahead with only nine or ten Member States, we would actually be contributing to further fragmentation in Europe. That is not what we want. That is why I feel that as a minimum, we must have all 17 euro area members plus a couple more on board. We therefore have to look for alternatives that would enable all countries to participate. I feel that we could even take the UK’s stamp duty as a starting point, and then of course expand it and include not just shares, but also bonds, derivatives and professional dealers. If we content ourselves with the current proposal and the mechanism of enhanced cooperation, then I believe we will be going down the wrong route.

 I did, in fact, say that the matter of how the resources will be used has not yet been finally decided. How much will go to Brussels and how much will remain with the Member States is still a matter of debate. Even among the Member States, it has not yet been settled which Member State would receive the funds. Once we have fundamentally settled this issue and know how much is going to the EU budget in Brussels, then we can think about the question that you have raised. At the moment, it would be purely speculation. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I subscribe to your opinion that the highly indebted countries will only be able to extract themselves from their predicament through a combination of growth and austerity. Some of what you propose – such as European Investment Bank (EIB) financed infrastructure projects – could indeed make them more competitive and thus contribute to growth. However, much of what you say reminds me of what Christine Lagarde of the International Monetary Fund is proposing – namely, taking on more debt in order to stimulate growth. At the end of the day, such additional financial injections would be just a flash in the pan, and there would be nothing to show for it afterwards other than even higher levels of debt, even higher unemployment and even higher inflation. We experienced that in Germany in the 1970s, when Helmut Schmidt tried precisely that. What we are dealing with is not a cyclical problem, but rather a structural weakness. If we are to overcome it, we need courageous structural reforms. Unfortunately, we are seeing little of that in the countries concerned. We need to complete the internal market, including the services sector. We need to open up protected markets, we need to make the labour market more flexible and we need to get rid of red tape. All that can happen without taking any more money, and it would still lead to growth. Wolf Klinz,

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of February, I had the opportunity to travel with several Members of this House to Burma, or Myanmar, as it now calls itself. To me, it was like a small miracle when President Thein Sein, a former member of the military junta, gave us a relatively credible explanation of his desire for reform. The critical test came at the beginning of this month, when the by-elections took place. It was very impressive to see how the opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who previously had to operate in secret, achieved an overwhelming victory, despite the fact that obstacles were occasionally placed in the way of her election campaign. However, one thing must be clear to us. Her party, the National League for Democracy, is still a very small party. It currently has only just over 40 seats. Therefore, the way in which it develops over the next few weeks, months and years will be decisive. The crucial landmark will be the 2015 elections. This is when it will become clear whether the citizens of Burma really have the opportunity to elect their members of parliament and their government freely, fairly and without outside influence. Until then, the reform process must continue at a rapid pace. It is essential that those who are currently in power make genuine progress and go on with the work that they have started. They must release the remaining political prisoners, as Mr Belet has already said. They must come to a ceasefire in the feuds that they are having with different ethnic groups and ultimately bring about peace. They must offer their citizens full democratic rights, such as freedom of expression in speech and writing, including on the Internet, in schools and in universities. They must ensure that there is a free and independent press and an independent judicial system. They must begin the systematic process of establishing the structures of a social market economy. We, together with our private sector, can and must help them to achieve this. As Burma introduces more democracy and freedom for its people, so the West can reduce its sanctions or even lift them altogether. It is in all our interests for Burma to free itself from China’s embrace and to overcome the mass poverty among its citizens. Wolf Klinz,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when the Lehman Brothers Bank in New York collapsed in March 2008, the global financial crisis reached its first high point. For small-scale savers and depositors, this crisis began a year earlier, when Northern Rock in the United Kingdom ran into difficulties and long queues of depositors suddenly began to form outside bank buildings, with customers waiting to withdraw their money. This was not just limited to Northern Rock, but was also evident in other banks too. The uncertainty among savers, in particular small-scale depositors, was enormous, which was why national governments found themselves forced to guarantee investments above the contractually guaranteed minimum level. Some states, like Germany and Ireland, actually guaranteed deposits to an unlimited extent, something that could not be sustained in the long term. The divergence between the deposit guarantee schemes in Europe came at a price at the time. That is why the Commission rightly said that we must ensure order and we must present a uniform deposit guarantee scheme for all 27 Member States of the European Union. It did this in an extremely convincing and acceptable way. The gaps were closed, depositor security was strengthened and a broad degree of harmonisation was established. As representatives of Parliament, we support this proposal. We had thought that we could have tabled one or two improvements. Unfortunately, as Mr Balz has already explained, our negotiations with the Council have been unsuccessful to date. Nonetheless, we are not giving up hope, but believe that we may still succeed in the coming months. The following is an important point, however: a deposit guarantee scheme protects depositors and is therefore necessary. However, it is even more important that it should not run out of money. Even more important again is that insolvency, or even difficulty, should be avoided, and that we should have preventive measures in place. That is why we urgently await the Commission’s presentation of the crisis and process management dossier. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union stands at an absolutely crucial crossroads. We need to deepen integration, especially in the fields of financial and economic policy. We need a strong Commissioner who combines the functions that are currently spread between the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Euro, the President of the Euro Group, a different Finance Minister every six months and the regent of economics Herman Van Rompuy into a single role and who represents the EU and the euro area to the outside world. If that does not succeed, we will not even be able to defend the status quo
, we will then inevitably find ourselves in a disintegration phase. We do not want a union of debt. We need a union of stability, and that is why the solution does not consist of issuing Eurobonds. Only today, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) had to pay 200 basis points more for its bond issues than Germany. The situation is getting worse – the bonds already issued are quoted far below face value. We need to attempt to also raise reserves that we still have in every Member State. The whole issue of the subsidies must be approached. In my country alone this is certainly a high two-digit, maybe even a three-digit, figure in billions that thus can be adjusted in the budget, with the effect of raising taxes. Mr Trichet hit the nail on the head today when he said that time is of the essence. The reality is that we must act fast or else the markets will continue to set the course for politics.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis was established in autumn 2009, many observers commented that it was too late. It should have been launched a year earlier and the crisis was almost over, they said. Today, we find ourselves not in the first or second year following the crisis, but rather in the fourth year of the crisis. The problem is still ongoing. Fukushima has shown that, one day, everything that can possibly go wrong will go wrong. It was a similar story with the global financial crisis. Numerous negative factors coincided and, if it were not for the decisive action by the European Union and the USA, things might have hit a new low, leading to economic melt-down and a repeat of the great depression of the last century. Happily, this has been avoided. However, we now have the so-called debt crisis or the euro crisis in Europe. We have been in the grip of this problem for eighteen months now. I get the impression that Europe’s decision makers have not been providing active leadership for the last year-and-a-half. They react to market distortions and turbulences in the market, but they do not act with foresight on the basis of a clear vision of where they want to take Europe. That is what is missing. There is a lack of vision, and our citizens have the impression that it is business as usual for those who caused the crisis: profits are privatised, losses are socialised and the actual issues are side-stepped. That is where our report has its starting point. It makes proposals for the overall direction of the future development of the European Union and the euro area. Mrs Berès explained these proposals in detail and Mr Karas also discussed them. I do not need to go into further detail at this point. There is one important point to note, however, which is that Europe has reached an extremely critical turning point. If we do not choose the right path now, we will not even be able to maintain the status quo of the integration already achieved, and will instead find ourselves taking a step backwards. It is important that all of us who believe in Europe and who want to shape Europe’s future should support these ideas, addressing our citizens and the representatives of the national parliaments and trying to win them over to our cause.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we do not know precisely what role short selling or naked short selling played in the bankruptcies of Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers, but we do know that they made at least a substantial contribution to the collapse of these institutions. Claiming that naked short selling is useful for the market is as hard to prove as saying that it will be the end of the world if we do not prohibit it. We are dealing here with a highly complex, extremely technical area and I would not dare to claim that one thing or another was definitely right. However, it seems to me absurd to want to sell something that you do not even have, and moreover to want to do this on a speculative basis. It goes against my basic understanding of how one should behave in business. If I do not have the title to something then it is difficult for me to offer it for sale. Whether this is genuinely useful for the market is something that I am not in a position to judge. Perhaps it is – but my instinct suggests it is not. I would therefore suggest that we should deal with it by saying that shares, debt instruments and credit default swaps (CDSs) can only be offered for sale if you either hold the title or – if you do not hold the title – a loan agreement has been concluded or at least an agreement that says that the title will be available the next day or in a certain number of days’ time if the transaction is actually concluded and settled, so that no risk arises. I thought that the Council and Parliament had already agreed on this when they agreed the intraday rule. I regret to say that the Council has since moved away from this position, and I hope that it may find its way back to it. One thing is certain: in the final event, these are international transactions and it is therefore important for us to have very clear supervisory rules. It seems to me that the recently established European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) is the ideal institution to have a sole mandate to intervene in serious cases and to establish what needs to be prohibited, what needs at least to be recorded, where we need a repository, where we need a reporting requirement and so on. In this respect we have an ideal opportunity to use ESMA productively. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for a long time we believed that the internal market and the introduction of a common currency would automatically result in economic convergence and convergence of the Member States, and that the Maastricht criteria were sufficient to ensure discipline. Reality has now caught up with us. The management instruments have proved to be inadequate and in the past they have been grossly transgressed. A single currency and a single monetary policy are not feasible in the long term unless the rules have teeth in the area of fiscal, budgetary, economic and social policy. The EU is now trying a new approach. To speak metaphorically, it has one last shot. If this last shot fails to hit the target, the damage could be severe. The EU could find itself in a regressive phase, we could see the return of renationalisation and protectionism, and the first signs of disintegration in the euro area. The new package attempts to prevent this and to lay a new foundation. I am in favour of this package, even though I consider it rather half-hearted in view of the problems that I have just outlined. There is a risk that the European semester will turn out to be a centralist, bureaucratic exercise. The pact for the euro may possibly be toothless. What we need are binding recommendations from the Commission. What we need are automatic initiatives and sanctions which the Council can only stop by means of reversed qualified majority voting. This is undoubtedly necessary if the disgraceful, opaque wrangles by Council members in back rooms are finally to be brought to an end. What we urgently need is a clear resolution mechanism for the financial sector so that it can work again. Wolf Klinz,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, credit rating agencies certainly did not cause the global financial crisis, but, in my opinion, they were responsible to a significant extent for its severity. When the so-called structured financial products were developed in America on the basis of the subprime mortgages, the credit rating agencies supported this process by rating dozens, if not hundreds, of products each day in an almost conveyor-belt fashion. In so doing, they also accepted conflicts of interests, in that they supported the issuers with advice and help in designing these products. They continued to claim that they were only expressing an opinion, although they knew very well that their ratings were, in fact, being used as a seal of approval. My report deals with numerous deficiencies and puts forward proposals in the hope that the Commission will perhaps be able to include some of them in its legislative proposal that it will be tabling in the autumn. I put forward five proposals. The first is that the reliance on ratings must be reduced. In practice, we have found that the regulatory environment has led to the use of ratings being absolutely essential, by banks, insurance companies, pension funds etc. which invest their money. Basel II made this very clear and, in fact, the credit rating agencies have become regulatory certification bodies. We need to make it possible once again for market operators, particularly institutional investors, which possess their own expertise to actually take responsibility themselves and not outsource the responsibility for investment decisions. It needs to be made clear that investors should only invest if they actually understand the product and cannot use the excuse that they can, to a certain extent, automatically make a triple A product the goal of their investment strategy. Secondly, we must ensure that the information on which credit rating agencies base their decisions is made publicly available, that it is understood, and that the models used are also known. That will lead to transparency and will also make it easier for institutional investors seeking to invest to make their own decisions. It will also help to enable unsolicited ratings to be given. In this connection, we should also consider whether the proposal that the United States is considering is a sensible one, namely, that where only one credit rating agency is chosen by issuers, a second, independent body could be encouraged to give a rating and this second body could be allowed to work on the basis of the information that is publicly available. Thirdly, we need more competition. We have a de facto oligopoly. The three credit rating agencies that exist and operate worldwide control 95% of the global business. They have a so-called monopoly income of 40% return on turnover, and therefore I am proposing that we set up a European credit rating agency. It should be based on a foundation model and the start-up financing should be provided by the finance sector by means of interest-bearing loans. After five years, we will know whether it is working and then this credit rating foundation will also have to pay back the funds that it has received. However, I am sure that there are also other options. It would also make sense to perhaps allow national and regional credit rating agencies to operate in the form of a European network. Fourthly, we still have an outstanding matter with regard to the payment model. Currently, we have an issuer-pays model. That is the model that essentially works throughout the world. Thus, the issuer pays, but clearly there is a conflict of interests here that we could reduce if there was no more advising of issuers and if the staff of the supervisory bodies was genuinely independent. Other possible models include a subscriber-pays model. Here, there is obviously the risk of conflicts of interest as well as of this being an invitation to freeloaders. Therefore, this needs consideration. The third option would be a performance-based payment, in other words, an up-front payment and then the final payment only once it is clear how good the rating is. The last, but important, point is that we must introduce liability. Credit rating agencies must accept responsibility for what they actually do, and therefore I believe that we should make them liable, obviously not for the rating as such, but for failures and negligence in their work. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

Madam President, Mr Barroso, Mr Van Rompuy, listening to you carefully one gets the impression that everything is ship-shape: the euro is secure, we have a new Stability and Growth Pact, we have an ESM and we have a Euro Plus Pact. I would say this quite clearly: ‘While I have heard the message, I am not sure I believe it.’ We should not lose sight of the starting point for all these deliberations and measures, namely the run-away debt of some euro Member States, the loss of competitiveness, economic distortions and, as a consequence, an increasing current account deficit that has to be financed. It is already obvious that many Member States will not be able to meet the conditions of the new Stability and Growth Pact with the best will in the world. The ESM will not help to overcome economic distortions because no one has seriously faced up to the idea that a euro Member State could become insolvent and because the prospect of financial aid from the ESM will lead to further laxity. The so-called stringent regulations will prove to be relatively lightweight in practice. The need for unanimous resolutions is resulting in the horse-trading that was a familiar fixture in the past. Finally, the pact for the euro is much too non-committal to cause destitute countries to implement far-reaching real economic reforms. Overall, therefore, I fear that we will not succeed in eliminating the root cause of the problem. We shall have a permanent overdraft facility whose credit parameters will have to be increased at regular intervals. This will turn into a bottomless pit and the citizens in the states that will have to foot the bill will find themselves duped once again. Public confidence in Europe will decline even further as a result. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

Madam President, Mr Schulz is right. We are in the midst of a huge crisis of confidence and the members of the Council are pulling the wool over the citizens’ eyes. They are telling them that everything is under control, we just need to make small changes to the treaty by introducing a permanent stability mechanism and then the problem will be resolved. In fact, the situation is not under control. The Member States are reacting rather than actually taking action. They are desperately firefighting, but they cannot put out the flames. The markets are asking themselves: Who is actually in control in Europe and in the euro area? The EU has reached a critical turning point. If we do not choose the right path now, we will not even be able to maintain the status quo. Instead we will take a step backwards. What we need are further moves towards integration. We need more Europe. We must finish establishing the internal market, including the service sector. Alongside the monetary union, we need an economic, budgetary and fiscal union. We also need a strong Commission which has the right and the power to control and monitor this economic union and to impose sanctions automatically, in cases where this is justified. If we take these steps towards more integration, then we can talk about the introduction of eurobonds. Then we will have laid the foundations for them. However, during all of this we must ensure that we have the long-term investment funding that we need, despite all of the justifiable austerity measures, to secure the European Union’s competitive ability in the medium and long term. We must finally tell the citizens the truth. We need solutions without blinkers, we must discuss the issues without bringing in ideologies and we must stop trying to muddle through. What we require is action for the long term, rather than short-term reactions. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in a few weeks’ time, we will have a new supervisory structure in Europe, which has been shaped to a considerable extent by the European Parliament. Among these three new supervisory authorities will be one that is responsible for markets and securities: the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). ESMA will have the last word in connection with the registration and oversight of credit rating agencies and be responsible for ensuring that the credit rating agencies actually comply with the new regulations. If it so wishes, ESMA can delegate this cross-border responsibility to national supervisory authorities if these supervisory authorities are small and only operate nationally. This proposal is therefore nothing more than an adaptation of the regulation of April 2009 to the new circumstances, but it strengthens the role of ESMA. It gives the new supervisory authority more powers and – something that is completely new – it gives ESMA the power to punish non-application of the regulation. I very much welcome this, because I believe that strengthening the position of a new supervisory authority of European mould will genuinely increase its credibility on the market. I just have one point of criticism. When drawing up the regulation in April 2009, we took a political decision with regard to how we should deal with ratings from third countries in Europe. We said at that time that they can be used in Europe if they either comply with the equivalence procedure or are supported by a credit rating agency that is registered and approved in Europe, the so-called endorsement procedure. The Commission has now changed this at level 2 and said that endorsement will no longer be possible. Therefore, only the equivalence procedure actually applies. I consider this – as it was undertaken unilaterally – to be an undemocratic way of going about things, and I believe that we should stick to the decision that we made at the time in April 2009. As the Commissioner also mentioned, there are still a lot of outstanding issues where credit rating agencies are concerned, namely, the lack of competition, insufficient transparency, the business model as to whether the issuer or the investor should pay, which need to be looked at critically. There are questions with regard to the payment system and also with regard to excessive dependency, because in reality, it is the case that, as a result of regulatory provisions, many ratings agencies have become de facto regulatory certification authorities. I am taking this up in the own-initiative report, and I am pleased that the Commission is going to table a legislative proposal on this matter in the next year. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 Madam President, Mr Almunia, we need to bite the bullet now, rather than prolonging the agony. This is what comes to mind when I think about the subject that we are discussing today. I support the Commission proposal to phase out State aid in 2014 for the pits which are not competitive by that date. The cost of each job in the coal mining industry is much higher than the average. This money is not being spent on developing sustainable and competitive employment for the future. Therefore, I believe it is right to phase out state subsidies for uncompetitive mines in 2014. We must invest the money which becomes available in research and development and in education and training. This is the only way in which we can maintain our technological head start and remain competitive in the global economy as a whole. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

Madam President, Mr Trichet, we all know that the main task of the European Central Bank is to ensure monetary stability and that you can best achieve this aim by being politically independent. We have always supported you in this. The crises of the last two years have shown that you have a further task, and that is to ensure the stability of the financial markets and of the financial system. This task, too, you have performed very professionally and convincingly. However, to do so, you have had to accept being yoked together with the governments concerned. In other words, you were not able to act with complete political independence here; instead, you had to work together with the governments. I would be interested to know how exactly you would like to arrange this role in the future to ensure firstly, that you are independent, and secondly, that you can continue to perform this task properly without governments exploiting this opportunity to in fact undermine your independence.

 Mr President, after lengthy rounds of negotiations, Parliament, the Council and the Commission have finally agreed on a joint text for regulating alternative investment fund managers. I welcome this, and I have to correct Mr Goebbels: We wished to send the original proposal back because we believed that the alternative investment funds were so different – hedge funds, private equity funds and property funds – that they each need to be regulated separately. Nevertheless, we now have a text that we can fully accept and support. The all-embracing approach that we found disturbing at first has been amended in respect of key elements. As a result, we no longer have a problem with it. The goal of the directive was to create greater transparency for the supervisory bodies but, above all, for the investors, in order to be able to identify systemic risks in due time and at an early stage and so to be able to deal with them accordingly. Personally, I am in favour of rules that all fund managers operating in the EU have to abide by. At the same time, however, I do not like the idea of us turning Europe into a fortress or even a prison or of European institutions seeking to invest not being able to do so outside Europe. We were therefore initially unable to support the proposal as presented in committee. The compromise that has now been found solves this problem. It promises to keep the markets open. Another reason for our initial rejection was the regulations relating to the area of private equity, which would, in fact, have led to distortions of competition in this area. The requirements for private equity, as they were initially formulated, would have placed even listed companies under a definite disadvantage. The compromise that we now have before us eliminates this shortcoming and it prevents asset stripping, which is something that we expressly welcome. Overall, therefore, we are very pleased with the proposal. It creates clear framework conditions and rules for alternative investment fund managers. It will ensure greater transparency for identifying systemic risks. It will therefore ensure greater stability. It will strengthen the internal market because it introduces the EU passport, which, following a transitional period, will also be introduced for managers outside Europe. It will ensure clear, undistorted competition. Finally, it will establish a clear, new task for the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). To conclude, I would like to thank not only my fellow Members but, above all, the Belgian Presidency, which has brought this matter to a successful conclusion with its untiring efforts.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the height of the financial crisis, the G20 countries promised joint action to stabilise the financial markets. Today, two years later, we are still a long way away from a global answer. In many instances, the measures adopted pursue national interests and considerations. The initial energy has dissipated and all too often we are back to ‘business as usual’. Mervyn King of the Bank of England put it succinctly when he said: ‘The need to act in the collective interest has yet to emerge’. In its interim report, the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis makes it clear that Europe is at a critical crossroads. We need to intensify our integration, we need to harmonise our economic and budgetary policies more, we need European infrastructure projects in the areas of energy, transport and telecommunications. We need a functioning internal market and labour market, and we need the resources required in order to achieve the demanding growth targets set out in the EU 2020 strategy. We need innovative sources of financing if we are to be able to exploit the potential of the SME sector. We need more Community method and less intergovernmentalism. A standstill here is a backward move; it will not preserve the status quo
. The debt crisis in Europe clearly demonstrates that stability and confidence are not achievable without discipline. The proposals made by Commissioner Rehn and by Mr Van Rompuy’s task force are intended to ensure that the Member States act in a disciplined manner. I regret to say that in Luxembourg the other day, the finance ministers cast aside these proposals at the behest of our Franco-German couple – a missed opportunity and a bad day for our citizens, who quite rightly feel betrayed by politics yet again. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if banks have to hold more capital for loans and financial instruments, that increases their ability to bear losses. The most recent proposals from the Basel Committee take this stability-based approach as their basis. Unfortunately, the Basel Committee has not, as yet, satisfactorily addressed the problem of system-relevant banks. I therefore welcome Mr Karas’s call for the requirements for the liquidity standards to be made independent of system-relevance. In other words, appropriately tougher requirements need to apply to banks that, due to their size or interconnectedness with the global financial system, need to be bailed out using taxpayers’ money in crisis situations. We should take a more differentiated approach to the factor of debt leverage. Only when it is empirically proven that this instrument does not lead to arbitrage and distortions of competition and actually counters the overheated granting of loans should we consider permanently incorporating it into the first pillar. There is a need, in any case, for these proposals to be implemented at the global level. We cannot allow the US authorities to have a decisive influence on the Basel proposals only to not then implement them. The G20 summit in Seoul next month will show whether, and to what extent, we can achieve this objective. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 I support the European Union’s initiative to refocus the current remuneration policy on long-term success and more liability for decision makers. However, this must not lead to salary levels being set by politicians. This task should remain the responsibility of the existing structures within the banks, such as the supervisory board and the general meeting. Therefore, the proposed remuneration policy should not replace existing structures, but should supplement them where necessary, ensuring that this helps to improve the quality of financial decision making.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, even the members of the Council realise that the weaknesses of the supervisory system are or were one of the causes of the biggest global financial crisis experienced since the 1930s. They are also aware that national measures alone are not sufficient to deal with the consequences of this crisis, but that we need to look for global, or at least European, solutions. The Council should know that the European Parliament does not want an independent European supervisory structure and systemic risk board to be set up out of dogmatism or stubbornness, but from a deeply-held, cross-party conviction. This is the only way of guaranteeing transparency and protection for investors, based on a uniform regulatory framework and a uniform interpretation and application of this framework. One clear message from the crisis is that we need not less, but greater involvement from Europe in the financial sector; if we do not go forwards, than we will go backwards. Member States should drop the hypocrisy they display when calling for global solutions at G20 meetings and demanding at least European regulations at home, but actually refusing to make any compromise in the trialogues.

 Combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography is vitally important. We must use all our strength to combat the availability of child pornography in communications networks.

 Mr President, Commissioner, rating agencies have played an appalling role in the global financial crisis and in the euro difficulties and are far from deserving of praise. Lack of transparency, conflicts of interest, financing through contracting entities and the publication of ratings at questionable times with a procyclical effect, or shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted, speak for themselves. Rating agencies have been, and continue to be, oblivious to this and do not see these problems. I personally have proposed that the EU should act now and I am pleased that you, too, feel the same. We should establish a European rating agency on the basis of a foundation model. Obviously, this foundation model must be financially independent. It must not be subject to any political interference, either from the European Central Bank, the Commission or any Member States. As an independent foundation, this European agency could become a serious competitor to the oligopoly, or indeed the monopoly, of the three rating agencies we are discussing now. It should be the case that any product offered in Europe and all issuers operating in Europe be required to give two ratings, one of which must come from this European agency. In order to be independent, this foundation must also be financially independent. This means that we need seed-funding that could be provided by the European Investment Bank or perhaps the Commission, and from that point on, this European foundation would have to finance itself. The question of whether such financing should come from contracting authorities or users remains to be clarified. This was raised earlier on by Mr Giegold. We have to reach a decision on this as well. On a general note, we should also consider whether we could restrict our reliance on rating agencies somewhat because it seems to me that we are much too dependent on them at present. Wolf Klinz,

 Mr President, Commissioner, if I take a little more than four minutes, I will make my concluding remarks shorter so that I do not overrun my six minutes. The Prospectus Directive was originally put together in 2003 with the condition that it be reviewed in September 2009. That has been the case. The Prospectus Directive concerns the completion, approval and publication of prospectuses as a prerequisite for the public offering of securities or their emission into a regulated market within the European Union. In general, the current review concerns technical aspects and is intended to eliminate legal uncertainties and unjustifiably onerous requirements. First of all, I would very much like to thank all the Members who have worked together with us on this, as well as all the shadow rapporteurs. We have had very good cooperation, and that includes with the Commission. Without such good cooperation, we would not actually have been able to see this package through to a successful conclusion at first reading in less than ten months. I would now like to present briefly the agreement we have forged – and this includes the tripartite talks – in the form of eight principal points on which we were able to reach agreement. Firstly, one of our objectives was to facilitate access to capital in the market for small and medium-sized enterprises. You know that in the US, there is a much higher percentage of companies, including SMEs, that obtain finance through the market, whereas in Europe, the common practice, especially amongst small businesses, is to obtain finance through bank loans. What we want to do here is open up the opportunity for small businesses to use the market more often than before. We have therefore raised the threshold for exemption from the threshold requirements, which ultimately saddle SMEs with red tape and costs, from EUR 2.5 million to EUR 5 million. My second point concerns investor protection: we want to make sure that, in the course of such facilitation, we can provide sufficient safeguards to the small private investor. This is why we have raised the threshold for exemption from the prospectus requirements for securities denominated in 50 000 to a denomination of 100 000. The third point I would like to raise concerns the issue of how to enable employees to participate in a company’s share capital without that company needing to bear the relatively high costs of launching a prospectus. So, this is about relaxing the prospectus requirement when offering employee participation programmes. Here, we have introduced a proportionality clause in that we have eliminated the unnecessary disclosure requirement. At the same time, however, we have made sure that we have a document detailing basic information so that those employees who benefit from this form of participation can have an idea about what it is they are getting. We have also made sure that companies listed in a third country, that is, a country outside the European Union, be exempted from the prospectus requirement as well – just like European companies – where they offer their employees shares, on the condition that they are able to prove equivalence with the disclosure requirements. The fourth area we discussed and on which we have reached agreement concerns what is commonly known as a ‘prospectus summary’. You can look at it this way: typically, a prospectus is a thick and voluminous document frequently containing several hundred pages. However, there is also the summary which frequently contains another 50, 60 or 70 pages. What we want Parliament to do is to shorten this to what is known as ‘key investor information’ or a document with essential information for investors of the kind provided by traditional investment funds, the UCITS. The Commission did not, in fact, consider this, wanting merely to ensure that key information really is contained in the summary. We have now agreed that, while keeping the summary in its present form, we should also ensure that it does indeed contain key information which will eventually be set out through directive requirements and a level 2 elaboration. This will help shorten the summary considerably, cutting it down from the current 60, 70 or 80 pages to some 20 or 30, perhaps, and help make it an easy read, especially for the small investor. This is important, because we do not want to leave the small investor out of the picture. Fifthly, the issue of liability: when a prospectus is drawn up, who is it that guarantees the accuracy of the contents? In particular, if an intermediary uses this prospectus, if he makes arbitrary changes to the contents, then the liable party is the intermediary. The prospectus requirement expires either when the offer period has expired or when the trading has begun, whichever is the later date. Seventhly, the review clause: as with the previous one, this directive will also be reviewed in five years’ time. My last point is that, in this document, we have the first piece of legislation that has been brought into line with the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon. Last but not least, allow me to point out that the Chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has managed to ensure that Parliament is given sufficient time. We have three months to respond to the Commission and another extension of three months, if necessary. Having said that, we have undertaken, in the event that all other options fail, to grant early approval, that is, to push this piece of legislation through within the shortest time. This satisfies all parties. Wolf Klinz,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, I will make just a few brief comments. First of all, I wish to thank the Commissioner and all the Members for their friendly comments. I am pleased that you share my views. Our cooperation has actually enabled us to balance out various objectives, namely easier access to capital for SMEs and the removal of administrative hurdles, on the one hand, and improvement and securing of investor protection and making progress in terms of creating a genuine European internal market, on the other. I hope that, when this new version of the Prospectus Directive comes up for review in a few years’ time, we will be able to establish a link between the Prospectus Directive and the Market Abuse and Transparency Directives, and that we might perhaps go so far as to choose, in terms of non-equity securities, not the home market, but another Member State of the European Union as a starting point for emission.

Madam President, I am delighted to be able to welcome Estonia as the 17th member of the euro area from 1 January 2011. Our Baltic neighbour, as previous speakers have already said, is actually one of the very few countries that meet the Maastricht criteria, and indeed with enthusiasm! In the current climate, we can be certain that the Commission, Eurostat and the European Central Bank have looked very closely at everything and made no allowances in their evaluation of the figures. The Council will also take its decision without any political benefit. Ten years after its introduction, the euro is, as we all know, currently facing its greatest test and challenge. It is testimony to an enormous degree of commitment, an unbelievable will and an extraordinary amount of effort that Estonia has succeeded in actually meeting the accession criteria under these circumstances. I believe that it is also evidence of the fact that it wants to meet these criteria as laid down in the Treaty. Estonia knows that, as a Member of the European Union, it is also obliged one day to become a member of the euro area and the fact that it wants to do that so quickly makes me, personally, very happy. It shows that there are still countries that have real confidence in this European project. It is fortunate that the Estonian Government did not have to put this accession decision to the people in a referendum, as we are well aware that citizens are to some extent very concerned. If they follow the media, they will view the euro as a soft currency and the euro area as a transfer union, and they are scared that the introduction of the euro will lead to large price increases. Slovenia and Germany are examples of this, and in Germany it is not without reason that the expensive euro has been referred to using the play on words as the ‘Teuro’ (‘der teure Euro
’ – expensive euro). The fact, then, that all of this is just perceived inflation, as the European Central Bank says, is surely something of an understatement. As a member of the euro area, Estonia will also have to deal with the problems facing the single currency and thus also sign up to the euro area rescue plan. What impact that might have on the budget, we do not know. I would like to ask the Commission to provide some clarity in this regard. I hope Estonia continues its excellent development and I hope that its achievements, particularly with regard to budgetary discipline and combating inflation, will prove to be sustainable in future, too.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European governments are being driven by the markets. At last they are reacting, but they are reacting after the event and not in advance. It is scandalous that the governments and the Commission only react when the real weaknesses appear in the markets. They should have identified these weaknesses themselves at an early stage. When the euro was introduced, we knew that we would not have a single monetary and fiscal policy, as is normally the case in individual states. For this reason, we have taken measures to find a substitute for this, but we have not adhered closely to these measures. The rules were broken very quickly and right at the start, even by the larger Member States. We need another effective set of rules with sanction mechanisms, including a name and shame policy, the loss of voting rights and suspension of payments from the European funds until the fines have been paid. Secondly, it has become clear that there are internal tensions within the euro area which are on the verge of putting its strength to the test and which take the form of differences in competitiveness. The Commission must take action in this area. It must investigate the budgets of the individual Member States to determine whether they represent a risk for the euro area. Of course, we know that the right to draw up a budget is a central right of the national parliaments. However, that is no reason for failing to develop a common European approach. This is urgently needed. We need more Europe and not less Europe. This may well be our last chance. If the Commission and the Council do not negotiate with Parliament, I am afraid that the result will be a major disaster at some point in the future. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from my economic experience I know that strategies are only as good as their specific implementation measures and the means of monitoring them. The Commission is yet to provide an answer in this regard. We listen to the goals, with which we can thoroughly identify, we hear the lofty intentions, but we hear next to nothing about how these goals are to be achieved in concrete terms. I had actually assumed that the financial and economic crisis – the largest we have experienced since the Second World War and which has now deepened on account of the additional problem of the national debt crisis – would have been at the top of the Commission’s list of considerations. In my opinion, that should have been the logical starting point, as both crises have changed the situation significantly. If we do not just stop at lofty intentions but actually want to achieve something in the next ten years then we will have to address a number of points in very concrete terms: Firstly, we need to review our finances – not only in the EU, but in each Member State, according to uniform criteria – so that we know where we really stand, what our financial leeway is and what we can actually afford to do. Secondly, we need to develop a crisis resolution mechanism to prevent us being thrown out of kilter again in the future should there be further storms on the markets. Thirdly, we need to complete the internal market in areas where it is not yet complete – I am expecting a great deal from Mr Monti’s report – including for services. Fourthly, we need to convincingly set out how we are to supplement the common monetary policy with a common, closely interlinked economic and finance policy and even a fiscal policy. Fifthly, we need to set out very specifically how we can replace the divergence that we have observed between the Member States with increasing convergence by concentrating on economic projects that are truly European in nature. There are very many of these: energy policy, energy interconnections, high-speed rail and road networks, navigation systems and many similar projects. Wolf Klinz,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the partnership between the EU and Canada works very well, not only in the area of the economy, but also on questions of foreign policy, such as Iran, Afghanistan, Haiti and other similar cases. Despite this, we are faced with a number of serious challenges. I am sure that we can overcome them, because we have such a close friendship and partnership. I am thinking about five points in particular. Firstly, we must do the job of regulating the financial sector properly. A great deal was promised by the G20 and I believe that it is important for it to be clearly shown at the G20 summit in Toronto, which is hosted by Canada, that the G20 countries are taking concrete measures and not just making promises. My second point has already been mentioned. We have very similar objectives with regard to climate policy. We in Europe can definitely learn from Canada about carbon capture and storage projects and other developments in this sector. We hope to be able to agree on joint standards for reductions. My third point concerns the need for a new trade agreement and I believe that our objectives are very similar in this area as well. I would like to highlight two points where action is needed and where we intend to move closer together, but still remain some distance apart. One of these concerns visa-free travel, which you, Baroness Ashton, have already referred to. I hope that it will be possible to treat ethnic minorities from EU Member States in the same way as all other EU citizens. My last point relates to the passenger data agreement which expired in the autumn of last year. It is de facto still in force, but no longer has a basis in law. We need a new legal basis, so that we can produce a new agreement. This new legal basis must ensure that civil rights are respected. Modern technological opportunities for networking should not be used to make all the information on names, dates of birth, flight details, credit cards, and so on, readily available in such a way that this information can be misused. We hope that we can work together to create a legal basis which corresponds to our European concept of civil rights. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, VAT fraud is not a mere peccadillo. It is a criminal act and a problem which either escalates or diminishes over time. According to the latest estimates, citizens, and thereby taxpayers, lose up to EUR 100 billion every year, perhaps even more. At a time of accelerating public debt and crisis, citizens have no sympathy for the fact that the European Union has so far not been able to tackle this problem successfully. This is why I welcome a fresh attempt to introduce the reverse charge procedure, on which we will be taking a vote the day after tomorrow. What we are trying to do with the reverse charge procedure is effectively eliminate the problem of VAT evasion or at least reduce it. We have to wait and see, however, whether or not this procedure will generate the desired increase in VAT receipts and deter new cases of fraud. However, it is certainly worth the attempt. We will monitor closely the results of the procedure, the application of which is currently limited to 2014, and carry out a critical assessment. However, I would have liked an amendment to one specific point: I am in favour of enterprises which duly discharge their duty of care in the context of a review of their VAT registration numbers, being exempted from any liability, even if the recipient commits fraud. I explicitly regret that my amendment to that effect did not command a majority in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the fast and decisive reaction of the G20 to the global financial crisis. A great deal has happened. The fire appears to have been put out, but the foundations of our financial system are still shaky. The citizens are unsettled. Profits are being ploughed back for the benefit of shareholders and losses are being socialised, that is how the citizens see it. In the meantime, it is back to business as usual for more and more market players, who are making big moves, rather than focusing on what they should really be doing as service providers, namely supporting the real economy. Financial ethics and responsibility appear, as ever, to be foreign words to many of them. I am expecting specific – and fast – measures from the G20. I hope that the EU Member States will all pull together. In addition to new supervisory structures, we also need bigger equity bases, which increase in line with the risk, long-term – not short-term – incentive systems, a coordinated exit strategy from State aid, contained protectionism, congruent regulation, rather than regulation arbitrage, an end to pro-cyclicity and a solution to the ‘too big to fail’ problem and, above all, we must abide by the tried and tested social market economy.Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the democratic structure of the European Union is the subject of much discussion at the moment. The Commission’s report on monitoring the application of EU law makes it clear that this is a complex topic and also involves the Member States. Citizens have a right not only to European legislation being drawn up in accordance with democratic principles, but also to European laws being transposed so they – the citizens – as well as businesses can benefit from them. Member States are also under a democratic obligation in this respect. They are obliged to transpose the legislation. If they fail to fulfil this obligation, they are infringing the European legal order and therefore the rule of law. Observing this rule of law is, however, a necessary condition for the legitimacy of any form of democratic governance. It is a guarantee for citizens that they will be able to benefit from the rights provided for in law. The Commission’s reports show year on year that many Member States frequently flout the transposition deadlines for Directives. As guardian of the Treaties, the Commission is therefore forced to institute costly infringement proceedings, which are embarrassing for the Member States. Here the Commission must keep a particularly close eye on those Member States with very poor transposition records. As Parliament we are also required to do this. Our citizens are turning to us with increasing frequency with petitions and in this way drawing our attention to transposition infringements by Member States. We must therefore make sure that communication between Parliament and the Commission is improved, so that infringements can be identified and remedied as early as possible. We owe it to our citizens!

Mr President, I do not wish to advance any political arguments against the ACAA Protocol, such as the idea that we are rewarding Israel for its human rights violations and sending out the wrong signal. Instead, I shall present some legal arguments. The Protocol states that the territorial competence of the Israeli Responsible Authority for pharmaceuticals, in this instance the Ministry of Health, is to be defined by Israel – in accordance with its own national law, of course. However, under Israel’s national law, the settlements in the West Bank, which are illegal under international law, and the illegally annexed areas of East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights are deemed to be Israeli territory. Due to the absence of any provision to the contrary in the Protocol, the worry is that Israel will extend the jurisdiction of the Responsible Authority to the Occupied Territories as well. When implementing the Protocol, the EU would thus be forced to recognise, for the first time, Israel’s claims to sovereignty over parts of the Occupied Territories. I therefore urge the Members of this House to vote against the ACAA Protocol today. As democratically elected Members of this House, we have an obligation to respect and uphold EU and international law as part of our set of values.  The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the EU because we apply rule-of-law and democratic principles – not only in relation to the EU itself. How can we ... this important ...

Madam President, legal, cross-border online access to orphan works is fundamental to the fostering of our diverse cultural treasures in Europe. The directive to be adopted will finally enable public institutions in Europe – libraries, museums, archives and the like – to dig out orphan works from their cellars, digitise them and thus make them available to the general public. After long and also difficult discussions in Parliament and with the Council, we have found a solution that serves both the individual rights holders’ interest in the reasonable protection of their works and the public interest in the distribution of such works. We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, in particular, insisted that there must be a truly thorough and effective search for the rights holder whose rights are to be protected before a work is published. If the rights holder makes himself/herself known at a later date, he/she should be due at least reasonable compensation. It is also important that we have put a stop to purely commercial use of such works. On the other hand, public institutions, especially in times of tight purse strings, depend on private bodies to assist them with the digitisation. Public-private partnerships are exactly the right approach to take in order to make as many works as possible accessible to the public. It is high time that the European Parliament finally made hitherto unused cultural heritage available to the public. I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, as these negotiations were truly difficult and we had proposed various different ways forward at the outset. I do not share the view of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance that there is, to all intents and purposes, no value in this directive. I take the view that, if that were the case, the review clause makes it possible to overhaul the directive after two years. I am, however, quite sure that digitisation can get under way straight away now, and also that the necessary funds for that are available. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, only simple and comprehensible law is good law. We issue European legislation in the public interest and for the benefit of the citizens. It is therefore essential that European law should be simple, easy-to-understand and accessible to everyone. As European legislators, we need to constantly monitor and optimise our work. That is what our citizens expect of us. It is important that we should have an ever more intensive exchange with the national parliaments in order to give shape to laws and act together as guardians of the principle of subsidiarity. In that way, we can ensure, together, that we really do only legislate at European level what is too much to deal with at national level. Good law making also includes not putting in place regulations that could be at least as well dealt with at national level. Particularly in these difficult times for the European Union, it is absolutely critical that European legislation should be accepted by everyone, including by our national elected representatives. The early warning mechanism established in the Treaty of Lisbon, which many people have labelled a paper tiger, showed its potential power for the first time yesterday. After reprimands about subsidiarity from 18 national parliaments, the Commission decided to withdraw its proposed regulation on collective striking law. There is cause to criticise the fact that there has still been no updating of the existing interinstitutional agreement on better legislation from 2003 to fit in with the Treaty of Lisbon. The Treaty of Lisbon brought in changes in respect of secondary legislation. Given the immense practical importance of such legislation, the agreement needs to be updated. Alexandra Thein,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are about to vote on two technical reports on the European Court of Justice. I would like to make the following non-partisan comments: the European Parliament expressly regrets the fact that the increase in the number of judges at the European Court of Justice, the necessity of which has also been accepted by the Council, has failed simply because the Member States were unable to agree on the Member States from which the extra judges were to be drawn. This is despite the fact that there were several possible solutions on the table. Thus, in procedural terms, we have an absolutely exceptional case here that is almost without precedent in Parliament, as we are about to vote on the proposed regulation and the first part today in order to relieve the Court of Justice of at least some of its workload, while leaving the second part hanging; it will hopefully be possible to bring this more important part to a successful conclusion by summer 2013. On behalf of our citizens and businesses, I once again call on the Member States not to play their usual power games with the third estate and to afford it the respect it deserves. Alexandra Thein,  
rapporteur

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg is overstretched. Tomorrow’s decision may seem technical and non-political at first glance, relating to the internal reorganisation of the three courts that comprise the Court of Justice of the European Union; however there is more to it than that. The European Union has been, and continues to be, invested with more and more powers and responsibilities, most recently through the Treaty of Lisbon. Accordingly, the responsibilities of the Court of Justice of the European Union have also gradually expanded. Thus, the excessive workload cannot be attributed solely to the increasing number of cases – in common with many Member States – quite apart from the accession of 12 new Member States. In fact, the number of cases concluded has lagged behind the number of newly received cases for many years. In this context, it becomes clear that the reform of the internal organisation of the Court of Justice will have a major impact on the functioning or the European Union as a whole and, in the final analysis, on the lives of Europe’s citizens. For this reason it was important for me that all of the participating legislative bodies – including the Court of Justice, which we included in the trilogue negotiations – should cooperate from the start and find practical compromises. We have only partly succeeded in doing this. Let me begin with the part for which we have actually found reasonable compromises, which make the work of the Court more efficient and which will reduce the length of court proceedings. The key points are as follows: the office of Vice-President is to be established at the suggestion of the Court itself. In future, the Vice-President will relieve the President of some of the burden involved in representing and administering the Court and will attend all Grand Chamber sessions. In addition, personnel structures are to be changed in the Chambers and in the Grand Chamber, which is to consist of 15 judges, so that the Presidents of the Chambers with five judges will also have their workload reduced and it will be possible to share the workload of all judges more evenly. The proposals in relation to the Civil Service Tribunal are also easy to explain. This Tribunal has always had seven judges. The small number of judges means that, in the event that a judge is absent, for example, due to lengthy illness, the Tribunal as a whole is seriously impaired in its judicial functions. In order to prevent this, an option is to be established whereby judges can be appointed to this technical tribunal on an interim basis. The judges in question are former members of the Court of Justice and they are to be appointed from a list in a particular order, so as to satisfy the requirements in relation to legally eligible judges. These judges can then replace individual judges should they be unable to fulfil their duties. So much for the positive and rational compromises which we have hammered out together and for which I wish to thank all those involved. As was stated at the outset, however, we have not been able to bring all the necessary proposals to a conclusion. I wish to emphasise clearly that the reason for this lies not with the European Parliament, but with the Council and the national vanity of the individual Member States. It was suggested that the number of judges in the Court of First Instance should be increased by 12, rising from 27 to 39 judges. This is the right decision in view of the increasing workload of the judges, although the precise number of additional judges required might be open to debate. Parliament is certainly convinced that increasing the number of judges will, in the final analysis, contribute to better jurisprudence for individual citizens and businesses alike. From which the Member States the additional judges are drawn should not really matter and appointments should be made solely on the basis of qualifications. After all, the principle of impartiality among judges also applies in the European Union. This, however, is something for the future. We have proposed a fair system for the appointment of judges, with numerous suggestions for how they could be selected. The Member States however, were unwilling and unable to agree to any of these solutions in the Council, which is why we shall not have an agreement to increase the number of judges for the foreseeable future. The motives behind this are purely national in character and cannot be justified in objective terms. I find this extremely unsatisfactory. In the future too it will be necessary to ensure that European jurisprudence follows a reasonable timescale. Our citizens and businesses are entitled to that. Excessively long cases, sometimes lasting over five-and-a-half years, represent a violation of our Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. That is why it is vital that, in view of the present, well-balanced proposals in relation to the selection of additional judges, Member States should finally consider their position and avoid any loss of confidence in the European legal system. Alexandra Thein,  
rapporteur

Mr President, I would like to thank all my colleagues and I am particularly pleased that we have cross-group agreement that the number of judges must be increased, as Ms Regner has also indicated how many there will eventually be. This still has to be discussed. The third estate is often neglected because it is unable to make its voice sufficiently heard in politics. It is reticent by nature. It is essentially important, however. Mr Häfner has underlined its importance for the public at large, while Mr Karim has explained its significance for the business community. I hope that the friendship group established by the Council will not only deal with further internal reforms of the Court of Justice of the European Union, particularly because it has already achieved a major reform that has also contributed to a drop in case numbers and concluded cases. It is extremely important that the principle of the separation of powers should be followed here, and the system as a whole must not be overburdened. The work on the two dossiers has shown that some questions remain outstanding and that we must take a closer look at the Court of Justice in our Committee on Legal Affairs when it comes to the issue of divergent opinions, even though these are not required by the Court, or the establishment of special chambers and technical tribunals. A number of questions have arisen during the negotiations and need to be clarified. We were under considerable time pressure because 14 new judges must be appointed in October and I hope that we will have concluded the negotiations on the additional new judges to be appointed before the next appointment of 13 new judges in September 2013. Mr President, as we have saved some time because a number of colleagues have failed to attend, please permit me to present once again the various options for appointing the additional judges. We tabled a cross-group resolution that was never adopted, despite unanimous support, because Parliament changed its Rules of Procedure in the interim. The following proposals are on the table: Firstly, the selection takes place in strict rotation and involves all 27 Member States. The second option: six judges are drawn from the most populous Member States, while the remaining six are drawn from the other 21 Member States in strict rotation. Alternatively: six judges are drawn from the most populous Member States, while the remaining six are drawn from the medium-sized Member States in strict rotation. Yet another option: six judges are drawn from the most populous Member States, while the remaining six are selected using the same system as that used to appoint advocates-general. Another possible interim solution would be to appoint temporary judges for approximately five or six years, as suggested by the Danish Presidency of the Council. Thus, there are plenty of solutions available, but the Council needs to agree. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 I was unable to vote in favour of the Ferreira report because of Amendments 68, 27 and 67. In its proposal to the German Government in autumn 2011, the German Council of Economic Experts demanded clear and strict rules on participation in a debt redemption fund (Amendment 67). Whatever one’s general position on such a debt redemption fund, which was not even foreseen in the Commission proposal, these participation criteria have been greatly watered down in the report that has now been adopted. Moreover, linking the introduction of a debt redemption fund with a road map for eurobonds or stability bonds and the treatment of economic imbalances is unfair and inappropriate.

 Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, as a liberal, I, too, welcome the hearing instigated by the Commission on the future of European company law. This is a key element of a functioning internal market. There are particular problems in respect of the mobility of our enterprises – in other words, the outstanding 14th company law directive on the cross-border transfer of company seats without having to establish a new company. The Commission has been slow in presenting draft legislation because the Member States are unable to agree on a common line, and negotiations are therefore likely to be difficult. Similarly, it is scarcely possible for shareholder rights to be exercised across borders and we are still awaiting harmonised framework conditions in this area. There are also problems with the European private company, where the Member States are again blocking progress, being unable to agree on, among other things, the necessity of cross-border aspects, the level of capital stock and worker codetermination. My final point is that in the current proposed directive on accounting, the Commission has, in my view, made a technical legal error. In principle, the idea of making payment flows from the commodities industry in developing countries transparent is to be welcomed. In terms of legal technicalities, however, this topic does not belong there. If we want to help fight corruption, EU accounting law is not the right place to do it. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, it was only on 8 June that you condemned settlement building in the occupied territories. Today, you referred for the umpteenth time to the fact that settlement building is illegal under the terms of international law. Furthermore, on 14 May, the Council reaffirmed in its conclusions on the peace process the fact that we must maintain the viability of a two-state solution. Therefore, it is incomprehensible that we in the European Parliament are now being asked to vote in favour of the additional protocol to the association agreement with Israel on conformity assessment and acceptance of industrial products (ACAA). I think it is particularly important to make the following point. We have not yet had a clear explanation of the precise way in which products manufactured in the settlements are handled in the agreement between the EU and Israel. These products are still finding their way onto the EU market. Before we conclude any further trade agreements with Israel, we need to resolve this problem. We must investigate whether there are any effective mechanisms for monitoring this which can be introduced and implemented. In the meantime, Israel continues to disregard its obligations under international law. More settlements are being built, enlarged and even relocated as Israel sees fit, while the EU stands helplessly by. A two-state solution is quite literally being buried under the settlements.

 I spoke against the report because two amendments tabled by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe did not receive a majority in plenary.

 Mr President, Mr Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome this discussion about the European corporate governance framework. Normally in the Committee on Legal Affairs, when it comes to own-initiative reports, in other words, non-legislative proposals, we try to bring all the political groups on board by means of compromises. On this occasion we did not succeed and that is a good thing, because in the case of corporate governance there are fundamental differences in the political perspectives of the Social Democrats and the Greens on the one hand and the Liberals, the Christian Democrats and the Conservatives on the other. For example, we believe that the comply-or-explain system is a useful tool in corporate governance. Any deviation from the code of conduct should be justified in an appropriate way and the alternative corporate governance measure that is taken should be described and explained. Calling for binding rules in this area, as the Social Democrats do in their alternative motion for a resolution, involves intervening to an excessive extent in companies’ freedom to do business and this is unacceptable, particularly when it is not dependent on the size of the company. Listed companies, some of which are small organisations, must not be lumped together with non-listed companies and small and medium-sized enterprises, especially given the additional call for sanctions to be imposed whenever there is a well-justified deviation from the code of conduct. This is pure socialism. We cannot simply force companies to accept the German or Austrian codetermination model in the light of the different corporate cultures in other Member States, even if this would perhaps prevent a few unnecessary strikes of the kind that often take place in southern Europe. I would now like to discuss the quotas for women. We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have tabled a far-reaching amendment concerning the representation of women on boards. We are not fully in agreement within our group and we have heard the same thing from speakers from other groups. Nevertheless, I hope that this issue will receive broad support. In future, I would like to see the Commission giving more consideration to the dual structure that we have in Europe and not focusing solely on the system with a single board. Alexandra Thein,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as a member of both the Palestine and Israel delegations, I welcome the fact that Parliament has decided to speak out on these unacceptable Israeli raids on two television stations in Ramallah. I would remind you that Ramallah is located in Zone A of the West Bank, in other words in the small area that the Palestinians are permitted to administer for themselves. This means that there is no legal basis in any agreement for such action by the Israeli authorities, particularly since it was unannounced. In addition to the fact that this action ran contrary to the right of free expression and freedom of information, what we have here is the illegal destruction of Palestinian property by the Israeli occupying powers, something that is stereotypically defended by Israel as necessary on security grounds, which does not make it any less illegal under international law: we witness the destruction of drinking fountains and energy sources, the almost weekly destruction of agricultural land and olive trees, as well as the continuous demolition of hundreds of Palestinian homes, including in Jerusalem itself. What is particularly galling is that the Israeli authorities do not even baulk at the destruction of infrastructural projects financed by the EU or its Member States. According to a recent report in Der Spiegel
 and elsewhere, solar energy systems funded by German taxes are once again being torn down. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Madam President, I welcome the fact that Parliament has taken up the issue of human rights violations in Bahrain. According to the list kept by the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, the number of fatalities since 14 February 2011 is much higher than indicated in the resolution. The number quoted there is 63. The debate is made all the more important by the fact that a large number of Member States were very quiet and indecisive about the events in Bahrain, when they actually should have made their voices heard. If one compares the way the Member States reacted to the very first killings in Syria, then it is apparent that the response was quite different. In the final analysis, this is what leads me to hope that the standards applied in the European Parliament at least will be the same, whatever country is under consideration. We cannot use a different yardstick here simply because Bahrain is the location of a US naval base rather than a Russian one, because it receives supplies of US weapons rather than Russian ones and because our trade relations with the country are better than with Syria. The same standards need to apply in Bahrain and in all the countries of the Arab world when it comes to compliance with human rights. Alexandra Thein,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are in the process of re-regulating succession and family law in respect of which law is to be applied, which courts have competence and the recognition and enforcement of judgments from other countries. We have done so already in respect of the arrangement of child support and divorce law. Tomorrow we will be voting on the law of succession, and marital property law will follow. As Mr Lehne has already said, in the plenary today we are not discussing any old abstract political issues. Instead, we are helping our citizens in a quite tangible way to solve what are currently in some ways irresolvable problems. In the worst case scenario it can happen in a cross-border succession case that the heirs appeal to the highest instance of the courts in different Member States, spend a great deal of time and money and that there are then two contradicting decisions because each of the courts applies the law in that Member State. The aim is for such situations to be avoided in future. We are on the verge of a change of system when it comes to succession law. In future, the entire succession will be in the competence of the courts of the Member State in the territory of which the bequeather was habitually resident at the time of their death. This is because we are working on the basis that people have a stronger relationship with the country in which they reside. However, someone who, by way of example, as a German permanently resident in Strasbourg, regards him- or herself as having a closer connection with Germany, can choose to have German law apply to their succession. In order to avoid a French court having to apply complicated German succession law, there is, in such circumstances, also a provision for the succession to be brought before a German probate court. Meanwhile, those who like to winter in Mallorca need have no fear either, as, wherever you go on holiday, it does not constitute habitual residence in the country in which you holiday. Furthermore, this regulation will not affect inheritance tax. Denmark, the United Kingdom and Ireland, as we have heard, will not initially be involved as a result of their opt-outs. That is a shame, as so many Britons, in particular, have holiday homes in southern Europe and these would then also be subject to the common law and not, as up to now, to the law of the Member State in which the land is located. A major information campaign will be necessary. I would also like to thank Mr Lechner once again for his comprehensive work and for the solution that he reached. His work shows how important it is that this Parliament should contain not only career politicians but also professionals from other walks of life. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, I welcome the fact that trading relations are to be established with a view to creating a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area in response to the Arab Spring, and that the over 100 bilateral protocols are to be brought together in a single regional agreement. I would, however, like to draw attention to one critical point, namely, products that purportedly originate from Israel. There have been some serious flaws in the implementation of the association agreement between the EU and Israel concluded in 1995. We in this House are all aware of this. I recently drew attention to precisely this flaw in a written question to the Commission. We know from several sources, including our customs authorities, that Israeli settlers have intentionally falsely labelled goods produced in the occupied Palestinian territories, including fruit and vegetables, also issuing these goods with falsified certificates, declaring the country of origin of these products to be Israel. This was in order for this produce to gain access to the EU’s single market at preferential conditions, including lower tax rates. We cannot have a situation whereby this new agreement will also be misused in further extending this illegal practice. Mr Barnier, I believe it is extremely important that the aforementioned list of the designations of origin of the various Palestinian villages and towns should be published. Our delegation has long been of the view that this list should not be kept secret, but should be published in the interests of greater transparency and clarity and to help restrict abuses.

– The FDP Delegation abstained in today’s vote on the motion for a resolution on the feasibility of introducing stability bonds. We believe that the introduction of Eurobonds would set the wrong incentives. Since the introduction of the euro, low interest rates have led to a substantial increase in debt levels in many euro area countries. Eurobonds would take the pressure off highly indebted euro area Member States to consolidate their budgets and introduce much needed structural reforms. Therefore, we believe that Eurobonds would aggravate, rather than alleviate the current crisis. However, we did not vote against the resolution as many of our concerns have been taken on board by the rapporteur. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

Mr President, Commissioner, in 2009 the European Parliament resolved to set up a European Observatory on Counterfeiting and Piracy in order to capture reliable objective data on the actual number of counterfeit and imitation products, rather than being solely reliant on the data made available by producers and the trade. The Observatory, which in the end only commenced operations in 2010, was a complete success. It has become a centre of excellence, collecting information and data on all the counterfeit products – such as drugs, toys and car parts – that threaten the lives and health of our citizens. This Observatory, which was co-managed by the Commission – the bottom line is that it was actually only co-managed – now needs to be restructured, and given additional human and other resources to deal with the increase in its tasks. To bring this about, we have decided – for reasons of costs and efficiency – not to establish a new agency, but to utilise an existing agency and, in effect, to transfer the Observatory’s tasks to the existing agency, the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market in Alicante. This agency in fact employs 650 people, and they are already responsible for the registration of Community trade marks and designs. May I therefore explicitly repeat to the Member from the United Kingdom – who has, unfortunately, already left – that this Office is therefore able to work on a cost-neutral basis, because it finances itself from the fees received for the said trade marks; in other words, we are merely imposing additional tasks on an existing agency and are benefiting from the agreement on fees. I would also like to repeat that analysis of the problem of data theft is mentioned only in the recitals, and that it is stated there that the Observatory will primarily deal with counterfeiting and product piracy.

 The obvious answer to that question is yes. I think that was the point of the question. I find it genuinely regrettable that comments are made here without any detailed knowledge of the facts. I, too, come from a liberal party that is extremely concerned about costs and efficiency, and naturally I hope that the people working there are performing their duties properly. Above all, however, I hope that this agency will continue to work on a cost-neutral basis by continuing to finance itself from fees and requiring no subsidies of any kind. Alexandra Thein,

Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, the interconnection of companies and commercial registers is a further milestone along the way to creating a European area of law. I am pleased that this matter, which is so important for our small and medium-sized enterprises in particular, and which I advocated and promised to work for during my electoral campaign, has now – following trialogue negotiations – been successfully incorporated into a directive. There are two aspects to this. Firstly, it gives citizens and companies easier cross-border access to commercial registers. Until now, if you wanted to access, say, a Greek commercial register, you had to instruct a Greek lawyer – who of course also had to speak your language, or at least a language that you had in common. The end result was extra costs and wasted time. This should now be able to take place via a platform. What is special about this platform is that I can make an enquiry in my own language and get an answer in my own language. Secondly, the commercial registers will now cooperate in a more institutionalised way, rather than on a voluntary basis as they have until now. Moreover, I regret to say that in the past one could not always rely on the entries in commercial registers of other Member States, particularly where the registration of branches in other Member States was concerned. We have now incorporated a requirement stating that, in future, entries must be made without delay or at latest within 21 days – provided, of course, that the conditions are met. Every company and every branch is to be given an identifier. The existing national commercial registers are not just kept only in their national language, but they also differ in many respects de facto
 and de jure
; for example, as regards their legal significance and the reliability of the data recorded. The directive aims only to interconnect the national registers in technical terms, not to harmonise the national systems. Nonetheless, for practical business life it is an extremely helpful measure that will encourage further integration of the internal market and will improve legal clarity and legal certainty for companies and citizens. I hope that the considerable technical work and software work that will be required for this can be achieved on time, by the year 2014. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

I abstained from voting on paragraph 6 of the motion for a resolution on the meeting of the European Council of 30 January 2012, calling for a road map for the introduction of stability bonds. I believe that such a road map would be wrong at present because it would simply ‘reward’ the excessive indebtedness of some Member States and lead to the morally unjustifiable joint and several liability of other Member States. Naturally, in the distant future, the euro area is interested in a joint liquid bond market as an alternative to the market for US dollar bonds, making the euro an internationally secure currency and replacing the dollar in this respect. The right conditions for such a move are still very far off, because, at present, some southern European Member States have no understanding of reasonable budgetary, fiscal and stability policies.

Madam President, securing better access to justice is one of the main objectives of the European Union’s policy of creating an area of freedom, security and justice. In a modern, globalised and digital economy, the confidence of the citizens in justice is a crucial factor. The Mediation Directive represents a milestone in this connection. Now, every judge in the EU has the opportunity to ensure, in every phase of the process, that two parties to a dispute voluntarily and on their own responsibility strive, with the assistance of a mediator, to settle their differences amicably. The directive ensures that utilisation of the mediation process will prevent the expiry of limitation and prescription periods. Moreover, the agreements reached as a result of limitation and prescription could be given the status of enforceable official documents. Also important are sound training of the mediators in the field of quality assurance and the strengthening of citizens’ trust in this system. Most Member States announced transposition after the deadline for transposition had already passed. However, it is not only the fact that transposition takes place that is important – how transposition is effected is the most important thing. To that end, specialists and legal practitioners must be consulted in order to ensure the greatest possible improvement of the directive. Alexandra Thein,

 Madam President, Mr Duff, first and foremost, on behalf of our group I would like to thank you most sincerely for the many years of work that you have put into this project and for the energy and enthusiasm with which you are trying to persuade us to support it. We all know that we will have to get to this stage at some point. You, yourself, asked earlier on whether now is the right time. I think that, first of all, we really must adopt a report in September. We all know that it will still probably take years, perhaps even decades, until this is actually implemented. However, if we do not start now, we might not even succeed in putting it in place in the next few decades, either. Personally, I would like to still be around to see us become a real Parliament with a single transnational list, because even the German Federal Constitutional Court has called for this and observed that we will only have true legitimacy if we are able to be elected by any citizen of the Union. However, in order to still reach a compromise, I would recommend that – in order to accommodate the small States – we extend the group of people who are allowed to stand as candidates on the transnational list slightly, perhaps to 10%. Our group Chair, Mr Verhofstadt, mentioned this somewhat light-heartedly in his speech yesterday. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 The German Free Democratic Party delegation in the European Parliament assumes that the inclusion of Romania and Bulgaria in the Schengen area will further improve freedom of movement within the EU. Now that both Member States have achieved positive evaluation results in all areas of the Schengen review, there should be no more obstacles to delay inclusion further. There is no denying that technically securing borders will not automatically make them secure as long as problems persist in combating corruption in the justice and policing system. However, this challenge also concerns Member States already in the Schengen area. For this reason, the German Free Democratic Party delegation believes that criteria such as the fight against corruption must receive greater attention when evaluating the Schengen mechanism, and any misdemeanours must be punished appropriately.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it will be an important step in the right direction when we vote on the transparency register tomorrow, but no doubt this will not be the last word on the matter. Firstly, I am pleased that we have chosen a new name for the lobby register of the European Parliament, which dates back to 1996 and which is now to be known as the transparency register. I find it regrettable to see who will be required to register in order to obtain a one-year building pass – the list includes public institutions and bodies. As I have stated before, I can understand why it is necessary for a law society to register, but I find it harder to understand why public bodies which have never been active on a party-political level, and never will be, are also required to register. In the final analysis, irrespective of all the transparency achieved, it all comes down to the moral compass of each Member of this House, as this dictates what he thinks is right, whom he meets and whom he decides not to meet, whom he listens to and whom he decides not to listen to. After all, people also contact us using many other different communication channels. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, very few of our citizens are aware of the existence of European parties and foundations. Until now these have simply been umbrella organisations for their national member parties, established according to national laws, mainly Belgian laws in this case. What is it that these European parties do? They discuss European issues, hold party conferences and play an indispensable role in reforming the European Parliament’s electoral system. According to the Treaty of Lisbon, they are required to help establish European democracy – a political forum at European level. The own-initiative report to be voted on tomorrow calls on the Commission to reform the legal basis for these European parties. In future, these parties will be based on a European legal statute and will have a European legal personality. As liberals, we have campaigned to ensure that a clear distinction is made between recognition as a European party and an entitlement to funding, as there was a certain greed in evidence. It is also important that European parties should follow democratic principles in their internal workings, something that cannot be taken for granted. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 In the vote on the Lange report, I am abstaining on paragraph 31 because of the ambiguous wording of the vote, which refers to Eurobonds as well as project bonds. However, taking it as a whole, I am voting for the report, as I have nothing against project bonds in themselves. Project bonds serve as finance for extensive innovation, infrastructure and reindustrialisation projects. This is not a question of instruments for the communitarisation of debts, as would be the case with Eurobonds. Alexandra Thein,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we will pass our third resolution against the criminalisation of homosexuality in Uganda. Within a short space of time gay people have been declared fair game in Uganda. Even children or minors are affected. This is all due to the irresponsible actions of a US-based Christian sect and the call by local newspaper Rolling Stone for a hundred people whom it named as being gay to be hanged. Now David Kato – one such person publicly named as being gay – has been hammered to a pulp on a public street; this is, in fact, what we were hoping to prevent with our last resolution. We call on Uganda firstly to hold an independent investigation into the murder of David Kato and not to arrest just anybody for the crime. Further, we call on Uganda to prosecute those who call for the public murder of gay people. We also call on Uganda to revise its legislation. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I come from Berlin, and the whole world rejoiced with us Berliners when the border in our city fell and the borders opened everywhere in Eastern Europe. Now, in the case of Egypt, we reacted too late, too cautiously and, above all, too unemotionally. Where was our joy? Every other word from us was simply about ‘maintaining stability’. However, freedom is the most important thing for every person in the world. We Germans in particular know what we are talking about. What we had in Egypt was not stability; it was oppression. Freedom and stability can go hand in hand any time. Therefore, we should not dictate to the Egyptians who they should elect. Provided the elections proceed in a fair and democratic way, we will have to recognise the result and must not be so arrogant – as we were at the time in Palestine or even in Algeria – as to decide whether or not we will recognise those who are elected. We must recognise the choice that is made. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 In overall terms, the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament supports the waste disposal directive. However, the subject of photovoltaic modules remains a problem. There is no understandable reason for excluding the solar industry from the regulations. We have a wide range of legislation governing waste streams. Therefore, it is not clear why a complete industry, which is expected to produce significant waste streams, is being excluded, particularly as the solar industry is likely to be responsible for a large amount of waste in the near future, when the first solar cells installed on large numbers on European roofs have to be replaced. Solar cells may contain toxic substances which can be reused. For this reason, I have abstained from voting on the report. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, today we are discussing a motion for a resolution on the situation of Christians throughout the world in relation to freedom of religion. The European Parliament supports fundamental freedoms and human rights all over the world. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is one of the driving forces behind this support and this distinguishes us from the conservatives who are focusing specifically on the situation of Christians. In general terms, this is not just about the position of Christians. From a liberal perspective, this concerns freedom of religion as a whole. By this I mean all the religions throughout our entire world. It is about protection for religious minorities and the obligation of every state to protect to the best of its ability the members of those religious minorities which are under threat. We also have problems in Europe. I come from Berlin, and there alone, we have had six arson attacks against mosques within the space of six months, fortunately not resulting in any deaths, following the uproar sparked by a social-democratic former central banker. However, the German state is attempting to provide the best possible protection for religious buildings. In the same way, Egypt is also increasing the measures it is taking following the second major terrorist attack against Christians. Of course, we cannot have a policeman standing in front of every church, mosque or synagogue. I very much regret the fact that in many countries, including my own, Jewish buildings have come to look like high-security institutions. For this reason, it is important that we as politicians take responsibility for the attitude to religious minorities in our countries and that we promote an open, friendly approach to all religions.

 Madam President, Commissioner, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union ban discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union and Article 19 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union oblige the bodies of the EU and all the Member States to fight discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. Lithuania is a Member State of the EU and has thus undertaken to share these common values of the 500 million citizens of the Union. Firstly, I welcome the fact that following our first resolution in 2009, the planned act entered into force in Lithuania in a less severe form and that we have not yet become aware of any instance of this law having been applied, and that its application in respect of the ban on the Christopher Street Day Parade failed and the parade took place. I am all the more astonished, therefore, that new legislative measures are now being proposed under which speaking publicly about or providing information on homosexual relations could effectively result in fines of up to EUR 2 900 and there will no longer be equal opportunities for homosexual people – but at least for women. I therefore welcome the Commission’s strategy to combat homophobia and would particularly like to thank Commissioner Reding for emphasising the importance of protecting these fundamental rights through her attendance here in plenary when the time is nearly midnight.

 Mr President, only recently, we held an international workshop in the large plenary chamber of our Parliamentary building in Brussels on Parental Responsibility and the Protection of Children, which I had the honour of leading. In Europe, there are more and more vulnerable and abandoned children who should not be living permanently in orphanages. It is therefore our duty as legislators to strengthen the right to international adoption within the EU in order to help these children. Article 24 of our Charter of Fundamental Rights also demands this when it states: ‘Children shall have the right to such protection and care as is necessary for their wellbeing’. Although we have the Hague Adoption Convention and a Council of Europe convention, these are not enough. In practice, major legal problems still arise in connection with international adoptions. In these cases, only international regulations which eliminate the differences in national regulations that still exist and replace them with clear and simple principles can help. In this regard, and with all our legislative zeal, we must not lose sight of the fact that the EU must cooperate with the Hague Conference on International Private Law in order to ensure a coordinated procedure. Thus, the EU should not reinvent the wheel in this area. I welcome the Commissioner’s statements in this regard. Alexandra Thein,

 Mr President, the United Nations Convention on Human Rights, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as well as the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, ban discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. The European Union not only has obligations in relation to human rights within its territory, but also an international duty to insist on compliance with these rights and to criticise abuses when dealing with third countries, particularly when we provide financial support through the European Development Fund to third countries like Uganda, which have entered into partnership agreements with us. Accordingly, we actually have the right to comment when these third countries fail to meet the human rights requirements set down in such partnership agreements. Hence, Uganda must respect international human rights standards because it was party to the Cotonou Agreement, which sets down our organised development aid to the ACP countries. Just one year ago, we called on Uganda not to follow through on its plans for a law to criminalise homosexuals. One year on, the situation has deteriorated. There is still the threat of long prison sentences or even the death penalty. With others, I myself demonstrated in front of the Ugandan Embassy in May of this year. This had no effect. We wish to emphasise once again that the EU is generally opposed to the death penalty and to homophobic legislation of this kind. Alexandra Thein,

 Mr President, what is meant by better lawmaking? We want to make simple and transparent laws that EU citizens and companies can understand. In this regard, it is important, above all, to respect the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. We want to regulate at European level only what cannot be regulated at national or local level. An important element of better lawmaking is, above all, having a clear idea of the impact of the planned regulations. Only with this can we achieve the best possible effects and, at the same time, keep any negative impact to a minimum. The impact assessment must therefore be prepared by the Commission with the greatest possible meticulousness. It is right, therefore, that, under pressure from the European Parliament, an independent board was set up to monitor the quality of impact assessments. However, this board is intended to be accountable to the European Parliament. For companies, authorities and citizens, the regulations are associated with costs, whether it is in relation to providing information, labelling products or complying with monitoring obligations. If the costs are too high, it cancels out the benefit of a policy. We therefore have the ambitious goal, which is also the right one, of reducing administrative costs by reducing red tape by 25% by 2012. To achieve this goal we need to act at European level, and the chances of achieving it are good. However, at this point it should also be mentioned that a good third – some people say two thirds – of the administrative burden that is derived from the EU is due to the fact that the Member States simply enact too many unnecessary administrative and bureaucratic regulations when transposing EU law. EU bodies and Member States should therefore actively work together to prevent unnecessary red tape. The transposition of Community law must also be fundamentally and actively scrutinised. Above all, the national parliaments should also fulfil their obligation for involvement in accordance with the Treaty of Lisbon. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Israel for taking seriously the many concerns about its proposed legislation and for at least watering down the provisions slightly. Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have, for many years, been required to disclose their sources of funding in a completely transparent way and even to publish this information on their websites. The planned legislation, even in its watered-down form, is ultimately aimed only at specific NGOs: firstly at human rights organisations and secondly at those which receive public funding. This includes, for example, public money from the United Nations or the European Union. In contrast, far-right groups or non-governmental organisations which are privately funded and which, for example, support the building of illegal settlements, are not subject to any legal restrictions and do not have to make their funding sources public. The problem with the proposed legislation lies in this unequal treatment. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, firstly I want to reject the numerous accusations from outside and, in some cases, from within Parliament, claiming that we are discussing this subject at the wrong time, after the peace talks have begun. The parliamentary question which I helped to draw up was tabled at a time when none of us thought that direct peace talks would start up again. I have been involved in this area since the early 1990s and this subject has been under discussion in Parliament for a long time. This is ultimately all about preventing the Lower Jordan River from finally running dry. The lower part of the river has already been reduced to a mere trickle. It consists only of waste water and contains no fresh water at all. All the scientists are agreed that the Lower Jordan River will be as good as dead in one or two years. I find it disturbing that the resolution addresses Israel, Jordan, Syria and the Palestinian Authority on equal terms. The Lower Jordan River area is located entirely in zone C, which means that the Palestinian Authority does not even have a right to access the area, never mind any administrative rights or any influence at all over it. It has already been said that the Palestinian Authority can do nothing in this area. Therefore, this resolution should be aimed at other countries. When a country, in this case Israel, uses 75% of the water available in the Lower Jordan River, although part of the water has already been taken by other countries, and leaves almost no water for the Palestinians to live on, this is a political issue. This problem was supposedly resolved in the Oslo II Agreement and we have not made any progress since then. The specific difficulty at the moment is that the Palestinians are constantly attempting to drill wells, which are immediately destroyed, and also that the Israeli water authority, which is a monopoly, is not drilling wells for the Palestinians, but only for the illegal settlements.

Madam President, Commissioner, the financial crisis has highlighted that a uniform financial supervisory authority is an absolute necessity for the European Union. The three EU-wide supervisory authorities which are envisaged for banking, insurance and securities should thereby be provided with the right to intervene directly in national institutions, such as Deutsche Bank. These intervention rights are restricted to absolutely exceptional cases and will hopefully never be used. As a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I regret that the committee responsible has not given any consideration to our constitutional objections regarding the envisaged intervention rights, both at European and national level, especially in the wake of the Lisbon judgment of the German Federal Constitutional Court. A recommendation from the Committee on Legal Affairs, whereby the Commission, as guardian of the treaties, would act as the final decision-making authority within the framework of a set procedure, or, in other words, have the last say, was not followed. On this point, the Committee on Legal Affairs recognises that the technical expertise required to make judgments is indisputably available in the national and European supervisory authorities and not in the Commission. I hope that during the current negotiations, too, a solution will also be found to this constitutional problem. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

Along with the majority of Members in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I have decided to vote in favour of the Sommer report. It is true that the Liberals were not able to achieve their goals in every area. The adoption of origin labelling for meat and milk in processed products is a regrettable move, because it imposes significant costs on producers and seems almost impossible to implement in practice. However, for me, the positive results of the vote outweigh the negative ones. For the first time, we have uniform regulations on food labelling throughout the entire internal market, with no possibility of individual countries going it alone. In addition, one of the decisive successes of this vote for me is the fact that the misleading traffic light model was rejected. A mandatory colour coded nutrient declaration will not be permitted either at a European or a national level. Uniform Europe-wide labelling rules will bring clear advantages for companies and consumers. The cost of manufacturing and selling products will fall because manufacturers will only have to follow a single regulation. Consumers will benefit from uniform nutrient labelling when comparing products that come from within Europe. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mr Vice-President, our plenary sessions are public and this gives a very poor impression. I would like to add my voice to what has been said. I am not asking for an email; instead I would actually like it to be officially presented and explained on Parliament’s website, because one statement at least must be incorrect. 168 cannot have been the threshold. If 621 votes were cast, then the threshold must have been 310 – if I have understood things correctly. I would therefore ask for a written explanation on the website so that every citizen can also understand it.

 Combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography is vitally important. We must make every effort to prevent child pornography being made available over the Internet.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the security and law enforcement authorities are working ever closer together to improve the cross-border prosecution of crimes in order to protect the safety of citizens in the European Union. In this regard, I could mention the European Arrest Warrant, for example. In return, however, the fundamental rights of citizens accused of crimes are being left out of the legislation. Up to now, all attempts to secure the guarantees afforded by the rule of law in criminal proceedings throughout the EU have failed to achieve the requisite unanimity in the Council or to receive mutual recognition. With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, we now have new opportunities for protecting the basic procedural rights of citizens in criminal proceedings. Now, for the first time, the European Parliament has the power of codecision, and only a qualified majority is now required in the Council. As you know, we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are in favour of protecting and continuing to extend citizens’ rights. Therefore, we have also worked to ensure that, in future, all EU citizens will have the right to an interpreter and to a written translation if they are arrested by the police or brought before a court as an accused person in a Member State whose language they do not speak or understand. It is vital not only that criminal proceedings be better coordinated across borders, but also that the rights of citizens in criminal investigations and proceedings – for example, the right to a fair trial – be adequately available to citizens throughout Europe.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I simply cannot understand how anyone can be against freeing micro-entities – and I stress micro-entities, not small or medium-sized businesses – from annual accounting obligations. Here we are not talking about the export-oriented medium-sized company from Baden-Württemberg with a hundred employees, but small craft enterprises, the flower shop, the baker around the corner, the newly founded IT start-up business. For years, politicians have been repeating over and over, both at national and European level, that precisely these micro-entities must be relieved. Relieved from unnecessary costs, in this case, unnecessary costs for a tax advisor, not from the otherwise essential costs – in Belgium it is lawyers who complete these annual accounts, in France auditors – and relieved from an unnecessary amount of work and administrative burdens, now more than ever in the current financial and economic crisis. Now that the Commission has finally tabled the proposal, which Parliament has called on it to do for so long, all of a sudden, the sceptics and nay-sayers express concerns. Only seven per cent of the micro-entities that we are talking about are involved in cross-border activities. Therefore, with regard to the principle of subsidiarity, there should not be any regulation at all at European level. To make matters worse, the accounting rules have continued to be oriented towards the needs of large and medium-sized businesses, and have been totally inappropriate for the micro-entities we are talking about here from the outset. I hear the arguments of the opposition, firstly, that the micro-entrepreneur might need a loan and then not be able to present his bank with anything. I say to you, anyone who is familiar with Basel II knows that for the bank, the annual balance sheet is at best a nice bonus, but nothing more. Secondly, the supposed creditor protection: creditors who depend on the annual balance sheet are in the minority. In all my time as a lawyer, when a business of this size is sold, I have never experienced a buyer depending on the significance of annual accounts in whatever form. Thirdly, the southern Member States of the European Union – yes, precisely those that right now are the subject of constant inglorious reports in our newspapers – want to maintain the old regulation. They can do this as the regulation is optional. However, states that demand annual financial statements from micro-enterprises because they do not have effective tax administration and exercise no control, apart from the receipt of the annual financial statement, should hardly be surprised if they have missing tax revenue or tax fraud. I therefore call on all MEPs, in particular, the Social Democrats, to approve this sensible regulation, especially as Mr Lehne from our Committee on Legal Affairs took all concerns into account through compromise regulations, subsequent to which no further relevant arguments were put forward.

According to the resolution of the European Parliament on the draft general budget for the financial year 2010, adopted on 17 December 2009, a vote was taken today on the amending budget for the European Parliament, following the revised calculations made by the Parliamentary administration. The FDP in the European Parliament abstained, because there was a paragraph in the package of amendments concerned that we could not reconcile with our convictions. The FDP had already expressed its opposition to an increase in the secretarial allowance to EUR 1 500 during the discussions in committee. It is out of the secretarial allowance that MEPs’ assistants are paid. The FDP considers that the argument that more money is needed due to the additional work that MEPs have to do with the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is unsound, as there is nothing in past experience to support this. Certainly, due to the Treaty of Lisbon, which has just come into force, Parliament will overall need extra capacity for legislative work, but with the introduction of the Assistants’ Statute from the beginning of the current parliamentary term, there is still no proof that MEPs actually need more assistants. For this reason, there are grounds for concern that further demands and supplementary increases, or an extension of office capacity, will follow. For this reason, the FDP in the European Parliament abstained. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, neither party to the conflict has so far met the demands of the United Nations for a credible and independent investigation into the accusations of the Goldstone report. This is regrettable, particularly on Israel’s part, because, however controversial the Goldstone report might be, any state that calls itself a democratic state based on the rule of law is obliged to allow such serious accusations to be subjected to an independent investigation. An internal military investigation by the Israeli army, which is itself under suspicion, is not sufficient. If the EU takes its own principles of respect for human rights and international law seriously, it must increase the pressure on both sides, including in the context of its bilateral relations, and insist that the investigation that has been called for into possible violations of international and humanitarian law is carried out according to the principles of the rule of law. War crimes must be punished under international law, as has been said here many times. If necessary, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court will have to carry out the investigations on the basis of Article 12(3) of the Rome Statute. However, irrespective of the Goldstone report, there is currently no reason to continue the siege on Gaza. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mrs Malmström, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I am a member of the delegation for relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council, in other words, the Palestinian parliament. Last week, our delegation was refused entry to Gaza by Israel. The situation in Gaza is very disturbing, particularly now that winter has come. Only 10% of the population can obtain the supplies they need by smuggling goods through the tunnels and this is exactly why the tunnels are tolerated by everyone. Before operation ‘Cast Lead’ the situation was exactly the reverse and 90% of the population of Gaza could take care of themselves. As an occupying power, Israel should be responsible for providing for the population in all the occupied areas. Israel is shirking its responsibility under international law, which means that the international community and, above all, the EU have to step in. If we are supplying food to 90% of the population of Gaza, we have a right to see where European taxpayers’ money is being spent, whether it is being used appropriately and whether it is reaching the people who need it.

 The German Free Democratic Party members of the European Parliament have abstained from voting on the Copenhagen resolution for the following reasons. The resolution contains statements about financing for climate protection measures in third countries without defining the specific criteria or purpose of the financing. We cannot justify this to taxpayers. In addition, we believe that blanket criticism of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) is wrong. The ICAO is the organisation which deals with aviation matters at an international level. Both the criticism and the statement about the alleged failure of ICAO negotiations are incorrect and inappropriate. The call for specific arrangements for a CO2
 trading system for the aviation industry goes against current EU legislation and overburdens the EU’s negotiating position in an international climate agreement with unrealistic demands. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

I voted for the Protocol as I believe that it will benefit the European Union. The Protocol is not the right instrument to address the issue of human rights abuses.

The Protocol does not imply recognition of these settlements under international law. Britta Reimers,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we now have three years of discussions and negotiations under our belts in a process that occasionally stalled and sometimes got quite tough. We set ourselves the goal of simplifying the quality systems, ensuring the reliability of quality and also establishing a way to get better prices for farmers. We did not succeed in controlling marketing standards or the regulation of supply. We now intend doing this in the common organisation of the markets. Overall, however, it must said that we have taken a first step towards a uniform quality policy. The long time spent in negotiations also shows how much we have struggled among ourselves to reach an agreement and that it is not always easy to make progress at first reading. The agreement has now also been confirmed by the Council. Speaking on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I have no choice other than to support the compromise before us and to ask you to support the amendments. We have failed to achieve a lot of what we wanted. The ALDE Group was not happy with the introduction of another new quality characteristic like the mountain products, however when one considers what has been achieved overall as a package, then we can support this. I think our colleagues will also be satisfied with this. Britta Reimers,

 Mr President, Ms Reding, ladies and gentlemen, the last reform of the sugar regime was a very positive development and the industry adapted to the market as a result. However, the complaints from all sides show that we need to go further and that we must continue to develop the sugar market, because the Commission’s forecasts were not accurate. The African, Caribbean and Pacific States have not been supplying Europe with sugar. Instead, they have sold it to other countries, because markets all over the world have changed. They have undergone huge changes in recent years, but not in the way that was predicted. Demand has grown in many third countries and we were not able to foresee this. This means that demand for sugar has increased all over the world and, therefore, that there have been reductions in supplies to the European market. The problem is that sugar is not the only product of the agricultural industry, and so farmers have also had to adapt increasingly to the requirements of the market. They are considering alternative crops. For example, in my area of Germany, energy crops are being cultivated and they are genuine competitors for sugar beet. In the course of the market reform, we should discuss whether it is time to abolish the quota regulations that apply to the sugar market and to give it more freedom in future. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we need to take note of the fact that we are discussing two subjects here. I will not, at this point, say anything about the voluntary labelling of the meat; I will stick mainly to the electronic identification of the animals. In that connection, Mr Schnellhardt, I need to disagree with you quite stridently. Sheep farmers are telling us very clearly that they have major problems with electronic identification, as there are technical shortcomings with it. The tags are not coming out of the animals, but the technology is malfunctioning. The fault that occurs as a result is blamed on the farmers. That is not acceptable, and it is a situation that we must avoid in the case of cattle. It is therefore right that we should leave this system as voluntary in cattle in future, too, until the system has matured. As a farmer, I am not saying that the system should not be developed or introduced, but allowing something to mature takes time. Moreover, it is important – for public health in particular – to call electronic identification into question if it does not work. As regards public health, it is quite clear that we need certainty. As long as that certainty is not in place, we should stick to a voluntary system. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

It is important that we take up a clear position in this transitional year. I would also like to emphasise that I welcome the constructive way in which we have worked together and I hope that we can continue to work even more constructively in future, because in the past, we were often only able to make progress on agricultural reform in fits and starts.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, ever since it was decided to abandon the milk quota, people have been watching you closely, Commissioner, to see how you behave and what action you are taking to exit the scheme in a rational way. Is there really any pattern discernible here? We have had a year of regional over-production and a rise in global production, which is hardly surprising since there was previously a shortage on the market, leading to higher prices. In addition, over the last two years there has been a rise in operating costs of about 20 %, principally due to direct and indirect rises in energy costs. The market reacted in the normal way to the increased supply and came under pressure. This caused prices to drop. The market is now stabilising again because the farmers are displaying an ability to manage the market and are slowing their production more than is usual for the season. The criticised price decreases have led to a rise in demand in the market. The decline in the euro exchange rate promotes marketability in the global market, making European dairy produce competitive. In the case of cheese, stocks have been reduced to such an extent that more milk is now needed for cheese production. In other words, this is a normal market cycle. Now we come to the Commission: if the market is working, why do we need a super levy? Is its sole purpose to acquire funds for the EU? Has the time perhaps come to put the super levy on a European footing, finally transferring it from a national administrative level?

 The German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament has spoken out clearly in favour of the introduction of a debt redemption fund. However, participation in such a fund must be associated with clear and strict rules, such as were contained in the proposal made by the German Council of Economic Experts to the German Government in autumn 2011. Watering down the criteria for participation is neither productive nor effective. Linking the introduction of a debt redemption fund with the eurobonds project and the treatment of economic imbalances is unfair, and is rejected by the FDP in the European Parliament in the strongest possible terms.

Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, it is utterly astounding that we are to decide here on the future of the common agricultural policy, but have had essential criteria for this decision withheld from us. There is nothing to prevent a new delimitation of less-favoured areas being carried out. It is also acceptable to try to base this on fewer criteria than is currently the case. However, if these are to be limited to eight criteria, made up of climate-related and geological criteria, it is unacceptable for MEPs to be denied the opportunity to scrutinise whether these criteria are indeed appropriate. We need maps of the new distribution of less-favoured areas in order to be able to examine whether this new distribution based on the eight criteria makes any sense at all. However, the withholding of the map material will obviously arouse distrust as to whether there really is any desire at all to enable Parliament to exercise its right of codecision. As a farmer, I have serious doubts from a purely professional point of view as to whether these simple criteria will enable this sort of area classification to be made appropriately. There are, after all, other criteria that could convey disadvantage, such as a lack of infrastructure, labour market access or general historical farm structures. Moreover, different combinations of various criteria could lead to very different results. It is high time that we were able to evaluate the Commission’s proposals in an objective way in order to be able to improve them if necessary. Otherwise, I would agree with my fellow Members who wish to leave less-favoured areas out of the current agricultural reform discussion. Britta Reimers,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, within the last year, a new viral disease has been discovered in sheep and cattle that leads to deformity or even still-birth among lambs and calves. The disease is apparently communicated by midges, which also seem to have been responsible for carrying it into the EU. The affected farms have suffered serious damage, in some cases even fighting for survival, and have been left to fend for themselves until now. We are all agreed that technically correct monitoring is essential for new diseases so that it is possible to determine, on a scientific basis, whether or not it is a new epizootic. This requires time, however, and time is precisely what the affected parties at local level do not have. They need help. Funds based on mutuality, such as an animal disease fund, require mandatory notification in order to be able to distribute financial assistance. When will the Commission finally develop a standard strategy for new diseases that clearly defines when remedial measures and assistance can be provided to those affected by new diseases, in addition to the monitoring services? We are running out of time. The disease is continuing to spread. Trading partners outside Europe are responding with export embargos, so that the damage is also spreading to non-infected farms. The insemination and breeding livestock trade is restricted, despite the fact that the disease is spread by midges and direct infection seems unlikely. How does the Commission intend to proceed in relation to export embargos? Climate change and increased trade and mobility in society will lead to a rise in diseases entering our territory. We need a rational concept to reduce the consequences. We need answers for those affected that will help them and us all. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 I have voted against the motion for a resolution on the feasibility of introducing stability bonds because I am of the opinion that the creation of Eurobonds would send out the wrong signal. Since the introduction of the euro, low interest rates have led to higher debt levels in many euro area countries.

Therefore, I believe that the introduction of Eurobonds would make the current crisis worse. Britta Reimers,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Nicholson for his successful handling of the negotiations. We have decided on the abolition of the existing cost-intensive and market-distorting milk quota system and analysed the findings of the high level group for milk. The dairy package that has resulted from the negotiations is an important first step towards a market and competition-oriented dairy sector. The formation of inter-branch organisations is being promoted, with these organisations to be given the ability to negotiate contracts on behalf of their members. The negotiating power of milk producers is to be bolstered – in future they will be able to negotiate on an equal footing, if they so wish. It is also good that we will not be overshooting the mark. These contracts will not be permitted to make up more than 33% of the national and 3.5% of the European market. This ensures that there will be no new imbalance and that the necessary market freedom is retained. As there is no general requirement for contracts, farmers’ individual commercial freedom to make decisions remains secure. This is an important element of a functional market. We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will support the dairy package, and I ask you all to vote in favour of this package in tomorrow’s vote in plenary.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we need functioning markets with scope for competition in Europe. We will only achieve this, however, when everyone has equal rights. The role of farmers in the market is that of relatively small sole traders. Upstream and downstream of them, by contrast, we often see quite large business structures. I therefore welcome the fact that the Commission is, for once, looking into the market not only from the consumer point of view, but also from that of producers. If we have imbalances, we need to find ways to tackle them without giving rise to excessive bureaucracy and without creating new imbalances elsewhere. We all know how sensitively markets react. In these times of the debt crisis, in particular, that is something we see day in, day out. It is therefore important to test the waters carefully if we intervene. Markets need sensible frameworks in order to facilitate a minimum level of balance. However, they also need enough freedom to act and to be able to do so. Agriculture cannot be excepted from this principle. Only a balance of freedom and responsibility will enable all market participants to make the most of their advantages and thus help bring about long-term growth and prosperity.

However, the super weapon seems to be losing its effectiveness. I agree with the authors of the motion for a resolution that we need to be more prudent and more careful with antimicrobial agents. The aim must be to limit the use of antibiotics to the essential curing of infections. We also need incentives for further research and development of new agents and alternative solutions. However, it is vital that we all pull in the same direction.

 I am 100% behind Mr Duff’s resolution. It is right and important to draw attention to the situation of the population of Western Sahara. The Moroccan authorities must provide information on the extent to which its economic activities relating to the natural resources in the territory of Western Sahara are for the benefit of the population of the territory and in accordance with their wishes. The status of the region under international law must be clarified. A court ruling on the territory of Western Sahara would bring about clarity in respect of relations between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco. Nonetheless, this resolution comes at the wrong time. Had it been passed, the resolution would have de facto
 blocked the EU’s fisheries agreement with Morocco, since this expires on 28 February 2012, and it is unlikely that the European Court of Justice would have passed a ruling by this date. Had this resolution been passed, it would have sent out the wrong signal to our Moroccan partners. Morocco is the only country in North Africa to have succeeded in initiating reforms to bring about democracy by peaceful means. This process should not be disrupted. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 In terms of social and economic policy, I believe it to be fundamentally right to increase the proportion of women in management positions. However, I have deliberately voted against the report, because paragraph 16b calls for the Europe-wide introduction of quotas for women. This is going too far. A mandatory quota will interfere on a large scale with companies’ freedom to do business and is therefore questionable from a constitutional perspective. In addition, an across-the-board quota does not take into consideration the specific circumstances of each company and industry. For example, it would not currently be possible to impose a standard quota in the construction, engineering or IT industries in Germany. In this area, it is essential to focus initially on training and study opportunities in order to bring about a significant increase in the proportion of young women employed in these traditionally male-dominated industries. In addition, we need to improve conditions for working parents, in particular, by introducing family-conscious, flexible work models and developing the child care infrastructure. Against this background, I would rather see a voluntary undertaking by companies and cooperation between the worlds of politics and business instead of an inflexible, mandatory quota.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his persistent and positive work. Where the future of agricultural policy after 2013 is concerned, we have to decide the direction in which we want to go. Do we want an agricultural sector that faces up to the challenges by acting in an innovative, modern, courageous, self-aware, responsible and independent way in the market? Or do we want an agricultural sector that continues to be drip-fed by Europe and which needs its hand to be held and encouraging words from Mummy with each step it takes into the future? That is the course we are currently setting. To cope with the challenges of the future we need to promote modern technologies in the agricultural sector instead of having endless debates on ideologies. If farms are to be enabled to plan with certainty then we cannot keep changing course every couple of years. It is too much of a strain on our farmers’ finances. Everyone here must surely be aware that each political change of direction results in new laws and directives, which in turn demand investment by farms without at the same time increasing their incomes. We should not care whether a farm is large or small; instead we should be concerned with whether it is run in an economically sound manner. We should not care whether it produces conventionally or organically, so long as it handles resources responsibly. We should also not care how many animals are kept, so long as those animals are treated well. The important thing for us must be that we have sufficient good quality food in the future at affordable prices in Europe. After all, Europe is not alone in the world. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 The German Free Democratic Party delegation in the European Parliament assumes that the inclusion of Romania and Bulgaria in the Schengen area will further improve freedom of movement within the EU. Now that both Member States have achieved positive evaluation results in all areas of the Schengen review, there should be no more obstacles to delay inclusion further. There is no denying that the technical securing of borders will not automatically make them impermeable as long as problems persist in combating corruption in the justice and policing system. Accordingly, this challenge also relates to Member States already in the Schengen area. For this reason, the German Free Democratic Party delegation believes that criteria such as the fight against corruption must receive greater attention when evaluating the Schengen mechanism, and any misdemeanours must be punished appropriately.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for many companies in the European Union, the continual rise in fuel prices represents an additional burden. European fishermen in particular are suffering as a result of this price rise because they cannot simply compensate for the additional costs by increasing their catch or by charging better prices. The current political situation in North Africa and the Middle East has exacerbated the problem. We therefore need to investigate the effects of the rise in fuel prices on the economy and employment in the EU. Which sectors are particularly at risk and what sort of support could be provided without it distorting competition? We therefore call on the Commission to look into this. It is important that we support the European fishing industry, among other things, in order not to increase our dependence on imports from third countries. We are on the verge of reforming the common fisheries policy and therefore, we are under a particular obligation to be cautious and not to act prematurely with regard to this matter either.

 Mr President, Mrs Damanaki, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that Parliament is finally to vote on this issue and would like to thank the rapporteurs for their work. The amendment to the Council regulation on the financial measures in the Community is one of the main tools we need in order to implement the common fisheries policy. This is true in particular for the areas of international fishery relations, data collection and scientific studies. The control systems of the common fisheries policy and their implementation are particularly important. The rapporteur has made every effort to convince his fellow Members of the need to increase the co-financing rate to a maximum of 75%. We have been unable to acquiesce to his wishes. The existing regulations have proven themselves in practice and already allow for some exceptions. The Member States already make use of the opportunity to avail of co-financing and there is no need for any further incentives. It is important that the amendment to the regulation should clear the way for a coherent legal framework. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

Madam President, market fluctuations are important for the proper functioning of markets in order to create incentives for the buying and selling of goods. For us farmers, commodity futures trading is a basic component of the buying and selling of harvested crops. It provides an important opportunity to achieve planning certainty through the early setting of prices and quantities. In contrast to the situation in our prosperous industrialised nations, rising food prices are a particular problem in the poor regions of the world where people have to spend a large proportion of their income on food. We must not intervene in the markets every time the prices change in an attempt to combat natural fluctuations. However, without internationally applicable framework legislation for the financial markets, we cannot even start to think about regulating the commodities markets, because if there is too much money in the financial market it will find suitable equivalents, and commodities are currently highly regarded. Therefore, we should not be surprised if agricultural commodities are now also a sought-after trading objective. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

We can enact more laws and directives, we can carry out more checks at even more cost, we can impose more severe penalties – none of these things will succeed against the criminal energy fuelled by such a tough fight for existence. We must finally tackle the causes of this problem. We must at last put an end to the constant demand for more and cheaper food. As a farmer, I have experienced the powerlessness against the criminal activities of certain individuals – as in this case – on my own doorstep. Together with my professional colleagues, I have shuddered at the thought of who will be next in line and innocently drawn into this maelstrom. I would therefore like to ask the Commission: what do you and your colleagues intend to do to restore the value of food? I welcome your proposals, but with these you will not solve the main problem.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have known for twelve years that battery farming practices would be banned in the EU from 1 January 2012 onwards. How can it be that twelve years have not been enough for some Member States to implement this ban in good time and to prepare their poultry industry accordingly? This is just one of many examples of how poor implementation leads to frustration. Egg producers in Member States who have implemented the changes in good time are already experiencing competitive anomalies that run counter to the principles of the EU. I am calling on the Commission to require that the relevant law should be upheld in all Member States and to do all it can to ensure that it is implemented. Eggs should no longer be produced in battery cages after January 2012 and the then illegal eggs should no longer be allowed to reach the shops, putting an end to their negative effect on competition. The farmers who have changed their practices to comply with EU requirements should not experience financial disadvantage while those who flout the changeover reap the economic benefits. It is impossible to explain to people in Europe why EU law does not apply equally in all Member States and why some Member States are always seen to be dragging their feet. The recent crises show where this can lead us. We need a Europe that acts in a concerted way, rather than one in which every member can do as it pleases, regardless of the rest. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Madam President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, one of our top priorities as Members of the European Parliament is to reduce bureaucracy and simplify legislation and regulations in all the political areas of the European Union. This is the only way in which we can manage taxpayers’ money efficiently and increase the acceptance of our political decisions among the citizens of Europe. For this reason, it is important for farmers to feel the direct effect of simplification measures of this kind in the agricultural sector. Their job is to produce food, not to write books. At a time when local authority budgets are becoming increasingly tight, it is also important for us to reduce the amount of work to be done by their administrative staff. Regulations must be drawn up in such a way that they are not padded out unnecessarily. In addition, we must ensure that the sanctions we impose are in proportion to the breach of regulations. An efficient, long-term policy is characterised by the fact that it places a greater emphasis on advice than it does on punishment. This is the only way that we can give our citizens and our farmers the incentives to implement new findings and to fulfil society’s requirements. We need to take all of this into account when we discuss the future common agricultural policy. We also need to focus more closely on ensuring that there is no duplication of formalities and controls and that forms are only filled out when they provide real added value for the administrative bodies and for the farmers themselves. We must finally learn to work together and not against one another. Britta Reimers,

 Madam President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, providing protection for bees is in the best interests of the agricultural sector and many farmers are also beekeepers. We have seen a decline in the bee population in many regions of Europe. We must identify the causes of this problem and take the necessary countermeasures. It is a good thing that the budget funding for the national bee programmes up to 2013 has been increased from EUR 26 million to EUR 32 million. However, that is not enough. We must ensure that these programmes are continued after 2013. In order to achieve this, it is also particularly important for us to improve and simplify the process which allows researchers, beekeepers and farmers to share specialist knowledge. We should focus as soon as possible on combating the diseases and parasites to which bees are subject. We must not leave the beekeepers to fight this battle on their own. We urgently need better and more standardised statistics from all the Member States throughout the EU. This is because we need to work with facts and not just with speculation. As the number of beekeepers is constantly falling, we also need to invest more in education and training. We should provide more support for young beekeepers and also for full-time beekeepers, to ensure that the profession has a future and does not die out. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports this resolution. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks to the rapporteurs. In view of the high level of imports of fish and fish products into the EU, it is essential that we maintain and support our local fishermen, as well as the domestic aquaculture sector. We urgently need improved catch methods in order to secure the long-term livelihood of both our seas and our fishermen. It is equally essential that we enable aquaculture to expand further. We are in urgent need of more effective data collection and more intensive research, since only once we know what is actually going on will we be able to make the right decisions for the future. Our lack of success in combining economics with ecology – which are not actually that different – is often down to excessive bureaucracy and insufficient knowledge. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 The motion for a resolution on the crisis in the livestock sector which has been adopted by the European Parliament calls for the introduction of new market management mechanisms in the livestock industry and of safety nets in all the cereal sectors. I oppose these market interventions. However, the motion for a resolution also includes important liberal requirements for pragmatic thresholds for GMOs in imported feeds and a review of the ban on feeding meat and bone meal. Therefore, I did not vote against the resolution, but instead abstained in the final vote. In order to guarantee a supply of feed for the European livestock sector, we must relieve farmers of their burden of red tape and create a framework of legal certainty. A market focus in the agricultural industry will also mean that farmers can take responsibility for their own businesses and need not expect constant protective interventions in the market to be made by politicians. If agricultural policy is based only on individual interests, the result will be a spiral of exemptions which it will not be possible to finance and which will distort the market. This will turn farmers into the victims of a bureaucratic, state-run control system. In order for the market to function effectively, we need a clearly defined framework for the entire agricultural industry and not just for individual areas. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, integrated maritime policy is a forward-looking area. The oceans are being used increasingly intensively for transport, maritime economic activities, offshore energy and fishing, and the development of these areas must be coordinated. The space available is limited and, therefore, the various maritime sectors must take a responsible and thoughtful approach to working together. The use and the protection of the seas must not conflict with one another. These two areas are mutually dependent, because the oceans can only support us if they are healthy. I would like to highlight the positive cooperation between countries bordering on the Baltic who are working together to promote the dynamic development of the fisheries, the environment, the infrastructure and tourism in coastal regions. We must continue to focus on the fishing industry, which is in a weak position and is often regarded as being a low priority, but which, because it provides us with food, represents a vital link in the coastal economy. I would like to congratulate Mrs Meissner on this positive report. Britta Reimers,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Convention on Future Multilateral Cooperation in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries established a very important organisation: the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation, or NAFO. Its aim is the conservation and optimum utilisation of the fishery resources in the Northwest Atlantic. The convention has since been amended and brought more into line with other regional conventions. Modern concepts such as stock management have been incorporated. I feel it is important that the structure of the organisation is streamlined and that the obligations of the contracting parties are clearly defined. It is also good that the possibility of resolving conflicts through a dispute settlement procedure is provided. The fishing possibilities accruing to the European Union under the convention are of great interest to the EU. Parliament should give its approval under the new powers granted to it by the Treaty of Lisbon. As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I commend Mr Wałesa’s report to the House. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the distribution of profits in the food supply chain has become unbalanced, and generally to the detriment of farmers. That is the correct conclusion drawn in this report. Unfortunately, the rapporteur has focused on the old instruments of agricultural policy. He believes that farmers’ incomes can be improved by regulating supply in the manner of a planned economy. Experience tells us that planned economies go hand in hand with greater bureaucracy, but our farmers want to produce – they do not want more paperwork. Measures that are not based on the basic principles of a social market economy have failed in the past. A planned economy has not worked in the agricultural sector in recent decades. A social market economy, on the other hand, offers farmers the opportunity to run a successful business. If we are to improve the situation of farmers, then we must ensure that the European farming sector is competitive in the long term. To achieve this, it is essential that we improve the bargaining position of farmers vis-à-vis the other actors in the food supply chain. This can be achieved by means of a fair and transparent market that is also capable of holding its own in the global market. At present, I have my doubts as to whether I can vote in favour of the report. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank our rapporteur for his constructive cooperation and for the important aspects highlighted by his report on the future of the CAP after 2013. This report calls for further development of the existing common agricultural policy rather than the development of a new policy. This is a good thing. The primary function of agriculture is and remains the production of food for our citizens. The ever-increasing need for public goods, the growth in population numbers and the simultaneous shortage of natural resources make this more difficult to achieve. Farmers are required to produce more and more with less and less. This is impossible without increasing efficiency. The European Parliament, the Commission and the Council are responsible for securing the necessary framework conditions for this. If we in Europe want to maintain a healthy and diverse agricultural sector in the future, we will also need to take account of the needs of farmers, namely by imposing as little bureaucracy as necessary and by allowing as much entrepreneurial freedom as possible to enable them to earn a reasonable income for themselves.

 Mr President, Commissioners, I would like to congratulate Mr Cadec on his successful and balanced report. I would also like to thank him for his excellent cooperation. There are major challenges involved in regulating the import of fishery and aquaculture products into the EU. With a volume of 12 million tonnes and a value of EUR 55 billion, the EU fisheries market is the largest in the world. This market is growing rapidly and is increasingly dependent on imports from third countries. It is therefore important for us to control the conditions under which the products from third countries are produced and imported. We have now submitted two amendments in plenary. These relate to the need for us to recognise the special economic situation in the peripheral regions of Europe. However, we do not hold market liberalisation alone responsible for the difficulties. The huge introduction of fish products onto the EU market, which has been described as unfair, also has no direct effect on... (The President cut off the speaker) Britta Reimers  (ALDE

I support the action of the European Union in reorganising the current remuneration policy to provide long-term success and more accountability for decision makers. However, this must not lead to a situation in which policy determines salaries. This should remain the task of the authorities which are already in place, such as the board of governors and the general meeting of the banks. The proposed remuneration policy must therefore not replace existing structures, but at most complement them where necessary, insofar as this is beneficial to the quality of economic decisions.

 It is certainly important to tighten the regulations on internships. The representatives of the German Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament have supported this. Young people often work for months on end without payment, hoping that they might still get a permanent job afterwards. This is an unsustainable situation. Internships should not destroy jobs. However, today’s plenary vote is going to pave the way in the future for a complete ban on unpaid internships. We believe that this gives a wrong message. It should still be possible to do a three-month unpaid internship, for example. There are numerous non profit-making or social organisations where a young person can acquire exciting, interesting experiences. However, such organisations are often unable to pay any remuneration for the internship. The key factor should be the duration of an internship. In the case of any internship lasting longer than six months, the employer can rely on productive output from the intern. From then on, remuneration should also be paid. The decision made today is impracticable and goes too far. We therefore do not support this part of the resolution. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mr Milana, the rapporteur, on his report. In a world in which fish stocks are becoming smaller and the demand for fish and fish products is rising, aquaculture is becoming more and more important. The report underlines the important role of European aquaculture in satisfying our needs and our demand. The growth in European aquaculture has proven to be insufficient. The Community legal framework is responsible, among other things, for development in the European Union coming to a near standstill since 2001, while the rest of the world has seen considerable growth. The Member States could evidently not be persuaded to model the national and Community legal framework in a way that would allow aquaculture in the EU to be developed in a dynamic way. Bureaucratic obstacles and a substantial administrative burden are the consequences of this legal framework. I therefore call on the Commission to adapt the directives relating to the designated Natura 2000 areas as soon as possible, in such a way as to enable sustainable aquaculture in these areas too, thereby making a positive contribution to their management. A total ban on aquaculture in these areas is unacceptable. There are always complaints about the excessive requirements involved in impact assessments for the establishment of new farms or for the expansion of existing farms. That should not be the case. Furthermore, we can see that the damage caused by the voracious cormorants in many areas is jeopardising the existence of traditional fish ponds. To ensure that this is not also the case in the aquaculture that is still to be developed, we need the European Cormorant Management Plan that we have been calling for for a long time to finally be adopted. My last point concerns aquaculturists in developing countries. These aquaculturists must be made more aware of a policy on quality and higher production standards – particularly as regards environmental protection, hygiene and social standards – in their production.

 Mandatory origin labelling of meat, poultry, dairy products, fresh fruit and vegetables and processed products made from one ingredient, which is called for in the report on the provision of food information to consumers, puts an unreasonable burden on food processing companies. For this reason, I have voted against the report. Food is produced across national borders within the European internal market. For example, in the dairy industry, milk from different countries is collected and processed. Separate labelling of the batches that are being processed from different countries is technically impossible. This will place bureaucratic obstacles in the path of European companies which are successful on the global market.

 Combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography is vitally important. We must use all our strength to combat the availability of child pornography in communications networks. The permanent and effective control of child abuse is both a political responsibility and a precept of the rule of law.

 In the vote on the Scottà report on agricultural product quality policy, Amendment 5 was accepted, which called for the mandatory labelling of the origin of foods made from only one ingredient. This requirement involves significantly more work and higher costs for the agriculture industry and food processors, without bringing any real added value for consumers. For this reason, I have voted against this amendment. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when discussing quality logos and mandatory designations of origin for food, we must not forget that our political decisions need to be implementable in practice. I cannot see how Amendments 4 and 5 can be implemented in practice and I will therefore be rejecting them. Quality logos should, in principle, be viewed as beneficial if they are voluntary. They give producers and processors of goods the opportunity to be successful in niche markets. However, we need to take account of the fact that, through the market dominance of a few chain stores, many voluntary private logos are interpreted as quasi standards. This robs producers and processors of their entrepreneurial freedom and also narrows the choice for consumers. There is a similar situation with regard to the mandatory indication of the place of origin for agricultural products, such as milk. Implementing this requirement in agriculture and in the processing industry would scarcely be possible from a technical point of view. We need to be careful that good intentions do not descend into excessive bureaucracy. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is only one step on the long road to the reform of the common fisheries policy. I would like to thank the rapporteur for the report and our coordinator for doing such an efficient job. I am in favour of fundamental reform of the common fisheries policy. However, if we lack the courage to do this, it is important to me that we retain the principle of relative stability. Furthermore, I would like to mention specifically the major problem represented by the greedy cormorants and the management plan that Parliament has already called for. The fishing industry is of fundamental economic and cultural importance to our coastal regions. Therefore, achieving a balance between the economy and the environment is of great significance for me in the context of the forthcoming reform of the common fisheries policy.

According to the resolution of the European Parliament on the draft general budget for the financial year 2010, adopted on 17 December 2009, a vote was taken today on the amending budget for the European Parliament, following the revised calculations made by the Parliamentary administration. The FDP in the European Parliament abstained, because there was a paragraph in the package of amendments concerned that we could not reconcile with our convictions. The FDP had already expressed its opposition to an increase in the secretarial allowance to EUR 1 500 during the discussions in committee. It is out of the secretarial allowance that MEPs’ assistants are paid. The FDP considers that the argument that more money is needed due to the additional work that MEPs have to do with the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is unsound, as there is nothing in past experience to support this. Certainly, due to the Treaty of Lisbon, which has just come into force, Parliament will overall need extra capacity for legislative work, but with the introduction of the Assistants’ Statute from the beginning of the current parliamentary term, there is still no proof that MEPs actually need more assistants. For this reason, there are grounds for concern that further demands and supplementary increases, or an extension of office capacity, will follow. For this reason, the FDP in the European Parliament abstained. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

The German members of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe voted differently from the group as a whole on two points. The first concerns Amendment 3 from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. The FDP members voted against, because a radical devolution of fisheries policy such as proposed in the motion with the transfer of powers and responsibility to Member States and to local decision makers cannot be reconciled with the European common fisheries policy. The idea here is precisely to find common forward-looking solutions at an EU level. FDP members supported Amendment 33 because it supports the important principle of relative stability, which is important for Germans. This concerns the basis for quota allocation.

 The German Free Democratic Party members of the European Parliament have abstained from voting on the Copenhagen resolution for the following reasons. The resolution contains statements about financing for climate protection measures in third countries without defining the specific criteria or purpose of the financing. We cannot justify this to taxpayers. In addition, we believe that blanket criticism of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) is wrong. The ICAO is the organisation which deals with aviation matters at an international level. Both the criticism and the statement about the alleged failure of ICAO negotiations are incorrect and inappropriate. The call for specific arrangements for a CO2
 trading system for the aviation industry goes against current EU legislation and overburdens the EU’s negotiating position in an international climate agreement with unrealistic demands. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a farmer, I see the tabled amendment of Articles 78 and 79 as a deviation by the Commission from its hitherto sound route through agricultural reform at the expense of efficient and forward-looking farms. It is dangerous to tamper, simply because of a desire to do something, so close to the final phasing out of the milk quota system, a system that has really been to the disadvantage of dairy farmers hitherto. It has also been left behind by developments on the ground, as the market is currently finally beginning to recover. I therefore reject this amendment. It is easy to see how the Commission is seeking to exploit Parliament’s call for urgent measures for its own ends. It is doing this by attempting, shortly before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, to ensure for itself permanent scope to act without Parliament’s consent through this amendment of Article 186. I therefore reject this amendment. However, I could live with Parliament granting the Commission scope to act for a limited period in cases of crisis. This ability would also be available to Parliament in future times of crisis, with very rapid effect, through Rule 142 of its Rules of Procedure. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the world economic crisis has thrown the global market off balance. As milk producers we are suffering the effects of prices having hit an all-time low. We are hearing over and over again that the adopted milk quota regulations should be amended. As a dairy farmer myself, I can only warn you against doing this. The Commission’s intervention measures have also succeeded in preventing milk prices from falling even further and the market seems to be relaxing. However, I do not think that this intervention is really a good means of achieving this, because it will result in stocks piling up which could burden a recovering market later on. I therefore call on the Commission to explain how it is going to deal with this problem. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we all know, most people are frightened of sharks. However, sharks have populated the world’s oceans for centuries, and I believe that we should not try to imagine a world without them. In my view, we have spoken for every person in Europe by voting by such a large majority to prohibit shark finning today. Shark fin soup is a particular delicacy, and shark finning was therefore a common practice in the past as well. After finning, the sharks are dumped back in the sea. This is not only barbaric; it is also a massive waste of resources. The fins are the most valuable part of the shark because they are the ingredients for soup, which is a lucrative business, but this practice cannot be allowed to continue. With this large majority, we have sent a very clear message today that this practice cannot continue. In fact, a ban has been in place in Europe since 2003, but there were a great many exemptions. We can remove these exemptions if we specify that the sharks must be landed with their fins naturally attached to the body. That is the only way to put a stop to this barbaric practice.

Mr President, we have some very interesting reports on fisheries reform before the House today. I would like to comment on three of them. Firstly, as we all know, fishing is one of the oldest crafts practised by humankind. Even now, many forms of fishing are practised by small-scale and medium-sized operations and artisanal fishermen. We put SMEs at the heart of our policies in Europe and I think it is right that this report also focuses very strongly on their needs. That is my first comment. Secondly, with regard to the external dimension of the Common Fisheries Policy, fish is already an important source of protein in many countries; this applies particularly to developing countries and their populations. With a growing world population, it is important in future to ensure, to an even greater extent than before, that people who rely on local fish as a source of protein can actually catch fish off their own coasts and that only the surplus is available to European fishermen, for example, under fisheries agreements.  My final comment relates to shark finning. It is unacceptable, it is barbaric, and it should be banned. I think there is general agreement on that. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mr Torvalds has said that the common fisheries policy (CFP) as it currently stands is one of the EU’s greatest failures to date. I think he is right. He has also said that it is an economic, social and environmental catastrophe for our fisheries. The fishing industry is not just a means of producing or catching food. It is the oldest trade in the world and, of course, we want to preserve it for the future. Therefore, I would like to thank all the rapporteurs. I believe that we have taken an important step forwards today and I know how committed Ms Damanaki is in this area. For example, we need aquaculture as a response to overfishing. I am very interested in an integrated maritime policy which is all about maritime environmental planning. There are some interesting concepts in this area involving, for example, integrating aquaculture into offshore wind farms. This may be something for the future, but we must ensure that we can expand this sector in the most effective way possible. Finally, I would like to tell you about a small success story from Germany. The North Sea and Baltic fisheries policy has resulted in stocks of cod, herring and plaice gradually recovering. I hope that in future, all the fish stocks in Europe will also recover.

 Since a postponement of the vote on the ACTA in order to be able to evaluate and take into account the pending ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union was not possible, I abstained from voting. With regard to tackling product piracy and strengthening copyright, ACTA is something that I could support. Nevertheless, the fears and concerns of a section of the population, which feels its freedoms will be restricted by ACTA, must be taken into account.

 Mr President, it has already been pointed out that we do not have a single European railway area, although many people assume that we do. In fact, all our citizens probably assume that we do. We have a lack of tracks in some areas, we have different gauges, we have different technologies and we also do not have fair competition. There are some countries where it is very difficult for other competitors to enter the railway market. That is something that we must do something about. I would like to offer special thanks to Commissioner Kallas. He has grabbed the bull by the horns and set something in motion that has actually been due for 9 years, as we have noticed that the Member States are not implementing what we decided. I would like to thank Ms Serracchiani, who has really done us all a great service here. We now actually have a process in which we emphasise a strong regulator. We have always said that that is the most important thing. The second most important thing is the separation of networks and operators, which is something that we have to discuss and on which we await the Commission proposal before we can see how far it corresponds with the reality on the ground. It is very important that we should have within the package what has become known as ‘mini-unbundling’, in other words, more transparency with regard to funding streams. Mr Ertug just addressed this issue, which I believe is very important. We must do everything we can to obtain a truly complete single European railway area. Gesine Meissner,

 Mr President, with the digital tachograph, the truth is that we actually agreed on many points during the negotiations. I, too, would like to offer my sincere thanks to Ms Ţicău, who was very committed in her negotiations with us shadow rapporteurs. We also really are in agreement about major points – the fact that this is about adapting practically everything, the fact that a technological innovation facilitates an improvement in control checks, which also need to be tightened up, as well as greater requirements for transparency in relation to what can now be installed, what we can check. I am thus in agreement with much of what has been put forward. There is just one area with which I do not agree, and I would like to concentrate on that area now. I will start off in something of a general way. In the Europe 2020 strategy, we constantly stress the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises. There are many of these companies, and they create the jobs and the training places. In 2009, a proposal for cutting red tape specifically for these small and medium-sized enterprises was awarded a prize here. Under the proposal, there were to be options for derogations in respect of tachographs for the Member States, whereby a tradesperson who, for example, drives a 3.5-tonne vehicle himself/herself, requires no tachograph if he or she is located only 50 kilometres from his/her place of work. That should now be extended to 150 kilometres. This proposal was awarded a prize. There was actually a great deal of agreement here – albeit not with everyone – that it was a good thing to move in this direction, that this really would mean a cut in red tape. Now, though, the Commission has only proposed 100 kilometres, unfortunately. In committee, we initially amended that to 150 kilometres with a narrow majority. We had a majority for 150 kilometres, for exactly that proposal. That now hangs in the balance. We have now provided on a general basis that the rules should only apply once over the 100 kilometres line – and rightly so – but, at the same time, the weight limit is to be reduced to 2.8 tonnes. The current situation in Germany is that, while the regulations do specify 2.8-tonne vehicles, there are so many derogations provided that the likes of small-scale painters and electricians are not subject to the regulations at all. That would change under these proposals. Because of that, I believe that we must vote against Amendment 134 and in favour of Amendment 129, which I proposed. In that way, we will be moving in the direction of cutting red tape and really doing something for small and medium-sized enterprises. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr Grosch, we agree on a great many issues. You just said that we need common applicability. I absolutely do not agree with that. You also said, however, that it should apply to professional drivers and not to the other groups. It seems to me that that is already not the case at present. Let us take the example of a master roofer, as a non-professional driver, who drives his materials himself and has a 2.8-tonne vehicle. That is a light goods vehicle, and many people have those, and let us then imagine that he drives over 100 kilometres once every three years, namely 103 kilometres one way, and so actually has to fit a digital tachograph. Does that sound proportionate to you? Do you, moreover, believe that safety would be jeopardised if that were not the case? Gesine Meissner,

The fact is that the people there are caught in a spiralling trap: they are facing drought, preventing them from keeping animals, they are coping with waves of refugees, terrorist attacks and unstable governments – in other words they are encountering a security problem of unimaginable magnitude. A number of EU citizens have been affected, falling victim to attack. This is not our sole concern, however, as we are particularly concerned with the plight of the people living in such enormous difficulties. We need to take action, particularly to protect women and girls, who are the victims of violence, and who are also denied education. This is truly a Herculean task for all policy areas in the EU, affecting development policy and security policy equally, as organised crime seems to be the most lucrative business in this area, as well as many other external policies. We need progress, which is why we have gathered today for this debate. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 I can offer a short answer to this. This is something we should really consider, because I believe that when we talk about human rights violations here we sometimes feel quite helpless; because many policies are moving in this direction and are proving inadequate, the question is: what additional steps can be taken? I think we should now take up this idea and discuss it between the groups. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr President, I believe that Ms Wikström has achieved a great deal in her report. It is obviously important to set up a central body which can find a solution in these cases and identify the correct location in the case of legal issues concerning the country responsible for resolving media conflicts of this kind. I believe that Ms Wikström has done a very good job. It is a pity that so few people have chosen to speak on this subject. Of course, there is a great deal of agreement in this area and so perhaps it is not necessary. This really is an important step forward that we are taking in Parliament and I am pleased about that. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, Commissioner Malmström, I very much respect your efforts to improve the agreement. Nonetheless, I believe that the agreement in its current form is not good enough. I could, in essence, continue from where the previous speaker left off. Of course when someone comes into your home, you will want to know who they are and what they want. However, you do not necessarily want to store data about them for long periods, also allowing others to access this information. Commissioner, you have stated, for example, that the data will be depersonalised after six months. That is correct. However, as you said yourself, this only occurs after six months. We need to take numerous concerns into account. It has also been stated that this data is gathered anyway. I do not see this as a reason to sign up to this agreement. There have been no complaints to date, according to Mr Voss. Likewise, I do not see this as a reason to sign up this agreement either. There is no need to rush. Negotiations with the US are not always a meeting of equals. I am aware of this from the EU-US air transport agreement. We agreed to this, despite its inequities, because it offered us economic benefits. In this case, however, I agree entirely with Ms Weber: it is better to have no law at all than a bad one. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr President, chocolate and cocoa are something to be enjoyed not just by children, but also by adults. It is true that we are now in Strasbourg, but we are often in Brussels, where many people like to buy Belgian chocolate and to give it as a gift. Most of them do not think about where the cocoa comes from, under what conditions it is cultivated, and how the chocolate is manufactured. This debate has already made it clear that we must understand that the cocoa which we import has, in many cases, been produced using child labour. As Ms Köstinger has said, this is not just about finding out whether the children are there with or without their families and whether or not forced labour is involved. We must also be aware that the conditions under which these children work are damaging to their health. Cocoa is produced under conditions which are extremely harmful to health, including that of children. We need to stop this from happening. We must do everything we can to buy cocoa fairly from countries like Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire which are attempting to bring about better living conditions for their people. This has already been said on several occasions and, therefore, I think that introducing a quality mark would be the right approach to take. I am pleased that there is widespread agreement in Parliament on this subject. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
).

 Madam President, Ms Bauer said earlier that nothing has changed. We do talk about equality every year, that much is true. Many things are changing a little bit, though. I get the impression that there are more men in the Chamber for the debate this year than last time, and that is a very positive thing, in my opinion. I would like to offer my sincere thanks to Mr Gustafsson, the chair of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, who fights in a very committed fashion for women’s rights, and also to my Liberal colleague Mr Schmidt, who will be speaking later. We are, after all, talking about fairness, and men, too, can see that things are unfair and are critical of that fact, which I think is excellent. There is another thing that is different this year. Last week there was the Gender Pay Gap conference in Brussels, and one of the speakers there began her address in a very unusual way. She said that men are less well qualified, yet they receive more money and pay more tax. Women are better qualified, they have university degrees, yet they receive less money and they pass less tax. She went on to question whether maybe it was perhaps the wrong approach to subsidise places in higher education for women if they then go on to pay less tax. She meant this as a joke, of course. What she meant was the exact opposite, and that is also the way that it has to be seen. When 60% of qualified graduates are women, can we afford for so few women to have the opportunity to develop into good jobs? Can we afford that? The truth is that this is crazy. After all, what we are doing is throwing away economic opportunities galore. It has already been said that, with one third female membership of executive boards, the working atmosphere and the success of companies are demonstrably improved. That is the case for businesses, but of course it could also be the case for politics. I therefore wholeheartedly thank the rapporteur, as well as Ms Reding and all those who champion this cause. We need more fairness in this area. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

Madam President, last year, when I drew up the report on integrated maritime policy, the accident in the Gulf of Mexico had just happened. At that time, we were already considering what we could do in order to be able to intervene better in such cases and how we could also implement some form of preventive measures. At the time, we came up with the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA). I would therefore also like to offer my sincere thanks to Mr Fleckenstein for his excellent work. It really is important for us to look at what institutions we have and to consider how we can involve them further and in different ways. The sea is, in general, being used more, and, in future, it will be used significantly more still, because it also contains raw materials. It is important not only for shipping, but also for energy production. In this regard, however, it is important to consider how we can protect the sea. If we have an institution that is perfectly capable of doing this with additional powers, then we ought to instruct it to do so. It will obviously need funds for this, but that is why it was right for us to say to the Commission during the budget debate when it wanted to cut back on the funding for the agencies that that was not on. We already knew, with regard to EMSA in particular, that we would be giving it an additional task. This is therefore an excellent report. We ought to give Mr Fleckenstein the negotiating mandate soon. Gesine Meissner,

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Grosch, the work that has been done here is truly excellent. There were 413 amendments, and we genuinely all supported the majority of the 32 compromises. It shows that we all know that it is important to take as united an approach as possible with regard to the subject of transport. Of course, we have different ideas in the various groups about the details of individual matters, but by and large, we all said that transport is important. It really is the backbone of the internal market. It is a foundation of European policy that we say that we want free movement of people, goods and services. For this, we clearly need to make various improvements, which we will continue to do in subsequent reports. We can truly say that it has just become clear – and it is also clear in this report – that we need all modes of transport. Naturally, we want transport to be more efficient, more environmentally friendly and safer. That is something that we all need to take into consideration. However, in order to be able to continue to take the internal market forward, we really need all modes of transport, even if one area might produce higher emissions than another. That has become very clear in this case. There are essentially very few points on which we do not agree. One of them concerns road trains. This is currently very elegantly worded. I know that not all parties will agree, but in this regard, it is the case that we need a European modular system. In other words, we wanted an option to have a larger volume or perhaps also a bit more length and a bit more weight in the lorries. Not everyone thinks that is a good idea. However, in some areas of Europe, that has already been put into practice – and successfully. This system cannot be used everywhere. On behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I would like to refer to an amendment that we tabled after the vote. I think it is more correct, and should also meet with much approval, to say that it is not a question of us asking the Commission to submit something relating to the railway package describing the relationship between the network and operators, but rather that it should actually be about the separation of the network and operators, which we also addressed in the recast of the railway package. That is a correction, so I would imagine that everyone would be able to go along with it. Thank you once again. I look forward to tomorrow’s vote. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
).

 Madam President, Commissioner, I am pleased that we have been able to meet up again. I stood here one year ago in my capacity as rapporteur on the further development of an integrated maritime policy. We have now reached a position where we can actually anchor a fixed maritime policy in European policy making and where we will have the appropriate financial framework. This is the major advantage gained from Mr Koumoutsakos’s follow-up report. For me, integrated maritime policy is not just what you might call a truly major concern, but also an enormously important future task for the European Union. It has already been pointed out that more of the earth is covered by water than land: the ratio is about 30% land to 70% water. There is a great deal of added value to be gained from water. This includes marine transport – 95% of all transport involves the sea – as well as, of course, fishing, research or offshore energy sources. We have a very broad range of options open to us when it comes to using the sea as a resource. We have just one earth and one mass of water, which is why we need to husband it as prudently as possible. This is a major challenge that we face. In practical terms, 40% of the EU’s gross domestic product comes from the IMP, the integrated maritime policy. As I have already said, our major success this time round is that the IMP now has a fixed basis. Although we have not achieved the hoped for EUR 50 million, a figure I believed to be a certainty last year, we have received EUR 40 million, most of which will be spent on cross-border projects. After all, it is important that cooperation should be practised that embraces various countries. Naturally I must express my sincere thanks to Mr Koumoutsakos. We made a good team when negotiating in the trialogue, which has now closed. We achieved an awful lot because we stuck together so well. Thank you again. I wish us both well with the integrated maritime policy. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, we have just been discussing the integrated maritime policy and, of course, fishing also plays a role there. Since I have been dealing with this topic for some time, I am aware that fishing is usually the last policy to be decided. Fishermen naturally play an important role in our food supply, however. It is also important for small and medium-sized enterprises that they should be able to work in a secure area and that illegal fishing should be prevented as it makes their work and their position in the marketplace more difficult. What we have heard is quite true: this issue does not just affect cooperation with developing countries. It goes without saying that this is significant because these countries also import fish. It is also important for us, however, because we need to prevent illegal fishing. For this reason, I should like to pick up on one of the points Mr Milana and Ms Lövin raised. I know that not everyone equally favours the European coastguard service. However, I do believe that we need better cooperation on this front in Europe at least. This was already called for in a Parliamentary report on integrated maritime policy dating from 2008. I have brought this up repeatedly and the Commission also needs to table a proposal in this area. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Madam President, Mr Kallas, I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Serracchiani. This was a tough task for her, as this really is a difficult portfolio. As has already been mentioned, the first railway package was established 10 years ago, when all Member States agreed on how the railway market in Europe could be opened up. The crazy thing is that a review carried out in 2009 indicated that only four states had actually met the provisions contained in the package. Two countries do not count as they do not have a rail network. The remainder have failed to stick to their own resolutions. This is why we need to take action once again. It is evident that we need a comprehensive railway sector in Europe, both in the interests of the internal market and in the interests of our citizens. What we find is not just gaps in the rail lines and incompatible systems, but also legal and organisational hurdles. It is these hurdles that we have tried to eliminate here. The good news is that we now have a strong regulator at European and national level. This regulator must be independent and must also be able to take action quickly. A lot of people have said this. We have also noticed that although the separation of networks and operators may be the right solution, a lot of comparisons are required in order to establish the nature of this separation and to ensure that we have a consistent system throughout Europe. This is something that will need urgent attention next year. There is one thing that we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe disagree with – Mr Tremosa has already pointed it out and we have also asked for a separate vote on this issue – and that is Article 6(4). Mr Kuhn has already indicated that he wants transparency in relation to the financial flow. We do not want to see public monies being invested in areas other than infrastructure. This is not assured by the current wording, however. This is why we really do need to vote against the last section, as otherwise we shall have no transparency. This is not in the interest of progress in the rail market. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, as has already been stated here, China is a super power and for that reason is very important for the Member States of the European Union. I know that, when it comes to human rights violations in China, some people would say we should leave the Chinese in peace. They have a different culture and do not share our value system, hence we should not seek to impose our values on them. When, however, we find that people are voluntarily setting themselves on fire, when young people of 18 and 19 years of age who simply want to live according to their faith have no other choice than to take their own lives, then it is no longer possible to remain silent. The fact is that the representatives of the Dalai Lama are constantly calling on our support, placing their hope in the European Parliament, even though they know that even if we debate the issue here, nothing will happen and nothing will change for a long time. All we can do is repeatedly point out the injustices happening there and call on anyone who has contact with China to keep putting this issue on the agenda. After all, I believe one thing is quite clear: if everyone brings up this issue again and again, then China will be unable to ignore it and something must eventually happen. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, if Ms Rafah Nached is sentenced, then this really will be a sign of the despotism and brutality of the Syrian state, as well as its helplessness and paranoia, as a previous speaker has already said. After all, what does a state have to fear from a woman who is old and infirm and who is only doing her job by helping traumatised people? What is so dangerous about this? She has been accused of having a destabilising effect on the state. In this case, however, the government, the dictatorship, is completely at a loss and, in a completely misguided move, is attempting to make an example of her. As my colleague Mr Preda has already pointed out, we now find ourselves in the realms of the surreal. We all welcomed the Arab Spring and the democratisation of the region. Of course we Europeans are pleased to see such developments and are trying to support this movement, including though a variety of contacts. However, we must also protest when individuals are imprisoned without grounds. This is truly a violation of human rights, and we must not accept it. Gesine Meissner,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

Madam President, I am much obliged to the Commissioner for his presentation. Commissioner, you said that in this case, this proposal largely meets all Parliament’s demands. In my opinion, that is not the case, and also in my opinion, it is not the case either that all the privacy rights of passengers have been safeguarded. That is why we have just tabled an oral question on this. In fact, as Mr de Grandes Pascual stated, we had a report in which we discussed and set out what form scanners should take where these are permitted to be deployed as an additional security measure at airports. In this report, we also said that people must have a free choice as to whether or not they go through them. Health and human dignity must be protected; data and privacy must also be safeguarded. In fact, what has now been proposed is exactly what we did not want. We did not want to have scanners that show real images – whether or not these are blurred. I am familiar with these images; I have been to the US and have seen such scanners. I do not want something like that placed in Europe’s airports. These scanners do, in fact, allow quite a lot of a person’s body to be seen. To me it makes no difference whether or not the person looking at them is in another room and does not see the people in real life. It is a violation of privacy and intimacy, and we expressly discussed the fact that that is exactly what we do not want. Despite this, the Commission’s proposal now states that something along these lines is to be permitted in order to implement our decision. Naturally, we are upset about it. That is why we are asking you to reconsider. There is the option of having simple stick figures, as they are known – in other words, schematic illustrations; either a green OK or a stick figure with red dots – showing, for example, that an arm should be investigated because something suspicious is indicated there. That really is something that we would like, without images being stored. That would protect people’s privacy as well as protecting data. We are astonished, and we are not happy that something different is now being proposed. If the installation of something that is actually quite different is being considered, then we need a legislative process. We are talking about the citizens of Europe and that is why the representatives of these citizens need to be involved in a proper procedure. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, the honourable Member has said that he also wishes to protect privacy, but that he wants to avoid monopolies. Does he really believe – knowing the way the European market works – that if we want to have something on the market, such as a particular type of scanner, it will remain the case that only one company makes them? Does he not think that more companies would then start producing them simply in order to be able to compete for this market? Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
),

 The German Free Democratic Party delegation abstained from the final vote on the own-initiative report on European road safety 2011-2020. This non-legislative text contains a large number of recommendations for increasing safety on Europe’s roads. Naturally, we support this goal, as we also want to reduce the number of fatalities and injuries on the roads. Some measures are quite over the top, however; for example, the call for a general 30 km/h speed limit in built-up areas, the mandatory carrying of warning jackets for all vehicle occupants, or the use of rear-facing child seats for children under three years of age. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr President, I would like to respond directly to Ms Stassen, who is the only one so far to say that we do not actually need tourism in Europe. I believe that we do indeed need it, and, moreover, it will not undermine the competitiveness and autonomy of the individual Member States. It is indeed the case that Europe is currently the number one tourist destination in the world, and, naturally enough, we would like it to stay that way. We want it to stay that way with all the diversity that we have. The diversity that we have in Europe can be seen from the previous speeches. These alone have made it worthwhile to be part of this debate, because if anyone thinks that 10 days is sufficient in which to see Europe – thus, the Acropolis, the Tower of London, the Eiffel Tower and perhaps Neuschwanstein in Germany – he or she is mistaken. Europe offers much more and it has developed a great deal more in terms of tourism. I would now like to mention something in particular that we have in north Germany, where I come from. We have cycling tourism, we also have nature-oriented tourism, not only holidays on the farm, which certainly also awakens a real understanding of nature, but, for example, also tourism in very sensitive areas such as the Wadden Sea beside the North Sea. That is a globally unique area. There you can really see how, right next to main shipping routes, a very sensitive form of tourism can be developed that also awakens an understanding of the diversity of nature. This is something that we need more of. Something that has not had any, or very little, mention is the fact that we also have old mines and old industrial heritage sites, for example, that you can view and where you can learn a great deal about the history of Europe and the working environment. Thus, there is a very broad spectrum, and in that regard we ought to consider how we can bring this to the outside world and how we can maintain Europe as a very attractive tourist destination in future, too. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the White Paper, Commissioner Kallas sets out various possibilities for the future of transport. For instance, he describes how there is a need for incentive systems in order to give transport a more environmentally friendly form, and he also states that new sources of funding are needed, including, for example, in order to be able to work according to the ‘polluter pays’ principle. The Eurovignette Directive that we are debating today is one way that both of these points really can be achieved. This was a major Belgian effort, I believe we can say, begun under the Belgian Presidency of the Council with three important Belgians involved and, above all, because of the rapporteur, who succeeded in opening a door to the new routes. As it happens, I would have wished Belgium’s major effort greater success than what we now have. What we actually managed to achieve is a small and weak compromise. Although we do now have earmarking to a very limited extent – 15% of infrastructure costs and 15% of external costs must go to the TEN-T networks – it is really far too little. All national transport policy representatives say that we need considerable resources in order to be able to sustain our infrastructure networks. It is self-evident that the resources collected in this area should also be able to be invested there. That is a point on which we can all fail to be satisfied. The fact is that, in this connection, we have nonetheless taken a step in a direction in which we will be able to move further at a later date. That is also the reason why we intend to vote in favour of this compromise. It was a tough struggle, though. It very definitely could have been the case that we ended up with nothing at all on the table, since a few Member States would have preferred to have nothing at all. This is therefore a success, and it will have our backing in the vote today. (Applause) Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr President, I would first like to agree with Mr Verhofstadt. It is indeed shameful that these human rights debates, which are actually very important to us Europeans who believe in values, always take place on Thursday afternoons when most people have already left. I would like that noted in the record once more. It is something that we must change. Right now, however, we are talking about China and there we are more or less powerless, as has already been said. Mrs Lichtenberger spoke of a brick wall. Mr Posselt, I do not believe by the way that it is really in the Chinese interest – as you said – to help bring about a breakthrough in human rights. It is apparently not in the interest of the Chinese Government, although it is undoubtedly in the interest of the Chinese people. We are talking today about many people: Ai Weiwei and Liu Xiaobo have already been mentioned. We have frequently debated in the past how we can bring about a human rights breakthrough. It is not just a matter of instructing Baroness Ashton to speak out against the human rights abuses in China at every opportunity. All our foreign ministers and representatives must do so, and we need to stick together. I think that is the only way that we can actually have a small influence on China. Otherwise, as a strong economic power, China will play us off against each other and we will achieve nothing whatsoever. That would be a very bad thing, especially for the people concerned. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr President, I would first of all like to offer my sincere thanks to Mr Simpson. In the Committee on Transport and Tourism, we know that, if our Chair prepares a report, we will not actually have anything to say against it. He always takes a great number of things into account, and the only thing we can say is: excellent Brian, we can support that. In this case, it has been variously said that it is a technical report. That sounds so boring. I do not find it at all boring. Although it is technical, it describes tourism, which really is a very important economic objective for us in Europe. It has already been mentioned that 40% of people worldwide travel to Europe. Thus, Europe is an important region for tourism, and therefore it is, of course, vital to know why these people travel to Europe. If, with our new competence under the Treaty of Lisbon, we now want to develop a new European framework, we must be familiar with the data and also be able to exchange this data in a harmonised way. That is the purpose of this report, and it also shows the new developments, for example, in terms of same-day visits or bicycle tourism. We also want to include our industrial heritage. All of this must be included in future so that we will really know how to set our objectives. Therefore, thank you very much – it is a good report and I believe we are able to support it. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr President, it has been very clear in the debate that violence against women is not a trivial offence; it is quite clearly a violation of human rights. It has already been said that even children are sometimes indirect victims of violence against women. They can even be direct victims of violence against women, because the main cause of still births and miscarriages is certainly the effects of violence against women. It is not only a question of domestic violence; there is also forced prostitution, honour killings – where there can actually be no question of honour – human trafficking, genital mutilation and much more besides. The trigger for this report, for which I am very grateful to Mrs Svensson, was, in this case, not only the fact that it was noticed in the context of the report on equality that equality is also put at serious risk as a result of violence against women, but also the fact that, through the Treaty of Lisbon, we now have the opportunity to enact a directive and to establish a common legal framework in Europe. That is urgently needed for us to make significant progress here, because this is a cross-border European problem that we must combat. Gesine Meissner,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group

Madam President, firstly I too would like to thank the rapporteur. We have already discussed the fact that, following the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament now has the opportunity to vote in favour of air service agreements of this kind or to reject them. We cannot change the contents, but we can accept or oppose them. This does not always make things simple, but it is at least a new task, which we are taking very seriously. It makes sense to replace a number of different bilateral agreements with one standardised EU agreement. It is clear that there are no boundaries in airspace, which is a good way of explaining this. The European Union is also a strong economic community and so it is sensible to discuss agreements made by the EU with different third countries, which is what we are doing now. We have a number of very different agreements on the table today. I will start with Vietnam. This is the least complex agreement. It concerns different accesses and services and also safety regulations, but it is a relatively short agreement, which is why I am only mentioning it briefly. The most comprehensive agreement is the one with Canada. In this agreement it was not just a case of ensuring free access to air services which can be used in different ways, but also of covering issues such as the environment, safety and also market access and ownership. In that respect we have long since passed the first stage of 25% and already reached the second stage of 49% ownership of each other’s air services market. Now we are about to enter stages 3 and 4. In stage 3 it is possible to establish airlines in another country and another region. Stage 4 would allow a European airline to fly from A to B within Canada. We have not come nearly as far as this with the USA, despite the fact that we have been negotiating with the USA for a long time. I would like to make one more point. Mr Kallas said that we were all very much in support of this issue, but in the case of the USA our reaction is more restrained, because the agreement does not represent a true partnership. The USA wants to take more from us than it is prepared to give. We need to continue negotiating on this. Apart from this issue, we will vote in favour, because it is clear that progress has been made. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 In today’s vote on the text of the directive on consumer rights, some members of the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament abstained. The compromise adopted undoubtedly contains many improvements on the original draft from the European Commission. For example, we have succeeded in ensuring that small businesses are not affected by most of the new rules or burdened with additional bureaucracy. However, the text adopted today also contains rules that would heavily burden companies without increasing consumer protection. Article 5, for example, will mean that a company will have to provide very extensive pre-contractual information even when goods are purchased in store. This will hardly benefit consumers, as they can assess the product directly in the shop. Article 22a places companies under obligation, in the case of distance contracts, to supply their goods to customers in any Member State. Such an obligation contradicts the freedom of contract and exposes small and medium-sized enterprises in particular to considerable legal and financial risks. Furthermore, the FDP was unable to succeed in its core demand for the complete deletion of Chapters IV and V of the directive. The FDP calls for these provisions to be amended during the trilogue negotiations with the Council and Commission. Gesine Meissner,

 Mr President, we have just spoken about natural disasters in the previous agenda item. In this case, it was a force of nature that brought air traffic to a complete standstill. Eyjafjallajökull – everyone probably knows of this volcano now – erupted last year and brought a large proportion of air traffic to a complete standstill. Incidentally, I just noticed once again during the previous speech that we have an excellent chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, because what he said is very similar to what I wanted to say. I will now try to change my speech somewhat. It was indeed chaos – Mr Simpson has already said that. As Europeans, with high-tech capabilities and with so much already coordinated, we were, in fact, helpless when it came to dealing with this disaster and finding solutions to it. We realised that there were too few agreements in place. We then set up a task force. The questions that concerned us with regard to this issue were whether the task force actually has any valid results already that could be discussed and has it published any studies? I do not know of any at least. Have all of the international experts on such volcanic eruptions actually been consulted? After all, as we already discussed here in plenary last year, there are other parts of the world where volcanic eruptions are much more frequent than in Europe and they somehow manage to have up-to-date data and to coordinate the whole situation. There is also something else that causes me concern. On 4 May, it was also mentioned in the Council of transport ministers that we need a linked-up European transport system. That can, of course, help in such cases. How far have we come in terms of being able to respond better in the event of a further volcanic eruption? We cannot predict this, of course. It will just happen. I have one further question: do we know exactly what technology we would need to be able to deal with this situation better? In Germany, we now have appropriate devices at all weather stations that collect the data and are able to pass on this up-to-date data very quickly to the people responsible at the airlines and also to pilots so that they can decide whether or not it is safe to fly. One further point which has not been mentioned yet but which I think is important in this context is the following: this ash crisis, and the subsequent problems it posed for the air transport industry, affected 10 million passengers and, of course, also many companies. Some passengers were stranded and were unable to continue their journeys. The question therefore arises as to how things stand with regard to passengers’ rights. We have rights for air passengers, but I have the impression that, in this case, they have not always been fully utilised. Perhaps we should also revise these passenger rights once more. There are a lot of questions here. Mr Hahn, I do not know whether you will be able to answer them now, as transport is not actually your area. Otherwise, I am sure that the questions I raised in addition to the written question can be answered later. You will notice that this subject is of great concern to us. After all, the air transport industry is very important, and we therefore need a Single European Sky. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 In the vote on the Lange report, I am abstaining on paragraph 31 because of the ambiguous wording of the vote, which refers to Eurobonds as well as project bonds. However, taking it as a whole, I am voting for the report, as I have nothing against project bonds in themselves. Project bonds serve as finance for extensive innovation, infrastructure and reindustrialisation projects. This is not a question of instruments for the communitarisation of debts, as would be the case with Eurobonds. Gesine Meissner,

 Mr President, a long procedure has now come to an end, which is good news. There are some positive aspects to all of this. One is that the basic rights for people with disabilities include the right to information and the right to access. Another positive feature is that the damages paid by small and medium-sized businesses have been kept to a reasonable level, which was not originally the case. It is also good that we have reached an agreement, because otherwise, we would have been stuck in the conciliation procedure and there would have been no regulations at all covering one specific area of transport. However, I would also like to pick up on some negative points, as we have not been able to produce a genuine European solution. Although we say that the free movement of people, goods and services is a European principle, we have not reached a European solution in this area, if three countries are not included and other countries do not have bus routes of this length. The right of people with disabilities to be accompanied, which is something they often need in order to be able to travel, is only guaranteed over long distances. In addition, the clause on major natural disasters, which does not apply to air travel, because damages had to be paid in the case of the ash cloud, has been applied to buses and coaches. This means that poorer passengers in particular who are making short journeys will not be compensated and have no rights. That, of course, is not a good thing. Therefore, because of this mix of positive and negative features, we abstained from voting during the midnight session in the conciliation procedure and we will do the same today. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

Madam President, I would like to explain why the majority of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has abstained from voting on this directive. It is good that we have made a decision and that the rights of people with disabilities are being respected. However, that is only the case over longer distances. Many of the other points are not worthy of a European directive. For example, because the directive only covers journeys over 250 kilometres, there are many countries where it does not apply. Cyprus, Malta and Luxembourg have no rights, in just the same way as some other Member States which do not have bus routes that are longer than 250 kilometres. The free movement of people, goods and services is one of Europe’s central principles. Now it is the poorer passengers who are not protected, because some Member States have no system of passengers’ rights. This is why we have abstained. There are some positive aspects, but also many negative aspects, and this is the reason for our abstention. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
),

 This regulation is a step in the right direction as it creates an EU set of rights for bus passengers. However, except for some basic rights, it applies to regular services equal to, or longer than, 250 km. Such a limited scope can hardly be a basis for truly European legislation in the interest of all bus passengers and ALDE cannot support such a deal. We also oppose the force majeure
 clause exempting carriers from the obligation to provide accommodation for passengers in case of cancellations or delays if these are caused by severe weather conditions or major natural disasters, as it can set a precedent for other EU passenger rights legislation. Even though this is not a triumph, it is an improvement, especially for travellers with disabilities and reduced mobility. We managed to ensure non-discriminatory access conditions, disability-related training for the staff of carriers and terminal authorities who deal directly with passengers and compensation for damage or loss of mobility equipment on all routes, regardless of distance. Keeping that in mind, and with a view to creating a harmonised EU set of rights for all passengers, we did not oppose the agreement and abstained in the final vote. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mrs Malmström, we definitely do not need walls to resolve the asylum problem. A proposal was made to erect a wall, which is why I have chosen to speak. Anyone who says something of this kind has completely failed to understand European values. For us, this is all about protecting fundamental rights and human rights. We cannot say about people who have fled from their country and sought asylum in Europe, for whatever reason, and about people who have voluntarily climbed into an overcrowded boat and put their lives at risk: ‘We want to send these people back before they have even arrived’. We need sensible asylum processes for these people which function properly. We cannot leave the southern European countries, where these people arrive, to cope with the problem alone. I agree completely with my colleague, Mrs Hirsch, on that point. From another perspective, it is wrong to say that we want all these people to stay outside Europe and we do not want to take them in. Demographic change is taking place in Europe and in future, we will need integration and also asylum seekers who want to stay here. This is not just an issue of humanity, but also of common sense. For this reason, we need to come up with solutions to this problem quickly. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
).

Madam President, I have now been in Parliament for a year and I have dealt with various dossiers, but none of them have been as difficult as what we have on the table here. At this point, I would like to offer my sincere thanks once again to Mrs Mathieu and Mr Cercas, the two rapporteurs from the relevant committees. This really is a very difficult matter, and the reason for this is that naturally we have very high ideals in Europe. We want to treat everyone who lives and works here fairly and equally. That, in principle, is something we can all agree on as a starting point. However, the question remains as to how much we can really implement this in detail. We have already been reminded that with the Treaty of Lisbon, we now wish to draw up a common policy on asylum and migration. Asylum policy is something close to our hearts, and not just because of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. We also need a migration policy for economic reasons, because demographic changes are taking place and we have a very urgent need not just for highly qualified workers, but also for less skilled workers. Basically, the great difficulty here is what to do. As has already been said – Mrs in ’t Veld mentioned it – the Member States stated back in 1990 in Tampere that they wanted to develop a common structure. Nothing has yet been placed on the table. In other words, what we have today is a compromise – we are not completely happy with it, but in my view, it is a way for us to move forward. Speaking personally, I can well understand why some are saying that we need more time for discussion. I am not completely happy with it either. It is particularly important to me, for example, that everyone should have access to training and further education, because this is absolutely crucial – not just for the persons concerned, so that they can work in the labour market, but also for us with our real need for workers. In the case of social security, for example, where we already have so many different systems anyway that have not even been harmonised within the EU, it raises the question of how we can really create a common set of rights for third country nationals in all cases even if we want to. It is difficult, and that is why I see the compromise that is currently on the table as a good thing. We really should vote in favour; then at least we will have something. Gesine Meissner,

 Mr President, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn, the arrival of a container full of trainers on an island somewhere, which was received enthusiastically by the residents, has in the past made headline news. In another case, a contingent of rubber ducks floated ashore. These are, of course, the pleasant examples of ships’ cargoes going missing, but the fact is that in many cases lost containers can cause serious damage. It has become clear that we must do something about this. The Dutch Government was concerned about this problem and set up an investigation to find out why it was happening. The investigation identified a number of causes. Although there are EU regulations which specify how cargoes should be secured and although all ships have the manual containing the regulations on board, only 46% of ships have their cargoes properly lashed down. This means that we do not need any new rules. You were right about that, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn. In many cases, the weight of the cargo has not been correctly balanced. Another reason is that many crews in the short sea shipping sector unlash cargoes before they have reached their destination to speed up the unloading process. Stacking errors can also be a cause of the problem, together with old or damaged equipment. All of this can, of course, have a major impact on the environment. Around 70% of items lost from ships at sea sink to the bottom, but this gives rise to the question of what damage they are causing on the sea bed. A total of 15% of the goods reach land. The remaining 15% float around in the ocean and obviously represent a major hazard for other ships, platforms and the environment. This means that when accidents happen at sea we must investigate the extent to which containers were involved. Then we need to speak to shipping companies and port operators to ensure that they comply with the regulations. In addition, regular inspections must be made. Two thousand containers really are too many and I think that carrying out feasibility studies would take too long. We must take immediate action, because the situation simply cannot go on as it is. Gesine Meissner,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn, ladies and gentlemen, I wish that the Chamber were full to bursting, not on my account or because this is my first report, but because of the subject matter, which is unfamiliar to many people, but nevertheless highly important. Hardly anyone has heard of integrated maritime policy, but it is a decisive subject for us all, because it really is true that our future lies in the sea. A total of 70% of the earth’s surface consists of water. Population levels are growing, not in Europe, but throughout the rest of the world and by 2050 they will have reached 9 billion. The earth is becoming too small and many experts have already discovered the significant potential of the oceans. Our objective must now be to keep the resources of the seas safe for future generations by means of the integrated maritime policy. So far only 10% of the oceans and their resources have been explored, but we already have 50 000 products which come from the sea. Efforts are now being made to produce energy from the sea and to extract raw materials for medicines, cosmetics and industry. While we are developing our overall maritime policy, it is important to ensure that the sea does not strike back, as it did in a sensational novel by bestselling author Frank Schätzing. We have the opportunity to turn the maritime economy into the largest area of growth in our economy as a whole. For this reason, people are talking today not only about green jobs, but also about blue jobs and blue growth. The coastline of the EU is 23 000 kilometres in length and one third of the population lives by the sea. Green shipping and offshore energy are areas where Europe has extensive expertise which can be developed further. For this reason, we need an integrated approach so that we can achieve all of these objectives with great care. Which individual areas are covered by integrated maritime policy? The first of these areas is transport. Shipping can be described as the powerhouse of European transport, because 95% of global trade and 40% of internal European trade travels by sea, via ports with hinterland connections and logistics. Further growth is being forecast and therefore we must ensure in particular that we can reduce emissions by developing greener ships. The next area is shipbuilding. We have a great deal of expertise in this field, as I have already mentioned. We must make sure that we use this expertise productively to secure existing jobs and create new ones. Of course, maritime policy also includes fisheries and aquaculture. Fish are not just a source of food. In addition, aquaculture is the area of agriculture and fisheries which is showing the highest levels of growth. It is important for us to be aware of this. In the field of energy there is a great deal happening on and around the sea. We have oil and gas pipelines, oil platforms and offshore wind farms and there are already plans to fit tankers with sails so that they can cut their energy consumption by 20% by using wind energy. Wave power is an area with future potential and microalgae, which can be used as biomass, represent an almost unlimited source of energy. In the area of research there is a focus on using blue biotechnology to develop medicines. We already have painkillers and anti-malaria drugs and work is currently underway on cancer medicines. Protecting our coasts is an important issue which is also covered by integrated maritime policy. Our coasts are threatened by storm tides and we need to protect them, not only against the tides, but also against oil, piracy and smuggling. In addition, we must deal with the problem of asylum seekers in Italy. Finally our coasts are also, of course, very popular tourist destinations and we are working on developing a sustainable tourism concept for the coastline. You can see that there are many individual areas involved here, all of which are related to water. The objective of the integrated maritime policy is to develop these areas carefully and in harmony by working together. Many people are not aware of this, but it is hugely important. The European Union has already achieved a great deal in this respect, but it needs to do even more. For this reason, I have focused in this report not so much on the individual areas, but primarily on what has happened in the last few years since the 2007 Blue Paper was published, what still needs to be developed and what has to be continued. These are the areas which I will mention again briefly in my conclusion. Gesine Meissner,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I think it is good that you have been counting, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn. I did not know how many speeches had been made, but 37 really is a lot. I would like to thank everyone who has taken part in the debate today. Right at the beginning, I also forgot to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their work. We really have worked together very constructively and I enjoyed it very much. I have covered a lot of subjects in the report, because it is very important to me to have a convincing majority in this crucial area. Many of the speeches on different subjects have highlighted the fact that we need joint action on research, planning, implementation and control of maritime activities by means of joint governance, spatial planning and monitoring. This is what the report is all about. However, it is a very varied subject. I should now like to discuss a few of the speeches. Mr Fleckenstein raised the problem of the sulphur emissions. We have included it in the report because it was important to us that there is no distortion of competition, but we also need to make sure that shipping is more environmentally friendly. However, what you said about shipbuilding, Mr Fleckenstein, is not quite true. It is not the case that the Liberals and the Conservatives did not want to include this. It was simply a question of how we should implement it, of whether we should create a new fund at a European level for refitting old ships or whether we should put in place a strategy. That is the current wording. The subject of my amendment was also raised, which I introduced in order to include emissions trading in the report. In the committee it was rejected by a very small margin, but in my opinion we are all convinced that we must continue to follow this route. For this reason, I am hoping for support in these areas. Mr Kohlíček, you said that it was difficult to link all the areas together, but I know that this is possible. A group of stakeholders and business people from all the different maritime areas meets twice a year to share ideas. These are prominent players at a European level and they all very much value the opportunity to come together. My last point concerns the reference to the fact that there are so many different regions. I have included the position of islands in the report and it is not true that this has been omitted. The only area not covered by the strategies is the North Sea. I live closest to the North Sea and, therefore, I wanted to mention that when we talk about the Black Sea, the Mediterranean and the Danube, we should not forget the North Sea. Finally I would like to express my thanks, in particular for the remark that we should take moral responsibility for the sea and for future generations. This is why I have chosen the title ‘We need a new awareness of the sea’. If we continue to work on this, we will be able to achieve a great deal. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking today about the working conditions of women, which we want to improve in Europe. I will specifically address the Thomsen report, for which I was shadow rapporteur; in other words, the subject of ‘precarious women workers’. This year is the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion. It is an established fact that poverty disproportionately affects women. Naturally, we cannot, on any account, allow this to remain the case. Poverty among women may be the result of various things. It may result from the fact that women are not paid as well as men. Naturally, that is not the only cause. Women also take more career breaks, for example, when they have children and take time off to bring them up. Women also perform the lower skilled jobs. Things are particularly serious in the case of women whose employment conditions are precarious, because in some cases, they may not even have an employment contract or may have irregular employment contracts; they may have no protection whatsoever and they may have little access to information. The situation is particularly bad for women with a background of migration. This can lead to the poverty continuing, so that they also end up poor in old age. We need to break out of this spiral, which affects women more than men. One of the ways this can be done is through education and training. Every woman – every girl – needs to get a qualification, whatever their background, and they need access to a profession which will genuinely secure them a proper living. Lifelong learning must generally be possible for women too. We also need to ensure that we have more women and girls going into the better paid professions. These are frequently the professions that are more heavily dominated by men. In other words, access to education in any event, and access to social security systems – that way, we can achieve many improvements for women. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, you have stated that human rights are core values in the European Union. Last December, we proudly signed off on the Treaty of Lisbon and the legally binding Convention on Human Rights associated with it. What you have said is absolutely correct and of vital importance: we must defend these human rights at every turn and we must also allow these principles to guide our trade activities. As you have pointed out, this is a difficult matter. However, as has already been stated, a list of camps producing laogai products already exists. I have a book here with all the relevant information. It shows which prison manufactures which products and under which trade name. Hence, it is possible to research this issue. That is why, for example, the Laogai Research Foundation, which is active both internationally and within Europe – I say this for the benefit of President Müller, who is with us here today – has written to Commissioner De Gucht to ask him to enable the UN Special Envoy to visit the camps of his choice and to examine the question of whether it is possible to halt tariff preferences for such products on a temporary basis, following the example of the US, which is somewhat more courageous on this issue than we are. I would like to know what progress has been made with the Commission’s promised investigation into this issue? (Applause) Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
).

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by addressing a matter that our shadow rapporteur, Mr Kacin, was unable to mention due to a lack of time, but which he nevertheless feels is very important. It is imperative, in this connection, not only to investigate the causes of accidents but also to protect victims and their families. My group, in particular, has spoken out very strongly in favour of information regarding the circumstances of accidents being provided quickly, at least to the relatives, and in favour of this information also being provided in the case of same-sex partnerships. In general, we have already noted that the report drawn up by the rapporteur is indeed a groundbreaking one. We cannot praise it enough. The fact of the matter is that the previous directive is 16 years old. Many technical developments have been made in the meantime and we need better aviation safety. In order to be able to investigate accidents, we need information that can be independently assessed. The United States has had an independent investigation agency of this kind for a long time, as well as the guarantee of protection if someone gives evidence that could later be used against that person as a party involved. We have now achieved this. I would like to thank Mrs De Veyrac most sincerely for her excellent work. Gesine Meissner,

 Mr President, we live in a Europe where we want people to be able to live together happily and to have access to all areas of life that are important to them. As you know very well, we are experiencing demographic change in Europe. In future, there will be fewer people living in many areas than there are now. Nevertheless, we want all citizens to be provided with the services that they require and that they need in order to be able to have their say. This includes – very importantly – the postal service, which is to be guaranteed by means of a universal service. Firstly, there is the question of how we can ensure the provision of the service in remote rural areas with little money in the coffer, and at affordable prices. We also need people to deliver this post who are paid a reasonable wage for doing so. That is not a simple task for the Member States. However, we have decided that that is what we want and you, Commissioner, have indicated that a large majority of the Member States have also agreed to it. We now also need to make it possible for users to complain. I can see a problem with this. It has not yet been mentioned. However, the directive states that if something goes wrong, citizens should have a body they can complain to. It is not so easy, either, to maintain the appropriate infrastructure in this regard, particularly where there are not many people. Commissioner Barnier, you said that you are still new to this office and that you will at least take everything into account. I believe you. However, you have to understand that we are extremely sceptical, particularly in the Committee on Transport and Tourism. Mr Simpson said that the same thing happened in the case of the railway package – the previous Commission was responsible for monitoring its implementation – practically nothing was implemented and nothing happened. In other areas, too, things have not always proceeded in the way we would have liked them to. I know that, because I was also previously in politics in Germany. Decisions are made which are extremely good and which everyone is agreed on, and then no one thinks to check to see whether it is implemented and whether it is implemented quickly in the interests of the people of Europe and in the interests of workers. That is what we want from you. Therefore, show us that we can trust you. We will be very pleased if that turns out to be justified. Gesine Meissner,

 Mr President, as a previous speaker rightly said, it is important that passengers’ rights are protected in Europe, regardless of what mode of transport they are using. It is simply a logical conclusion for us to move from air and rail transport to passengers’ rights on ships, buses and coaches. Yet another speaker has already mentioned the fact that we have unfortunately not succeeded in dealing with both subjects as a package, as we had originally planned. Although we were able to reach a compromise on the rights of passengers on ships and complete the trialogue, this was sadly not the case with bus and coach transport. I would like to look specifically at the rights of bus and coach passengers, because I am also the shadow rapporteur in this area. I very much regret that we have not managed to achieve a compromise, because in the trialogue meeting, we were able to bring the position of the Council, on the one hand, and the positions of the European Parliament and the Commission, on the other, much closer together. We were concerned – and this is also very important – about protecting passengers’ rights; above all, we wanted to ensure that people with restricted mobility and with disabilities can always make use of transport, including buses and coaches. A range of measures are needed to make this possible and this is what we have been calling for. I believe that this is particularly important because in future, there will be more people with disabilities and restricted mobility, simply as a result of the ageing population. This is a very important point. Of course, we must also take into account the fact that consumers’ rights involve having an offering available. In particular, those small and medium-sized companies which provide coach trips are not able to do everything. For example, they cannot provide unlimited compensation. There is also the question of how they will cope with advance payments. We managed to bring our positions closer together in this area and this is why I regret the fact that we have been unable to reach an overall compromise. As the rapporteur said, it is important that we consider both passengers’ rights and the options open to transport providers. I would very much like to see some sort of agreement reached during the forthcoming mediation process, because I agree absolutely with Mr Simpson when he says that the exclusion of buses and coaches is unacceptable, given that other means of transport are covered by the regulation.

 Mr President, I believe that Mr Koch is right when he says that intelligent transport systems will take us into a new era. In the last year, I have come across lorries that can talk to one another. It sounds crazy, but this really is the intelligent transport management system of the future. Special devices enable lorries to identify for safety reasons whether there is an obstacle or a pedestrian crossing the road in front of them. They can then pass the information to the lorry travelling behind, so that it can brake in good time and prevent an accident from occurring. Of course, this is not yet on the agenda. In this case, the major benefit of Mrs Jensen’s report is that it gives us an overview of the current situation and an insight into what we will need in future in order to improve safety, prevent congestion, reduce accidents and take more effective action on the environment. My final point concerns something which I have experienced myself near Hanover in Germany. On the motorway, there is an intelligent transport system consisting of variable speed limits. These tell drivers what speed they should travel at in order to prevent traffic jams. This is good for drivers and for the environment and also reduces the number of accidents. We need systems of this kind and much more. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mr Kallas referred to a European maritime transport space without barriers. I believe that this is something that we all want. We also need it urgently and this report is another step in the right direction. It is a fact that 95% of our exports and 40% of intra-European goods are transported by sea and therefore pass through ports. For this reason, it is clearly absolutely essential for administrative procedures to be simplified and harmonised within this growth area. This report will meet both these objectives, which is why it cannot be praised highly enough. I regret the fact that Mr Sterckx was not able to achieve everything. Two points which were very close to his heart and which many other Members supported, as we have heard, are the simplification of the pilot licensing system, because this would be a really sensible, practical solution, and the lack of a common language. I believe that English really is the right language. It is unacceptable for accidents to happen in which people can even lose their lives simply because many seafarers speak different languages. It would be much better to introduce a common language in this very environmentally friendly area of transport, in just the same way as in the air transport industry. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, this has really been an afternoon devoted to transport and this is the report which basically summarises everything. Many people say that the greatest achievement made on behalf of the citizens of Europe is the internal market. As Mr Kallas has said, the transport routes are the arteries of the internal market. Therefore, it is, of course, important to ensure that these transport routes are safe, that they are developed in an environmentally friendly way, and that we take a general look at what can be improved in future using intelligent transport systems, for example. We must think about how we can structure the more environmentally friendly areas, such as rail and sea transport, in a more effective way, how we can move more transport away from the roads and into these areas, and how we can reduce the environmental impact of the emissions from sea transport. At the same time, we must also consider how to meet the specific needs of urban transport, which are very different from those of international transport. The future of urban transport may lie with managers who travel on e-bikes that also provide them with exercise. Of course, we need quite different options over longer distances, which would also fulfil a cross-border function. This is a good and very forward-looking report. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Providing consumers with information about food is undoubtedly important. However, the debate in Brussels has become a lobbying battle between large companies from the food industry and consumer protection organisations. There was no place in this debate for the reality of everyday life for consumers. The representatives of the German Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament are in favour of a minimum of labelling. Consumers should be able to make their purchasing decisions on the basis of transparent, legible information. Colour coded labelling influences consumers and does not form the basis for transparent information. The so-called guideline daily amounts (GDAs) also have their weak points. Instead of having neutral information about the amounts of nutrients per 100 grams or millilitres printed legibly on packaging, Parliament discussed whether the daily requirements of a 40-year-old woman could be used as the point of reference or whether the colour coding of nutrients was a useful decision-making tool. The proposed, far-reaching, mandatory requirements for the origin labelling of ingredients cannot be implemented in practice. We have also rejected the idea of special national provisions, because the labelling system should, as far as possible, be standardised. For these reasons, we were not able to vote in favour of the proposed report. Gesine Meissner,

 Mr President, Mrs Georgieva, you have presented this existing agreement and have said that there has been significant progress. We in Parliament take a less generous approach than you, as you have already heard. It is important that this agreement is in place, because the EU and the USA together account for about 60% of global air traffic and the USA is an important partner of ours in general terms. The problem is simply that, in a partnership, the conditions for both partners should be roughly the same. However, it is not possible to say that the conditions are the same when the USA has a 49% share of our market and we are only allowed about a 25% share of theirs. It is clear that this represents an imbalance. A small delegation went to the USA and took part in negotiations in the spring of this year. The Americans said to us that, if we wanted greater market access, we would have to lift the limitations on night flights and change the noise restrictions. We explained that for us, this is a question of subsidiarity which has to be respected. Basically, we can only negotiate on other issues if we have a reasonably level playing field. Four points were mentioned. The environment: we can make some joint progress via the emissions trading system, simply because we have such a large share of the world market. Social standards: something has been achieved in this area and passengers’ rights were also mentioned. Competition: this still leaves something to be desired. As far as security is concerned, I would now like to talk about data. The American concept of data protection and privacy is different from ours. We understandably want our concept of privacy to be respected. We looked at the body scanners while we were in the USA. There, it is normal for the scanners to show an image of the entire body, with only the face being concealed. This was completely inconceivable to us. We want privacy and data to be protected in every case. This has to be respected. We in Parliament, with our new powers from the Treaty of Lisbon, will be happy to discuss this with you.

 Mr President, Mrs Georgieva, you have now moved from air travel to rail travel, which is our second subject this evening. I must say that it is often the case in politics that fine words are followed by actions that leave a lot to be desired and that is what has happened here. In the European Union, we have a lot of excellent objectives. We have already achieved some of them, but others we are far from fulfilling. There is still a great deal to be done with regard to the internal transport market and rail transport in particular. We had good intentions, but we have to ask ourselves whether the European Union is a paper tiger. Or perhaps we do not have the wherewithal to get to where we want to go? In the past, competition on the rail market has been very varied. We need an independent regulatory body. This has functioned quite well for the rail system in Germany, but that does not mean that there is no room for improvement. We really need the option of dividing up the lines independently, so that everything runs smoothly and there can be real competition. That is one of the points that I wanted to make. It is, of course, embarrassing for us that, out of the 27 Member States, only the United Kingdom, Finland and the Netherlands have implemented the directive. The two Member States which have no railway system – Malta and Cyprus – were obviously unable to do so. All the others have not done their homework and have obviously got away with it, because we have not reprimanded them. Therefore, it is important for the European Union to put in place appropriate sanction mechanisms, otherwise we will not be taken seriously. It is also important to make it clear to the Member States that everyone will benefit from this. In principle, everyone wants the rail market to be opened up to competition. That is what everyone says. However, when it comes to taking action, nothing much happens. We must make progress on the finances. It finally became clear in Saragossa recently that there is a general lack of funding available. It could be our job to subsidise cross-border projects and we must, of course, call on the Member States to do more. We know that the situation is difficult everywhere at the moment, but this is what Europe needs. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
).

Madam President, we have heard a great deal already. It is true, as Mrs Figueiredo said, that this is a directive that was intended to be aimed at employees. That is correct. However, there are also self-employed people who are not classed as employees. It is important for people in Europe to be able to decide how they want to work – whether as an employee or as a self-employed worker. That is only right. Naturally, the self-employed also have to play by certain rules. Digital tachographs are already present in all heavy goods vehicles and the equivalent vehicles that we are talking about here. If we were now to include self-employed workers in this directive, it would unduly restrict their freedom of choice. That is why my group is in favour of excluding the self-employed from this directive at all costs. We consider Mrs Bauer’s proposal, and the proposal from the Commission, to be right. That should be taken into account. We want to protect small and medium-sized businesses, and in this case, we can do so by adopting the proposal. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
).

 Madam President, Commissioner, we are in complete agreement about the need for an internal market in rail freight transport as well. This is very important. We have had this on paper for a long time, but unfortunately we do not yet have it in practice. If we still have a few differences of opinion, that is due to the fact that we have different experiences in the various Member States in terms of the functioning or non-functioning of the rail network. I come from Germany, where it would be terrible if freight transport took priority over passenger transport. That would have a very negative effect on local public passenger transport. At the same time, we are very well aware that we need a continuous system in Europe. This is something that we want as well as need. There is just the question of how it will be implemented, how many corridors it will have and then, of course, also who will now lay down the one-stop shop rules, who will allocate the train paths. There are completely different opinions on this. Some people think that we would create a parallel system if we had a one-stop shop per corridor and not functional national one-stop shops, which should perhaps be included. That is the only source of dissent that we have. Otherwise, we all agree that we need this freight transport in Europe. Gesine Meissner,

 Madam President, Commissioner, we have already held a debate about the ash cloud and the associated problems for aviation in the immediate aftermath of the volcanic eruption. We observed various things in this crisis. We observed, for one thing, that aviation really is essential for the transport sector, as it is not only passengers that get stranded, but goods, too, can be left untransported. In Germany, for example, BMW had some production bottlenecks due to not receiving deliveries. We observed that we need every mode of transport, including aviation. For another thing, we observed that it is a significant crisis for the airlines if it is not possible to fly for several days. A five-day break, the airlines said, could be coped with. A 20-day break, however, could perhaps have caused a collapse of the entire industry lasting quite some time. We need not talk about compensation just yet, the airlines themselves said, but if it had lasted longer, that would have been necessary. Passenger rights have been subject to varying comments from different speakers. They have now put to the test the rule that, in such extraordinary cases, too, everything can be done for passengers in relation to information, compensation and recompense to the extent that they need it and in the way we originally laid it down here. There are still two subjects in particular that I would like to go into. The first is the Single European Sky. We do not have a single European airspace, and that is something that was painfully absent this time, too. A single European airspace clearly would not have prevented the volcanic eruption, we all know that, but we would certainly have been better able to bring about the smooth evacuation of passengers. We have appointed a Functional Airspace Blocks (FAB) coordinator, of course. He is now starting work, and we all very much hope that his work will relatively soon be able to lead to a single European airspace. The question is also how long will it take until we actually achieve this? Perhaps you are not in a position to answer that precisely. We have also discussed before whether better European coordination of the railway sector – something that we have long been wanting and, on paper, have long had – could have helped passengers to get home more quickly. In this regard, too, we observed quite clearly where our difficulties lie. I will now move on to my final question. Do we have good crisis management arrangements for cases like this? We have the institute in London, which is actually there to provide information when there are earthquakes. It also deals with volcanic eruptions as a secondary responsibility. Now it has been producing computer projections based on second-hand data, and it has been criticised for that. What can we learn from other parts of the world where volcano eruptions are more common, such as the United States, Indonesia and others? What other measurements do they take? According to my information, they are better prepared for such situations. Perhaps we had not planned for this in Europe, but we do then have to learn the resultant lessons. We are a hi-tech location, we have a lot of opportunities, and researchers in Germany, for example, have called for a specialised monitoring network for those aerosols, those minuscule items, that volcanic ash contains. What else do you think that we can do? How can we improve our technologies in the interests of aviation, the people and goods? Jürgen Creutzmann,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European single market, Europe’s greatest achievement, is celebrating its 20th anniversary. Border-free travel, work and study, a huge market for businesses and consumers: the single market gives us more freedoms and is a driver of trade and productivity. However, the benefit that the European Union derives from the single market could be doubled if further barriers to trade – especially in the service sector – were to be removed by promoting the digital single market and integrating infrastructure. If we examine infrastructure in the single market, two things become clear. Firstly, it is fragmented: few countries place a priority on cross-border links. Let us take the example of rail traffic: a goods train travelling from Italy to Sweden has to change its locomotive and crew up to four times. Secondly, the integration of national systems is extremely costly. Physical and regulatory hurdles must be overcome. The Commission’s proposals currently being discussed for trans-European transport, energy and telecommunications networks address these and other problems. However, these ambitious aims can only be achieved if enough money is made available. Investments in infrastructure are the best use of EU funds, because they encourage sustainable growth, employment and European competitiveness. This is why it is so important that the Member States, as part of the ongoing negotiations over the multiannual financial framework, do not make any cuts in the Connecting Europe Facility. SMEs must also benefit more from the European single market. Ninety-nine per cent of European enterprises are SMEs, but only 25 % export within the single market. The further completion of the single market holds no dangers for Member States. On the contrary, it is an opportunity for more growth, more jobs and thereby more prosperity for people in Europe. Jürgen Creutzmann,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in many political areas we already speak with a single European voice at international level. Unfortunately, this is not true with regard to external energy policy. It is regrettable that the Commission’s proposal and the ambitious position of Parliament were rejected by the Member States. In formal terms the Council may be right in claiming that the European Union does not have executive powers. However, it must be clear to all of us that we must all pull together in the energy sector if we are to meet the challenges of security of supply and affordable energy in the long term. As globalisation progresses and various actors in the energy markets flex their muscles, even the large Member States must realise that in the long run we can only succeed by acting in concert. This is even more the case for the smaller Member States. We knew from the start that our parliamentary position was very ambitious. We had to expect resistance. However, it gives one pause to realise that the Council saw no room for negotiations. Having weighed up all the options, we can agree to the results of the negotiations. After all, we have the opportunity to agree at least a legal framework, a basis on which we can build in a few years’ time. I believe that this is better than a failed legislative text that would have forced us to start again from scratch next time around. For this reason, we will vote against the amendments tabled by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament. I would like to express my sincere thanks again to the rapporteurs for their commitment and for their efforts to support the Commission in this. Jürgen Creutzmann,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the protection of intellectual property rights is of life and death importance to the European economy. Increasingly frequent infringements of rights and the constantly increasing trade in rights-infringing products threaten the growth of our economy and, with it, also jobs. Counterfeit products damage not only the industry affected, but can also represent a serious threat to the health and safety of consumers. This is often forgotten when this matter is discussed. The customs authorities at the EU’s external borders are in a comparatively favourable position to retain rights-infringing products before they reach the internal market. That is why it is so important that this regulation should be adapted to meet the new challenges of our times. The Commission has recognised the need for action and produced a sound proposal last year in which it extended the scope of the regulation, increased legal certainty for transiting goods, and put forward a special procedure for small consignments in view of the burgeoning online trade in counterfeit products. In my view, however, there is still considerable potential to further improve the conditions for the affected actors. I am referring, in this regard in particular, to the customs authorities, rights holders and consumers. With my report, I pursued four goals; namely, increasing protection for consumers, relieving the burden on customs authorities, strengthening the position of rights holders and observing data protection. With regard to the first objective, in contrast to the oft-cited view, the enforcement of intellectual property rights is in the interests of consumers more than anyone. This is because counterfeit products generally do not meet the statutory requirements and are generally not subject to any quality control. As a result, these products often endanger the health and safety of consumers. During our committee’s consultation, we were shown horrific pictures of consumers seriously disfigured after using counterfeit toiletries. It is not going too far to say that counterfeit products can even put people’s lives at risk. By way of example, one German carmaker brought to my attention the deadly risk that counterfeit braking systems entail. With regard to the second objective, the customs authorities can only effectively enforce the various intellectual property rights if they can quickly and efficiently instigate proceedings. We therefore put forward a series of proposals in order to ease the work of the customs authorities. In principle, a procedure to destroy the goods and launch proceedings that is as standardised and simplified as possible should be used for all cases of infringed rights. The procedure proposed by our committee makes it possible to destroy products without a court having to determine an infringement of rights, provided that the rights holder confirms the infringement and – a very important detail – that neither the party reporting the infringement nor the holder of the goods objects. This ensures the protection of rights and a procedure in accordance with the rule of law. Moreover, the special procedure for small consignments makes it easier to destroy goods, as the customs authority no longer needs to contact the rights holder in each individual case. This is of benefit both to the customs authorities and the rights holders. The conditions for information exchange between customs authorities in the Union and the competent authorities in third countries should also be improved. That will make it possible to prevent the production and sale of counterfeit goods closer to the source. With regard to the third objective, with the new regulation, we are also aiming to strengthen the rights of the holders of intellectual property rights. It is they, after all, who generate significant growth and jobs in Europe through their innovations. If we Europeans want to continue to be competitive, we need to promote innovation by effectively enforcing intellectual property rights. We have a series of proposals to that end: a) Rights holders are to be given better access to information about goods seized.
 b) They may also use this information to determine the identity of the rights holder, both in connection with criminal proceedings and out-of-court settlements. c) The biggest improvement is to be found in the reversal of the burden of proof in the case of transiting goods. I will go into that again later in my summing up. Jürgen Creutzmann,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I am still a little shocked by this debate. Mr Engström, it goes without saying that the customs authorities will not become the arbiters of patents, as the Commissioner has stressed once again. Similarly, I do not understand the concerns of social democratic Members. I believe that their worry is completely unfounded as, when it comes to generic products, for the first time, the text states quite specifically that the customs authorities may not obstruct the free trade of medicines and, in particular, generic products. We further reinforced this basic principle in our report. I also thought it important – and there were some points to debate in this regard – to ensure the rule of law. This is, after all, a highly important criterion, in other words, that those whose rights are infringed can also take legal action against customs decisions. On another note, I have been pleased to see that the Council has adopted many of our amendments in its compromise text, for example, Commissioner, when it comes to the delegated acts for small consignments. We proposed two kilogrammes and three items, from which the Council has made three kilogrammes and five items, so we will certainly reach a positive result in this regard. I hope that plenary will back this report with a large majority tomorrow so that we can immediately enter into negotiations with the Council, and that, as the Commissioner said in his speech, at the end of the year, a regulation will then enter into force that offers benefits all round, which is to say, to consumers, data protection, businesses – that has been stressed once again in the speeches we have heard – but also the customs authorities. Our contribution was reducing the red tape for the customs authorities in order to help them to be able to resolve cases. I believe that we succeeded in doing so. Jürgen Creutzmann  (ALDE

 The German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament has spoken out clearly in favour of the introduction of a debt redemption fund. However, participation in such a fund must be associated with clear and strict rules, such as were contained in the proposal made by the German Council of Economic Experts to the German Government in autumn 2011. Watering down the criteria for participation is neither productive nor effective. Linking the introduction of a debt redemption fund with the eurobonds project and the treatment of economic imbalances is unfair, and is rejected by the FDP in the European Parliament in the strongest possible terms.

 Mr President, Mr Potočnik, cooperation between the European Union and Switzerland is something dear to my heart. That is why it is important to deal with these issues hampering cooperation. We have heard that the provisions for the granting of residence permits for eight European countries no longer correspond to the agreements. We regret this action on the part of the Swiss authorities, particularly in view of the fact that this is just one of many measures that threaten the transposition of bilateral agreements between Switzerland and the European Union; Mr Potočnik has outlined the problems already. It is evident from this that, within the Joint Committee, the Commission still needs to deal with the still outstanding measures for the free provision of services in Switzerland and the implementation of an internal market. If we succeed in making progress here and in reaching an agreement between Switzerland and the European Union that sets down binding rules when it comes to points under dispute, then this can only be to everyone’s benefit. The decision by the Swiss authorities is not just unwise in political terms, but also from an economic perspective. We know, for example, that there are many well-qualified young Polish citizens who would have had the opportunity to work in Switzerland in future and to contribute to prosperity there. I hope that Switzerland will revise this decision and withdraw it again. Jürgen Creutzmann,

 Mr President, one of the most serious problems for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is access to finance. The Commission’s cohesion policy should be able to help resolve this problem. There are various programmes which have already been mentioned. A study by the European Parliament on the effectiveness of the Structural Funds and other measures aimed at regional SMEs has evidently highlighted some weaknesses. These include a failure to distinguish between different types of SMEs – such as micro-enterprises, but also self-employed people – major bureaucratic obstacles during the process of applying for finance, together with the reporting and monitoring requirements, the need for advance funding for projects and a lack of standardisation of the rules and procedures across different subsidy programmes. This leads me to make a few requests to the Commission. We should be able to simplify the process of obtaining finance from the Structural Funds. We need to improve the access to Joint European Resources for Micro to Medium Enterprises (JEREMIE). The contribution of EUR 50 000 required from the applicants is too high. We need to relax the requirement for advance funding for projects. We also need to take a more targeted approach to providing finance for different types of SMEs, to reduce the amount of cofinancing required and to close the financing gap between the individual depreciation cycles. In addition, we need more support to help SMEs to help themselves in the area of financing. Professional organisations could make a contribution in this respect. We must help SMEs to become stronger and to increase their capital. They have to do this in order to obtain loans from the banks. Mr Hahn, it is, of course, also important that Basel III is implemented in such a way that it does not obstruct the process of lending to SMEs, but instead creates opportunities for companies to access loans easily and under favourable terms. Jürgen Creutzmann  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today’s vote will introduce a regulation which brings direct added value for the citizens of Europe. During the next summer holidays, mobile phone calls from abroad will be significantly cheaper and, for the first time, there will be price transparency outside Europe, which is also important. For me, an essential feature of this regulation is that we have not repeated the mistakes of Roaming I and Roaming II. It has become clear that simple price limits, which actually have the same effect as price fixing, do not lead to more competition. Therefore, it is important for us to focus now on unbundling roaming services and national contracts for mobile communication services. We are creating a market which will lead to low prices of its own accord by providing genuine consumer choice and introducing new market players. Of course, we still need a safety net for prices as a transitional measure and to protect consumers from abuse. However, more competition also requires more market players and they will not come onto the market while the price limits are too low and there is too little scope for innovative offers. It will also not help consumers if operators do not have enough money in future to invest in new, faster networks. Ultimately, we do not want to fall behind in Europe. For these reasons, I welcome the fact that we have found a sensible solution and I would like to thank Ms Niebler specifically for her important contribution to this common-sense regulation. Consumers will notice the benefits of the new Roaming Regulation in their wallets. By 2014, there will be significant falls of up to 45% in the cost of incoming and outgoing calls and, as early as July 2012, consumers will be paying almost 20% less. Particularly in the case of data roaming, there have been no limits to misuse until now, which has, in some cases, resulted in horrendous prices. A cap will be put on these in future. We must continue to work towards completing the internal market and, if possible, finding a solution which means that in future, we do not need roaming charges at all.

 Mr President, I should like to start by expressing my deep gratitude to all the shadow rapporteurs, who made this report possible through their excellent cooperation. The committee agreed to this report with an overwhelming vote of 30 in favour, one against and one abstention. Online gambling is an international phenomenon that is growing on a daily basis. Consumers find it easy to gamble online with providers who are either completely unregulated or who are registered in other countries where different rules apply. As a result, some individual Member States are no longer able to guarantee sufficient protection for their consumers. Children and young people or gambling addicts are particularly affected by this. In addition, frequently illegal foreign competition causes Member States to lose many millions of euro in tax revenue every year. This comes at a cost to the promotion of charitable projects, combating addiction and support for amateur sport. Finally, legal uncertainties make it difficult to offer cross-border gambling services within the internal market. Given that there are no European licensing standards, it is necessary to decide on a case-by-case basis whether practices in the Member States comply with European law. The existing level of legal uncertainty is made clear by the large number of contractual violation cases in recent years. That is why there is an urgent need to close the existing gap between legislation and reality. The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has come to a clear conclusion. The Member States need to cooperate much more closely on this issue. This will not be enough to resolve the problems outlined, however. In addition, the European Union will also have to play a significant role in future. This has been demanded by our committee with an overwhelming majority. In addition to other measures, an EU directive is also to be considered that will set shared minimum standards for consumer and youth protection, combating crime in the area of online gambling. Although the committee emphasises the principle of subsidiarity in its report on online gambling, the Member States need to regulate online betting for themselves insofar as possible within their own territory. However, this means that certain rules will need to be met in accordance with the judicial rulings of the European Court of Justice: restrictions in the legal range of gambling services, through state monopoly for example, are only permitted if they are coherent and proportionate. We cannot have a situation where a state explains away its monopoly by arguing that it wishes to protect consumers from the negative effects of gambling, while at the same time intensively advertising its range of state-backed gambling options. The best example of this can be found in Germany, where we have a state monopoly on gambling and lotteries, but with frequent advertising informing consumers of the current size of the jackpot, naturally encouraging players to invest their money in the lottery. To avoid such situations in the future, the European Union should set down quality standards for state licensing models. If a Member State decides in favour of a state licensing model, this model must comply with the principles of transparency and fair competition. In other words, all providers of gambling services that comply with the relevant conditions should be able to apply for a licence. At the same time, trust between the national regulatory authorities needs to be strengthened so as to achieve greater cooperation. In addition, the Commission is called upon to examine ways to use legislation to prevent the flow of payments between illegal providers and their customers. This could be achieved, for example, if each Member State were to draw up a white list of licensed gambling operators in its territory. Banks and credit institutions would only then be permitted to authorise transactions with these approved operators. I believe that this is a sensible and realistic alternative to the blocking of Internet sites, something that we, as liberals, would not favour. This measure would also be an important step in securing tax income from legal gambling, combating organised crime, and protecting the consumer from unregulated gambling. Everyone, regulated providers, the public purse and consumers alike, would benefit from the measures called for in the report. Nonetheless, the European Commission needs the full backing of the European Parliament in order to present the necessary initiatives. It is for this reason I am hopeful that there will be a broad majority in favour at tomorrow’s vote, giving the Commission a clear mandate for action. Mr Barnier, it is over to you.

In my opinion, it exacerbates the problem of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), rather than resolving it. We need a standard, EU-wide solution.

In addition, it will weaken the position of the EU in future World Trade Organisation negotiations.

 The German Free Democratic Party delegation in the European Parliament assumes that the inclusion of Romania and Bulgaria in the Schengen area will further improve freedom of movement within the EU. Now that both Member States have achieved positive evaluation results in all areas of the Schengen review, there should be no more obstacles to delay inclusion further. There is no denying that the technical securing of borders will not automatically make them impermeable as long as problems persist in combating corruption in the justice and policing system. Accordingly, this challenge also relates to Member States already in the Schengen area. For this reason, the German Free Democratic Party delegation believes that criteria such as the fight against corruption must receive greater attention when evaluating the Schengen mechanism, and any misdemeanours must be punished appropriately.

Mr President, Mr Rehn, the joint question on the review of the Small Business Act shows that there is still a great deal to be done to ensure that medium-sized companies in Europe have freedom to act, particularly on a national level. However, I am pleased that in recent years, we have succeeded in implementing almost all the provisions of the Small Business Act in the European Union. Most recently, a new directive on combating late payment in commercial transactions came into force in March, which will make an important contribution to improving payment practice in Europe. Now the Member States have two years to implement the new directive. I would like to call for this timeframe to be shortened, in particular, in the Member States where this would not present a significant problem. Instead of delaying implementation for two years, it could be completed, where possible, within one year. The Member States have not yet been able to agree on the statute for a European private company. Therefore, I very much welcome the fact that the Hungarian Presidency is following up this issue and making it one of the focal points of its work. This form of company in particular could enable small and medium-sized enterprises to save a great deal of money. I am thinking, in particular, of accounting, establishing a company and ongoing legal advice. Therefore, I would like to say again how pleased I am that the Hungarian Presidency is focusing on this area. The issue just mentioned by Mrs Riera Madurell is also important, and that is public procurement. Here, we can still achieve a great deal for small and medium-sized enterprises. There are many bureaucratic regulations in this area and it is often particularly difficult for small and medium-sized businesses to take part in the public procurement process. We need greater transparency and we must also try to make the most of the opportunities presented by the modern media and, in particular, the Internet. Jürgen Creutzmann,

Mr President, Mr Barnier, I would like to respond to my fellow Member’s remarks. Instead of a social clause, the committee has proposed investigating the impact that the measures in the internal market will have on employment. This is much more important than applying general formulae. If we want to make progress with the internal market, we must pay attention to social issues and put the emphasis on them in everything we do. For this reason, an impact assessment which specifically takes these requirements into account is particularly important. I would like to make one more comment. I was surprised to hear the President speak about economic governance, which is still translated in German as Wirtschaftslenkung
. This term is also used to mean central state control of the economy. We have had very bad experiences of state control of the economy in one area of Germany. I am certain that we can only develop the internal market further if we coordinate all our national economies. That is abundantly clear. However, we will not be able to make progress with the internal market by means of economic governance. Today, we are discussing how we can bring some momentum to the internal market. This is long overdue, because we will be celebrating the 20th anniversary of the internal market next year. Therefore, I welcome Mr Barnier’s statement in which he said that he wants to focus on a few specific measures that have not yet been implemented and that will give a new impetus to the internal market. The internal market represents a huge opportunity for all of us. It can lead to the creation of more jobs and our goal must be to find work for people. This is the very best social policy that we can put in place, because people who are employed will also develop self-esteem. Therefore, we must do everything we can to make sure that progress is made in this area. We need a balanced package of measures which brings advantages for businesses and for citizens. On the one hand, we want medium-sized companies in particular to benefit more from the internal market than they have done in the past. Therefore, we urgently need an EU patent system, so that companies can at last protect and sell their innovative products throughout Europe for a reasonable cost. In addition, businesses need more funding to develop innovations. A European venture capital market is just one of many measures that can be taken. The harmonisation of value-added tax and the corporate tax base that we are now discussing will also give a boost to the internal market. On the other hand, we also need to take specific measures which will increase citizens’ trust in the internal market. We must improve the recognition of professional qualifications, possibly by means of the European professional card. This will make it easier to work in another Member State and will create more mobility for citizens within the European internal market. We also need a European market surveillance organisation, and I would like to emphasise this point, because the Member States are constantly failing to put the dossier into practice. We do not want dangerous products to be sold on the internal market. If we can adopt this proposal with a large majority, we will be able to give a new impetus to the internal market.

 Madam President, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, the largest single market in the world in terms of economic power has developed in the globalised era into a crucial location advantage for the European Union. That is why it is so important to oppose protectionist tendencies and to expand the single market further. In view of the excessively indebted national budgets, there is nothing left for Europe to do but to strengthen the economy by means of structural reforms. Since its establishment in 1992, the single market has already generated additional growth of 1.85%. Implementation of the measures that have been announced is intended to bring about further growth of 2 to 4%. We can divide the Commission’s 50 proposals for single market initiatives into three categories: firstly, into the many specific proposals that will, in any case, enhance the single market for enterprises and citizens. These include the creation of a fully operational internal energy market which, for Europe as an economic and industrial centre, is particularly important. Then there is a European professional card and a European Skills Passport to facilitate mobility within the European Union, which will become more and more important in future in order to maintain Europe’s competitiveness in a globalised world, and the strengthening of electronic commerce by means of better management of copyrights and new guidelines for the effective implementation of the Services Directive in order to create new jobs. Secondly, there are, however, also many proposals which are worded in too vague a manner for us to be able to assess them yet. Therefore, we still need to wait for the Commission’s specific proposals. I include here the revision of the EU rules for public procurement, measures for services of general interest and also – Mrs Gebhardt – the deliberations on a European approach to collective redress. I do not know whether we ought to go down the same erroneous path as the United States. Thirdly, the communication also contains proposals which, in my view, are counterproductive in terms of strengthening the single market, because they burden enterprises with additional bureaucracy. We therefore need to discuss these proposals, and we are ready to do so. Jürgen Creutzmann,

Madam President, Commissioner Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow, the European Parliament will adopt a directive on combating late payment that will make history. It is the first directive that can quite simply be explained in three sentences: firstly, public authorities will, as a matter of principle, have to pay within 30 days in future if no shorter payment targets have been agreed and if no special circumstances make a payment target of no more than 60 days necessary. Secondly, when agreeing payment targets, enterprises have freedom of contract within 60 days and payment targets of more than 60 days are no longer permitted, except if expressly agreed and if it does not pose a serious disadvantage to the creditor. Thirdly, if the aforementioned payment deadlines are exceeded, recovery costs of at least EUR 40 and interest of at least 8% above the European Central Bank base interest rate can be charged without a prior reminder. This directive will help small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe to a great extent to improve their liquidity, and they will not need to accept as much credit from the banks. Debtors with a strong market presence will no longer be able to force small and medium-sized enterprises into granting longer payment deadlines, and that is a good thing. Furthermore, individual Member States will not only be able to retain shorter payment target deadlines in the form that has been customary up to now; we assume that, in fact, they will be retained, because we cannot imagine that the Late Payments Directive will lead to a deterioration in payment practices within the Member States. Enterprises that do business within Europe know that, in future, their claims will be settled after no more than 60 days. This is a huge step forward and a further step towards the completion of the European internal market. We can be very satisfied with the adoption of this legislation. It will help small and medium-sized enterprises and it will help the European internal market. Jürgen Creutzmann  (ALDE

 Madam President, Commissioner, in Pakistan, we have witnessed devastating floods, and we must help the suffering, destitute people of this country. In this regard, what saddens me, in particular, is the fact that there are regions in Pakistan that the central government is not allowing any proper aid to reach. Thus, for example, the region of Gilgit-Baltistan, north of Jammu and Kashmir within the Pakistani border region, has also been badly hit by heavy rainfall and its effects. According to information I have received, in Gilgit-Baltistan alone, 500 people have died and 50 000 people have been made homeless. Four bridges have been washed away and many areas of land have been completely cut off from the outside world. So far, however, aid equivalent to only around EUR 10 000 has reached Gilgit-Baltistan. Therefore, the European Union should not just hand over its aid to the Pakistani central government but provide direct support to the non-governmental organisations that are also looking after the interests of the remote regions of Pakistan.

Along with the majority of Members in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I have decided to vote in favour of the Sommer report. It is true that the Liberals were not able to achieve their goals in every area. The adoption of origin labelling for meat and milk in processed products is a regrettable move, because it imposes significant costs on producers and seems almost impossible to implement in practice. However, for me, the positive results of the vote clearly outweigh the negative ones. For the first time, we have uniform regulations on food labelling throughout the entire internal market, with no possibility of individual countries going it alone. In addition, one of the decisive successes of this vote for me is the fact that the misleading traffic light model was rejected. A mandatory colour coded nutrient declaration will not be permitted either at a European or a national level. Uniform Europe-wide labelling rules will bring clear advantages for companies and consumers. The cost of manufacturing and selling products will fall because manufacturers will only have to follow a single regulation. Consumers will benefit from uniform nutrient labelling when comparing products that come from within Europe.

 Combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography is vitally important. We must use all our strength to combat the availability of child pornography in communications networks. The permanent and effective control of child abuse is both a political responsibility and a precept of the rule of law. The German Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament is of the opinion that it is necessary to remove such criminal content as quickly as possible. Jürgen Creutzmann  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, Commissioner Dalli, the fact that we are discussing three own-initiative reports on consumer protection and the internal market today shows that, despite all of our successes in these areas, there is still much that is in need of improvement. Admittedly, the Member States’ transposition of the internal market directives has, on average, greatly improved, but seven Member States have failed to meet the target set by the Commission of reducing the transposition deficit for the internal market directives to 1%. The main problem, however, has more to do with the application of EU law than with its transposition. Thus, in the event of treaty infringements by Member States, it takes, on average, 18 months – in other words, still far too long – for them to comply with the judgment of the European Court of Justice. This can be seen from the current internal market scorecard, and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe finds that unacceptable. This deficit will lead to problems for citizens and, in particular, for small and medium-sized enterprises, which depend on harmonised rules within the internal market, but which meet with unexpected, time-consuming and bureaucratic obstacles when they want to operate across borders. This is why it is important for SOLVIT to be developed further. SOLVIT is an online problem-solving network in which the Member States work together in a pragmatic way to resolve problems that have arisen as a result of the misapplication of internal market rules by public authorities. All Member States must ultimately provide the financial resources and adequately trained staff for the SOLVIT centres. The ALDE Group calls emphatically for people to be made more aware of SOLVIT in the Member States in order to facilitate the cross-border sale of their products and services. For this purpose, the involvement of the relevant associations in large-scale information campaigns is just as necessary as a uniform, easy-to-understand and easy-to-find Internet portal for receiving all kinds of complaints.

 According to the resolution of the European Parliament on the draft general budget for the financial year 2010, adopted on 17 December 2009, a vote was taken today on the amending budget for the European Parliament, following the revised calculations made by the Parliamentary administration. The FDP in the European Parliament abstained, because there was a paragraph in the package of amendments concerned that we could not reconcile with our convictions. The FDP had already expressed its opposition to an increase in the secretarial allowance to EUR 1 500 during the discussions in committee. It is out of the secretarial allowance that MEPs’ assistants are paid. The FDP considers that the argument that more money is needed due to the additional work that MEPs have to do with the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is unsound, as there is nothing in past experience to support this. Certainly, under the Treaty of Lisbon, which has just come into force, Parliament will overall need extra capacity for legislative work, but with the introduction of the Assistants’ Statute from the beginning of the current parliamentary term, there is still no proof that MEPs actually need more assistants. For this reason, there are grounds for concern that further demands and supplementary increases, or an extension of office capacity, will follow. For this reason, the FDP in the European Parliament abstained from voting. Jürgen Creutzmann

 Mr President, Commissioner, if what you are calling for is further development and harmonisation of the internal market, then we need to have a common set of rules. There are three aspects to online gambling which ought to be considered in this debate. How can we best protect the interests of our citizens and consumers? How can we best prevent fraud and criminal activity? How can we best protect our citizens from harm? The European Parliament resolution of 10 March 2009 on the integrity of online gambling has indicated methods and ways to proceed with regard to this issue. Now, as before, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe endorses the principles concerning the integrity of online gambling contained in Parliament’s resolution of 10 March 2009. In accordance with a ruling of the European Court of Justice, each Member State is free, under certain conditions, to regulate online gambling itself and the resolution of 10 March stresses that emphatically. National rules are better suited to combating match-fixing fraud, although this type of fraud cannot be eliminated entirely, as demonstrated by some recent examples in Germany. It has to be said, though, that gambling markets are much better regulated at national level, according to the tradition and culture of the country concerned. Players are offered better protection against addiction, fraud, money laundering and match-fixing if they can play through major online gambling service providers, who always, by definition, operate across borders. We cannot regulate everything according to the internal market concept and particularly not the prevention of underage gambling or gambling addiction. Online gambling provides increased opportunities for corrupt practices, such as fraud, match-fixing and illegal betting cartels, as online games can be set up and dismantled very rapidly. Illegal offshore betting operators present a particular problem in this regard, as it is almost impossible for them to be regulated or controlled. Profits from gambling should primarily be used for the benefit of society in order to promote amateur sport, amongst other things. It is best to leave this to the competence of national administrations. Continuous funding, for culture and professional and amateur sport, for example, gives individual Member States some justification for permitting gambling. However, a precondition for that is that the risk of addiction must be highlighted and proactively combated. As the full impact on consumers of the specific forms of gambling services offered online is not yet known, we need to take urgent action to fill this knowledge gap. It is essential in this context that Member States really do fulfil their tasks. Market surveillance is also key, when it comes to online gambling. If we in the European Parliament can agree that Member States have the right, under the principle of subsidiarity, to regulate their gambling markets according to their own traditions and cultures, we also then have to ensure that this is actually happening, through efficient control and market surveillance. Jürgen Creutzmann,

 Madam President, Commissioner, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports the views expressed in the opinion of the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment to the effect that the ALARA principle, in other words, the principle of ‘as low as reasonably achievable’, should apply in the assessment of carcinogenic substances. Secondly, there is consequently a need for the Commission to examine whether this principle is also satisfied by the limit values laid down in the Toys Directive. Thirdly, if this does not happen, we call on the Commission to ensure that, until the Toys Directive has been transposed by all the Member States in 2011, the limit values are laid down in the Toys Directive in such a way as to rule out any risk to the health of children from softening agents in toys. Fourthly, the principle enshrined in the Toys Directive, whereby chemicals that are potentially carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction are impermissible, must be implemented with regard to accessible parts of toys. This must actually be achieved by the limit values set, as otherwise such a directive is worthless. Fifthly, this calls, in particular, for better and more efficient market surveillance, because it is usually toys that have been imported into the EU that exceed the limit values set by the Union. However, efficient market surveillance would also enable toys manufactured within the EU to be tested to see whether they, too, comply with the limit values. Sixthly, it is totally unacceptable, should this be the case, that lower standards should apply to imports into the EU than, for example, into the US. However, the threat by the German Federal Minister for Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection, Ilse Aigner, to go it alone and prohibit so-called ‘toxic toys’ herself is, in my view, completely the wrong way to go about it and totally counterproductive when it comes to creating confidence in the European internal market. Merely cultivating national popular opinion not only destroys confidence in the European Institutions; it also damages the German Federal Government, because it approved the Toys Directive.

 The German Free Democratic Party members of the European Parliament have abstained from voting on the Copenhagen resolution for the following reasons. The resolution contains statements about financing for climate protection measures in third countries without defining the specific criteria or purpose of the financing. We cannot justify this to taxpayers. In addition, we believe that blanket criticism of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) is wrong. The ICAO is the organisation which deals with aviation matters at an international level. Both the criticism and the statement about the alleged failure of ICAO negotiations are incorrect and inappropriate. The call for specific arrangements for a CO2
 trading system for the aviation industry goes against current EU legislation and overburdens the EU’s negotiating position in an international climate agreement with unrealistic demands. Jürgen Creutzmann,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s response is, of course, not only discouraging, as Mr Schwab said, but also very disappointing. When it comes to the transposition, we need to realise that if you say that around 50% are on schedule, then we have to assume that the other 50% are a long way from achieving that. Take my own country, Germany, for example: the individual Federal Länder 
are currently transposing this directive. In Rhineland-Palatinate, where I live, I had the opportunity, on 2 September, to participate in the first reading for the transposition of the Services Directive for this Federal Land
. As you can imagine, it will be impossible to achieve the transposition on time, and I believe that the other Federal Länder
 are in a similar position. The crucial factor for us, of course, will be how the transposition is carried out. If Article 13(2) stipulates that ‘authorisation procedures and formalities shall not be dissuasive and shall not unduly complicate or delay the provision of the service’ then we must take great care to ensure that this does not happen in practice. A decisive factor, for example, will be how the single points of contact are equipped. Will they have language skills? Will they work closely enough with the administrations to also be able to deal with the concerns put to them? We very much doubt it. In fact, the committee should now be asking which countries are behind schedule with this, which countries make up the 50% and when do they expect to achieve this. It would then be better to create a moratorium, or something similar, for these countries. I am certain that, in most countries, this directive will not be transposed by 1 January 2010, even though these countries have had more than four years to do this. That is a major problem and it is very disappointing. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

 Dear colleague, that is a very good point. I would like to answer you in English. I have considered that, and as Liberals we are always fighting against bureaucratic burdens.

Mr President, the delegated act as adopted on 30 September 2013 foresees that public-private partnership bodies are to receive an indirect discharge via the Commission, instead of an individual discharge as they receive now. We fought against this as a team of rapporteurs, and I thank Ingeborg Gräßle for this good compromise. We rechecked with the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Controls which, acting under Rule 51 and unanimously, adopted the motion for resolution objecting to the delegated act. An alternative approach was now agreed upon by the Parliament, Council and Commission teams, which they are to endorse via a trilateral joint statement which foresees that, firstly, Parliament, the Council and the Commission agree that the joint undertakings should continue to be subject to a separate discharge by the European Parliament upon recommendation of the Council, and secondly, that the Commission will include derogations in the financial rules of the joint undertakings to reflect the separate discharge. Subsequently, the Commission will propose corresponding modifications to Articles 209 and 60 of the Financial Regulation. Thirdly (and last but not least), the Commission Delegated Regulation of 30 September 2013 on the model financial regulation for public-private partnership bodies will enter into force in order to allow joint undertakings to benefit from the simplifications introduced in the new financial framework. As just mentioned by the Presidency, the Council will endorse the joint statement on 20 January. In the light of this, the Committee on Budgetary Control and, I believe, the Committee on Budgets are ready to endorse this trilateral joint statement on the separate discharge for joint undertakings. In the name of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I request the withdrawal of the resolution objecting to the delegated act which was initially planned for vote tomorrow in Plenary.

 Mr President, Commissioner Šefčovič, Parliament has always actively supported the Danube Strategy. The Danube Forum, of which I am the Chair, has 60 MEPs. Therefore, I am pleased to be the first signatory of the oral question to put the subject of the Danube on today’s agenda. There has been some progress with regard to the Danube, such as the bridges I saw this summer between Widin and Calafat, on the international Danube bicycle tour. However, this progress is moving at a snail’s pace. There are still major difficulties: mayors in Bulgaria tell us that construction works on the Danube require consultation with seven ministries in Sofia. Other Danube residents have the impression in their Member States that the Danube is being marginalised in capital cities and not being placed in the foreground. This is why we are asking the Commission for more substantial results and measures. In the current programming period, the Danube Strategy should be provided with resources and for the future period we need a dedicated budget line for the Danube. We have specific projects, such as the Danube Manager, for which administration capacity needs to be developed. Small and medium-sized enterprises should be supported while they cooperate. There should be technology transfer centres. More than anything else, we need more opportunities for citizens to meet. We note that these citizens’ meetings must be supported otherwise they do not function. I have written to Chancellor Merkel and Commissioner Lewandowski to propose the formation of a Danube Youth Foundation. I therefore pose the question: can the Commission imagine itself financially supporting such a Danube Youth Foundation? Many young people would like to meet up, but cannot afford the tank of petrol or the train tickets they need to get to a meeting. Ladies and gentlemen, parliaments should play a greater role. I hope that we in the European Parliament will act as leaders and invite the other national and regional parliaments to join in, so that we, too, take greater ownership of the Danube Strategy than ever before.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the level of dissatisfaction in the wake of the Rio conference is significant. We recognise that Europe cannot force its ideas in relation to environmental policy on the rest of the world. This phase of disillusionment can also be seen as an opportunity, however. Europe can act as a role model. That is my first point. My second point is that we need to focus more on adjusting to the new situation brought about by climate change, as well as working towards climate protection. Above all, I believe that Europe’s development organisations, research institutions, universities and private enterprises can make a significant contribution; after all, we need to see economic development and environmental policy as two sides of the same coin. Weaker countries will only be able to pursue environmental policies if they also make progress on the economic development front. So, let us press forward with environmental technology. This is something Europe can offer other countries. Perhaps we need to question the idea of greening. Perhaps we should create blue growth that is mainly based on technology. As the world’s population continues to grow, this will only be possible if we see economics and environmental policy as inextricably linked.

 The German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament has spoken out clearly in favour of the introduction of a debt redemption fund. However, participation in such a fund must be associated with clear and strict rules, such as were contained in the proposal made by the German Council of Economic Experts to the German Government in autumn 2011. Watering down the criteria for participation is neither productive nor effective. Linking the introduction of a debt redemption fund with the eurobonds project and the treatment of economic imbalances is unfair, and is rejected by the FDP in the European Parliament in the strongest possible terms.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, do you know Mr Hanselmann? If not, you should get to know him. Around 20 years ago, Mr Hanselmann founded a company with three colleagues from the University of Paderborn. Now it has 1 000 employees. He received a loan from the state subsidy system in North Rhine-Westphalia to set up his company. This shows that state subsidies for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and subsidised loans are helpful. We need an initiative in Europe to promote the start-up of SMEs. The aid available must be made simpler. It must have lower thresholds and involve less red tape. One approach could be innovation vouchers. In addition, we must reallocate the unused money from the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund so that SMEs in Greece, for example, can obtain loans. However, to be able to do this, we also need different banking systems. One possibility would be cooperative banks and savings banks which the outlying countries in particular do not have. We need both things: a solution for the outlying countries and a policy for highly innovative companies in wealthier regions which will reinforce their strengths. That is what is currently required.

 Mr Lamberts, when you say we need growth and we need to create structures to allow states to borrow money again, it is also the case that the states which will be lending the money are afraid that this is just a bottomless pit.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating the 2010 budget and the European Court of Auditor’s report in this regard. This report contains both encouraging and less encouraging elements. Firstly, with regard to the funds that are directly controlled as well as managed by the Commission, it can be seen that the error rate is falling. This is the case in agricultural policy in particular, where an encouraging result was achieved with a 2.3% error rate. On the other hand, in cohesion policy, which has been a problem area for many years, we have an error rate of 7.7% – and two thirds of these errors should have been rectified by the Member States. That should not allow us to cease in our attempts to influence the Member States in this regard to ensure that the error rate is reduced. At this point, I would like first of all – on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, but also as committee chair – to thank Commissioner Šemeta as well as the President of the European Court of Auditors most sincerely for their excellent cooperation. I expressly agree with those Members who welcome the fact that the Council is also here today, represented by Mr Wammen from the Danish Presidency. The cooperation with the Commission and the European Court of Auditors is exemplary. The cooperation with the Council, Mr Wammen, is in need of improvement – and it is on the part of the Council that this improvement is required. I would like to ask and encourage you to pass that message on to the other members of the Council, too. As Parliament, we expect an improvement in use of funds for which we have shared responsibility, and for the Council now to accommodate Parliament here in the trialogue so that in future, we can reduce the error rate. After all, we must also finally make some progress on the discharge of the Council. It is not acceptable for there to be public expenditure that is not subject to any democratic scrutiny. ‘No taxation without representation’ was the battle cry of the American Revolution. Democracy requires there to be no public expenditure without democratic scrutiny. You mentioned the principle of reciprocity, but that is clearly not appropriate in terms of the relationship between the Council and Parliament, as the Treaty of Lisbon clearly stipulates that the Council recommends, but Parliament decides. That is not reciprocity; it is not symmetry, but asymmetry. Here it is important for Parliament, as the directly elected body of the citizens, to have its rights upheld. Michael Theurer,

 Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I would like to welcome the President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), Werner Hoyer, and to congratulate him on his committed and convincing debut. Following monetary stabilisation, we must now focus fully on real growth in the economy. One of the key aspects of this is the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises. The EIB supported 115 000 small and medium-sized enterprises in 2010 with funds totalling EUR 10 billion. A credit squeeze nonetheless persists for medium-sized businesses, particularly in the crisis countries and on the periphery of the European Union. We in the European Parliament expect the EIB to do all it can to provide greater support to small and medium-sized enterprises. We would be interested to learn more about the significance of the guarantees for small and medium-sized enterprises and the options with regard to the Risk Sharing Finance Facility. We also believe it is important that the EIB should play a role in financing infrastructure in the context of the EU project bonds. In summary, we believe that infrastructure, technology and innovation – in short, blue growth – should be at the centre of EIB strategy. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was an own-initiative report by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe which pointed out that the absorption capacity of certain Member States was not very high. As rapporteur on that report, I pointed to the causes of that situation. It is now necessary that the Commission take appropriate action here. We will also support the Commission in finally taking action in problem countries – in Greece, Romania, Bulgaria and in southern Italy. A reallocation of resources towards small and medium-sized enterprises, dual vocational training and tackling youth unemployment is absolutely the right course to take. That has to be our starting point. However, the vital thing is that capacities are built up, if we are to solve these problems. The impression the citizens of Europe have is that – as in Greece – all-out austerity is not working and that the government simply agrees measures which then remain unimplemented. However, it is crucial that, to use a car analogy, we do not put our foot down on the accelerator only to find that nothing happens. Now we need to engage a gear, so that the engine can provide thrust to the wheels! After all, we need to take action to develop a real economy: that is, to improve competitiveness, so that the problem is tackled at the root. Michael Theurer,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development
. – (DE)
 Mr President, Commissioner Rehn, ladies and gentlemen, in the discussion regarding the economic and financial crisis, which has led to the introduction of the European semester, the focus for the public is on the question of monetary policy and the sovereign debt crisis. For the Committee on Regional Development, however, it is important for more light to be shed on the question of the real economy. We want to eliminate the causes of the differences in competitiveness that result in some countries lagging behind. That is the central focus of European policy, and it must remain so in future, too. It is disgraceful that some countries do not utilise the Structural Funds. We need to investigate the causes here, as Parliament also determined in connection with my report on the absorption rate. It is not just a question of cofinancing; it is also a question of decentralising the responsibility for decision-making and of increasing administrative capacity. In this regard, the Committee on Regional Development is grateful to the rapporteur for including our proposals, because we now need to tackle the root of the problem and eliminate the causes of the imbalances. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Michael Theurer  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, the differences in competitiveness are undoubtedly also due to the different responses of Member States to global economic changes. It would be carrying things too far to investigate this, as even the opinions of the experts differ. The fact is that, even within Member States, individual regions are developing differently. Therefore, the Committee on Regional Development believes that current cohesion and regional policy offers a good approach for providing assistance to regions, cities and communities and the companies established there to enable them to adapt better. However, on investigating the actual effects it emerges that some Member States – such as Estonia or even Poland, which are achieving very good results – deal with the Structural Funds better than others, which find it difficult to absorb the funds – for example regions like Calabria and Sicily, as well as Greece and Romania. In the committee’s view, what is now needed is for us to tackle these problems specifically in order to utilise the Structural Funds better and to deal with the causes of the problem.

 Madam President, Commissioner, first of all, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Rühle, for her report and for such good cooperation. In view of the current debate, this is an appropriate moment to point out that public procurement is a very important way of achieving fair prices for public services and for the procurement of goods for the public sector. Competition is one element of using our scarce resources economically. It is thus a positive aspect of this report that public procurement is to be simplified. This should also facilitate access to public procurement for small and medium-sized enterprises. The measures for achieving this includes consistently allowing self-declarations, the division of contracts into lots – in other words, an SME-friendly tendering procedure – and the introduction of an electronic procurement passport. Moreover, when awarding contracts, the contracting authorities should give greater consideration to the quality of the goods and services to be procured, in addition to the price. It is also sensible for contracting authorities to attach greater weight to future life-cycle costs. In other words, it is no longer simply a matter of the cheapest offer, but rather the most economic offer over the entire life cycle. Greater consideration also needs to be given to environmental sustainability. These are the positive points. However, we in the ALDE Group feel there are some points that need revising. There are calls for the bureaucratic requirements on subcontractors to be increased. We see this as a major problem. We also want to have an open market worldwide that cannot be distorted by giving preference to domestic bidders. In return, we want other countries to open up their markets. We are also critical as regards award criteria introduced through bureaucracy; in other words, where certain local authorities are allowed to introduce their own criteria. It is in the interests of the market as a whole to prevent this. Michael Theurer,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, President Barroso has already highlighted the significance of small and medium-sized enterprises: 99% of all enterprises in Europe employ fewer than 250 people. Small and medium-sized enterprises are thus the backbone of employment and training. With the Small Business Act, the European Union began an initiative to improve national and European legislation for small and medium-sized enterprises. It was in this context that the test of the impact of legislation on small and medium-sized enterprises was introduced. Now, however, a study by the European Parliament has shown significant variation in the way that this SME test is being implemented in the individual Member States, and that in some cases, it is being implemented badly. Only five Member States have made this SME text a binding requirement. Fourteen Member States apply it half-heartedly, irregularly and with varying quality, while eight Member States practically do not carry out the test at all. That is why we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have tabled this question and are calling for the Commission to start an initiative to make this impact assessment a genuinely binding requirement in the Member States. We want the costs of administration and red tape to be quantified, in order to work towards reducing these. Small and medium-sized enterprises need to be saved from national and European legislation that burdens them with more and more additional costs for bureaucracy and administration. We are in favour of implementation being made very flexible, so that the Member States have room to manoeuvre. However, the aim must be for the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises to be taken into consideration as part of an integrated approach to law making. We also want the Commission to set an example by being the driving force behind this SME-friendly implementation of legislation. We in the European Union should take the lead in making laws that are genuinely capable of being implemented by small and medium-sized enterprises in practice. Michael Theurer,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at a late hour this evening, we are debating a subject that is of absolutely crucial importance for us. In any case, 37% of the EU budget goes on cohesion policy. Let us take a closer look – today, in the middle of the period, in 2011 – at how much in the way of resources has actually been taken from the Structural and Cohesion Funds so far. We can see that, unfortunately, in many Member States, the absorption rate and absorption capacity are well below what should actually have been paid out already by this stage. We have new Members States, such as Bulgaria and Romania, which have a poor absorption rate, but it is not only the new Member States; there are also Member States that have been in the Union for a long time, with regions such as Calabria and Sicily in the founder State of Italy, that with a rate of 7% – if we are to believe the budgetary controllers in the Committee on Budgetary Control – are well behind. This raises the question: why are these regions unable to spend the financial resources that we make available? There is Greece, too. Here in Parliament we have been highlighting where action is needed for months and have been pointing out that a country like Greece is not absorbing these resources, and we are pleased that the Commission, which to start with did not attach the necessary importance to this matter, has now given it high priority. With regard to Greece in particular, President Barroso has pointed out that, out of 20 billion, 15 billion has not been spent, and Commissioner Hahn has also just been there. We have considered what we can do to help these regions. The first thing to consider, as always, is the subject of cofinancing. The fact is that the regions are finding it difficult, in this global economic crisis, to finance their own share and Member States like Greece, which appear to be on the brink of insolvency, are also finding it difficult to finance their own share. There is no question that help must be provided here. However, it is clearly not just a matter of cofinancing, because there are also regions in Greece that really do not want an increase in European Union subsidies, are happy with the current rate of 80% and would rather implement more projects. Thus, it is not just a question of cofinancing; there are many different reasons. The procedures are too complex and need to be simplified as a matter of urgency. There is also the problem that, in many Member States, the central administrations of the governments in the capital cities take too long and the regions and regional authorities at local level have insufficient decision-making options in order to use the resources. Take Romania, for example, where the local authorities take 20 to 30 days to process applications, the regional authorities take around 60 days, but the central government takes 260 days. All of this provides an argument for delegating responsibility from the top down and introducing a strong local self-administration. Where are the Council, the Council Presidency and Mr van Rompuy this evening, in fact? He has taken the floor with regard to other matters. We are talking about 37% of the EU budget here. The EU is putting off payment obligations of EUR 250 billion. How are they to be fulfilled? The President-in-Office of the Council from Poland could have attempted to answer this, as Poland, of course, has shown how the absorption rate can be increased. There are also examples of good governance. Poland has managed it – its absorption capacities have increased – but so has Estonia. As Parliament, we are of the opinion that the Member States are now called on to ensure, as a matter of urgency, that the resources that we as Parliament have made available for the citizens in the regions are actually spent, also in the interests of increasing competitiveness and stabilisation of jobs and employment. In this regard, we expect the Commission to push forward with the method adopted and to very strongly urge the Member States to bring this matter to a positive conclusion. Michael Theurer,

 Madam President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased that, at my initiative, this oral question has received so much support here in Parliament and that it is being answered so promptly by the Commission. Thank you very much, Mr Tajani, for your response. As you know, because of globalisation, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are facing increasing competition from other countries, including from emerging economies outside the European Union. This involves major challenges, but also significant opportunities. In order to remain competitive, to secure growth and to support the sustainability of our companies, SMEs must take part in international activities. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is convinced of this. This concerns imports and exports, foreign direct investment and, of course, also acting as or using foreign subcontractors. However, only a small proportion of European SMEs are doing business with third countries. A total of 99% of the companies in the European Union are SMEs. However, only 29% of the SMEs in the EU import products, of which 50% import from countries outside the internal market. Only 25% of the SMEs in the EU are involved in exports, of which 50% export to countries outside the internal market. This means that our SMEs are not yet fully integrated into the global market. There are still opportunities to be exploited in this area and we now need to consider how we can encourage SMEs to do more business outside Europe. Not many SMEs are familiar with the public support programmes, such as the Enterprise Europe Network, or with information resources, such as the Market Access Database and the Export Helpdesk. There are also similar programmes available at a national and regional level. We need to know what concrete measures the Commission is planning in order to ensure that SMEs are better informed about the available tools and programmes. We would also like to know what the Commission intends to do to make the confusing subsidy system more transparent and clearer for SMEs. Following the decision made by the Court of Justice of the European Union on 10 December 2009, the Commission intends to include product-specific list rules in the implementing regulations for the Modernised Customs Code, in other words, to make these rules legally binding. The intention is to replace the current regulation, which has proved its worth over several decades and which specifies that the origin of a product is based on its last substantial processing or working, by countless product-specific origin rules for products imported into the EU. We are concerned that this will lead to an increase in red tape and, most importantly, will put SMEs at a disadvantage. We believe that this is not in line with the Small Business Act for Europe. Therefore, we are calling for a simplified form of this system which is beneficial for SMEs. How does the Commission intend to ensure that safety-related adaptations and changes to the Modernised Customs Code do not conflict with the existing simplified procedure and lead to competitive disadvantages? This is all about the position of SMEs on the world market, which will ensure their continued existence and allow them to safeguard jobs here in the European Union. Michael Theurer  (ALDE
).

 Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bütikofer, for a very good report. Commissioner Tajani, you have given a very clear signal this evening, which gives us hope. After all, we were disappointed with the presentation of the Commission’s strategy in the beginning. However, the raw materials strategy is a vital ingredient for business, employment and jobs here in the European Union. That is why a coherent strategy is essential. It goes without saying that we need the three pillars: security for our sources of raw materials, a recycling strategy, including greater efficiencies, as well as a joint approach so that partnerships can be established with the main raw materials suppliers of this world. The amendments tabled by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe focus on the idea that we should include more members of the scientific community in this strategy because there are many modern techniques for using raw materials found on the sea bed in the world’s oceans that still need to be researched and developed. This is precisely where Europeans have something to offer raw materials suppliers in developing countries and emerging economies as part of a common raw materials strategy. As liberals we believe it is important to remember that small and medium-sized enterprises require our particular help. Big business can secure raw materials for itself, while small and medium-sized enterprises need a joint strategy. Hence our call on you: let us work together to unite the Member States under the umbrella of the EU and establish long-term partnerships with the countries with the raw materials. The aim of the raw materials strategy must be to bring economic policy, environmental policy and international trade, together with development policy, under one roof. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mr Oettinger, ladies and gentlemen, even 25 years down the road, Chernobyl continues to be a cause for concern. Fukushima will also be a source of anxiety for years to come. The debate surrounding these major accidents is a sign that nuclear technology has inherent risks that it may not be possible to control. This is leading to a rethink in energy policy. However, it is also evident that unilateral action by individual countries is a mistake. We need international strategies, or at least EU-wide strategies when it comes to safety. That is why I fully support the Commissioner for Energy, who has made a number of important proposals in this direction. I would call on everyone here to work together to produce common principles so that the existing nuclear reactors really are safe, so that power failures are not allowed to happen and so that earthquake safety and other risks can be better estimated. We should then take a pro-active approach in bringing these principles to the attention of the international bodies. Michael Theurer,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Baltic Sea strategy set the ball rolling, the Danube strategy that we have debated this year in Parliament was the second step and now it is the turn of the Atlantic region. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in Parliament supports this macro-regional approach and was actively involved in this resolution. What we are concerned with here are improvements to the protection of the seas and the environment, and naturally also maritime affairs and fisheries – but it goes beyond this into lots of other areas, and three pillars in particular. The first of these is cooperation between Member States, so that synergies can be better exploited. Secondly, the Atlantic links the EU Member States and regions bordering the Atlantic with transatlantic partners such as Canada and the US and with other neighbouring countries such as Norway and Iceland. Thirdly, it is also concerned with bringing about closer links between stakeholders in the regions. We should emphasise the aspect of bringing together and networking towns and communities, regions, Member States and, above all, citizens, civil society and businesses, so that these actors can bring this framework – that is, the macro-regional strategy – to life. After all, the intention is not to create new institutions or new bodies; the idea is to have an effect using existing funding. The resources that exist are bound to contain unexploited synergies and opportunities that can be used as a basis for our activities. It is precisely because of this that the ALDE Group considers this strategy to be urgently needed, because it affects international trade. Goods from all over the world come across the Atlantic into the European Union. Naturally, this trade must take place in an ecologically sustainable way. Moreover, there are likely to be large reserves of raw materials in the Atlantic that we may be able to utilise, provided there is sustainable protection for the environment. We call on the Commission to draw up and submit a strategy for this area as soon as possible. Michael Theurer,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are currently witnessing a historic situation, because the Free Trade Agreement with South Korea that we are debating and that we intend to adopt is the first Free Trade Agreement that has been debated under the new Lisbon system, which grants Parliament full power of codecision. This makes an important area of policy – trade policy – more democratic. We, as Parliament, consider this to be important. The debate here in Parliament has also shown that, as regards safeguard clauses, we were able to include important concerns expressed to us by workers, companies and associations in an improved safeguard clause that is intended to protect the interests of industry and, above all, jobs in the future by creating a level playing field and fair conditions for competition and avoiding asymmetries. That is what we as the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have concentrated on. As shadow rapporteur for our group, I am pleased that we were able to be successful in this regard. The duty drawback mechanism, which caused us concern to start with, has now been explicitly included in the safeguard clause and there is the option for industry, and also for Parliament, to call on the Commission to carry out an investigation. A monitoring process is planned, which is intended to be established in a transparent way via an online platform, and there is greater scope for the investigation of the factors that will decide whether significant damage has been done to European industry. Mechanisms for monitoring to be carried out by the Commission, particularly for sensitive sectors in the event of increased imports, are also provided for. We can start with this and focus on the advantages associated with the South Korea agreement, such as the considerable reduction in duties – the Commission expects enterprises in Europe to be able to save EUR 1.6 billion. I would therefore like to thank Commissioner De Gucht, who has personally worked hard to enable us to reach a compromise, including with the Council. I would also like to thank the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, especially Mr Sturdy and Mr Zalba Bidegain, for their excellent work. We have achieved something really good here. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn, ladies and gentlemen, we must preserve the world’s oceans as an ecosystem. However, the oceans and the concept of globalisation are not mutually exclusive. Shipping routes are essential to our prosperity, because they are the arteries of world trade. There is a lot to be done in this context in order to ensure that we protect the environment and that our transport routes are secure. In future, we will also have to secure our supply of raw materials. Scientists are predicting that valuable raw materials can be found on the sea bed and in the sea itself. The important consideration is to extract them in an environmentally friendly way. The third aspect I would like to look at is the link between the oceans and inland waterways. I believe it is important to establish a connection with inland waterway transport. The development of the Danube plays a major role in this respect. As the longest river in the EU, in combination with the Rhine-Main-Danube canal, it can link the Black Sea with the North Sea. We should be creating a connection between integrated maritime policy and inland waterways. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, my fellow Members have explained that it is an urgent human rights issue that the import of these products into the European Union should be halted. I am also of the opinion that, in the context of such inhuman conditions, the question arises as to whether these products are being sold at dumping prices. I believe that we should look at the need for anti-dumping measures. In addition, we in the EU should make it quite clear that, irrespective of the commercial issues involved, the conditions in these labour camps are unacceptable to us. Naturally we should concern ourselves not just with the products themselves, but with improving conditions for the people interned in these camps who have no recourse to the principles of the rule of law. We should once again make this very clear to the People’s Republic of China. Michael Theurer,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I would like to thank Commissioner De Gucht as well as the rapporteur, Mr Zalba, for their positive cooperation in connection with the Free Trade Agreement with South Korea and the safeguard clauses. I would first like to emphasise that we Liberals and Democrats here in the European Parliament would like to see the agreement ratified and adopted as soon as possible, because we are in favour of free trade and because we see an agreement with South Korea as providing great opportunities for both the economy of the European Union and that of South Korea. Where the safeguard clauses are concerned, however, we need to take the concerns raised with us by European industry very seriously. We believe that the safeguard clauses represent an instrument that is capable of taking account of these concerns. We hope that the vote this week will send a signal that the political forces in Parliament are united and that these safeguard clauses will result in a well-functioning agreement being concluded here. We therefore call on the Council and the Commission to move towards us on the important outstanding issues. Above all, we do not want to see the duty drawback system being abused. We cannot allow duty drawback to provide an open door via South Korea for cheap products, particularly cheap primary products from China and other Asian countries. Moreover, we want the South Koreans to dismantle their non-tariff barriers to trade – such as the CO2
 regulations for cars – so that we do not have new barriers to trade coming in through the back door. We want social and environmental standards to be upheld. Naturally, the matter of comitology must also be settled; that is, for the later application of the agreement. Here, we want to see a strong role for Parliament. We also want industry itself and the Member States to be able to initiate such investigations and monitoring in future. One last point is a cause for concern: in the coming days, the Council will debate the provisional application of the agreement and possibly also vote on this. I must sound a note of warning here that, under the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament must give its consent. Provisional application would be contrary to the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon. I therefore call on the Council not to approve provisional application of the agreement, but to wait for Parliament to make its decision. We have done everything in our power to make a timely decision possible, and we should demonstrate this again by showing a united front in the vote. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

I support the action of the European Union in reorganising the current remuneration policy to provide long-term success and more accountability for decision makers. However, this must not lead to a situation in which policy determines salaries. This should remain the task of the authorities which are already in place, such as the board of governors and the general meeting of the banks. The proposed remuneration policy must therefore not replace existing structures but, at most, complement them where necessary, insofar as this is beneficial to the quality of economic decisions.

 It is certainly important to tighten the regulations on internships. The representatives of the German Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament have supported this. Young people often work for months on end without payment, hoping that they might still get a permanent job afterwards. This is an unsustainable situation. Internships should not destroy jobs. However, today’s plenary vote is going to pave the way in the future for a complete ban on unpaid internships. We believe that this gives a wrong message. It should still be possible to do a three-month unpaid internship, for example. There are numerous non profit-making or social organisations where a young person can acquire exciting, interesting experiences. However, such organisations are often unable to pay any remuneration for the internship. The key factor should be the duration of an internship. In the case of any internship lasting longer than six months, the employer can rely on productive output from the intern. From then on, remuneration should also be paid. The decision made today is impracticable and goes too far. We therefore do not support this part of the resolution.

 Combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography is vitally important. We must use all our strength to combat the availability of child pornography in communications networks. The permanent and effective control of child abuse is both a political responsibility and a precept of the rule of law. The German Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament is of the opinion that it is necessary to remove such criminal content as quickly as possible. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the current debate on a functioning system of European economic governance, the long-term perspective is being neglected, in my opinion. Now is the right time to incorporate the short-term stabilisation measures into a long-term strategy. We need a vision of a market economy. The fundamental principle of the social market economy is already laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon. We must now bring it to life. The social market economy was the successful model behind Germany’s economic miracle. Walter Eugen, the guiding light of the economic miracle, remarked as early as 1950 that the economic activity of the state should focus on designing the regulatory systems for the economy and not on managing the economic processes. Therefore, I am calling for a regulatory approach, in other words, measures taken by the state to influence the basic conditions of economic activity by means of general legislation. It is not the state which creates jobs, but it must create a regulatory framework for job creation and this is what we need to focus on. Competitiveness is not the start but the result of economic activity. Michael Theurer  (ALDE
).

 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, as we have heard, the financial markets need to be packaged in a new regulatory framework so that in future, we can avoid the excesses that have led to the crisis. However, if we highlight the underlying causes of the indebtedness of governments, then it becomes clear that, here in Parliament, we talk too much about public debt and too little about how we can achieve prosperity and growth. What determines our growth? Our growth and prosperity depend on people in the European Union developing products and generating new ideas that can also be sold on the global market. It is therefore right that one chapter in the EU 2020 strategy is Innovation Union. We need to focus on inventions and on how we can reinforce research and development. With that, it is important that we enhance the synergies of research funding and regional development policy. A great deal more could be done in those areas. Together with the Liberals and the German Free Democratic Party (FDP), I would argue that we focus on small and medium-sized enterprises. We should see to it that we, as the EU, spend our funding so that SMEs really get access to that funding and so that there is a technology transfer between universities and colleges and SMEs. We should encourage people to take their destinies into their own hands through personal responsibility and self-initiative. Governments cannot create jobs; they need to be created in the economy itself. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Takkula has just said, cyanide technology is a common method in mining. However, as we have heard, it is highly dangerous. The disaster that Mrs Băsescu just mentioned contaminated the Danube at the time and shocked us all, and you know that I campaign strongly for the Danube region. For that reason, as a trade politician, I wonder what can we do about it? In the European Union, we only have limited gold mining capacities. The goal is to make a difference worldwide with technical innovations. Here, there is high technology, I know. In Germany environmental technologies were developed that will help to avoid cyanide in the future. We must make these European high technologies commercially viable and we must make them affordable. I see great potential for trade in this. We should not confine ourselves to the European Union, but ensure that here, we also achieve a breakthrough in international trade, in the interests of the environment and our economy.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate about the euro, the debate about Greece, has defined recent days. I would like to draw your attention, at this point, to what strikes me as a disturbing piece of news, namely that 40% of Germans now believe that the introduction of the euro was a mistake. We have to be disturbed by that, because the introduction of a Community currency is not a one-way street. Europe’s integration process is not irreversible. I believe that we must keep the promise that we gave the German people when they gave up their national currency, namely, that the euro would be just as stable as the German mark. I am also firmly convinced that we in Europe need a discussion about the social market economy, about the regulatory framework. We should not be talking about how we are making Germany less competitive. Instead, we should be discussing how we can make the whole of Europe competitive so that we can be successful on global markets. That is what our aim must be; that is why I am calling for a debate on the social market economy in Europe. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

 The European Commission’s negotiations relating to the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) have raised a few questions. Although the agreement deals with justified concerns, namely combating the counterfeiting and smuggling of products and brands, it needs to be more firmly based on our European principles. It must not lead to the harmonisation of copyright law, patent law or trade mark law in the EU – on the contrary, the principle of subsidiarity must remain our most important principle. Trade agreements must not be misused in order to curtail the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals. Before Parliament can give the approval that is required for the ratification of this agreement, significant improvements still need to be made, and not only in terms of content. Parliament must be involved to a greater degree in the negotiations and the negotiation documents must be made available to us in full. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

 Mr President, the Goldstone report describes human rights violations by both sides. Over 1 400 victims in the Gaza Strip are obviously too many. However, I am also certain that, without the rocket attacks on Israel, there would have been no military response. During a visit to the country by the Delegation to Israel, we discovered that Israel does not take military action lightly. The main accusation of the Goldstone report, that Israel deliberately and continually attacked civilians, does not hold water. The question of the extent to which Hamas used civilians as shields has not been adequately investigated. However, the report mentions that the Israeli army provided warnings by means of telephone calls and flyers. Hamas did nothing like this in connection with the rocket attacks on Israel. However, we also need to ask whether the UN itself did enough in Gaza, for example, to prevent the Hamas rockets being fired in the vicinity of UN facilities. I do not believe that the Goldstone report is a basis for further terrorist attacks on Israel – it does not justify that. It perhaps does not help any further, either. However, it is clear that, here in the European Parliament, we must demand respect for human rights and call on both sides to return to the peace process. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

Madam President, Commissioner, firstly I would like to congratulate you on your appointment as commissioner. We are pleased to see such an astute and successful politician and a well-known Liberal on the Commission. You will need all your powers of persuasion to bring a new impetus to international trade policy in the EU. We must fight against any protectionist tendencies. History clearly shows that countries which have taken part in world trade have enjoyed better growth than those which did not. We are also facing a new world order. Some of the players involved, for example, China, have State capitalist systems, but may be using quite different methods in this arena. Therefore, I call on the Commission to develop a new strategy for world trade. It is clear that we must move forward with the Doha development round, because a multilateral approach is the right one. However, we will need all our efforts to make progress in relation to China. Michael Theurer,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon is opening a new chapter in the cooperation between the Commission, the Council and Parliament. The right of codecision of the European Parliament that has been directly elected by the citizens of Europe gives us the opportunity to bring democracy back into decisions on trade policy. This is the right thing to do, because it will have consequences for employees and consumers in the Member States. Free and fair trade forms the basis for Europe’s prosperity. We must therefore firmly oppose any protectionist tendencies. Free trade agreements like this one with South Korea can make an important contribution to stimulating world trade, growth and employment. However, it is in the nature of agreements of this kind, that, depending on their specific structure, they bring more benefits for some sectors of industry than for others. It is our job in Parliament to weigh up carefully the impact on different industries and sectors within the EU. In order to do this, we need the relevant data and impact assessments and it is the Commission’s task to provide them. However, despite many requests from the committee and in the plenary session, we have not yet received data which we believe to be satisfactory. This is the reason why the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has joined with other groups to ask this question. According to the information that we have received so far, the agreement offers opportunities for the service, mechanical engineering and plant construction, chemical and agricultural industries in the European economy. However, the concern is that the agreement will have a negative impact on the car industry and the textile and electronics sectors. The free trade agreement with South Korea is the only agreement with a developed country which does not include a ban on duty drawbacks. This may lead to one-sided cost benefits for South Korean industry. As the Commission has assured us on several occasions, the provisions on the duty drawback include a safeguard clause, which allows for a waiver on the basis of certain criteria. However, we urgently need to clarify this in the interests of the companies involved. The system must be applicable in practice. It must not be the case that the safeguard clauses are worthless because the companies cannot provide the necessary proof. As the agreement seems to contain one-sided regulations and as it sets a precedent for future agreements, for example, with India or with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, we feel that the specific wording of the safeguard clauses, the procedure for settling disputes and the other regulations relating to the application of the agreement are of central importance. We are therefore calling on the Commission to submit the free trade agreement together with the provisions on its application to Parliament for approval. We want a decision quickly. For this reason, a provisional version of the agreement must not be allowed to come into force. I know from discussions with companies what an important impact the implementation has. Therefore, my question to the Commission is as follows: Will the development of the European External Action Service lead to it playing a stronger role in trade policy? In our opinion, at least, this should be included. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against tax fraud is a necessity. Of course, tax evasion and tax fraud are not the causes of the economic and financial crisis. It seems important to me to make it clear once again in this House that we must regain the confidence of the taxpayer through simple tax systems and through low and fair taxes. However, that is not to say that we should not actively fight tax evasion and tax fraud, because any tax evasion undermines our sense of justice. That also brings us to the subject of tax havens. Germany’s neighbour, Switzerland, has voiced concerns that it is being placed under pressure. On this point, I would like to ask the Commission specifically: are proposals being made, or rather, are measures being taken to place Switzerland under particular pressure? My personal view is that Switzerland cannot afford to treat the EU any less well than the USA. Therefore, that means that Switzerland must actually join in our concerted efforts to fight tax evasion.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the importance of the Danube Region is evident by the very fact that 80 million people in six EU Member States and in four neighbouring countries live along the Danube. In the Black Forest – 100 km away as the crow flies – the Danube begins and then flows down to the delta and into the Black Sea. Therefore, we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe support the call for a Danube Strategy and, as the European Parliament, we are also making an important point this evening by having the subject of the Danube Strategy on the agenda. Twenty years after the collapse of the Iron Curtain, after putting an end to the division of Europe, the Danube is once again a symbol of unification. From a founder member of the EU, Germany, via Austria, which joined in 1995, through to the new Member States in Central and Eastern Europe that joined in 2004, the Danube also connects neighbouring countries like the accession country Croatia as well as other neighbouring countries that have aspirations for accession. It is therefore almost possible to see the reunification of Europe along the Danube. Ladies and gentlemen – and this is something to which the ALDE Group attaches a great deal of importance – we now need to take the appropriate measures to also make the Danube Strategy a regional policy priority in the new funding period. There are many ways to go about this. One option is for small and medium-sized enterprises to conclude more mutual partnerships. There are, of course, other major tasks in the area of infrastructure. This is particularly important to the ALDE Group because, as a result of the division of Europe, the historical transport links were broken and have not been modernised. Therefore, the development of the Danube as an inland waterway, the modernisation and improvement of its ports, locks and passability will provide an environmentally sound method of transport. However, work still needs to be done on the road and rail network. It is also particularly important that we involve the municipalities, towns, districts and the citizens in this.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, funding for the regions and structural funding form part of our practical economic policy and make Europe widely visible. In local authority areas, towns and municipalities in the regions, different players are working closely together. For this reason, we must retain this integrated approach for the entire European Union. I call on the Commission to focus much more closely on small and medium-sized enterprises and to involve the local authority areas, the towns and the municipalities much more in the future cohesion policy. We will definitely need to invest in the infrastructure in future, but most importantly, we must ensure that innovation and technology transfer are guaranteed for small and medium-sized enterprises. In future, we should also enable jobs to be subsidised. These are the crucial issues in choosing a new direction for the structural and cohesion policy in the European Union. Michael Theurer,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, two weeks ago, the Seventh Session of the World Trade Organisation Ministerial Conference was held in Geneva. I had the opportunity, as the representative of the delegation of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, to attend the conference and, as co-author, to contribute to the present joint motion for a resolution. There are four lessons that can and need to be learned from these experiences. The economic and financial crisis also brought a sharp fall in world trade. A speedy conclusion to the negotiations in the Doha Round is therefore crucial in order to give new impetus to the world economy. The revival of fair and free world trade is something that Doha can, and indeed must, achieve. The European Union has gone a long way to accommodate its partners, in particular those in the developing countries. For example, we have promised to abolish all export subsidies for agricultural products. Now we need to bring the negotiations to a conclusion. For this to happen, we need a signal of political will. In the ALDE Group, we are determined to achieve a conclusion to Doha. Now! It is therefore vital to join forces in order to bring the Round to a conclusion. The European Union can and must play a leading role in this. We should also take on a bridging role, for example, to bring together the United States and the emerging economies and developing countries, just as we call for in our joint resolution. We must now also raise the public’s awareness. We need broader support from the citizens. We should emphasise the advantages of global trade, as free and fair world trade is good for all of us. I do not see any alternative to Doha. The alternative would be competition for bilateral agreements, which would put access for the weaker countries and the inclusion of human rights and environmental aims at risk. That must not happen. We therefore need a conclusion to the Doha Round now. Michael Theurer  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have drawn up a major resolution which covers a number of themes. However, one important point – trade – is only touched on briefly. I believe that international trade is a decisive factor. The fall in world trade is one of the causes of the economic and financial crisis and I would like to see a greater focus on world trade, even now in the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC). It is not the case that the US and the European Union agree on every area. On the contrary, we have only a few trade agreements, there is a risk of bilateralism and there is the possibility that the Doha Development Round will not be continued by the US. Therefore, we should address the critical points and I hope that the TEC will introduce some new stimuli to revive international trade. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

 Mr President, I would like to congratulate you warmly on your speech. The process of bringing an end to the division of Europe was the result, on the one hand, of the desire for freedom among Central and Eastern European countries and, on the other, of course, of the attractiveness of Europe as an economic model. I believe that we have too little confidence, too little confidence in the future. If we cannot achieve this in Europe, then who can? We should explain with greater conviction that we can work on resolving our problems with confidence. We have a great deal of potential and there are still opportunities for growth throughout the world. While there are still people in the world who need goods and services, there will still be opportunities for growth. We can make sure that in Europe, we have a slice of this cake and everyone involved will benefit. I would like to encourage all of us to have more confidence in Europe as a successful model and I would like to ask you to convey this idea in your speeches. Michael Theurer,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank you, Commissioner Ashton, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, for the information that you have given us this evening in the extraordinary committee meeting and here in plenary. Clearly, the free trade agreement with South Korea is close to being concluded. From a Liberal viewpoint, and particularly from the point of view of my own German Free Democratic Party, the objective of free and fair world trade is of great importance, particularly right now, as, in the course of the economic and financial crisis, we see tendencies towards protectionism, tendencies which must be resolutely countered in the interests of prosperity and jobs in the European Union. In this context, the question arises of what significance the Commission attaches to the free trade agreement with South Korea, as there has, for a long time, been a focus on progress in the Doha development round, without any agreement being reached so far. That is the reason behind my question, Commissioner Ashton: do you see concluding the free trade agreement with South Korea as a first step towards further bilateral free trade agreements, and does that, in your view, mean a move away from Doha? Or are such bilateral agreements merely a supplement to or expansion of the European Union’s free trade policy? As you know, furthermore, the clause on the refunding of duties is a cause of concern in a number of Member States and sectors of industry – in particular, in the car industry. This clause could lead to supporting business in low-cost countries such as India and China, thereby threatening European manufacturing. Can you see a way that these concerns on the part of a number of Member States in respect of such refunding of duties can still be addressed? Nadja Hirsch,

 Mr President, it is necessary to change the year, because we have already decided that 2015 should be the European Year of Development. Therefore I propose, together with the other shadows, the following oral amendment ‘supports the Commission in its plan to declare 2016 the European Year of Integration.’  So we have only changed the year.

 I abstained from today’s vote, as the report presents the internet as a source of dangers to children and young people in too one-sided a way. It also intends to protect them by taking measures whose effects on freedom of expression on the internet cannot be foreseen. Too little reference is made to the huge opportunities that the internet offers young people, in the areas of education and participation for example. I also consider effectively disempowering parents by means of an ‘educational alliance’ among families, schools and civil society to be a crucial point. Instead of creating an artificial safe area for children, we should make sure that children and young people are empowered to use the internet confidently and independently. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE

 In addition to supporting the ‘eight hours’ campaign, the alternative resolution also contains a call for a legislative proposal introducing a ban on cloning. On balance, I decided to support the alternative resolution, despite the call for a ban on cloning, as limiting the transport time for farmed animals to eight hours is something that takes absolute priority. For one thing, the European Parliament has supported a written declaration in this regard. In addition, more than 1 000 000 people throughout the EU have put their signature to the ‘eight hours’ campaign. It is therefore only logical that the demand of the majority in Parliament and one of the first citizens’ initiatives should be reflected in the EU Animal Welfare Strategy. Nadja Hirsch,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is actually absurd. With regard to this important subject of a resettlement programme, we have achieved agreement across all of the groups. Many of the Member States are already implementing resettlement programmes. In other words, there is broad consensus that this is necessary and, above all, that it is not only an urgent, but also a highly volatile situation – as demonstrated in particular by the current situation in Africa. Thus, it is actually absurd that, even though there is agreement from almost all sides, this can founder simply as a result of the technical implementation. It is the duty of both the European Parliament – we are aware of this and that is why we have tabled a proposal – and the Council to assume responsibility here and to push this matter forward. I have experienced the Polish Presidency to be very creative, also in connection with the asylum package. It has tabled new proposals. For that reason, I am really placing my hope in the fact that you will now see the opportunity and present us with a proposal that is workable for the Council, the Commission and for us as Parliament, and that now, as we are in any case all in agreement, we can finally also tackle the implementation and – as Mr Tavares also said – can finally bridge that period that costs some people their lives. That is something that we need to be aware of in relation to this matter. I do not mean to be dramatic here, but each additional day that it takes us can cost someone’s life. Nadja Hirsch,

Madam President, Commissioner, a good education policy is the best kind of employment policy. It is true that many highly qualified people are currently unemployed, but despite this, the people who have no education or few qualifications are also the ones who have little or no chance of finding a job, even when the economy recovers and the labour market takes off again. Therefore, it is precisely these people that we should be concerned about. It is our responsibility to ensure that these people have the chance of a new life. I would like to point out that 14.4% of pupils in the EU leave school early and this is an average, which means that in some places, the figure is much higher. What is happening to all these young people? They will have no opportunity in the foreseeable future, regardless of whether or not the economy is growing, to live an independent life or get a well-paid job. For this reason, we must invest in this area. I believe that, while it is a good thing for the European Parliament to call for this to happen, it is primarily the responsibility of the Member States. It is up to us to demonstrate which projects are already running successfully. At the moment, there is a model pilot project which involves looking after early school leavers and providing a youth guarantee. The project is attracting attention to this subject and giving it a high priority. This is a key issue on which we need to take action. In addition, there are, of course, all the people who already have a job. We must not forget that in many countries, the talk is of people retiring much later. My generation will probably retire at 70, if at all. This also means that it is not enough to train once for a job. We must invest in further education and make flexible and attractive training available within the European Union, so that people can continue their education alongside their family life. These are all factors that we need to take into account and I am confident that we will be successful and will take a step in the right direction. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE

Mr President, Mr Mleczko, it is not the case that we are starting from nothing. We should always remember that we in Europe have a good minimum standard in comparison with many other countries. Regardless of that, the Commission has submitted a new proposal. It is simply a result of the timing that the situation with regard to equality has changed. Therefore, the Commission proposal was a wise move, a step forward, which sent out a clear signal, but, at the same time, it was sufficiently moderate, at 18 weeks and 75%, that it would have been practicable. Unfortunately, I can only agree with the other speaker. Here in the European Parliament, a small majority put together a huge wish list. At the moment, it is sadly the case that we must either stick with this wish list or get nothing. I would like to make it quite clear to you that I would rather we took the new Commission proposal as our basis, so that we can at least move forward. Each individual country can then decide whether to add other provisions. Then it will be up to every individual Member State to raise its own standards even further. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE

 The German Free Democratic Party delegation in the European Parliament assumes that the inclusion of Romania and Bulgaria in the Schengen area will further improve freedom of movement within the EU. Now that both Member States have achieved positive evaluation results in all areas of the Schengen review, there should be no more obstacles to delay inclusion further. There is no denying that the technical securing of borders will not automatically make them impermeable as long as problems persist in combating corruption in the justice and policing system. Accordingly, this challenge also relates to Member States already in the Schengen area. For this reason, the German Free Democratic Party delegation believes that criteria such as the fight against corruption must receive greater attention when evaluating the Schengen mechanism, and any misdemeanours must be punished appropriately. Nadja Hirsch,

 Mr President, Commissioner, tomorrow, we will vote on the role of vocational education and training in the Europe 2020 strategy. In this connection, it is worth taking a brief look at the position we are starting from. We currently have a level of youth unemployment of 21%, in other words, almost double the normal average. We have an EU-wide school drop-out rate of over 14%. The participation of women in gainful employment is still very low. Many people with disabilities, as well as migrants, are without jobs. The goal of the Europe 2020 strategy is precisely to tap this potential in terms of workers and to bring them into the workplace so that the EU, too, can deal with globalisation. Thus, it is also our job to ensure that initial vocational education in particular is of high quality. The discussion began in connection with the Copenhagen process, followed by the Bruges Communiqué, and now it is up to us to see to what extent this area can also be incorporated into the Europe 2020 strategy. An absolutely key element is the fact that young people must have the opportunity, not only in their studies, but also in their vocational training, to undertake part of their training in another EU Member State. It is a key element because someone who has already worked in another Member State will also take the opportunity later on to regard the European labour market as his or her labour market, with all the opportunities that that offers. It is therefore an absolutely key aspect that we must pursue. The second major area is, of course, that of further training. On account of demographic change, people are having to work for longer and longer – or they can work for longer, but everyone has to take that decision for themselves. People are living until they are much older and will continue with their careers for much longer, and in order to be able to carry on in skilled work until they are older, they will also need to undertake further training. There is currently a very low level of participation in further training initiatives. Here, too, it must be ensured that the willingness of both employers and workers exists and increases when it comes to taking advantage of further training and continuing to gain education by means of lifelong learning. For this, of course, the options on offer also need to be flexible. We must take everyone into consideration. Further training must fit in with other elements of people’s lives and it must be possible to do it alongside work and family life. For that reason, we clearly need to create flexible opportunities in future. The area of universities has received a great deal of attention – in connection with the Bologna Process, for example – and a similar situation faces us in the area of vocational training, including with regard to mobility. We could almost say that no one has noticed this. Nevertheless, alongside the universities, the area of vocational education and training is particularly important and we therefore must not ignore it. For that reason, I would like at this point to thank my fellow Members from the other groups once again for their very committed cooperation. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE

Madam President, the borders have been removed for the first time in Germany and Austria and we finally have free movement for workers from the countries of Eastern Europe. On the one hand, borders are being torn down, while on the other you are trying to build barriers yet again. I find it impossible to accept that two Member States and two gentlemen looking to make a name for themselves have managed to bring the issue of the reintroduction of border controls back to the debating chamber. There is no going back on this matter and we cannot allow ourselves to be put under pressure by this single-issue discussion. The refugee problem cannot be automatically resolved by returning to a regime of border controls. Pardon me. These people have risked their lives in making their way to Europe and they will also succeed in bypassing border crossings. The only ones who stand to gain from the reintroduction of border controls would be the human traffickers because the refugees would have to find new ways to cross the borders, providing the human traffickers with a new source of income. I cannot accept the fact that we are seriously contemplating this matter and I would call on the Commission not to compromise here. Nadja Hirsch,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, Mrs Malmström, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs most sincerely. We had very many debates. In the end, we reached some very good compromises, even though we all know that it is not always quite so easy, of course. On behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, however, I would like to say that, in any case, we still have the goal of establishing a common, EU-wide asylum system by 2012. That also means that we must now make some real progress and also send a clear signal to the Council that we have not lost sight of this goal and that we are, of course, still prepared to enter into negotiations. That goes without saying. However, I also believe that we need to make it clear that, above all, we want a common asylum system. It is not acceptable, as has already been said, for it to be almost like a lottery depending on where an asylum seeker makes his application. It is not acceptable – and in this regard I am pleased that, at the last minute, we achieved success here – for every individual Member State to have its own national list of what constitutes a safe third country. Either a country is safe or it is not – and then it still must be examined in each individual case whether it can, in fact, be a safe third country for the particular person who has made an application or whether, in this individual situation, it is perhaps not possible to simply say that is the case as such. I am also convinced that, ultimately, the Member States will benefit from this, but so will the asylum seekers, who will have the chance, in future, to receive a ruling directly at the first instance in a fair and nevertheless rapid application procedure if this is implemented in the way that we envisage it. I believe this also to be a right; asylum is a right, not a favour. We must take an absolutely clear position on this and then also have a clear procedure. Above all, I welcome the fact that we have managed to further extend the rights of minors. I am in favour of that and so is the ALDE Group, and I will be pleased if we get a good result in this regard tomorrow. Nadja Hirsch,

 Mr President, the resettlement programme is something that we worked extremely intensively on, investing a lot of energy, across all group divides and allegiances. We were unanimous in wanting to send out a clear signal on this matter. We also made it our top priority simply because it is such an important issue: people’s lives are at stake. Nonetheless, the situation and ongoing developments in North Africa mean that we are called on once again to produce results in double-quick time. We have already lost one year. We have made the best use of the time available to provoke a civil and social debate because, in the final analysis, we also need the support of the Member States, regional authorities and the local population if such a programme is to become established in the new Member States, too. This discussion and the social consensus that has gradually resulted cannot be abandoned just because the Council and other key players are unable to agree and have reached an impasse. The issue is too important. We have instigated this debate and, true to our liberal credentials, our aim is to make this matter a genuine priority. I believe that we have agreement across all the groups in Parliament. We have signalled our position and now await a clear course to be set by the Council so that the issue will be placed on the agenda and that the other Member States that have so far not played an active role will now be encouraged to get involved. The feedback that we have received during our discussions indicates that these Member States are willing to come on board. For this reason, the main concern on the part of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe – although I believe I can speak for all the groups involved because the level of cooperation was really excellent – is that this matter should be given priority and the debate that we have engendered on a broad social level should be encouraged, rather than jeopardised by continuously the matter being continuously put on the long finger.

 Madam President, as the rapporteur for the opinion on the report on equality, I concentrated on the labour market. Unfortunately, the pay differential is still 17% and women are still not always represented in management and supervisory boards. There is an urgent need for action here. We can no longer afford to waste the potential of females in society, whatever their age. We have a good level of education and the state invests in these young women and mothers. We really do need to make progress here and demand that companies finally put their fine words into action. To this extent, I welcome the fact that companies really are taking a step in the direction of a voluntary quota. However, on the other side, any report on equality should not forget that men are also disadvantaged in some respects. In particular, boys are not always given the opportunity to develop in school. Deficits exist in the area of housework and childcare and men can become more active here, too. This is one task we should all adopt for ourselves. Each of us, whatever our gender, should be given an opportunity to find our niche and live our lives as we see fit. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mrs Malmström, we are talking today about the judgment passed by the European Court of Human Rights. This is ultimately about Belgium, but it concerns every Member State of the European Union. Germany has also decided no longer to send asylum seekers back to Greece. As one of my fellow Members has mentioned, we must ask ourselves whether we want to build walls around Europe or whether we want to maintain and develop the right to asylum, something which I, as a Liberal, strongly support. However, this also means that we must give every asylum seeker the chance of a properly organised process. We must realise that it is unfair and shows a lack of solidarity if we allow the southern countries to bear the entire burden alone. Because of their geographical position, these countries have been exposed to an increased influx of refugees. In Lampedusa, this is because of current events in Tunisia. However, this is also an ongoing situation which the local asylum authorities cannot cope with. The recent liberalisation with regard to Kosovo also resulted in a huge influx of asylum seekers into Germany just a few weeks ago. We also had the problem that we could not initially process all the applications properly. Therefore, if we really want to retain this right to asylum, we must restructure the system to ensure that it offers greater solidarity in future. Dublin II cannot continue in its current form.

 Madam President, Mrs Malmström, we were all pleased, as were the citizens of Europe, about the revolution in Egypt and Tunisia and the fact that values such as freedom and democracy were suddenly on the agenda. Images from these countries have dominated the news over the last few days. However, for two or three days, we have also been seeing pictures of the streams of refugees and people in boats on our television screens and in our newspapers. We must act quickly to ensure that we do not miss this historic moment and that it is not only the pictures of refugees which remain in our memories. We must remember what these countries have really achieved. We must explain to the public that although a lot of people are coming here, the majority of them will go back, because they have no right to asylum as we define it. Of course, we have to ask ourselves the question which is frequently posed about economic migrants. One thing is clear. If these young people have no future prospects, they will come back. Perhaps not the same people, but constant streams of new migrants. This is why we need to deal with this problem now. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE

 In overall terms, the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament supports the waste disposal directive. However, the subject of photovoltaic modules remains a problem. There is no understandable reason for excluding the entire sector from the regulations. We have a wide range of legislation governing waste streams. Therefore, it is not clear why a complete industry, which is expected to produce significant waste streams, is being exempted. For this reason, some of the FDP Members of the European Parliament have abstained from voting on the report. Nadja Hirsch,

 Mr President, we have agreed in the European Parliament that we want a common European asylum system to be in place by 2012. This also involves having the same or similar conditions in all the Member States. However, the implementation of the system has met with resistance and that is primarily due to the fact that during the discussions on the asylum package, we were given inadequate information, sometimes no information at all, or even conflicting information. We had very little data as the basis for the financial estimates relating to the Procedures Directive and the costs in the Member States. Our aim is to call on the Commission to provide Parliament with a study or with the necessary information. This concerns areas such as the interpreting service and also legal advice. It is not clear what effects this will actually have in the Member States. On the other hand, during the process of revising the Procedures Directive, it has become clear that we can produce a high quality, fast procedure which is of benefit to both sides, because it helps decisions to be made quickly so that the situation is clear to people and there is a low error rate. Our objective as liberals is to give the Commission our complete support for its plans. However, we need arguments, including in the discussions with the Member States, which will demonstrate the effects of the revision of this asylum package and, in particular, the Procedures Directive. For this reason, we are calling on the Commission to give us genuine support to ensure that this asylum package becomes reality by 2012, so that we can establish a common European asylum system.

 Madam President, Commissioner, as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I, too, would like to express my sincere thanks to the two rapporteurs. Thank you for your cooperation. I think we have put together a good document today. We can take a decision on something today that can really put paid to human trafficking. However, the challenge will be getting the Member States to put this directive into practice. It is crucial that the enforcement bodies, such as the police and the courts, are made aware of how to actually recognise and to prosecute this crime. This is vital, and it is also very important to raise public awareness – as Mrs Matera has already mentioned – so that people are aware of the fact that human trafficking is happening within the EU. It is not just happening somewhere else; theoretically, it could also be happening right outside my front door. Another important point that, as Liberals from Germany in particular, we had difficulty with – although this has now been resolved in a positive manner by empowering the Member States – is the criminalisation of people who make use of this sort of service, because if someone is liable to prosecution, he can refuse to make a statement in a subsequent trial. If someone makes use of this right to refuse to give evidence – for example, a man who had been with a prostitute who had been endangered through human trafficking – information will be lost that could be used further to finally uncover this network of human traffickers. It is therefore a good thing that this rests with the Member States, and I would like to thank you very much for your cooperation. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE

Madam President, the question that we must ask ourselves is what is this directive intended to achieve? There is relatively substantial agreement that there should be health protection for mothers-to-be and new mothers. The great debate concerns the areas in which the aspect of equality should also be included. On the other hand, as the European Parliament, we also need to be aware that we are adopting a directive that will be in force not just for five years, but perhaps for the next 20 or 25 years. However, I hope that by then, women’s working conditions will be substantially better and companies will be keen to employ young mothers – not least because of a shortage of skilled labour – and, above all, will also build up the appropriate infrastructure for this. We need to bear in mind this perspective too. Notwithstanding this, I also realise that at present, we do not have a majority that is prepared to adopt this perspective. In view of this, we will probably arrive at a point where we agree on a compromise such as eighteen weeks, a higher rate of statutory payments or the continued payment of 75% of salary, which will indeed bring about an improvement in some European countries in particular. A much more important point, and one which goes beyond the aspect of maternity leave, is the framework conditions surrounding young families. This means childcare facilities; in Germany, for example, there are still not enough of these. That would be a real equality policy that gives women a chance to go back to work. Nadja Hirsch,

 Mr President, I think it is right and proper for us to be championing the cause of a coordinated cohesion and regional policy. This is extremely important in order to deliver efficiency and to be able to use the money well, despite the limited amounts in question. I must warn, however, that the plan is to achieve this efficiency by applying one and the same set of rules to everyone. The funds are very varied, have very different target groups and different contents. With that in mind, coordination is very important but the same rules are not. That is exactly what we are experiencing with the European Social Fund at the moment, which is to say that it would be extremely well received by just those little communities, municipalities, if – just as the speaker before me said – for these small bodies on the ground, in particular, such an enormous amount of time and effort did not have to be spent in order to actually be able to access and use this money. That is exactly what we need though, as unemployment, poverty and socially excluded people are to be found in every Member State of the European Union, not just in certain regions, but in every Member State. With that in mind, I find it particularly important that the European Social Fund, in particular, should truly continue to be available to minorities, which, to an extent, also includes young people, but also the elderly and often people from an immigrant background, in future and actually, that it should be more available, in order to give these people the chance to enter the labour market, as that is precisely what we are aiming to achieve. The Europe 2020 strategy represents our attempt to achieve greater inclusion in the labour market for the different groups. I hope that that will not remain simply a goal; instead, we now have to genuinely provide the measures and the instruments to achieve it. The European Social Fund is a very effective tool in this regard. We just need to optimise it and, above all, make it useable. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE

 I cannot support the animal experiments directive in its current form. It is true that this version is more progressive that the old directive from 1986. However, in comparison with the huge scientific and technical advances made over the last 24 years, the measures for replacing animal testing seem very feeble. There are too many exceptions. In addition, the wording is weak and allows too much scope for interpretation and implementation. It is also absurd that Member States cannot put in place animal welfare measures which are stricter than those required by the EU. Market distortion is given as the justification for this. This sends the wrong message to the citizens of Europe, to the research community and to industry. On the one hand, the state must take into account the changes in citizens’ ethical awareness. On the other hand, more pressure must be exerted on the research sector and on industry. No one wants to put the status of Germany or Europe as a research location at risk, but investment costs are not a valid argument for postponing the further development and use of methods which do not involve laboratory animals.

 The German Free Democratic Party is fundamentally in favour of positive labelling (process labelling) of genetically modified organisms at a European level in order to ensure the necessary transparency for consumers. However, in this case, we were not able to vote in favour of the report, because it proposes unequal treatment for different sectors. It calls for labelling for foods of animal origin, but not for those of plant origin. Unfair labelling of this kind for products of animal origin could distort the market to the disadvantage of one side. This counteracts our efforts to ensure fair competition and is clearly in conflict with the principle of equality enshrined in our legal system.

 It is certainly important to tighten the regulations on internships. The representatives of the German Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament have supported this. Young people often work for months on end without payment, hoping that they might still get a permanent job afterwards. This is an unsustainable situation. Internships should not destroy jobs. However, today’s plenary vote is going to pave the way in the future for a complete ban on unpaid internships. We believe that this gives a wrong message. It should still be possible to do a three-month unpaid internship, for example. There are numerous non profit-making or social organisations where a young person can acquire exciting, interesting experiences. However, such organisations are often unable to pay any remuneration for the internship. The key factor should be the duration of an internship. In the case of any internship lasting longer than six months, the employer can rely on productive output from the intern. From then on, remuneration should also be paid. The decision made today is impracticable and goes too far. We therefore do not support this part of the resolution. Nadja Hirsch,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, what we all discussed on this subject was that we simply must convince more Member States to take part in this programme. I believe there is much to be achieved in this regard by explaining the programme and also highlighting its benefits, as those who take part have thus far always said that they will continue to do so and that they welcome the programme. It is very important to make clear which people this relates to. It relates to people who do not, themselves, have the power to come to Europe. These are women, children and the sick, who find themselves in refugee camps outside the EU and need our help. I think it is very positive that we will be deciding to make a larger proportion of the European Refugee Fund available in future. At the same time, I also believe that it is very important that this money, if it is paid to the national Parliaments, the nation states, in other words, must not just disappear into the budget, but it really must be used in order to build a durable structure, that the money, in fact, even has to be passed on to the local authorities and to the towns and cities where the integration actually takes place, where the nursery places and housing are provided. It is a very important point that the towns and cities and the local authorities, as our allies, must be involved in this discussion. The Member States are perhaps more inclined to reject this in the short term than the local authorities on the ground. In the predictability that this brings with it, I see an important element connecting us – the EU – and those on the ground bringing about the integration. All together, this could certainly give a boost to the resettlement programme, something that I think is very positive. Above all, there is one thing that needs to be stated very clearly, which is that the citizens cannot be left behind – people and associations must be found who ease the path of people who want to start a new life locally and who show them how their new town works or where the nearest swimming pool is. We need a cross-society consensus that we want to take part in a resettlement programme, that it is a good solution, and that people will actually bring about integration on the ground.

According to the resolution of the European Parliament on the draft general budget for the financial year 2010, adopted on 17 December 2009, a vote was taken today on the amending budget for the European Parliament, following the revised calculations made by the Parliamentary administration. The FDP in the European Parliament abstained, because there was a paragraph in the package of amendments concerned that we could not reconcile with our convictions. The FDP had already expressed its opposition to an increase in the secretarial allowance to EUR 1 500 during the discussions in committee. It is out of the secretarial allowance that MEPs’ assistants are paid. The FDP considers that the argument that more money is needed due to the additional work that MEPs have to do with the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is unsound, as there is nothing in past experience to support this. Certainly, due to the Treaty of Lisbon, which has just come into force, Parliament will overall need extra capacity for legislative work, but with the introduction of the Assistants’ Statute from the beginning of the current parliamentary term, there is still no proof that MEPs actually need more assistants. For this reason, there are grounds for concern that further demands and supplementary increases, or an extension of office capacity, will follow. For this reason, the FDP in the European Parliament abstained. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE

Madam President, firstly, congratulations to Mr Füle on his appointment as Commissioner. I would also like to congratulate Mr Swoboda, the rapporteur, on his report. It is a very balanced presentation of the progress made in Croatia. At the same time, it clearly indicates the areas where Croatia still has work to do in order to be able to complete the accession process. It is also significant that statistics taken from a Eurobarometer survey carried out in the autumn of last year show that 84% of Croats are dissatisfied with democracy in their country. This means that not only are reforms to the judiciary required, but also an improvement in the situation of minorities. It is also important to ensure that the freedom of the press is guaranteed. These reforms must be initiated and implemented and, above all, they must be supported by the population. In formal terms, the criteria can certainly be met very quickly, but the entire population must be behind the process and must welcome Croatia’s accession to the EU. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE

 Madam President, we have the European Year against Poverty and Exclusion. Women are still at a very high risk of becoming poor or having to live in poverty. There are many small steps which land them in that position: girls tend to choose jobs which do not pay so well. They then decide to have children, which often leads them to only be able to work part-time. Alternatively, they might decide to look after their parents or grandparents, which again puts older women in a situation where they are unable to return to work. These periods add up and, as a result, women’s professional careers progress much more slowly. This is also reflected in the fact that they have lower pensions, for example. There are many aspects to this, and many have been included in this report. The really important message we need to put across is that there are already many opportunities out there, but girls and women need to make use of them. The awareness that a girl is studying engineering, and that she is brave enough to do so – that is what we have to promote in schools. This also applies particularly to immigrant women. I would also like to make another point: if you look around the Chamber today, you will see that two thirds of us attending this debate are women and one third are men. We must also win men over to taking a much greater interest in this subject, so that, one day, we can have the two remaining thirds of men attending and supporting women’s issues. Nadja Hirsch,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her commitment and excellent cooperation, as this really is an important subject. As we have said already, human trafficking is perhaps the very worst form of crime. Europol’s figures, cited in the question, show that there has been no improvement in this field. The opposite is true, in fact. In the area of forced labour, specifically, the figures are going up, whilst the figures on the trafficking of women remain unchanged. It is thus absolutely clear that there is an urgent need, above all, for consistent action. In order for such action to succeed, it is necessary, first and foremost, to adopt an integrated approach in the most varied of areas. One absolutely essential element is to increase awareness – including amongst the population within Europe – that human trafficking takes place right in the middle of Europe, in every country. We need, above all, to get to work on education in this regard, as we did, for example, for the football World Cup in Germany, in order to bring the issue of forced prostitution to light, and to show that this really happens everywhere, and also to inspire debate amongst the populace so that there is an awareness there which will lead to the victims being helped. My second point concerns the protection of victims. Precisely when people are rescued from such a dramatic situation, the Member States, too, must ensure that there is medical and psychological care for them so that they are supported in going back to their countries of origin where appropriate or so that the way is opened to asylum or other similar possibilities here to find a new home and to begin a new life.

 The German Free Democratic Party members of the European Parliament have abstained from voting on the Copenhagen resolution for the following reasons. The resolution contains statements about financing for climate protection measures in third countries without defining the specific criteria or purpose of the financing. We cannot justify this to taxpayers. In addition, we believe that blanket criticism of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) is wrong. The ICAO is the organisation which deals with aviation matters at an international level. Both the criticism and the statement about the alleged failure of ICAO negotiations are incorrect and inappropriate. The call for specific arrangements for a CO2
 trading system for the aviation industry goes against current EU legislation and overburdens the EU’s negotiating position in an international climate agreement with unrealistic demands.President. −

Mr President, this is turning into groundhog day. Every seven years, we have renewed squabbling over money. As Jutta Haug has rightly said, the Member States bicker like children. Once again, we are becoming embroiled in discussions over whether there should be 5 % more or 5 % less for agricultural subsidies and essential investment in research and development, instead of talking about the priorities and where the European Union should be going in future. The fundamental problem is becoming increasingly obvious. Our Member States are all egotists. The question is always: ‘What can I get from the European budget?’, not ‘What can I contribute in terms of added value to this budget?’. Instead of shared European interests, the EU is dominated by 27 sets of national interests.  Unless we manage to formulate some shared interests for the European Union, we will set the course for its ultimate demise. That is something that no rational Member of this House could possibly want. The multiannual financial framework must be seen as an opportunity to define these European interests. President.

I voted in favour of this report because I believe that the discharge decision for the European Medicines Agency (EMA) cannot be based upon additional requirements, such as the guidelines of the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development), when the implementation of those requirements has not been officially requested by either the EU legislator or specific arrangements within the Agencies during the respective discharge procedure. The European institutions are therefore invited to examine whether it is advisable to incorporate and to commit to additional guidelines in a possible common framework for all European institutions and bodies. On the basis of the data available, I agree that discharge can be granted to the Executive Director of the European Medicines Agency in respect of the implementation of the EMA’s budget for the financial year 2010.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time we have met to discuss this issue, although it may be the first time that we have met at this hour. The question now arising, slowly but surely, is this: when will our debate about data retention finally be at an end? A great many Member States and their constitutional courts have decided that it is not compatible with national constitutions. The Irish High Court referred the matter to the European Court of Justice, and countless citizens in the Member States have not only expressed disquiet and incomprehension about data retention but reject it outright.  I hate to say it, but our assessment all those years ago, when this issue was first discussed in 2005, was correct. We have legal issues which are unresolved; we have economic issues relating to data retention which are unresolved; and we have technical issues which are unresolved. Above all, we have social issues which are unresolved. The Commission’s evaluation report clearly showed the extent to which the approach to data retention, procedures and use vary between the Member States. In some countries, for example, the coastguard can access dossiers of retained data; in others, authorities can make a verbal request. The evaluation report also showed that everything has been achieved, except for harmonisation on issues of data retention. The question whether it is needed at all is still unanswered. In that sense, the authors are rightly asking when we can expect a new initiative from the Commission. It is time to stop flogging a dead horse, which is what data retention is. I would hope that we will have the opportunity to discuss a reform before the end of this legislative term and, in particular, to hear the Commission’s proposals during this debate. I hope we will find out more this evening. I do not want to speak for too long, so let me finish by saying this: I am sure you will have noticed from my comments that we are all getting very tired of this issue. I personally would greatly welcome it if we could find a solution to this sorry state of affairs at European level and perhaps even deal with the issue in an objective manner. Alexander Alvaro,

Mr President, many thanks, Mr Voss, for your input, which is very interesting, especially as regards the role of the Justice Minister. Would you not say that it is the Justice Minister’s responsibility, if she sees that an item of legislation is incompatible with the law and, furthermore – as noted by the Irish High Court, which would not have referred the matter to the European Court of Justice otherwise – possibly incompatible with EU law as well, to suspend the legislation until the matter has been clarified, rather than transposing what is possibly bad law?

Madam President, Mr Lewandowski, the draft budget for 2013 includes funding of almost EUR 150 billion for commitments alone. These commitments are directly related to the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy and they have increased by 2.7% to EUR 64.5 billion in total. The figures under Heading 1, sustainable growth, in particular, have risen by 3.5%. The central programmes for growth and investment, small and medium-sized businesses, employment and young people and new initiatives, for example, the planned pilot phase for the project bond initiative in the fields of transport, energy and ICT, should help to resolve liquidity problems and, therefore, to promote investment and growth, which Europe currently needs more urgently than ever. The payments in the draft budget amount to a total of EUR 138 billion. In the last year of the current financial framework, the draft budget includes higher funding for payments than in 2012, in particular, in the Seventh Framework Programme, where the increase is around 28%, and in the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, where the increase amounts to about 12%. These correspond exactly with the estimated payment applications from the public and private partners, which are responsible for projects in these areas. The proposed increase of 6.8% in the total payment appropriations is the result and the inevitable consequence of the EU’s commitments under the terms of the Treaties to enable all the larger programmes to continue and to take into account the outstanding commitment appropriations from the current year and from previous years. This is conscientious and responsible budgeting. We are also setting priorities, such as the programme for supporting ICT policy, which will be concentrating in 2013 on increasing the spread of these technologies and ensuring that they are used as effectively as possible, in line with Europe’s digital agenda. Overall, this programme will support Europe and the draft budget is a positive approach which we will hopefully be able to adopt together with the Council. Incidentally, if you will allow me to, I would like to conclude by saying that we would have saved a significant amount of money if we had held this debate in Brussels and not in Strasbourg.

− I would be happy to oblige, Mr Pirker. Firstly, perhaps you will have noticed that I did not preside over this debate from the outset. Accordingly I regret that I did not realise that you did indeed have the discipline to be here from the start. The Rules of Procedure themselves state that if we have a five-minute ‘catch-the-eye’ procedure, then five speakers are permitted. It is basically a matter for the President to decide how to handle this. I do not know the eight colleagues from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) (PPE) who requested the floor. I actually made what I thought was the fairest choice. I chose a woman so that there would be a balanced representation of the genders, because the other groups were all represented by men. I am not sure if my answer will satisfy you, but I have to follow some rationale in making a choice. With eight members of the PPE Group requesting the floor, I freely admit that my choice was not based on who had been here for how long. As I was not presiding at the start of the debate, but only took over the chair at a later stage, I was not aware of this. I can assure you, however, that I will take this into consideration the next time, particularly in your case. If a Member has had the discipline to attend a debate from start to finish, then he should be given the opportunity to speak. I apologise that this was not the case this time.

Mr President, inevitably, we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe find it difficult to reach a decision on issues like this. For us, this is a matter to be pondered and we follow a rational path, weighing up the arguments rather than being swayed by dogma. We are the only group in this House to follow such practice. We are aware that legal certainty, legal clarity and the question of the clarity of the wording are decisively important, in other words what is contained in this agreement and what the decisive points will be for us. There are deficiencies with regard to the question of further usage and retention periods, as well as with regard to the area of application, which is open to interpretation. The wording is not clearly defined. As a group we are known for our attachment to freedom, specifically the freedom of the individual. Security is always the servant of freedom. It is never the other way round. Responsibility is an essential element in this context. It is our responsibility to protect and balance the interests of our citizens. In our view this agreement does not achieve that and I believe that our rejection makes it clear that we shall oppose this erosion of freedom and responsibility. President.

 Mr President, thank you, Mr Lewandowski, for the proposal you have submitted. It is not easy to present a budget when so many different interests are involved and Mr La Via has succeeded in highlighting the majority of Parliament’s priorities. In my opinion, there are three decisive aspects to the budget guidelines: the budget must be balanced, it must be sensible and it must be responsible. Mr Lamassoure has just referred to the fact that we have had two austerity budgets in a row. This is absolutely the right thing to do in this situation. During this period, the Member States have only been able to provide limited resources. At the same time, as the previous speaker rightly pointed out, we need to make investments. These are, of course, complementary measures. First of all, we need to create the necessary structures, which are based on a responsible approach to the use of taxpayers’ money, so that we can make investments. Otherwise, we will be throwing good money after bad and this cannot be in our interests. Therefore, I believe it is important that we remind ourselves of this in the guidelines from the parliamentary side. We played a significant role in ensuring that the Member States agreed on automatic sanctions after the summit on 1 and 2 March and this must now be put into practice. I would like to see the Commission and not the Council taking responsibility for this, because then we could be sure that it would be implemented. At the same time, however, we need to give the Member States support with regard to European added value. The issue of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) has been mentioned. They form the backbone of the European economy. It is not the large organisations and the multinationals that create jobs. It is the medium-sized companies which ensure that Europe’s engine for growth and employment continues to function. Therefore, we need to make targeted and sensible use of money. More funding does not necessarily mean better policies. Finally, I would like to express my full support for what Mr Lamassoure said about the need to resolve the problem of the outstanding commitments or reste à liquider
. Most importantly, as far as the budget is concerned – and it is a pity that the Member States are not represented – it would make sense for us to draw up a sensible budget right from the start, so that we do not find ourselves in a difficult situation because amending budgets are required.

 Mr President, since 14 of the 15 blue cards have unfortunately gone by the board, I would like to ask Mr López Aguilar whether he can explain to me why Mr Weber, who represents the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), supports law and order, but is not prepared at least to take the group in the direction of carrying out a serious legal test under Article 7(1) which would be a proper solution to the case. You are a former minister of justice and an experienced person. Perhaps you can explain to me why Mr Weber is not in favour of this. Alexander Alvaro  (ALDE

 – (DE) 
Madam President, Commissioner, good morning. It is good to see you in this last week of business in Strasbourg for this year. As Mr Fernandes has rightly said, 2007 was the year the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund was established, since which – it is unfortunate that my fellow Member from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is no longer listening – EUR 307 million has been distributed – out of a fund of EUR 2.5 billion. Money alone is not the solution when it comes to tackling economic crises and the consequences of globalisation. Structural reforms in the labour market, economic reforms, taxation reforms and social reforms are the elements that can be used to take control of globalisation. Do not be fooled into thinking that money is the horn of plenty that can be used to solve all problems in the long term. If we see the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund as a way to reward the conduct of companies like Nokia, which has moved from Bochum in Germany to Romania and, ultimately, out of the European Union, receiving monetary support on two occasions, that is the wrong approach, and we will certainly not allow that to happen. Mr Fernandes is quite right and I share his views on the prospect of the European Parliament becoming the field where national election campaigns are fought. I note what has happened in France. I also believe, however, that this is a matter for France and does not need to be discussed here. That is why my group will reject the oral amendment if tabled. There are still more than 40 Members of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in this House. This means that we can also reject this oral amendment. I would much prefer it if we were to sit down together and work out how we can integrate the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund intelligently into European budgetary policy within the parameters of the Multiannual Financial Framework, ensuring more growth and more jobs, rather than perpetuating unemployment with the money we have.

 Mr Rübig, I believe that these are precisely the kinds of proposals that we can build on. If we work together – for example with the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), although I am also certain that it would be possible to collaborate with the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance – to produce suggestions for how we can finance and support medium-sized enterprises, young entrepreneurs and start-ups, as well as encouraging quality in the existing business community, then I believe we will arrive at a common denominator, which is precisely the path we should take.

Blue-card answer.

 Madam President, actually this is the problem, and we in the Committee on Budgets have asked, in the reports dealing with EAGGF – especially through amendments – for evaluation mechanisms to be put in place, because we as a Parliament do not know exactly how many people have been reintegrated into work with the help of the European Globalisation Fund (maybe Commissioner Lewandowski knows). We know how many workers we have helped and how many redundant workers have been receiving money out of the Globalisation Fund, but we do not know how many have actually been reintegrated into work. Just to correct one thing: I did not say that companies are doing good; I said that the European Globalisation Fund is actually taking away the burden from enterprises to elaborate specific social plans. This is something which worries me probably as much as it does you. Alexander Alvaro  (ALDE

 Mr President, I am pleased that the Polish Presidency was able to conclude its term in office so successfully. When you receive more praise from all the groups for your Presidency than I, like Mr Schulz, have ever heard in the 15 presidencies that I have had the good fortune to experience, then it is clear that the ‘P’ in Poland stands for ‘professional’. We would like to thank you for the work that you have done in that area. Unfortunately, a lot of what you have achieved in your Presidency has been overshadowed by the general focus of attention on the euro crisis and the debt crisis in Europe. However, you did something very important that has not yet been mentioned. In the preparations for the multiannual financial framework of the European Union, your Presidency involved Parliament at a very early stage for the first time. I had the pleasure of leading a European Parliament delegation in Sopot. We in Parliament were involved in these discussions at an earlier stage than we have ever been before. That is important to us. We hope that the same thing will happen in future, too. In the areas of justice and home affairs, in which I have also been working for many years, you have achieved a significant amount of success in connection with combating child abuse as well as in other areas. I could say that you are concluding your Presidency with a results sheet of successful action that I would like to see followed in a similar way by other European states and companies. I would like to thank you, and I look forward to our continued cooperation in a different context in the Council. Alexander Alvaro  (ALDE

 Mr President, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Council Presidency, Mr Lewandowski and, in particular, the two rapporteurs who, together with the Chair of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Lamassoure, have done an excellent job. The tough negotiations that formed part of the conciliation procedure lasted for 17 hours and the European Parliament spent two hours of this in discussions with the Council. Perhaps it would be sensible next time around if the Council did not hold its negotiations during the conciliation procedure, but instead reached a common position first. That would make the job easier for all of us and would extend the Saturday morning slightly. Nevertheless, we have nominally agreed on a sensible budget. We have accommodated the Council’s requirements. At the Council’s request, the payments were limited to EUR 129 billion and the commitment appropriations were set at EUR 147 billion, which is what Parliament wanted. We should not be under any illusions, however. We are pushing a very dangerous avalanche along. The Council is prepared to finance the commitments that have been entered into by means of supplementary budgets, but I would prefer a commitment to establishing a budget from the beginning with a clear financial basis, so that we do not need constant amending budgets. This simply postpones the problem. Another problem that has emerged is the fact that the European Union needs more investment in research and development. Everyone, including the Member States, clearly supports this. However, this will not work with a capped budget, unless we are prepared to abandon our dogmatic approach to preserving the status quo and our subsidy mindset. If we do not restructure the budget in favour of research and development and the Europe 2020 strategy, we will not be able to meet these priorities. At the same time, we have also shown that, at a time when citizens have to tighten their belts, the European Parliament can do the same. I would like to thank Mr Fernandes in particular, who has made an excellent job of initiating this process. We have achieved a good result and we will be able to vote in favour of this budget. However, we still have to discuss whether this is the right approach in the long term. Alexander Alvaro  (ALDE

 The representatives of the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament will only vote in favour of the Hübner report on amending COM(2011)0482
 on condition that, when raising the applicable cofinancing rates by ten percentage points, there is an exception for those Member States explicitly affected. This exception must not be able to act as a precedent in any way and should be revoked in respect of the Member States in question once the severe financial and economic crisis and its liquidity squeezes have been overcome. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Mr President, I would like to recall that about three years ago Franziska Brantner and I set up what we called ‘Friends of the European External Action Service’, a temporary platform where academics, NGOs and future diplomats of the EEAS could come together and discuss how this should be structured. Some of the things that we came up with are on the agenda today. One is political deputies. We recommended this, but at the time it did not find favour with those who initiated the service. It became clear very quickly that ubiquity is not something that one can expect of the High Representative in what we always called an impossible job – three hats at the same time is simply impossible to fulfil without serious political deputising. Today this is the first point in the recommendation that we are writing as a Parliament. The second issue that we discussed – and which was indeed realised – was to have a broader leadership structure rather than one all-powerful General Secretary. If it was Pierre Vimont we would not have a problem with that of course, but we did not want to have an éminence grise
 behind the scenes who would not appear in Parliament etc. We wanted to have the opportunity to give you as much information from as many sources as possible in your leadership functions. We believe that, even if this is modified, the principle is still valid.  A last point – and my colleague here the Earl of Dartmouth just mentioned this  – is that our Member States are indeed closing down embassies and consulates and that this is where the External Action Service can provide added value because our Member States will continue to be represented by a service that is their own.

I actually have two questions. Firstly, you complain about a lack of solidarity, although aid of about EUR 10 billion has been given to Cyprus, a country of less than one million people. I think that is proof of solidarity. Do you agree with me? Secondly, are you aware of the Council of Europe’s report that has just been leaked, concerning money laundering and the lack of effort on the part of the Cypriot authorities to combat money laundering effectively? We are seeing some pretty dramatic figures online right now. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Mr President, the Taoiseach is here; Chancellor Merkel was here; Prime Minister Monti was here; President Sarkozy, when still in office, was here. David Cameron is hiding in Holland. He seems to be afraid of a real debate about the future of Europe with the elected representatives of the peoples of Europe. I would like to say to Martin Callanan of our Tory friends to invite him to come here to have this debate here rather than in The Hague. Your being here earns you our respect and loyalty but not only that. Sie haben sechs Sparhaushalte nacheinander verabschiedet. Sie haben alle Auflagen von IWF und Europäischer Union erfüllt. Sie sind am Kapitalmarkt zurück, Sie haben wirklich viel getan! Aber Ihr Schuldenstand wird in diesem Jahr ungefähr 120 % des Bruttoinlandsprodukts erreichen, und Sie wollen deshalb die irischen Schulden europäisieren. Ob das richtig ist, sei dahingestellt. Es ist allemal legitim, es zu versuchen. Es wirft nur eine Frage auf: Kann Irland wirklich ein ehrlicher Makler sein, wenn die Last der nationalen Interessen so schwer auf Ihren Schultern drückt? Vergessen wir nicht, in zwölf Monaten wird hier der griechische Premierminister sitzen. Welche nationalen Interessen wird er mitbringen? Das ist ein großes Problem. Sie haben eben in Ihrer Rede gesagt, Sie wollen eine erneuerte und umgebaute Europäische Union. Das klingt bei Ihnen erheblich glaubwürdiger als wahrscheinlich bei David Cameron am Freitag. Ich habe einige Vorschläge, was man machen könnte. Zum Einen: Lassen Sie uns die rotierende Präsidentschaft abschaffen. Sie werden sehr gute Arbeit machen. Das ist Ihre siebte Präsidentschaft, Sie haben eine hervorragende Europaministerin. Aber das System ist ein Problem. Zweitens: Gestern hat hier der österreichische Bundeskanzler, der auch hier war, um über Europa zu debattieren, gefordert, dass alle Rabatte abgeschafft werden sollen bei der Finanzierung der Europäischen Union. Lassen Sie uns das System erheblich einfacher machen! Beim dritten Punkt geht es an Ihre Glaubwürdigkeit: Sie haben gesagt, Sie wollen eine Europäische Union, die weniger komplex, weniger institutionell ist. Der erste wichtige Schritt dahin ist eine kleinere Kommission. Wir haben jetzt 27 Kommissare, es werden immer mehr. Das ist der erste wichtige Schritt, und hier spielen Sie eine ganz besondere Rolle! Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Mr President, I second the last remark. It is good to have you here in this job, Stavros, it is good that we have you as an EU Special Representative for Human Rights. I think that is very good. Die Menschenrechtspolitik der Europäischen Union war ja eine Zeit lang wirklich in der Kritik.  Die Stunde der Wahrheit war der Arabische Frühling. Wir haben in den Spiegel geschaut, und was wir gesehen haben, das hat uns nicht alles gefallen. Wir haben darauf reagiert, mit einer Menschenrechtsstrategie, mit einem Aktionsplan – das ist gut. Mit einem Sonderbeauftragten für Menschenrechte – auch das ist gut. Wir unterstützen die Zivilgesellschaft und Nichtregierungsorganisationen – auch das ist gut. Wir wollen uns koordinieren und wir wollen an einem Strang ziehen – auch das ist gut.  Aber hier habe ich eine ganz konkrete Frage an Frau Kozakou-Marcoullis, mit der Bitte um Antwort: Wir wollen uns koordinieren, wir wollen uns abstimmen, wie machen wir das praktisch?  Sollten wir uns nicht – Sie haben den Europäischen Demokratiefonds erwähnt – in unserer Politik und in unseren Instrumenten wirklich darauf verpflichten, dass die Demokratieförderung von EIHDR und EED eng abgestimmt wird, dass miteinander geredet wird, um Doppelungen zu vermeiden? Ich bin sicher, Sie werden mir da zustimmen.  Und Sie haben auch Diskriminierungen auf der Basis von Kastenzugehörigkeit erwähnt. Wir werden morgen hierzu eine Dringlichkeitsentschließung haben. Würden Sie mir auch zustimmen, dass die Europäische Union in ihrer Politik und ihren Instrumenten kastenbasierte Diskriminierung aufgreifen und bekämpfen sollte? Herzlichen Dank für Antworten auf diese beiden Fragen. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Mr President, we are voting on quite a large number of amendments tabled by one particular group that usually attaches great importance to strict compliance with the Rules of Procedure. In this House, roll-call votes are generally reserved for issues of particular and major importance. It would therefore be sensible for the EP’s Services to contact the group concerned to establish whether each of these roll-call votes is, in fact, necessary. In my view, what the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group is inflicting on us here is completely unnecessary. (Applause) Alexander Graf Lambsdorff,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, Prime Minister, Mr Barroso, we have heard a great deal about how the house of Europe is built of the bricks of solidarity, but houses must be built on solid foundations. That has been the distinctive line of the past six months: the link between solidarity and solidity. I would therefore have liked you to have said a bit more about solidity, Prime Minister, and to have talked about how we can exert better, stricter control over the situation that we are in – the debt crisis in the Member States that has dragged our currency down with it. You mentioned the ‘two-pack’, and that indeed took place during your Presidency. In the case of the ‘two-pack’, we, as the European Parliament, called for a debt redemption pact. I believe we need to take a brave step forward if we want to be successful here. However, the Council’s decisions of last weekend leave a lot of questions unanswered. Mr Swoboda mentioned the growth pact. I know that it is something he is particularly concerned about. Der Spiegel
 called the whole thing a sham. A total of EUR 50-55 billion is supposed to come from the Structural Funds, but even Commissioner Hahn says he does not know how such figures are arrived at. I am not convinced that it is genuinely solid, that it will restore confidence among our citizens. Liability and control go together; that is the really crucial thing. We want to liberate forces for growth, we want the European patent. However, and in this Mr Swoboda is absolutely right, what the Council has decided is completely absurd. A court that sits in three different places – London, Paris and Munich – is downright grotesque, and it shows that quite clearly the Member States are not capable of coming to sensible decisions on such an important, innovation-driving matter. I have one question. A new system of banking supervision is now to be established on the basis of Article 127(6) of the Treaty. I thought we had a European Banking Authority. Are we now going to have a banking supervisory authority with two seats as well? Are we going to get two different banking supervisory authorities? Precisely what form does the Council imagine this is going to take? You will find it pretty difficult to explain the proliferation of seats of various organisations to this Parliament and get support for it. In other respects, I would like to offer my sincere thanks for your committed Presidency. There are some other matters that you have progressed with real success. I have not mentioned Schengen, which was undoubtedly a sore point in your Presidency. However, the enlargement policy in respect of Serbia and Montenegro is undoubtedly one of the positive aspects.

Blue-card question.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I should like to ask Ms Harms whether what she describes as a comfort – the prospect of joint liability, common risk – does not necessarily also entail shared political control, or should be viewed in parallel with this. After all, the debts for which we are jointly liable today are the taxes of tomorrow. No taxation without representation. That is a very important point. My second, very specific, question is as follows. You said that bank risk should be separated from sovereign risk, and that we have now succeeded in this. However, the European Stability Mechanism, which is currently recapitalising the banks, is borne by sovereign states. In other words, sovereign risk is being distributed differently, but it is still there. What is your assessment of this? I take a very critical view of it, and where the conclusion of the Euro Group is concerned, I am decidedly sceptical as regards how vague it has been kept and what impact it will have in practice. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, firstly, congratulations to Mr Lewandowski. However, the person I really want to wish all the best is not you, but rather your namesake, Robert, of Borussia Dortmund – I hope he manages to score to take Poland into the quarter finals. That really would be something to celebrate. We have just heard a few things about the Council and the future of Europe that this Council is to decide on, that are to be debated. Listening to what Mr Bokros has said here, I believe this to be very important. The crucial thing as regards everything that we are debating in relation to the multiannual financial framework, in relation to the budget, is whether the private sector is going to invest again, whether the private sector will regain its confidence in the European economy and its prospects. This is the decisive factor. Public budgets can only provide incentives at best. The Social Democrats sometimes need that explaining to them. You cannot buy growth; you can only enable growth. That is why it is crucial that the structural reforms that President Barroso mentioned come about. The second really crucial thing is the debt redemption pact; a clear, effective debt redemption pact linked to clear conditions which will relieve the burden on the budgets in the Member States, which at present, despite all their efforts – in Italy, for example – simply cannot emerge from the constraints of their refinancing. We therefore need a clear and effective debt redemption pact. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff, Britta Reimers and Michael Theurer  (ALDE
),  
in writing.

 The German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament has spoken out clearly in favour of the introduction of a debt redemption fund. However, participation in such a fund must be associated with clear and strict rules, such as were contained in the proposal made by the German Council of Economic Experts to the German Government in autumn 2011. Watering down the criteria for participation is neither productive nor effective. Linking the introduction of a debt redemption fund with the eurobonds project and the treatment of economic imbalances is unfair, and is rejected by the FDP in the European Parliament in the strongest possible terms.

 I have two very specific questions. One is whether Mr Rouček is aware that the Czech Government has granted political asylum to Mr Danylyshyn, the former Ukrainian Minister for the Economy. This is only granted when the person is suffering from political persecution. I would also like to know what he thinks of this fact. My second question concerns whether it is relevant that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament or the Social Democratic Party of Europe has a cooperation agreement with the Party of the Regions. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, as Mr Siwiec has just said, this is not the first debate that we have held on the subject of Ukraine and, as has so often been the case before, large parts of this debate have been unproductive and predictable. Why is this? The answer is quite simple. The Batkivshchyna is a party which follows the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and, as we have just heard, the Party of the Regions has an agreement with the Socialists. In other words, the PPE group is now making a big fuss, puffing out its cheeks and running a poster campaign to create a good photo opportunity, while the Socialists are giving speeches about the situation in Ukraine which they ought to be ashamed of. This is a softly-softly approach which glosses over the reality of the situation. This type of debate does not do justice to the strategic or the humanitarian dimension of the problem. Ukraine is a large country with a population of 50 million. It lies between Russia, the European Union and the Black Sea. For 20 years, it has been stagnating in economic, democratic and social terms. Of course, that was also the case under the Yushchenko/Tymoshenko government. I believe that we now need to put the focus on the political and humanitarian dimension. We must ensure that democracy has a chance at the elections in October. However, Mr Füle, the electoral campaign is already under way. I would like some very precise information from the Commission and the European External Action Service about how they plan to implement the measures that you have just described, in other words, the close monitoring of the electoral campaign and the elections themselves. I would like our two guests, Hryhoriy Nemyria and Yevgenia Tymoshenko, to take away more from today’s debate than just the usual disputes between left and right. To Ms Tymoshenko, I would like to say in particular that I hope her mother receives the medical treatment she needs. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Blue-card answer.

The subject of our debate today is the case of Ms Tymoshenko, a political and humanitarian case which gives rise to the most serious concern, and Members who I otherwise have a great deal of personal respect for, such as Mr Rouček and Mr Vigenin, are giving speeches which do not in any way do justice to the severity of the case about the various minor reforms that are taking place at the moment. The situation would be exactly the reverse if the government in Ukraine were different. That is what I mean. We must be open and clear about this. Regardless of who is in power in Ukraine, the country is too important for us to discuss it here from a party political perspective. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr Schulz, I hope you have noted the fact that I did not express a naïve hope, but that I called on the Commission to make it entirely clear how it intends to monitor the election process.

 – (DE)
 Mr President, there are three important issues for the summit tomorrow. The first is to continue consolidating the national budgets. That is not an end in itself, Mr Bullmann. If investment levels are currently low or even at zero, as you say, then there is a reason for this. We are paying interest on the debts that we have accumulated in the past instead of building schools. We are paying interest instead of building roads. We are paying interest instead of investing in innovation and research. We need to continue consolidating the national budgets so that we can begin investing in these areas again. The second important topic is structural reforms. Productivity, efficiency, competitiveness, entrepreneurship and an appropriate level of taxation for businesses will all help to ensure that the Member States and their markets are competitive. It concerns me that the labour market reforms in Italy have come to a stop. We need to abolish Article 18. I do not understand how anyone can be opposed to that. The third point is growth. How do we intend to finance it? The UK is not prepared to go along with the financial transaction tax. This amounts to false accounting. The European Investment Bank is a much better solution. In addition, the Commission must finally submit proposals as to how we can mobilise the available money in the Structural Funds for use in Greece and the other countries, because we have already been talking about this for two years. We gradually need to introduce some concrete measures. We have been talking about this for two years without anything being done. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

I simply wanted to ask Mr Lamberts whether he might consider assuming that the Members of the House, whatever their nationality and whatever their political affiliation, pursue honest motives in their political activities, and whether he might refrain in future from slanderous and belittling remarks.

 Mr President, what do Düsseldorf and Dortmund, Herten and Essen, Arnsberg and Würselen have in common? They are all places where the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) Members of the European Parliament for North Rhine-Westphalia live. The people of North Rhine-Westphalia hear from Ms Kraft that the SPD’s aim is to protect and promote both industry and the region as an industrial heartland. At the same time, these Members from Dortmund, Düsseldorf, Essen and other places are now about to vote for a massive increase in the price of diesel, this despite the fact that Germany and Europe lead the world in this energy-efficient and environmentally friendly drive technology. The consequences of this price increase are clear: rising prices, a decline in internal demand, a threat to technological superiority and to the survival of the industrial base. If this really is the Social Democrats’ industrial policy, then we can say good night to North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany and Europe. The truth is that this makes no economic or environmental sense. If we consider rising fuel costs, which have already reached record levels, then we must recognise that we are inhibiting internal demand, despite the fact that the Social Democrats are always looking to stimulate growth in this area. This makes no sense from an environmental perspective either. We all know that diesel-powered vehicles travel further on less fuel than petrol-driven vehicles. That is why I would call on the Social Democrats to reconsider the consequences for the people, the consumers and the drivers of Germany and Europe of their vote tomorrow. It is high time that the SPD espoused an economic policy that targets success, not just on election posters, but also in specific political action. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I support the motion tabled by Mr Swoboda to remove this report from the agenda. Some points in the report are so incomplete that it needs further debate. The current wording of the report makes it clear that diesel would become considerably more expensive. This is definitely not the sort of economic policy signal that car drivers and industry want to see. Therefore, I believe it is right to discuss this report further and to focus on the uncontroversial areas when it is next referred to Parliament. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Madam President, my group tabled the original amendment. We regret that it is not possible to name the Zaman
 newspaper here, because this was the only paper to suffer attack in Cologne, Paris, London, Rotterdam and Zurich. As a group, we intend to vote in favour of Mr Obiol’s amendment nonetheless in order to show clearly that the freedom of the press is a central objective for us. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 – (DE) 
Madam President, my report appears in the voting lists as an own-initiative report. However, according to the Rules of Procedure, it is, in fact, a recommendation to the Council. That is a different matter. We would not need to vote on the report because, according to the Rules of Procedure, it is deemed adopted if there are no amendments tabled by the groups. I would ask that the documents be corrected in order to put this right. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, we all agree that we want a stability culture in Europe. That is at least what we are constantly hearing. We also need to assess what has been achieved with the fiscal compact, which represents an important step towards the stability culture. It is not a turning point and it is not the solution. It is also not a universal remedy. We can all agree on that. However, I believe that it is an important step forward, and this needs to be said for the sake of truth. We want balanced budgets with very low primary deficits, if these cannot be avoided. We want a debt brake in the euro area countries. We want automatic sanctions for offenders before things go wrong. We want old debts to be reduced and the results to be reported to Brussels before new debts are incurred. We want the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) to come into effect earlier. We must also make sure that only those countries which join the fiscal compact have access to the ESM. These are all important elements of a stability culture in Europe and, with the ‘two-pack’, we are attempting to implement this under European law, including a debt redemption pact, which is something my group is specifically calling for. We want to stimulate growth in Greece and the money to do this is available. Between EUR 16 billion and EUR 18 billion – the numbers vary – can be provided from the Structural Funds. I believe that we finally need to get started with this. Everything that Mr Reichenbach and the Troika have so far achieved in Greece is not enough to give a real boost to growth. Then, today, there was a debate in the German Parliament which surprised me, because the Social Democrats are threatening to vote against the fiscal compact unless it includes a particular tax, which would justifiably be controversial. I believe this would be a huge mistake. I also think it is important for the Social Democrats to become aware of their responsibilities in terms of stability policy and to vote in favour of the compact without playing party political games. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the central issue for us is to make progress on the road towards a stability culture. I would like to finish by congratulating you, Mr Van Rompuy, on your reappointment. Everyone agrees that you are doing an excellent job. However, I am still of the opinion that your position, as it is enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon, is a mistake. I would prefer to have a President of Europe who, if possible, was also directly elected. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff,

 Mr President, as Mr Wammen has just said, the Spring European Council meeting is traditionally the European Union’s rendezvous with social and economic reality in Europe. However, we have all heard that the finance ministers yesterday cancelled their meeting in Brussels at which they intended to approve the second aid package for Greece. What does that mean? What does it mean for Greece and for Europe? I believe that our common goal is to keep Greece in the euro area and I would like to respond to Mr Daul on this subject. I do not agree with what Ms Kroes has said about Greece remaining in the euro area, but the reason why she has said it and why so many people are so impatient, is the behaviour of her sister party, Nea Dimokratia, in particular. If they could just call Mr Samaras to order, it would be very helpful. I believe it would be better for all of us. We want Greece to stay in the euro area, but it is important to make one thing clear. In the past, the Greek Government has made a lot of promises, but has delivered very little. The introduction of another austerity package does not by any means indicate that what is being promised will actually be put into practice, and that is exactly what this is all about. It is about structural reform, which will lead to further aid being made available. If it takes the right course, Greece can count on our support. However, we no longer need preliminary work; instead, we are looking for action. It has been said here that the situation in Greece is genuinely dramatic. In addition to the savings which are needed, Mr Swoboda, from 1991 to 2007, in other words, before the crisis, Greece had an average annual national deficit of 6.6%. Greece is now having to pay the bill for its poor policies in the past. Of course, we do not envy the Greeks. That is absolutely clear. We want to get the country and the economy going again and the trade unions will be an important part of this. Trade unions have played a constructive role in increasing competitiveness in Germany over many years. Economic performance has fallen by 7% over the last three months. This is why we now need genuine structural reforms, in other words, a tax reform which is worthy of the name. Progress must be made with privatisation in important sectors such as energy generation, ports and lotteries, every area where the state is too heavily involved. The proposed cuts in the bloated civil service are also needed. Parts of the Greek political system have been based on this. People simply found positions for their supporters in a ministry, a public authority or a public company. In other words, the state sector is completely bloated. I would like to remind everyone in this context that it was the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe which called for a sort of Marshall Plan some time ago. We call it the Hercules Plan and we will be happy to work on it. However, after the last Council meeting, our group also made three very specific proposals for measures to promote growth and create jobs. These proposals are addressed to the Council: the implementation of the European patent, the deployment of unused funding from the European Union budget and a plan to reduce the risk of infection within Europe. We want a debt redemption pact for the whole of Europe. We expect the Council finally to tackle this problem.

 Mr President, I am looking around and I do not want to exclude any of the Members who are sitting behind me. It is important to make it clear that we must not attach too much importance to these remarks. It is obvious that many people really have run out of patience. We want to see something happen in Greece. We are prepared to help and to show solidarity, but the phase of promises must be replaced by a phase of taking action. I believe that this is what lies behind these remarks. They are made on a pars pro toto 
basis. This is not just one voice speaking. Many, many people are saying the same thing. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, I would be very grateful if Mr Cohn-Bendit could explain to me what he believes the Taliban are. I am not familiar with the phrases ‘liberal Taliban’ and ‘neoliberal Taliban’. Mr Daul has just outed himself here as a liberal. I do not believe that he is a member of the Taliban, not even the neoliberal Taliban. We should stop all this nonsense. What is really important, and I would like to say that Mr Cohn-Bendit is right about this, is that we should all treat each other with respect. That also applies to the different peoples of Europe, including the Greeks, the Germans and the others. Treating each other with respect within the European Union should always be more important than wonderful rhetorical flights of fancy which are actually rather disrespectful.

– The FDP Delegation has abstained in today’s vote on the motion for a resolution on the feasibility of introducing stability bonds. We believe that the introduction of Eurobonds would set the wrong incentives. Since the introduction of the euro, low interest rates have led to a substantial increase in debt levels in many eurozone countries. Eurobonds would take the pressure off highly indebted eurozone Member States to consolidate their budgets and introduce much needed structural reforms. Therefore, we believe that Eurobonds would aggravate, rather than alleviate, the current crisis. However, we did not vote against the resolution as many of our concerns have been taken on board by the rapporteur. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Mr President, Mr Swoboda, I would like to ask you to take note of the fact that the same states which are currently in particular difficulties in the midst of the debt crisis are also the states with the highest youth unemployment levels. Please also take note of the fact that labour market policy is the responsibility of the Member States and that imposing sanctions in areas where companies have to hire people definitely does not make sense but simply aggravates the situation. Please also take note of the fact that the citizens of France will elect their own president. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, I was particularly pleased about the Council’s decision to impose sanctions and an oil embargo and to increase the pressure on Iran. I consider this to be the sensible and right thing to do and I am amazed to hear many fellow Members saying that there is no proof of military intent or that it is not possible to distinguish between civil and military use. We only need to look at the facts. Iran has 5 000 kg of uranium that is enriched to 3%. That is what is needed for energy production. However, it already has 75 kg that is enriched to 20%, and the only explanation for that is that it is planning to use it for military purposes. The enrichment needs to be pushed to 90%. That is technically complex, but by no means impossible. All of the facts, including the most recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), indicate that military use is intended here. In other words, we have a predictable period here in which the whole scenario will enfold, and it is therefore right for the European Parliament to now increase the pressure. The same applies with regard to the delivery systems, commonly known as missiles. The Iranians are obviously working on medium- and long-range missiles. This brings the urgency of the situation even more clearly into focus. It would have been better if the oil embargo had been put into effect immediately – although I fully understand the need of some Member States to find means of diversification. However, that will also give Iran the opportunity to find ways round this. I am pleased that the joint parliamentary resolution received broad support. I am also pleased about the particularly constructive role of the IAEA, in particular since Yukiya Amano took over the position of Director General. That is extremely helpful, and I am also pleased to see the positive and constructive role that Turkey has been playing recently with regard to this matter. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, Prime Minister, I would like to start by thanking you. Immediately upon entering office, you reversed the snap decision of the previous regime to reintroduce border controls between Denmark and Germany and Denmark and Sweden. I believe this was a very good decision. My group favours an open Europe. This was good news for those citizens living in the border regions. It was also good news for business, particularly the transport companies on either side of the border. Thank you for what is a really positive step. In my second point I find myself agreeing with Mr Langen: please defend the Community method. You have already seen what happens when we revert to the intergovernmental patterns of the 19th century and the attitudes associated with them. At least this is what has been reported in the media in relation to what Mr Sarkozy had to say to you. If this is the new tone we can expect from the intergovernmental method, then this is another argument in favour of the Community method. There is one important point to make, however. In setting out your priorities for the Presidency of the Council you state that you want the European Union to have a strong, consistent external profile. I believe it would be good if you could use the opportunity afforded by this Council Presidency to initiate a debate on whether you really wish to maintain your opt-out from the Common Security and Defence Policy. It is strange that every country except Denmark is a member of the European Defence Agency. I would be extremely grateful if you could take advantage of this opportunity. Finally, my group, together with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, is pursuing a procedure against Hungary under Article 7(1) of the Treaty. It is then up to the Council, however, to make any recommendations. Article 7(1) only provides for recommendations. I would encourage you: place this on the agenda and organise the necessary four-fifths majority of Member States. This is the only way we will make any progress with regard to Hungary. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Blue-card question.

 Mr President, Mr Weber, I have absolutely no doubts about your commitment to the rule of law. However, today I do doubt your political judgment. There is a new national justice agency in Hungary. It is responsible for appointing judges and for allocating cases to specific courts. This national justice agency has a director. It is managed by a lady. Perhaps you would like to tell us who she is, if you know. If you do not know, ask your neighbour. She is the wife of Mr Szájer and I find this very strange in the context of discussions on the independence of the judiciary. (Applause) Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Orbán, I would like to make one thing clear straight away: Hungary is not Belarus, you are not Mr Chávez and it is possible to live a good life in Hungary. Nevertheless, we do have serious concerns. I am intending to link my criticisms to specific points, as Mr Weber has called on us to do. You said that no one had criticised the constitution. There are now 25 ‘cardinal laws’, which raise some issues to the level of the constitution because a two-thirds majority is required to change them again. One of these is the flat tax. I am a Liberal and I think a flat tax is an excellent idea. However, it is not acceptable to take a tax policy issue out of the political debate and include it in the constitution. This undermines and impairs the citizens’ democratic right to vote, to choose a different government at the next elections and to bring about comprehensive change. Tax law is a question which must stimulate central political debate and democratic disputes. This situation is unacceptable because it undermines democracy and that is why it is so serious. Incidentally, you have said, and this was the point which concerned the judicial system, that this is all about the independence of the judiciary and about facts. The Prime Minister has said that he has done everything possible to consolidate the budget. How can he then reduce the retirement age for around 300 judges from 70 to 62? That will cost the state a lot of money. Of course, new judges will have to be appointed to fill the vacancies. That is all well and good. We have our own ideas about who they will be. I think we understand that very well. A year ago we expressed our criticism of the media law. We were told that the pluralism of the media was not at risk. Now Klubrádió is being closed down. It has already been closed in Budapest and the frequencies are now being shut down in the countryside. Mr Orbán, you have said that you have written a letter to Mr Barroso in order to discuss the situation calmly and objectively. In the BILD newspaper today you explained that you are yielding to power. (The President cut off the speaker) Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, I am rather surprised. This morning on the German radio station Deutschlandfunk
, Mr Schulz was celebrating the agreement on the ‘six-pack’ as the hour in which the European Parliament demonstrated its importance and I completely agree with him about this. However, he failed to mention that the left wing of this House did, of course, vote against the ‘six-pack’ and has now also taken up a position opposing the results of the summit, balanced budgets and effective sanctions. This does not add up. I am sorry, but we have a debt union. We must have balanced budgets. We need sensible mechanisms which will allow us to achieve this. That is what was decided at the summit. In overall terms, the results are an effective way of allowing us to move from being a debt union to becoming a stability union. However, on one point I agree with him and my other fellow Members: this will become a government agreement. As a result, the risk of a democratic deficit and of a lack of acceptance by the citizens is very real. Therefore, it is very important that the parliaments, both this House and the national parliaments, are very closely involved in this process. My third point, Mr Barroso, concerns something that is important to me. Of course it is essential that what is decided in this fiscal compact is transferred into the Treaties. To do this, we just need the agreement of the United Kingdom at some point. However, it may possibly be the case that we will be forced to do things the other way round. We may need to see this fiscal compact as the founding of a new European Union, as closer integration and as the starting signal for a new project. Nevertheless, I would like to make it clear that we want the British to be involved. Mr Daul, the countries where Liberal parties are in government are those where the public finances are largely in good shape: Estonia, Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and Sweden. These are the countries where the Liberals are in government. In the countries where the Conservatives are in power without Liberals to apply corrective measures, such as Italy, Greece and Portugal, things look a little different. The Liberal position is very clear in that respect. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, I take every appropriate and inappropriate opportunity to praise Ms Wortmann-Kool. To put it simply, no one disputes the institutional point. Of course, this was one of the European Parliament’s finest hours. However, we are not only discussing institutional questions here today; we are also talking about overcoming the euro crisis and about the route towards a stability union. (Heckling from Martin Schulz)
 This is an important point. I am amazed by the tough stance taken by the entire left wing of this House in opposing the results of the summit, including Mr Steinmeier, who described the whole thing as a fiasco. With the best will in the world, I cannot understand this. It is in our common interest that the Member States in the euro area have balanced budgets and that they are monitored. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 – (DE)
 Mr President, before I come to the topic in question, I would like to mention that our former fellow Member and Vice-President, Mr Lambrinidis, is here in the Chamber. He is holding a conversation at the back and we are pleased to see him. He is not listening, because he does not understand German, but that does not matter. When I attend events in my constituency, I always ask my constituents: Which has more soldiers, the European Union or the United States? People generally give the wrong answer. The Member States of the European Union have 2 million soldiers under arms, while the United States has 1.4 million. We are armed to the teeth, but we are only spending on these soldiers one-third of what the Americans are spending. That is plainly nonsense. For this reason, pooling and sharing makes perfect sense. However, it is also clear that we cannot leave this to the armed forces alone. The process must be under political control. In this respect, this report makes a major contribution to the political debate and I would like to thank Mr Lisek. However, I would like to express my criticism of one point and that concerns offsets. The opinion expressed in this report cannot replace the legally binding provisions of the directive on defence procurement in the European Union. I have read the Commission’s guidelines on the use of offsets and it is essential that we follow them. Regardless of whether they are civilian or military, direct or indirect, they always have the effect of distorting competition and, under the terms of Article 346, are only permitted in very few exceptional circumstances. Therefore, I believe it is important for us to emphasise this once again, to stick to it and to vote accordingly.

 Mr President, as I know how excellent our interpreters are, it cannot have been due to the interpreting, so it must have been down to you Mr Van Orden. I clearly said that the Member States have 2 million soldiers and that we are only spending on these soldiers in Europe as a whole one-third of what the Americans are spending. It is obvious that this does not make sense. Even the United Kingdom is very happily pooling and sharing strategic transport aircraft, nuclear testing and aircraft carriers with the French. I believe that this debate is important and I would like to thank Mr Lisek for his positive report. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Madam President, I believe there is cause for concern with regard to this summit. The role of the US in the global economy is far from agreeable. While we here in Europe have learnt from the debt crisis to be responsible with our public finances, we see the American Central Bank continuing to open the floodgates and flood the American market with dollars. Easy money was one of the causes of the crisis in 2008. The whole affair is, unfortunately, continuing along the same path, just like the US public debt situation. The risk of inflation must not be ignored. I also think it is regrettable that the US has still not managed to carry out any permanent reform of its Medicare, Medicaid and social security systems. In this context ahead of an election year in 2012, a weaker dollar is, of course, not what the US wants. A revaluation would absolutely not fit in with President Obama’s jobs programme. The advice to Europeans to please stabilise the euro should also be seen against this background. After all, if the euro loses value against the dollar, US exports will have a harder time on the global markets. At the same time, there is a rise in protectionist efforts in the US – this is also a trend that we absolutely must counter, and therefore it is good that the Commissioner for Trade has spoken here today. I consider this to be extremely important. We Europeans and Americans still have the most significant trade and investment relations with one another. A second point that is important for my group is the fact that, with Google, eBay, Apple and Amazon, so-called information empires have arisen. With regard to the handing of the data, it is important for us, together with the US, to find a new approach for these private players too, and I believe that this is of great interest to our citizens. This matter must be addressed seriously. I forgot to mention Facebook, which should clearly also be included here. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 – (DE)
 Mr Rübig, I wish I could give you an encouraging answer. My fear is simply that if the Republicans actually manage to remove President Obama from office, we will not see any particular improvement in the US public finances in terms of revenue, whereas if things were to go on as before, the Democrats will continue their irresponsible policy in relation to expenditure. Therefore, I do not believe that the macroeconomic situation in the US will take a turn for the better. We will have to humbly wait and see who the Americans ultimately vote for next November.

Madam President, Ms Schaake is one of our most competent Members when it comes to issues relating to the Internet, freedom of information and data protection. I would like to take the opportunity to ask you whether you think it would make sense to draw up an action plan with the US that would ensure the protection of data and the privacy of users of these major providers. Could this be an objective for this or another EU-US summit? In my view, it could be. I would like to hear your opinion on this and perhaps a few elements that could be agreed on in such an action plan. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what we are now experiencing is something we have warned about for many years in soapbox speeches. We are leaving the coming generations an impossible debt burden. This is irresponsible. All the political parties have said so for many years. We can see from the example of Greece that the problem is no longer waiting for the next generation – it is now confronting this generation and we can see what this means. Tightening one’s belt is painful, however we need to move towards a stability union. There have been some good developments that are going well and where things are working. Ireland is heading in the right direction. We have introduced a budgetary control watchdog, the European Semester. We have agreed a stability pact with teeth – something also to be welcomed. Last night marked an important step along the way to stability union. We agreed that the banks need to do business on a more solid basis. They are to be forced to fulfil their responsibilities and will be recapitalised, however they must have a solid 9% of equity capital. Greece is to have the haircut. It was clear that this would have to happen. We will also have permanent monitoring of the reforms in Greece. Italy has announced pension reforms. We must be clear about the fact that we are still on the path to stability union. All of these things must be implemented in order for us to move forward. I would like to close by congratulating Mr Rehn, the new Vice-President. I am certain that he will play a key role in taking us along the path to this stability union. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I have to say that the wishes of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have never been met so quickly by the Commission. The chair of our group has only just requested the documents that describe the proposals in detail and here they are. We have asked for the documents because I would like to reassure myself that I have correctly understood one point which is particularly important to me. The Commission proposals, which, on the whole, are excellent and far-reaching, include the following statement:  Deciding a sustainable solution for Greece within the euro area, through an effective second adjustment programme.  (DE)
 We need a lasting solution for Greece within the euro area and we can achieve this by making Greece’s debts sustainable. In other words, this is the famous haircut. It is insolvency or, if you prefer, ‘re-solvency’. That was precisely our position. This is why we were accused of being populists a few weeks ago when we said that debt reduction would be needed to allow Greece to emerge from the crisis. The Commission is rightly combining this with robust implementation and supervision mechanisms. This is the right thing to do. We want solidarity, we want to keep Greece in the euro area, but we also want solidity and we want to be able to monitor it, because solidarity cannot be a one-way street. That is extremely important to us. I am pleased that the European debate is now moving in this direction. I am also pleased that our position, which all the experts have long since confirmed is the right one, is now also being confirmed in the political arena. I always get a warm feeling when I hear the Tory Members of this House, like Mr Kirkhope, calling for strong European solutions to recapitalise the banks. Issues like national sovereignty and the United Kingdom and its special position always come to mind in these circumstances. However, I am pleased that there are occasions when even London believes that Europe is useful. I would just like to see this happening more often. I have one final point to make, which is that the news agencies are already reporting that the opposition and the governing parties in Slovakia have agreed to support the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the increase in its scope. This also pleases me. The spectacle of the last few days clearly shows that the requirement for unanimity is a means of setting up blockades. We need majority decisions, including when it comes to stabilising the euro. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
).  
– (DE)
 Mr President, the interpreter, at least, did not word it as a question, but nevertheless, I am happy to provide an answer. No, the solidarity between the Member States of the European Union and of the euro area makes various demands on us and on our voters. However, we are prepared to meet those demands because we want a stability union for Europe and, within this stability union, solidarity is a two-way street. This means that we are prepared to take on these guarantees. As far as the question of the banks is concerned, I am unhappy about the developments in the banking sector, just as everyone who takes a close look at it is. It is true that some of the things which were being done before the crisis are still going on now. However, one thing is absolutely clear. Without a functioning banking sector, we cannot develop a strategy for growth in Europe. As a result, the actions that we have just taken – paying the next tranche to Greece and organising a haircut which does not completely cripple the banking sector – are necessary to allow us to emerge from the crisis by means of economic growth. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Ms Harms, are you aware that the Prime Minister of the Netherlands has proposed a Commissioner – Mr Rehn, to be specific about it – as a sort of European finance minister? We believe that this is a good idea. My second question to you is as follows. You have spoken here about imbalances and about the investments that need to be made. How do you explain the fact that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will be voting here today against a better, tougher, stronger Stability and Growth Pact, which will stabilise the eurozone, while we in Berlin are being given wonderful advice by the Socialists and the Greens? (Applause) Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, you have made a very good speech, Mr Barroso. What is important now is putting it into practice, in other words, the follow-up, as Mr Verhofstadt has said, and ensuring that something really happens here. I believe that we agree almost unanimously that we need more Europe in order to be able to overcome this crisis. However, we need the right Europe and for us that means that we want a stability union rather than a debt union. We need to include a ‘debt brake’ in the national constitutions. We still need, and here my opinion differs from that of the Chair of my group, different interest rates, because they act as an economic ‘debt brake’. We also need an organised process for national bankruptcy. We need rules which determine what happens when a country becomes unable to pay its debts, so that we can keep it in the eurozone. That is the crucial point. We need a stability pact with teeth and with automatic sanctions. I would like to say one thing. The plan by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to vote against this tougher stability pact here today is a continuation of Gerhard Schröder’s policy of 2003, which aimed to destroy the stability culture of Europe. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, some excellent work has been done in a difficult field. I am a little surprised by Mr Cohn-Bendit, who spent five minutes berating you, describing your role as that of a blackmailer and calling on you to resolve the problems immediately, before leaving the Chamber. He could at least have waited to hear what you had to say in reply. The fact is that some excellent work has been done in this field. There is one thing that we must not forget: what were our fears? We were afraid that the European Union would once again create an impression that our Member States would not pull together, just as we failed to act cohesively in the war in Iraq or as we are doing now in Libya. Germany and France had already made their positions clear in individual statements. On the contrary, the European Union is pulling together. You have earned the trust of both sides in the region, the Israelis and the Palestinians. This is a diplomatic feat in itself and it is true to say that we can only play a constructive role through trust. It is also true that we, the European Union, can only play a constructive role if our Member States are united. Both of these points are on a good footing thanks to your work. Overall, you have done a good job. There are three more important things I would like to mention: we want a united European Union – you are making good progress in this direction. As Parliament stated in its resolution, we want a negotiated solution in the United Nations. We do not want a vote with winners and losers. We regard this as vitally important. Thirdly, we must have a timetable. We say that the Palestinians should get their upgrade during the 66th General Assembly, in other words, they must be recognised. We should allow the Palestinians this moment of joy, Mr Swoboda. However, I should say, whenever reference is made to 1947, that immediately afterwards, in 1948, Israel found itself under attack from all its Arab neighbours. If we achieve recognition for Palestine as a peaceful state and secure borders for the state of Israel, then this will be a reason to celebrate for the Palestinians, for the Israelis and for us here in Europe who played a constructive role, thanks to your efforts. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
).  
– Madam President, just a short question to Mr Davies. Would he concede that, on the Palestinian side, it is fair to speak of two faces as well? Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE) 
Mr President, Mr Tusk, Mr Barroso, you have been quoted, Mr Tusk, as saying that the Polish Presidency will primarily be characterised by the way it reacts to crises. It seems to me that your speech today showed that you have more than just crisis management on your agenda. You want to give Europe a direction. I believe this is a good thing, and my fellow Members on all sides of the House have emphasised this. You delivered a great speech. I would like to thank you warmly for that. You mentioned the debt crisis in Europe, calling for European solidarity. We, in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe give our emphatic backing to such solidarity. However, I would remind you of the other side of the coin. For us, this clearly means solidity. It was a lack of solidity and dubious lending policies over many years that led to this crisis. That is why our key demand is for a stability pact that genuinely has teeth. It is ironic that in 2003, the German Chancellor and the French President watered down the Stability and Growth Pact and that the present German Chancellor and French President decided while strolling on the beach in Deauville that the pact for the future should once again be toothless. Mr Tusk, do not let this discourage you! Set to work – as Mr Verhofstadt has pointed out, the direction is clear. A second area where I would encourage you to press on boldly is one of the focal points of your Presidency: progressing the common security and defence policy. You will hear some sceptical, reluctant reactions from the capitals of Europe. Do not let this discourage you. The Americans are withdrawing. We have Libya, we have Syria, Eastern Moldova and Georgia – we Europeans have a lot on our collective plate. Strengthen the European External Action Service, promote democracy and human rights, continue to develop security policy instruments and the European Defence Agency. Push for progress in the interest of Europe! There is much to be done. I wish you the best of luck. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, you have mentioned that you will be holding Quartet negotiations on 11 September and I am very pleased about that. I am equally pleased, although perhaps also a little surprised, because you are setting your sights very high. You have already clearly stated that you expect this meeting to result in a statement that will bring the Palestinians and the Israelis back to the negotiating table. You have publicly set yourself a very challenging objective and I very much hope that you achieve it. Why am I hoping for this? On the one hand, for the sake of the people in the region and, on the other, because I am concerned once more about the common foreign and security policy. Mr Sarkozy has announced that he will behave in a certain way and the German Government has said that it will do something quite different. If we then find ourselves in a situation where the Palestinians present their concerns to the General Assembly, I am again worried about the unity of the Member States on a central foreign policy question and it is you who will bear the brunt of the criticism. Therefore, I wish you every success in these Quartet negotiations. My second point is that you have said that democracy is important and that the people in the region want democracy. That is certainly true. However, I believe that we should not lose sight of the fact that what the people really want is dignity and we should focus all our attention on this issue. They want to be able to live in dignity under the rule of law, with no arbitrary confiscation of property. They want habeas corpus and they want to be free from constant threats by the secret police. They want jobs and the prospect of a positive future, so that a free trade agreement with us really will bring results. Of course, they also want democracy and the option of shaping their own political system. However, that is one part of a bigger picture. Finally, they also want peace and an end to this terrible violence. I would like to emphasise once again that we should take the measures proposed by Mr Verhofstadt here in relation to Syria. It would be very good if we could work closely together with Turkey and make genuine progress. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

Madam President, I, too, wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs De Keyser, for her excellent report. This report has a normative section and an operative section. In the normative section, we try to establish a European consensus on what, from our point of view, constitutes democracy, what it absolutely must encompass. The Council has been unable to come to such agreement for years, because the Member States have very different traditions. Nonetheless, I believe that we can all agree that what we have included in recitals C to O are clearly elements of democracy which must be taken into account when promoting democracy. The operative section deals with the instruments. What instruments are available to us? The EIDHR has been mentioned. We find that it is often too slow, too bureaucratic, too complicated and has scope for improvement. The Instrument for Stability could also be faster. The report states that we always react in an immediate and integrated manner to situations; however, it took weeks before election workers could be sent to Tunisia to provide technical assistance under the Instrument for Stability. There is still a lot of work to do here. That is why the European Endowment for Democracy is being discussed, because we want a faster, more flexible instrument. I believe – and this is important and applies to all the groups – that there are some who are more enthusiastic, while others are somewhat more reticent. We need clarification from the European External Action Service, from the Commission and from the Polish Presidency of the Council, which considers this an important project. Where are the boundaries between the instruments that we have and what a European Endowment for Democracy is supposed to do? Who does what with which instruments and when? Mr Howitt addressed the question of election observations in this context. I believe that this is very important. Please look at paragraphs 60 to 63: they contain this House’s view on election monitoring. We want stringent criteria for selecting countries; we are of the opinion that they are not always stringent enough. We want comprehensive political concepts. We want recommendations to be followed-up. I think these are some of the points that need to be highlighted. What happens next? This report contains numerous calls for action, by the EEAS and by Parliament. How can we make sanctions more effective? How can we make the instruments more effective? What are we doing for women and democracy, for gender equality? What are we doing in the EEAS delegations across the world? There are numerous calls for action to be drawn from this report. Let us get to work. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

Mr President, Prime Minister, President of the Commission, my group is of the view that the Hungarian Presidency has achieved some truly important successes. This was a difficult presidency, with the financial crisis, Fukushima and the developments in North Africa. We have your government to thank, Mr Orbán – particularly your foreign minister, Mr Martonyi, who is sitting alongside you, and also your Minister of State for EU Affairs, Mrs Győri – for the fact that really outstanding work has been done here. This is particularly true as regards economic policy. What has been achieved in terms of stabilising the euro has undoubtedly been a great success, although it remains an important task. The adoption of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and also the Treaty establishing the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) – these are great and important achievements. The implementation of the first European Semester, the coordination of Member States’ budgetary policy – this is progress par excellence
 when it comes to preventing the indebtedness that has been commonplace in the past. There is one outstanding matter, which you yourself have mentioned: the so-called ‘six pack’ – the economic governance package. Our group will insist on this and we will continue to insist that we strengthen the Stability and Growth Pact, and consequently we will also stand firm on the issue of the reversed qualified majority. I believe it was right to postpone the decision for the time being and to continue the negotiations. Joseph Daul has said here that we need a convincing economic policy package if we are to have a stable euro. We feel that the Stability and Growth Pact is key to this. It needs teeth, and that is why the negotiations should continue. There are a few other policy areas in which you were very successful during your Presidency. Croatia has been mentioned, and the conclusion of the accession negotiations. I can only endorse what Mr Swoboda has already said: this is a most significant step forward for the whole region. After three years, the directive on consumer rights has at last been finalised. Progress has been made on the energy efficiency plan. One further very important matter from our point of view, and also in the view of Europe’s small and medium-sized enterprises, is the European patent, which President Barroso has just mentioned. A whole raft of really noteworthy successes achieved under your Presidency. Prime Minister, when we met in Budapest we said to you that we would assess your Presidency fairly, but that naturally we would also look at what is going on in your country. From the point of view of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, we regret that your Presidency has been overshadowed by the controversy surrounding the media law. We would have liked to have seen a different media law. Although the Commission brought about some amendments, to our way of thinking these were not in the key areas. We would also like to have seen the Constitution being drawn up by the process proposed by the Venice Commission. I believe that this watchfulness of each Member State – including my own, by the way – by the rest of Europe must continue if the European Union is to make progress. Freedom dies little by little – whether it is freedom of the press or freedom to travel. In a quarter of an hour customs officers will take up their places on the German-Danish and Danish-Swedish borders in order to reintroduce border controls. That is a development against which we might have wished the Presidency to have spoken out more strongly. This whole area – freedom to travel, asylum policy, revision of the Dublin II Regulation, the attack on the freedom to travel within the Schengen area – is where we would have liked to have seen greater commitment from your Presidency. Overall your Presidency has been a successful one, but we would have preferred it not to have been overshadowed by the criticisms that I have mentioned. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Madam President, Mr Weber’s motion makes good sense. We have completed a truly enormous programme with some major, significant reports. We now no longer have any legislative reports to vote on. It is already after half past one. It would be best to postpone the non-legislative reports to the July part-session. This would be no great loss. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, following the confidence vote yesterday in Athens with the result that we are all aware of, the Bild
 newspaper in Germany printed the headline ‘Greek leader has survived – Europe can breathe a sigh of relief’. I have to say that I was also pleased with the result of this vote, but I think it is far too early to breathe a sigh of relief. This is because we now need to put the substantial austerity package successfully in place in the next week. That is the next big test. Even then, we will be a long way from being able to breathe a sigh of relief. Further steps and measures will still need to be taken before this crisis is overcome. I believe that what has been said here is right. The people in Greece need a light at the end of the tunnel. However, I would also like to make it quite clear that the people in the countries from which most of the aid is coming also need a light at the end of the tunnel. They have the feeling that they are giving and giving and giving and there is no end to it. In Greece the people have the feeling that they are saving and saving and saving and there is no end to it. That is why a growth strategy is so important. That is why privatisations are crucial to break open and liberalise this encrusted economy. That is why it is right for us resolutely to promote and support the reduction of public debt in Greece. Democracy has to endorse this. What is happening with respect to Mr Samaras is totally irresponsible. However, it is right for us to give guarantees for investments, for example. It is also right for us to draw out unused EU funds, Mr Barroso, and make them available to Greece, because ultimately it will not only be Greece but the whole of Europe that will benefit from more growth. If we look ahead slightly, one thing is also important: the Stability and Growth Pact must be strengthened. We must prevent future crises. This is where this reverse qualified majority comes in. No ordinary citizen will understand what that actually means. To put it plainly, either the Stability and Growth Pact has this strange technical element that I have just mentioned, and then the Stability and Growth Pact will have teeth, or else it does not. Then we will not be able to support this package. Reverse qualified majority voting in the preventive phase of the Stability and Growth Pact is absolutely essential as far as we are concerned. Mr Barroso, I am extremely pleased to hear you explain once again that the Commission is of exactly the same opinion. I would like to see substantial support for this project from this House. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Madam President, it is hardly conceivable that our relations with Russia are based on an agreement dating from 1994. We have not succeeded in resolving anything new since then. We alternate between cooperation and confrontation with Russia. Where the neighbourhood is concerned, we deplore the war with Georgia, the pressure brought to bear on Ukraine, the recognition of President Lukashenko in Belarus and the split in the Republic of Moldova as a result of the conflict in Transnistria. At the same time, our cooperation with Russia in the Security Council on the issue of Libya or on Iran’s nuclear programme is pleasing. As regards Russia itself, the new paradigm is what is known as the Partnership for Modernisation. Yet what is modernity without democracy? In the list of priorities that you have just given, Commissioner Füle, human rights came after cucumbers and the rule of law after tomatoes. Is that the best we can expect in this area? Do we expect nothing more of Russia’s democratisation? I believe that as Parliament, we must make it clear that we do expect something; for example, fair elections – there must be progress there. There is, though, one thing that I would like to say quite clearly: such progress is often to be achieved at expert level. Two summits a year is too much. Let us have one summit, as we do with America. We have enough exchange with Russia in the specialist areas. Otherwise, we will have summits with no real content, and that would not be good either. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Madam President, Baroness Ashton, we are still a long way from a common foreign policy which is really worthy of the name. You are being criticised for this, but it sometimes seems to me that you have been made the scapegoat in a situation which is outside your control and which is caused by the fact that the Member States do not have the political will to agree on a common approach. Let us take the example of Libya. First of all, Italy blocked the imposition of sanctions, then France recognised the transitional council in Benghazi without any consultation and, finally, Germany abstained during the vote on the resolution in the UN Security Council. There is nothing you can do to change this, but it gives Europe a negative image. In Syria, we should have imposed stronger sanctions, but here, we also needed unanimity. There are some Member States – Greece, Italy and Spain have been mentioned in the press and Germany may also be one of them – which are opposed to this. In this case, you must stand up here and say: ‘We have only been able to put 13 on the list’. The need for unanimity is paralysing us. It no longer works with 27 Member States. We must make the next quantum leap forward in our common foreign and security policy. I would like to make this quite clear to Mr Tannock and his Tory friends. What can you do? Make public the fact that European cooperation has failed and identify who is responsible. Make use of the community instruments, in particular, to promote democracy. I was surprised to hear you speaking here so openly about the European Endowment for Democracy. We are in the process of drawing up a report on the subject with Mrs De Keyser as the rapporteur and we are evaluating what the requirements are. I must make it quite clear that we do not want a second European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR), which is bureaucratic, slow, over-complex and unpolitical. We need a solution that is unbureaucratic, fast, simple and political. If you can bring this about, you will have our full support. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

Madam President, Mr Le Hyaric, I see things in exactly the same way as you do. The unity between Hamas and Fatah really is an historical step forward. It may now perhaps be possible to make progress in the process of reconciliation between the Palestinians and the Israelis. Baroness Ashton has made it very clear that the second flotilla will be a completely unnecessary provocation which could harm this process. Would you and your group now distance yourself from your support for this flotilla in the same way as happened yesterday here in Parliament with the substantial involvement of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left? Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, spring has arrived in the Mediterranean, but in the Gulf and in Syria, winter still reigns. The images of violence which we are seeing are horrifying. Several hundred people have been killed and Amnesty International and the United Nations have produced alarming reports. The calls which the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are making are clear. We want a special session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva to be held as quickly as possible. The Council of Europe and the Member States of the European Union which are represented on the UN Human Rights Council should take up this call. The UN Council is always very quick to act when it comes to taking one side in the Middle East conflict. It is now time for it to face the real challenge presented by these extreme violations of human rights. We need reform, we need a move to democracy, and we need an arms embargo. All of these things have already been mentioned here. I watched the speech made by President Assad of Syria live. This is a medieval-style dictatorship which uses western PR agencies to present its representatives as pseudo-modernising influences in glossy magazines. The agencies and the magazines should be asking themselves whether this is really the right thing to do. Now to Yemen. This is where there is, in my opinion, the greatest danger: the risk of a split between north and south, an active al-Qaeda cell and the danger of a failed state. We already have a failed state of this kind in the case of Somalia and our Atalanta mission is in operation in the Gulf of Aden. Europe has a direct interest in the area and we need to hear more than what the representative of the Council has said here today. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, it has been said here that it is not the euro that is in crisis, but the Member States that have got into debt. That is the nub of the crisis – irresponsible indebtedness that has been carried on for many years. That is what we must now stop. That is why it is right that the European Stability Mechanism must be strict. That is also why it is right that this has been the case in the bail-outs that have taken place. That is also why it is right that Ireland is not given an interest rate reduction. This indebtedness must end. Once again I am hearing the social democrats talk of a distinction between good and bad debt. Of course investment is different to consumption, but at some point too much good debt becomes bad debt too. We need to be fair to future generations, we need sustainable public finances – and then the euro will become stable again. The pact for the euro involves too little Community method. That has been said here, and quite rightly so. I share this view. I would like to say a final word about Libya. The Council has supported resolution 1973. We must now look to the future. I agree with Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra when he says that France has played a very good role. However, had Turkey been invited to the Elysée summit then we would not be having these problems in NATO and the situation would be considerably easier for us all. Moreover, I hope that the newly appointed head of the transitional government in Libya will soon be visiting us here in Europe. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, we have been addressed specifically here. Of course, we have confidence in Commissioner Kroes’s work. Her examination of the secondary law was exemplary. We wish the Commissioner examining the primary law had done her work in the same way, as this is where the problem lies. (Applause from the left)
 The reality of the situation includes those things just mentioned by Mr Swoboda, namely that, in the opinion of both the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the amendments are inadequate. Hungary’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Public Administration and Justice, Mr Navracsics, has himself admitted that this was not a significant amendment of the media law. I could mention the protection of journalistic sources, which still remains unregulated, or the composition and powers of the media authority. All of these are matters that still need to be discussed. I would therefore like to state, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, that we will not withdraw the motion for a resolution, but rather request that the vote take place. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, this debate here in the European Parliament makes one thing clear, and that is that we are not neutral when it comes to this conflict. We are on the side of the democratic revolution. Gaddafi must go and Europe must play an active role in bringing that about. There is a sharing of the workload here at the international level. We are discussing a no-fly zone, something for which – as Mr Schulz correctly identified – the backing of the UN Security Council is required. What do we do if Moscow and Beijing do not grant their assent? Well, then we would have to close this loophole in international law. We would have to take on the responsibility of protecting the unarmed population regardless, with the aid of the Arab League and the African Union, but also with the aid of an active role on the part of the European Union. Military implementation would then be the responsibility of NATO and its partners, but politically and economically, the European Union would continue to also have the key role to play, long after, in such a scenario, NATO and the United Nations had finished playing their major roles. There is one thing that I would like to say quite clearly, and that is that I was very pleased, Mr Schulz, to hear you say that we need a free trade zone. This is because, if we do not allow these people’s products into the EU, they will continue to come across the Mediterranean in coracles and in their masses to overwhelm Lampedusa. We certainly do not want that. Let us, therefore, create the free trade zone, let us allow the products into the EU, so that the people there also have an economic future in their democratised countries. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE
).

 Mr President, the contrast is striking! The revolution, the change taking place in the Arab world is fascinating for all of us. We are trying to help. We have discussed Libya today. In recent days and weeks, we have discussed Egypt and Tunisia. Yet, at the same time, we have a standstill in the peace process. Against this backdrop, we must say quite clearly here, Baroness Ashton, that you did us a service when you managed to convene a meeting of the Quartet. To produce movement now, at this period of profound insecurity in the region, and profound insecurity in Israel, was an extremely positive service. I should like to make this very clear. You occasionally have to endure criticism from this House, too. For this reason, some praise is perhaps also in order. As far as the contents are concerned, I should like to make it clear that I do not believe that Israel is sceptically disposed towards democracy in Arab countries. It is merely that these changes have not yet come to an end. When and if there are democracies there, I agree completely with Mr Pöttering and with you too, Mr Swoboda, then there will clearly be a great opportunity finally to get the Middle East peace process going too. Settlement building must stop, that is clear in any case, as must the sophistry with which it is defended. There is a consensus among all groups in this House on that point. Connected to the uprising in the Arab world, we also have experienced protests against the Hamas regime in the Gaza Strip. The situation in the Palestinian Territories is in no way simple. Democratisation must succeed here too. For the time being, we fortunately have a moderate and conservative partner in the West Bank, but that is absolutely not the case in the Gaza Strip. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

Madam President, Mr Füle has just made it completely clear that Turkey and the European Union need one another. We are important neighbours, we are allies in NATO, and many people of Turkish origin live in Member States of the European Union. We must show respect for one another. I very much support visa facilitation for businesspeople and students, just as you have said. I am also in favour of integrating Turkey much more closely into the structures of the common security and defence policy. I would like to see Cyprus bringing an end to its blockade in this area. When we look at North Africa, it is clear that Turkey is a role model for many countries in the region. All of this is very good. Then we come to the accession process and we find that many chapters are blocked. It is extremely difficult to open new chapters. There are only three chapters left and the competition chapter is almost at the stage of opening. What will happen when the last chapters are opened? Will Turkey and the European Union no longer have anything to say to one another? That surely cannot be the case! Therefore, we must consider very carefully how to progress with the accession process and whether or not we can retain the current procedure, which involves Parliament commenting on the Commission’s progress report by means of a resolution. Our 2010 report is highly critical, but also constructive. It deals with fundamental rights which are self-evident, particularly for Liberals: freedom of the press, freedom of speech, expression and assembly, student demonstrations, trade union rights and freedom of religion. For years, we have been calling for improvements in freedom of religion, but far too little progress has been made. The arrest of Ahmet Şık and Nedim Şener and the interference in the work of political foundations in Turkey are giving us great cause for concern. This is covered by the first Copenhagen criterion. It is a central issue, because it is the political criterion. If Turkey cannot move forward with its internal democratic constitution, I believe that we will still have serious problems in some areas, quite apart from the deadlock in the Council. In diplomatic terms, we need Turkey and Turkey also needs us. In democratic terms, there is still a great deal to be done in Turkey. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, the Treaty of Lisbon makes new demands of European Union foreign policy and development policy. One has been mentioned here: coherence. In other words, our various instruments, the European External Action Service, the European Investment Bank and the Commission must act in a consistent manner. The Treaty of Lisbon also provides for greater parliamentary control, greater transparency and joint decisions on these matters. All of this will enhance the quality of the debate on foreign policy, particularly if we have greater transparency as a result of the participation of the relevant committees – primarily the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Development – in this House. One result of this transparency is that this Parliament has resolved to remove Belarus from the list of countries in which the European Investment Act can act without first having another debate here in this House. Are human rights being respected? Have opposition politicians been released? Does the state respect the property of its citizens? Is there freedom of the press? Are entrepreneurs able to act freely? Are there free trade unions? In our relationship with such an important neighbour – one which is located directly on the border of the European Union – these are all matters which need to be debated first, before the European Investment Bank becomes active there. I am very pleased that the House has taken up this suggestion and I call on the Council to do the same. Yesterday we had a debate on Egypt. We debated the instruments and what we could do. Baroness Ashton called for the ceiling applied to the European Investment Bank to be raised. Parliament is happy to pursue this. We need to improve how we work together with Egypt and Tunisia, with North Africa. That is only right. It is also a good example of how this Parliament can react quickly. The same is now required of the Council, which must act accordingly. I believe that our foreign policy instruments, especially if they are market-oriented, together with the loans from the European Investment Bank can do a lot to assist with development and economic growth in North Africa. That is precisely what is needed. If there is growth there, if there is democracy there, then we will also have fewer migrants arriving at our borders. If I may specifically address our fellow Members from the extreme right, I would like to say that your arguments are really far too rudimentary and simplistic – if not primitive. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the course of a revolution is seldom predictable. That was the case with the American and the French revolutions, as well as the major revolution in Europe in 1989/91. It is important for us to be clear about one thing: this is and remains the Egyptian revolution. It is not a European revolution that we would be able to steer. Instead, what Baroness Ashton is doing there is right, namely to listen and not to try to dictate events there as Europe would wish. However, one thing is key: there should not only be an election in Egypt in August, the Egyptians must have a genuine election. It is good that the Muslim Brotherhood has involved itself in the process to amend the constitution, has founded a party and will take part in elections. However, the secular powers must be equally involved so that the Egyptians will have a genuine election in this revolution for freedom. I would like to say a few words about adaptation of the instruments. That is jargon and hardly anyone understands what it means. What does it mean? Firstly, it means providing more money to enable the European Investment Bank to do something. But what else does it mean? We need a European foundation for democracy to enable us, in future, to work more efficiently, more quickly and more democratically with these civil societies. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, I would ask you to be more courageous. Go to Cairo before the Council of Foreign Ministers. Speak with the government representatives and with the opposition there. Come back to Brussels and tell your colleagues what you have seen and heard. Set the agenda and do not listen to 27 different opinions, with which it is then very difficult to actually do anything. When Mr Mingarelli goes to Tunisia – something that I view very positively – inform us so that we are aware and so that the public is aware that Europe has a presence there. I first found out that the American was there and only then did I hear that Mr Mingarelli was also there. You are the foreign minister for Europe and I would earnestly advise you, on the one hand, to be our foreign minister. On the other hand, as foreign minister for Europe, you must not jump through every hoop that people put in front of you. Comparisons have been made here today with 1989, and I think that is right. I believe that Tahrir Square in Cairo in 2011 is equivalent to Alexanderplatz in Berlin in 1989. A revolution is taking place there. However, if we recall the revolution of 1989 for a moment we will remember that we had the same dilemma then. We wanted freedom, stability and democracy, and we overlook the fact that this process, the transition from a stable dictatorship to a democracy, is rarely peaceful, orderly and stable. From this point of view, diplomacy, organisation and caution also have their place. That should not distract us from the fact that we are extremely pleased about this revolution. It is a revolution against the dictatorship and for freedom. I do believe that Europe can dictate the setup in these countries. However, our joy needs to be apparent, but one thing is also clear, and that is that, even with limited influence, it will certainly not be possible to build a state with Mr Mubarek. With the violence today in Tahrir Square, the last vestige of legitimacy for this ruler in Egypt has been lost. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Madam President, Mr Orbán, in an article which appeared yesterday in a major German newspaper, you cited Otto Graf Lambsdorff as one of your role models. We last met at his funeral service in December 2009. You attended as a private individual and we very much appreciated that. I would like to ask you to honour his memory by respecting, following and defending the principles of the liberal constitutional state in all the measures that you take. You have responded to the criticism of the media law with two arguments. You have said that this is a campaign against Hungary and against you personally and that the campaign is unspecific. I would like to make it very clear on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe that this is not a campaign. It is an issue for Europe if fundamental freedoms are interfered with and called into question in a Member State of the European Union. I would like to say to the Commission and to Mr Barroso that a legal assessment must be carried out by Mrs Kroes. However, the Commission is not just a solicitor’s office; it is also a political body. The assessment must take a political form and it must be completed quickly. Your second argument is that the criticism is unspecific. Mr Orbán, I would like to make a few specific points: slander, defamation and incitement to hatred are against the law in Germany and in other democracies. That is what the criminal law is there for. Please let the criminal law take effect in this case. You need to improve the legal protection in Article 163, change the composition and the powers of the media authority in Articles 123 and 183, together with a great deal of other things. There are many specific points. I suggest that you postpone the application of the law until the Commission’s assessment has been carried out and this must be done as quickly as possible. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, there is one thing that it is important for citizens, too, to understand: the European Union is not in debt. We are talking here about a debt crisis in our Member States. The European Union is the only political level in Europe that is debt free. I would also like it to remain that way. However, we are joined together in a shared destiny by the euro. In this regard, Mrs Harms and Mr Schulz rightly lamented the lack of European spirit. Deauville was a mistake. Germany and France have been blackmailed by the United Kingdom. The Commission must impose the sanctions, not the finance ministers. Mr Van Rompuy, the automatic nature of the sanctions during the preventive phase was sacrificed in Deauville. The finance ministers must take the decision again here. These are the ones who were previously responsible for triggering the financial crisis and the debt crisis in the Member States. What is economic governance? Everyone is talking about economic governance, but what does it actually mean in specific terms? Do we really want the European Union to interfere in the details of our labour market and social policy? There is a big question mark here. Setting the legal framework for entrepreneurship, stimulating growth, they are all well and good, but above all putting public finances in order once again in the Member States – that is the challenge. That is why the European Semester is so important, and that is why it must be implemented. (

 Mr President, of course I am happy to answer that. Mr Schulz is, of course, also a member of the Bureau of the Social Democratic Party of Germany and will also occasionally make statements here which are probably not entirely congruent. There is, however, one thing I would like to say, and it is that, if Mr Schulz can show me who from the FDP was present in Deauville, I would be grateful to him. We made a relatively clear statement on this at the end of the summit. I believe that the key point, namely actually relinquishing the automatic nature of the sanctions in the preventive phase, was criticised by us in no uncertain terms. If we get the change to the treaty, this will be rectified retrospectively. However, the decision made in Deauville was clearly a mistake. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, the European External Action Service is one of the most important decisions in the Treaty of Lisbon. It is now only six weeks until Baroness Ashton will no longer primarily be the Minister responsible for establishing an EU foreign ministry; she will instead be the Foreign Minister for Europe, and that is a good thing. This will commence on 1 December and we wish you every success in this regard. We have had many debates and we have achieved a great deal. It was a fruitful political battle. The lack of democracy associated with the old common foreign and security policy has been eliminated, there is a greater degree of accountability and the quality of the public debate has improved. There will be more stringent budgetary control, the prerequisites for a genuine team spirit have been created and national diplomats can, if they so wish, remain in the European External Action Service. There will be no geographical quotas – you could sometimes get the impression that this is the most important issue here, but it most definitely is not. Germany, in particular, would benefit greatly from a quota, but I am nevertheless against this. A common form of training will be provided. I believe that the prerequisites for a successful EEAS are in place. In other words, the European Parliament is almost happy. We would be really happy if you were now to take advantage of the opportunity and actually establish the appropriate structure for conflict prevention and crisis management that has been promised. Then we would have European added value right from the start. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, this, of course, was a European Council meeting that focused, among other things, on foreign policy. At almost the same time, in the United Nations General Assembly, China and numerous developing countries voted against granting special status to you, Mr Van Rompuy, and also to Baroness Ashton. This ought to be addressed with China at the summit on 6 October and it needs to be discussed in no uncertain terms. However, it demonstrates quite clearly the reality of the situation: the European Union still has a long way to go to achieve political power. We are currently an economic power and, for that reason, citizens expect us to do something in this area to combat the economic crisis. That brings me to the task force. Mr Van Rompuy, you said there was broad consensus. At the end of the month, this consensus will be put to the test. On 29 September, the Commission will present its documents. You have already said that you will present a draft on 27 September. I hope that these will be in line with each other to some extent. Incidentally, I would recommend that you speak Dutch more often; I very much enjoyed your statement on the Community method. As regards macro-economic surveillance, there is apparently consensus in the task force – great! Monitoring of national fiscal policies within the European Semester – that is a good thing and something that we expressly welcome. As regards the sanctions, you say that more work is needed. We all know what that means: there is no consensus. The test will therefore come at the end of the month. Why, as Parliament, do we insist so strongly on the Community method? Mr Schulz has just mentioned this. We are still in the process of weighing up the Lisbon machinery. However, the crucial point is this: the European Council is now a European Union body. What that means in terms of its understanding of itself, we do not yet know exactly. If often appears to us to be a gathering of Member States representing only their national interests. One national interest is very clear: that of the United Kingdom, which is to have as little regulation as possible in the financial sector. The Community method represents our only chance of getting the interests of Europe as a whole to prevail over individual national interests. That is why this House insists on the application of the Community method. In light of your Dutch statements, I am pleased that you view this in the same way. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mr Hughes, we have worked together before and I have high regard for your work. However, in your analysis of the economic crisis and of the measures that are now to be taken, you are seriously wide of the mark, just like the majority of your group. Would you not agree that it was excessive debt – in other words, too much expenditure in pursuing so-called policy objectives – that triggered the current crisis? Would you not also agree that, for that reason, precisely the right thing to do now is to focus on stability and a sound fiscal policy in order to overcome this crisis? Holger Krahmer  (ALDE

 Madam President, a comment on the Rules of Procedure: where are the Greens when environmental associations organise exhibitions in Parliament and confront elected MEPs with the words ‘we are the voice of the citizens’? I sometimes get the feeling that the Greens only accept democracy if the arguments suit them. Holger Krahmer  (ALDE

 Mr President, Ms Lepage, are you therefore willing to accept that it is a question of physics rather than a lobbying question; that if you burn gas more efficiently than coal, there are fewer CO2 
emissions than with coal-based power generation? This means, for example, that if we ultimately shut down our coal-fired power stations in Europe – a development that is already taking place in the United States – and bring gas-fired power stations on stream, CO2 
emissions will fall. That is my question. My second question, which follows on from the first, is as follows: are you willing to accept that mining less coal possibly also has less of an impact on the environment than shale gas exploration may have, in other words that coal mining has a greater environmental impact than shale gas exploration?

Mr President, Ms Wils, my question is along exactly the same lines: what impression do you have of freely elected MEPs – to think that we are at the beck and call of industry interests, that we are not smart enough to form our own opinion and that we need exhibitions and lobbying before acting as stooges for some lobby or other? Why do you assume that Parliament is being overrun by the interests of lobbyists? Why do you not assume that there can be a fair and open debate on all issues, particularly in connection with the environment, climate and energy? Holger Krahmer  (ALDE

Mr President, Mr Groote, there is no technology without risks! The perfect energy generation technology does not exist. I believe the same applies to what we are discussing here today. I am very much in favour of a rational discussion. What we are currently experiencing is a new arrival on the energy markets in the form of unconventional resources, applying mainly to gas, but also to oil. It is neither appropriate to get carried away with euphoria about the great future of gas, nor, as some of my colleagues from the Greens and Left have done here, to paint a picture of terrifying scenarios which bear absolutely no resemblance to reality. I think we should bear in mind that these unconventional resources have the potential to change all the familiar energy supply relationships between suppliers and consumers, and that economic efficiency calculations for existing energy sources are also called into question. We should face up to this development. We should acknowledge that it could also be an opportunity for Europe and not only a risk, and we should prepare ourselves to take up and use new technologies in a positive way, to weigh up opportunities and risks fairly and not to fall into ideological debates. Holger Krahmer,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.

Mr President, my role in this great financial market regulation process is limited to the issue of the extent to which industry is affected by financial market regulation – here I speak on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy – since there is a need for financial market regulation, which we are addressing with this directive and regulation package. However, there is a lot of activism involved in financial market regulation and the Commission’s first proposal on the subject would simply have led, through questions of definition and interpretation, to companies in the real economy – here I am thinking of smaller industrial enterprises such as German public utility companies and agricultural cooperatives – suddenly being treated like banks, for example when they hedge delivery relationships with suppliers and customers on the futures markets. This would have been the collateral damage of financial market regulation and would have been in no one’s interest. In my view it is clear that industrial companies must be treated differently to banks. The majority of futures transactions made by these companies are for hedging purposes, not speculation. Even where these transactions do involve speculation, it must be said that I do not know of a single industrial company or energy supplier that is of systemic importance. The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy was very clear in its opinion on this subject and I must say that I am pleased that these aspects managed to appear in the final package. To that extent, in the end we certainly did well to include this ancillary aspect. Holger Krahmer,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, firstly, I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur. We have recently enjoyed very constructive cooperation on this subject in particular. The result that we have before us today is a compromise, and it is in the nature of compromise that everyone is both satisfied and dissatisfied with it at the same time. Overall, it is a step in the right direction when it comes to the quality of marine fuels in the European Union. We have been making policy on air quality in other areas for years and, in my opinion, we often overshoot the mark and pass measures that are not particularly efficient. In this case, we are on the right track. Nonetheless, I have certain objections here. In reaching agreement so quickly at first reading, we have disregarded some of the arguments and concerns of some players in Europe’s internal market. In 2015 at the latest, when it becomes compulsory to use what are, in fact, sulphur-free fuels in the Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs), which is essentially in the North Sea and the Baltic, there may be consequences of this legislation that can already be foreseen today but which, at the end of the day, we are completely ignoring. It cannot be in the interests of this legislation if more expensive fuel for goods transport by ferry in the North Sea and Baltic results in goods vehicles turning around at the ferry ports and going by road instead, where this is a possible alternative to short sea crossings. We have given no thought to that, and it was not considered when the Marpol Convention was concluded either. We have simply disregarded this argument. Consequently, I fear that we will have to look at this situation again in the northern regions in two years’ time. I think it is important to harmonise things in Europe, but we also have to be clear that this cannot happen at the very highest level. I can quite understand some of the arguments from southern Member States, particularly those bordering the Mediterranean, which are dubious about this idea and feel that they have other priorities than the introduction of sulphur-free fuel. It costs money, and you can only ever spend your budget resources once. Consequently, I see this as a step in the right direction but, in the end, unequal competition within the EU has been written into the legislation here. My final point is that compensating Northern Europeans for their hardships by means of State aid cannot be the way to go since, in the end, this would distort competition between the countries of Northern Europe. Some countries will pay, while others will not. Holger Krahmer  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I, too, would like to thank Mr Gerbrandy for the sound piece of work that he has presented here. I can also support much of what is in the report. I consider it a good thing that we are making the effort to say that we have to overcome the obstacles in the internal market when it comes to removing barriers to the exploitation of resources and the exchange of resources. I also feel, however, that a lot of things that have been said here are not quite correct. I feel I must briefly mention these. Jan, the price of copper is not going up because copper is becoming more scarce, neither are the costs of raw materials at AkzoNobel and Unilever going up because the raw materials are becoming scarcer. Instead, it is because we are printing so much money, and because a lot of money is looking for safe investments and increasingly it does not find these in government bonds – which is why much of it is ending up in the commodity markets. That is one reason why prices of raw materials are rising; not so much because we are about to completely run out of some raw materials and they will no longer be available. I think we need to look more carefully at the causes here. It generally has little to do with a scarcity of resources. There are two things in the report that I find hard to stomach and that I consider to be sending out completely the wrong signals. The first is the call to extend the scope of the Ecodesign Directive. We should stick with the principle that we will find the best solutions through competition and not by political edict – we have already heard the term ‘eco-diktat’ used in this context. The second point is that we in Europe, which is no longer growing and is facing catastrophic developments, should call for new taxes in order to manage our resources.

 That is a matter of political judgment. I would simply remind you that the central bank – this has nothing to do with this debate, but I have been asked the question so I must answer it – printed EUR 1 billion in the months of December and February in order to ease liquidity bottlenecks in the countries of southern Europe. In my opinion, it is apparent that we are on the way to losing price stability. I also think that this policy risks exacerbating the situation in the commodity markets, because a lot of money is flowing into precious metals and commodities there, since some investors see them as safe havens or want to make speculative transactions there too. Holger Krahmer  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mr Davies is aware that I am a fundamental opponent of the plan we are about to decide on. Political plans – particularly ones with very long-term goals – have always existed. These plans always had one thing in common: they were superseded by reality. The fact is that it makes absolutely no sense to plan how the world will be in 2050. This presumes too much knowledge. A great many things are bound to happen to us before then that we have not planned and that we cannot know or predict. The targets we set ourselves are, in the final analysis, arbitrary. We find ourselves comparing years and percentages that actually only have one constant feature, namely that they end in zero. Their relevance in terms of climate cannot really be explained in objective terms. We could just as easily deduct five years from the dates or add 5% to the percentage points. This would be just as arbitrary, but a little more ambitious. Why do we not do this? I would suggest that any of us still alive in 2050 should meet once again as venerable ladies and gentlemen to discuss the reality of these plans as part of a night’s entertainment. I have the feeling that would make a very entertaining evening indeed. It is also high time that we realised that European climate policy is a failure in global terms. Our pioneering role is not accepted and no one pays much attention to our standards. I would simply remind you of the inclusion of the aviation industry in emissions trading. We must take a much more reasonable approach. We will only achieve success in climate policy if the rest of the world comes on board. (Applause) Holger Krahmer  (ALDE

 Mr President, I believe that our decision today marks a black day for the European internal market. We are giving up on the concept of the internal market as a result of what is simply a reflex opposition to technology. This is obviously the latest fashion in the EU. We have criticised Denmark today for wanting to leave the Schengen Agreement for populist reasons. Essentially, we are now behaving in the same way. We must be fully aware of what we are doing. We are allowing the European Food Safety Authority to continue authorising genetically modified organisms (GMOs) on the internal market, but, at the same time, we are giving the Member States the legal means to deviate from these authorisation criteria. I hope that this will not set a precedent for other internal market decisions which are due to be made in future. We should pull ourselves together at this point and remember that we must not give up on the European idea at every opportunity. Holger Krahmer,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, in the discussion about whether or not it is sensible to come to an agreement during the first reading, we should not stick as closely to our principles as some Members have recommended. This should depend on the dossier. How are the discussions going? How controversial are they? In the case of the regulation of CO2
 emissions from light commercial vehicles, it is clear that the positions of the institutions were not very far apart. Therefore, it would not have been worthwhile to start the second reading process, except in the case of an issue which is the subject of heated discussions, in other words, the long-term target. The European Commission has never explained properly and it is also not clear from the impact assessments how a reduction in emissions from 203 grams today to 135 grams within 10 years – these are the figures just mentioned by Mrs Hedegaard – can be implemented in an economically viable way. This represents a cut of 34% and goes far beyond our other climate targets. Parliament’s most important job was to bring this target back to reality and to make it feasible in economic terms. This is what we have done. I am pleased that Mr Groote took up my argument, because a fleet average of 147 grams is a long way from what the Commission originally proposed, but it is also by far the most ambitious target set anywhere in the world. We should not try to persuade ourselves that a CO2
 limit for light commercial vehicles will save the world’s climate. I would like to thank everyone, including the rapporteurs, for their hard work. I am pleased that we have achieved a large majority for this compromise. Holger Krahmer,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

Madam President, Europe is rightly regarded as having the safest medicines in the world. With this legislation, which we have been discussing for a long time, for two years I believe, we will further improve levels of safety. I would like to thank Mrs Matias very much for taking on such a complex report as a new Member of Parliament. This was a huge task and she has done very well. It also involved a great deal of teamwork and I would like to thank everyone involved for this. We have produced some very good results. However, we must not lose sight of the fact that we can never achieve complete safety by means of regulations. This is true in every area, not just in the case of medicines. We have rightly concentrated on the essential issues, on the distinctions between different types of packaging and on traceability in the distribution chain. By differentiating between prescription and over-the-counter medicines, we are taking the right approach, because we must remember that every piece of legislation and every attempt to make products safer costs money. Therefore, it is reasonable not to include every pack of aspirins or every over-the-counter medicine automatically right from the start. Instead, the Commission or the agency must be given the task of monitoring the market and investigating developments. I believe that we can be proud of what we have achieved. We have produced a piece of legislation that brings real benefits. Most patients will probably not be aware that they are the result of EU law and, therefore, we must make this very clear.

 In overall terms, the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament supports the waste disposal directive. However, the subject of photovoltaic modules remains a problem. There is no understandable reason for excluding the entire sector from the regulations. We have a wide range of legislation governing waste streams. Therefore, it is not clear why a complete industry, which is expected to produce significant waste streams, is being exempted. For this reason, some of the FDP Members of the European Parliament have abstained from voting on the report. Holger Krahmer,

 Madam President, Commissioner, with this directive, we have before us legislation that has come about surprisingly quickly. I am very surprised that we have reached a compromise already which I and my group – and I expressly underline that – consider acceptable. When all is said and done, this piece of legislation has had a very difficult passage through Parliament. We expanded its scope, only to restrict it again straight away. We have quite incidentally attempted to declare certain substances highly dangerous; perhaps we should ask ourselves whether this legislation is really the right forum for such a debate. Personally, I did not think it a good idea to include PVC and nanomaterials in a directive on ‘hazardous substances’. I therefore think it sensible that this is no longer the case in the compromise. The previous speaker has just said so already, but it really is remarkable that we consider each gram of polluting substances so carefully and are then sometimes very irrational in our debates. Apparently, there are industries in Europe which we are ring-fencing for political reasons. This seems to be the case for enterprises in the renewable energy sector. The fact that we instantly exempt them completely from the scope of this legislation by saying that we have to put up with environmental pollution for the sake of climate protection and our objectives in the area of renewable energy is incomprehensible. It does not add up. I only hope that we do not do the same thing in the case of electronic waste – the decision on which is also imminent here – because that would be even more astonishing. Holger Krahmer  (ALDE

 – (DE)
 Mr President, it is good that we are looking at biocides, because they are hazardous, toxic substances. However, I am wondering why we do not base every piece of chemical legislation that we implement on the same system as that of REACH. We have passed the most comprehensive piece of chemical legislation in the world. The principles have been laid down: collect the data, evaluate it, authorise the product. Why are we using a different system for subsequent chemical legislation and defining new exclusion criteria, which ultimately also results in chemicals that we need and that, in some cases, do not have alternatives, being withdrawn from the market? I think that we will end up in a blind alley if we draw up our policy on chemicals purely from the perspective of toxic substances. Pest infestations can be much more dangerous, in particular, for small children because of the risks of disease transmission, than the few milligrams of biocides which we use to combat them. I would like to see the situation being put into proportion and, most importantly, I would like to see regulations that can be used not only by large companies which have the resources to enter into a discussion with the authorisation bodies, but also by smaller companies which supply useful products for niche markets.

 Madam President, I regret to say that we are debating a failed strategy here. Even at the time we adopted the directive, some voices of warning could already be heard asking whether including third countries in emissions trading without any consultation had really been thought through. Even today, we are ignoring the international situation. We imagine that we only have to grit our teeth and then everything will work out in Copenhagen, subsequent conferences and ICAO. However, it is not that simple. Nonetheless, we have an EU directive that has to be implemented. I would like the Commission to tell me how it intends to do this. I have four specific questions on this and I eagerly await the answers. Firstly, what steps is the Commission planning to take if third countries or third country airlines refuse to participate in the EU emissions trading system? Secondly, what measures are planned to bring about the inclusion of airlines in emissions trading? Thirdly, is it correct that the Commission is investigating or planning the withdrawal of EU flying rights from those airlines or third countries that refuse to participate in the EU emissions trading system? Fourthly, if such flying bans are imposed, how does the Commission expect the third countries concerned to react? May I remind you that the European Court of Justice has received actions from third countries that are simply refusing to be included in the EU’s emissions trading system. It is high time that we took a careful look at the day of reckoning that will come in 2012. I want to know what will happen then. What will we do then? Debating what position we are going to take at ICAO is of secondary importance to me right now. When it comes down to it, ICAO is nothing more than an assembly of the governments of the world that are acting from exactly the same vast differences in interest as they were in Copenhagen and, I suspect, as they will be in Cancún. My question to the Commission is therefore as follows: how are we going to get out of this dilemma? We are trying to implement a law that already exists, but which, in fact, cannot be implemented.

The FDP is basically in favour of positive labelling, or process labelling, for GMOs in food at European level in order to bring about the necessary transparency for consumers. In this case, however, we cannot agree to the fact that unequal treatment of different sectors is being demanded. While labelling is requested for the field of animal production, this is not the case for plant production. Unfair labelling of this kind for products of animal origin could distort the market to the disadvantage of one side. This counteracts our efforts to ensure fair competition, and is clearly in conflict with the principle of equality enshrined in our legal system. Holger Krahmer,

 Mr President, this debate was timed badly. I would like to have seen the Dutch team win, even if for the last time in this World Cup. This is perhaps a bad omen, because we are no longer allowed to watch, so they will probably not win after all. Commissioner, today – or more precisely tomorrow – we are completing a legislative package that we have been discussing for more than two years. It is not just controversy that is responsible for this, but also the European elections that have taken place in the meantime, and also the entry into force of a new EU Treaty which has meant that we have had to adjust a few things. However, I think that, if we can draw a conclusion from today’s debate, it is that we are voting on a compromise which completely deserves to be approved, even if, in some areas, we might do so with gritted teeth. I would like to emphasise two aspects. The first is the environmental requirements in industrial plants. What we are talking about here is the better implementation of best available techniques in Europe. I think that we have found a paragraph of exceptions in the compromise which is currently before us which gives the European Commission – Mr Potočnik, here I am addressing you directly – the tools to ensure over the next few years, better and more firmly than has been the case up to now, that the approximately 52 000 industrial plants in Europe which are affected by this finally make better use of best available techniques than they currently do. I have heard many arguments in this debate. I would like to take up one of these and deflect it, because I cannot comprehend it at all. It has often been said to me that the use of best available techniques is too expensive and that we will thereby endanger the competitiveness of European industry, and even more so in the crisis. I do not like to remember my past, but I come from the former GDR, East Germany. The economic and ecological collapse of the GDR was attributable to the fact that for decades, we neglected to invest in up-to-date technology. I think that every industry and every industrial enterprise, for its existence, needs to invest in up-to-date technology, because otherwise it will become less competitive, and this naturally means also reducing emissions of pollutants. Today, we have the opportunity to bring in a law which will improve this situation from which we are starting. The second part of the directive – and here we have some of the gritted teeth that I mentioned – deals with large combustion plants. We are talking once more – as we did before with the last directive – about renewing exceptions up to 2020, and in some cases 2023, for large combustion plants which do not have to achieve the environmental obligations and, in particular, the limits on air pollutants. Here I call on the Council, but also perhaps all of us here, to consider very carefully how sensible it really is that we regularly bring in ambitious environmental targets, and we discuss them and welcome them here, but always, whenever it comes to implementing them and transforming them into concrete legislation, then a tragedy begins in Europe. Then it suddenly becomes clear to the Member States how much it costs, which bills we have to pay, and then, as a rule, the ones who have done this in advance are punished. There are a number of Member States which now already meet the obligations, and which will, in the end, be left out in the cold. I will say it here once again: whether we are talking about industrial plants or large combustion plants – which essentially means coal power stations – we are not dealing with science fiction. We are not talking about things which are not available; on the contrary, this is up-to-date technology. Best available techniques – what is available on the market given competitive and cost factors – can be incorporated into these plants, and today, against this background, we are completing a legislative package which I think is better than what is currently in force, and therefore I would encourage us all to approve it. I would also like to thank my fellow Members, who, while sometimes pulling no punches, have worked with me on this for the last two years, for their support, their legwork and, above all, for the fact that almost all of the main groups have subscribed to this compromise. Holger Krahmer,

 Mr President, three relevant things have happened while we have been debating: first, it is clear that Europe will be the football world champions. A good omen, I think. Who exactly it will be, we will see. I do not want to express any preference now. The second is that Germany is receiving compliments from the United Kingdom. Chris Davies, many thanks! That also does not happen every day. It is certainly worth noting. Thirdly, all is still well with the world; even the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance finds football more important than environmental protection. Regrettably, our fellow Member, Mr Eickhout, has left us again. However, congratulations to our Dutch friends, of course. I wanted to talk about two aspects of the debate to which I have just been able to listen. The first is that I understand all the worries and woes of my Eastern European friends only too well. As an East German, I am also half-Eastern European. I understand that Eastern Europe cannot immediately catch up on every step of environmental policy that has been taken in the Western European countries in recent decades. In order to get high-level environmental protection, one has to be able to afford it. Yes, that is true. However, I think that – even if we allow for this – it is worth approving this compromise, because it will do justice to the different starting positions that many Member States find themselves in. Secondly, the argument that the use of best available techniques will endanger competitiveness, in particular, with respect to China, is not only false; it is also dangerous. We must deal with the fact that industrial processes in Asia are always cheaper than here. However, we will only meet this challenge if we implement best available techniques in as many branches of industry as possible. Those which do not do this will become less competitive. No one, including this law, is demanding that an industrial enterprise should be switched off tomorrow. No one is demanding a leap from 0 to 100 in order to achieve a particular pollutant limit within a week. We have enough transitional periods, but to say that we must go without for competitive reasons is false. I also think that with this directive, we have set a course not only for environmental policy, but also for industrial policy, a course for which it is worth working in the next few years. Holger Krahmer  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I think that we are making good legislation today. It is good and right that we are taking steps to avoid illegal timber being placed on the European internal market. However, what holds for all environmental laws also holds for this law: we cannot just put in what we want, but we must also always check whether what we put in and prescribe is feasible in the end. Therefore, I think it is right that we have, in the end, come to the compromise that due diligence only needs to take effect at the first instance of placing on the market, and also that only then can the import ban be issued. It would be much too bureaucratic to provide documentary evidence of origin throughout the entire supply chain within Europe. This was on the table at the beginning of the debate. I think that it is not realistic here to constantly keep new accounts and provide documentary evidence, from the timber yard and the sawmill right up to the furniture factory. This produces bureaucracy which, in case of doubt, produces more paper and thereby may even accelerate legal felling. Therefore, we must be moderate in this area and ensure balance. We have succeeded in doing this. I am not in favour of the approach that Mrs Hassi has just spoken of, namely that we can bring in a zero-risk policy. This is not only applicable to felling, and it will not work. Zero risk is not feasible. It produces bureaucracy and, above all, produces new risks. We must ensure that the laws remain balanced and feasible. In this sense, this compromise is a good one. I am pleased that we will be able to approve it with a large majority tomorrow.

 Providing consumers with information about food is undoubtedly important. However, the debate in Brussels has become a lobbying battle between large companies from the food industry and consumer protection organisations. There was no place in this debate for the reality of everyday life for consumers. The representatives of the German Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament are in favour of a minimum of labelling. Consumers should be able to make their purchasing decisions on the basis of transparent, legible information. Colour coded labelling influences consumers and does not form the basis for transparent information. The so-called guideline daily amounts (GDAs) also have their weak points. Instead of having neutral information about the amounts of nutrients per 100 grams or millilitres printed legibly on packaging, Parliament discussed whether the daily requirements of a 40-year-old woman could be used as the point of reference or whether the colour coding of nutrients was a useful decision-making tool. The proposed, far-reaching, mandatory requirements for the origin labelling of ingredients cannot be implemented in practice. We also rejected the idea of special national provisions, because the labelling system should, as far as possible, be standardised. For these reasons, we were not able to vote in favour of the proposed report. Holger Krahmer  (ALDE

 Commissioner, I have two specific questions for you. Firstly, in your paper, I see no analysis of the European negotiating position at international level. Have we really taken note of the fact that Europe’s influence in climate policy has diminished? Have we taken note of the fact that the political and economic weight in this world has shifted sharply in the direction of Asia? Is it possible that we completely overestimated our influence here? Secondly, your paper is remarkable. In the twelve pages that you have completely filled, there is not a single reference to the IPCC Panel. Is that a subtle attempt to distance yourself from this body? I would like to remind you that this panel formed the basis for all the political decisions relating to the directives that we have drawn up here in recent years. Is it not time to call for a broad scientific approach that gives us real scientific statements, not political ones?

According to the resolution of the European Parliament on the draft general budget for the financial year 2010, adopted on 17 December 2009, a vote was taken today on the amending budget for the European Parliament, following the revised calculations made by the Parliamentary administration. The FDP in the European Parliament abstained, because there was a paragraph in the package of amendments concerned that we could not reconcile with our convictions. The FDP had already expressed its opposition to an increase in the secretarial allowance to EUR 1 500 during the discussions in committee. It is out of the secretarial allowance that MEPs’ assistants are paid. The FDP considers that the argument that more money is needed due to the additional work that MEPs have to do with the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is unsound, as there is nothing in past experience to support this. Certainly, due to the Treaty of Lisbon, which has just come into force, Parliament will overall need extra capacity for legislative work, but with the introduction of the Assistants’ Statute from the beginning of the current parliamentary term, there is still no proof that MEPs actually need more assistants. For this reason, there are grounds for concern that further demands and supplementary increases, or an extension of office capacity, will follow. For this reason, the FDP in the European Parliament abstained. Holger Krahmer,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

Madam President, it seems to me to be a little symptomatic for the EU in general, but also for Parliament in particular, that we should have knee-jerk debates about situations in certain countries that are in no way new. Unfortunately, it is very often the case that overnight events lead to us here in Parliament spouting out waves of political demands that I sometimes find somewhat dubious. I think that it does not give a good impression of us if a failed bomb attack on an aeroplane only leads us to a general debate on Yemen. We should be clear that it would be fitting to consider a strategy for how to deal with this situation. I also think that the situation in Yemen requires a precise analysis, specifically with regard to the fact that this is a failed state in which the government does not have control of large parts of the country We should analyse for ourselves what risks this involves for Europe. The risks appear to be that terrorists are trained there and the risks also appear to relate to the Yemeni coast, where piracy is clearly taking place. We – and perhaps Baroness Ashton, also – must consider what we can do to counter these risks. As I see it, the main question might well be: how can we bolster the Yemeni Government so that it can regain control of the country and thus contain these risks? All the other debates about the long-term building-up of the country also need to be held, of course, but I do not think that there is really any point in us putting forward a catalogue of demands clean across all political areas – from the freedom of the media to women’s rights – here in Parliament at this point, or that we will be taken seriously if we do so. Doing so will not achieve our goal in Yemen, so instead, we should concentrate on what tangible assistance we can provide in the current situation in order to solve an urgent problem.

 The German Free Democratic Party members of the European Parliament have abstained from voting on the Copenhagen resolution for the following reasons. The resolution contains statements about financing for climate protection measures in third countries without defining the specific criteria or purpose of the financing. We cannot justify this to taxpayers. In addition, we believe that blanket criticism of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) is wrong. The ICAO is the organisation which deals with aviation matters at an international level. Both the criticism and the statement about the alleged failure of ICAO negotiations are incorrect and inappropriate. The call for specific arrangements for a CO2
 trading system for the aviation industry goes against current EU legislation and overburdens the EU’s negotiating position in an international climate agreement with unrealistic demands. Holger Krahmer  (ALDE

Madam President, European climate policy should leave its reverie behind and take note of the international realities. First of all, Kyoto was a failure. It was very symbolic, but delivered no reductions in emissions. Secondly, on the eve of Copenhagen, it is clear that important states in the world are not prepared to accept binding targets for reductions. Thirdly, politics must take note of a debate emerging in science. The same scientists who signed the conclusions of the IPCC panel two years ago today talk of natural influences on the climate – something that the IPCC categorically ruled out two years ago. We should already know how sure we can be of what influences climate change when we make political decisions. I therefore call for a change of strategy. First of all, we need to adapt to inevitable changes to the climate, while we should also move beyond all the ideological discussions about CO2
 and look for international allies in order to accelerate research into new energy sources and clean technologies. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

  Mr President, as an addition at the end of paragraph 24, which deals with the religious issues, we suggest the following sentence: ‘Calls on the Yargitay court to reverse its decision converting the historic Hagia Sophia Church in Trabzon as a mosque and push for its immediate re-opening as a museum’.

 Madam President, it has been an honour and a privilege to be the rapporteur for the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) on the proposal for a directive on the accessibility of public sector bodies’ websites and websites operated by entities performing public tasks. This piece of legislation is long overdue and eagerly awaited both by citizens with disabilities and by our increasingly ageing population who find themselves more and more isolated and excluded from a world where information is accessible primarily online. In Europe this amounts to 80 million citizens with disabilities and another 87 million aged over 65. 167 million European citizens is too great a number to be ignored. Throughout my involvement with this dossier, I have seen what these people face when trying to navigate their way online. I was particularly struck by the difficulties faced by the blind, which was exemplified at an IMCO Committee hearing held in April 2013. Ioanna-Maria Gertsou, a blind woman who owns a school for guide dogs in Athens, came to Parliament for a web accessibility demonstration and got visibly lost on traditional websites. However, despite the fact that assistive technology already exists, Europe has been lagging far behind. We are the European Union. We should be setting the agenda, not struggling, or even failing, to keep up. Less than one third of Europe’s public sector and government websites, and even less than 10[nbsp ]% of Europe’s websites in general, are fully accessible. Making websites and their content useable for all should already have become a priority at EU level. The Commission’s initial proposal was limited in scope and not fully in line with the goals promised in the digital agenda for Europe. The IMCO Committee was more ambitious, and made a number of significant amendments to the text. The directive now covers all EU public sector bodies’ websites and websites providing public services, as now laid down in a new annex. It now covers mobile web and apps and includes a robust enforcement mechanism. The specifications for accessibility are technology-neutral and based on the international Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0, also known as WCAG. This directive is essentially a forerunner in the planned European Accessibility Act, which I know is also being eagerly awaited by our citizens. The scope, along with the enforcement mechanisms and monitoring systems, reflects the binding obligations set out in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the commitments made in the digital agenda for Europe. In addition, with the implementation of a harmonised European approach, making these websites accessible also has the potential to be a highly profitable business. The financial benefits are currently estimated at EUR[nbsp ]2 billion.  Members of this Parliament will vote tomorrow to deliver on their commitment to uphold the rights of disabled people. However, this is only the first step in the legislative process. We regret the lack of engagement by previous presidencies on this dossier. However, I thank Commissioner Kroes for having openly supported our legislative work using one of the most modern ways of rapid communication, Twitter. I thank her for that.  I am sure the Greek Presidency will follow up the good work on this file and it is completely feasible that the Italian Presidency will be able to bring this dossier into legislation. In our increasingly digital world, accessibility is very much a human right. All people are entitled to use the internet in order to exercise their fundamental rights. I hope tomorrow’s vote will cement Parliament’s commitment on this.  Lastly, I must emphasise that cooperation with my shadow rapporteurs last year was both consensual and produced a directive that should be acceptable to all and I thank them for that.

 Madam President, my thanks go to all colleagues, especially to Adam Kósa, the Intergroup Chair, who really contributed to this piece of legislation.  This is both an ethical issue and a commercial issue. It is about basic and fundamental human rights and it is about jobs. Yes, the report is ambitious and I will admit that it has been made more ambitious by Parliament, but it is a feasible report, this is a feasible issue.  The ball, as many colleagues and Commissioner Kroes have said, lies now in the court of the Council of the Member States. Yes, and with our vote tomorrow we will take an important step. And I am very confident that the next Parliament will take up its work where we end it now and will bring this to an end together with the forthcoming Italian Presidency. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

Mr President, as Co-Chair of the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) of the European Parliament and the Sobranie, let me congratulate you on yet another positive report. For the first time our colleagues from Skopje are here in Strasbourg to attend the 11th JPC at the moment and to follow this debate on Richard Howitt’s report. I would like to welcome especially my Co-Chair Kenan Hasipi. Last December, only two months after the positive Commission progress report, we experienced a major political crisis in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The opposition was kicked out of the plenary, journalists had been expelled previously, and voting took place without their presence. The whole political process was disrupted due to parliamentary blocking for many weeks. We have been following the developments very anxiously in Brussels and in Europe, and the EU has made tremendous efforts to act as a mediator between the parties. On 1 March 2013, an agreement was achieved thanks to an EU mission by Parliament’s former President Jerzy Buzek, Richard Howitt and Commissioner Füle. Congratulations, especially to the Commissioner for his commitment and his tough tone, which led to the 1 March agreement and calmed the situation. Our rapporteur Mr Howitt postponed the vote on his report as he feared that the vote could turn out negatively for the country. I respect his decision. Moreover, the JPC was also postponed. This was a sign of mutual respect. Parliament, I think, and our colleagues were extremely tolerant in allowing us to use this time-out instrument, but this measure can only be an exceptional approach. Let us continue to work hard, keeping the country on the European track. It is in our common interest. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

Mr President, when I entered politics one of my biggest idols, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, defined as one of the cornerstones of the European Union respect for the right to sovereignty, especially for the small Members of the European Union. The Eurogroup did not respect this small Member State, Cyprus, and its sovereignty, nor the Cypriot economy and society. The Eurogroup should stop putting in danger this fundamental value of the European Union, namely respecting the sovereignty of the small. That is why we should respect Cyprus in order to safeguard the European Union. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,

Madam President, President Caldeira, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the Court of Auditors for the important work that it undertakes on behalf of the European taxpayer every year. Mr Caldeira, you and the Court are and will remain a valued partner for us as Members of this House, the representatives of the European Union’s discharge authority. A year ago, as we sat here discussing the Court of Auditor’s previous report, I said that the Court’s report presented a positive picture, but there were some grey areas. The picture is becoming steadily brighter, but there are still some spots of grey. The sum of EUR 130 billion was available in 2011, and of this figure, EUR 5 billion should never have been disbursed. That is an error rate of 3.9 %. Compared with previous years, that is an improvement, but it is still much too high. I am at a loss to explain how these figures can possibly be justified in view of the budget constraints throughout the EU. However, there are some positive aspects. The instruments that Parliament, in its discharge reports, has given the Commission, especially in recent years, are being utilised at last and are working. This is happening to an exemplary – extremely exemplary – degree in the field of employment and social affairs. The Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion and its Commissioner, Mr Andor, have since 2008 applied a consistent policy of suspending and discontinuing payments if current projects simply do not work. As a result, the error rate here has fallen to 2.2 %. I would like to congratulate you, Commissioner Andor, on these consistent efforts, which show how it should be done. I would like to extend these congratulations to Commissioner Šemeta as well, for he is of course involving in overseeing these efforts.  I myself, as one of the previous rapporteurs for the budget discharge, together with my parliamentary colleagues, reminded the House that funds that have been disbursed without justification must be recovered. This measure is also being used to an increasing extent, and I would like to congratulate you on this as well. My perusal of the Annual Summaries, which we Members are now permitted to inspect, has convinced me that this instrument is working. As regards efficiency, there are still some problems here. The evaluation report has rightly been criticised by the Court of Auditors for being too vague. I would like to offer Mr Geier, who is reporting on the budget discharge this year, the support of the House as a whole in order to ensure that the procedure is improved. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

The EU single market is one of the most worthwhile European achievements. Between 1992 and 2008 it created about 2.77 million jobs and increased GDP by 2.13 %. These figures clearly show the potential of a smoothly functioning EU single market. The 20 years of its existence that we are now celebrating is an anniversary of which all Europeans should be proud. However, past achievements should motivate us to remove any remaining obstructions. As the rapporteur has clearly shown us, some things in the single market are still in dire straits. The Commission has also produced a working paper containing the 20 main concerns of citizens that they consider impede the everyday smooth operation of the single market to no purpose. The problem areas identified must be solved using an integrated approach. Another problem concerns the issue of how we can ensure that every European citizen can benefit from the achievements of the EU single market, no matter where they live. The trade balance deficits within the EU may in the long term create difficulties for the Union. European policy must steer us in the opposite direction. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, 20 years of the internal market are indeed a reason to look back on this track record. It is exactly as Ms Gebhardt said: the internal market has brought the European idea, the European philosophy, to the fore, there is no doubt about that. It goes without saying that, externally, the internal market is seen as a success. However, if we look inside the European internal market, we will discover that some have benefited more than others. Germany has a very healthy balance sheet. The German Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau
 has calculated that, in Germany alone, the internal market effect represents an annual amount of EUR 30 billion in relation to the euro. On the other hand, we see that productivity in the peripheral countries is declining. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let us take the Single Market Act II and these 20 years of the internal market as an opportunity to consider how we can get to grips with this imbalanced development, these current account differences, within the European Union. If we do not succeed in this, unless everyone sees an advantage in the internal market, the internal market will lose credibility and legitimacy in the long term. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Busuttil, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I warmly welcome this own-initiative report by Mr Busuttil. It is further proof of how important it is that Parliament sets the agenda on important matters. Thank you, then, Mr Busuttil, for this very balanced report. The subject is more relevant than ever, for alongside the things that we imagined would be the engine of European integration when the internal market was established 20 years ago, we can also see that there are imbalances in the internal market. The imbalances where the balance of payments is concerned are also one reason why the euro area has run into such difficulty. The single European market as a whole is also at risk of losing its legitimacy, its role as an engine, if we do not devote particular attention to what has happened now, on its 20th anniversary. The internal market scoreboard could be a useful instrument for indicating where things are going wrong at a very early stage, as a kind of early warning system. It would be a significant first step towards economic policy that is at last coordinated. That is why I also welcome the European Commission’s plans to publish this internal market scoreboard annually. We need to square the circle here. On the one hand, the economies that have nursed their labour markets back to health by making appropriate reforms – those that are more prompt with transposition – must naturally not be punished for their achievement. On the other hand, however, even the best in class will be affected if its neighbour gets into excessive debt in order to buy its products. As an initial step, it would be sufficient for the EU’s internal market regulations to finally be transposed in a more timely manner. In reality, what we need here are realistic transposition and implementation targets – as this report also underlines. Then there is the varying speed of transposition. In May 2011, the Member States took, on average, 5.5 months longer than the transposition deadline to transpose EU directives; today, the figure is nearly 8 months. This time period needs to be reduced, for the sake of equal opportunities alone. In short, the Member States must meet their obligations better and must demonstrate greater commitment to and make greater efforts towards implementing European legal provisions. At the same time, it can be seen that 20 years of the internal market have resulted in a drastic increase in the differences between the competitiveness of the national economies in the European Union. There has been a radical shift in the balance of payments between the strongest economies and what are now the weakest economies, in favour of the strongest. The low interest rate policy conducted since the launch of the euro has reinforced this trend, acting rather like an accelerant. We Europeans have trusted in the healing powers of the internal market, while ignoring the fact that competitiveness has not necessarily improved across the board as a result of this internal market policy. Commissioner Barnier, we need to take action to counter this. The scoreboard provides one way of doing so. The 20th anniversary of the single European market also gives us an opportunity to look into drawing up a plan for more equal balances of payments at national level, and possibly even at regional level in a further step, alongside the completion of the internal market. Only then will we achieve overall economic equilibrium in even the marginal regions of Europe, and particularly in the southern parts of the euro area. Europe’s sovereign debt crisis shows that the surpluses in the north and the deficits in the south will have a blocking effect on each other unless we can resolve this problem in the medium term. I would therefore urge Europe’s economists to give us new theories that reconcile the internal market with reciprocal balance. The internal market scoreboard could provide a decisive starting point for this, but it must not be allowed to become a paper tiger. Let us use the internal market week as an opportunity to think about these things. Let us also use the 20th anniversary of the internal market as a chance to make all of us in Europe – not just the strong countries of the north, but everyone as a whole – fit for the future.

 Mr President, Mr Rehn, I wish to congratulate Werner Hoyer on his brilliant debut in his new job. Mr Hoyer, this is not an easy time for the European Union. This economic and financial crisis calls for adroit economic and political expertise. You have both in good measure. The European Parliament is happy to see you at the helm of the European Investment Bank (EIB). I would also like to thank the outgoing Vice-President, Matthias Kollatz-Ahnen, however, as he has also achieved a great deal. As an example, I would mention the establishment of the European Energy Efficiency Fund. Mr Hoyer, the role of your bank is decisive in overcoming the crisis. We are all aware of this. You have also proven this. I would cite the example of how you overcame the crisis in the automotive sector. Thanks to the scrapping premiums, which were mainly paid for by your bank, we managed to do something good for the environment, while also providing a stimulus for the economy. We are now facing new challenges. We have heard several references to the issue of project bonds. We are constantly talking about the innovative financial instruments we expect from your bank. We need clear rules, however; we expect your bank to issue clear rules for all Member States. We wish you every success in your efforts to obtain a triple-A rating for the bank. As stated in our report, for which I would like to thank Ms Ivanova, we would like to see the EU becoming a shareholder. This may perhaps be a step in the right direction. I wish you all the best for the work ahead. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, Jürgen Creutzmann, Britta Reimers and Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, this year’s report from the European Court of Auditors presents a positive picture, but there are some problems. The good news is that many areas are satisfactory, in particular, the major area of agricultural spending, as Mr Fjellner has already said. The bad news is that the predicted deterioration in the area of cohesion has taken place and 49%, in other words half, of all the payments audited in the area of cohesion had errors. That is a great number. A total of 90% of all the payments with problems are made in the Member States. In our committee, we were critical at the time of the fact that the Council was not present. I am looking at the Council bench and the Council is once again not represented. The Council really should be here for this debate. Two-thirds of all the errors occur in three Member States. I would like to congratulate you, Mr Šemeta, for having the courage to name these Member States in the committee. You have said that they are Italy, Spain and the Czech Republic. You have our support for this new policy of naming and shaming. You have followed up another call by the European Parliament and I would like to thank you for this too. You have interrupted payments amounting to a total of EUR 2.4 billion. This is the only way that we will be able to introduce discipline in the Member States. After the process of damage limitation, we must identify the errors and name the culprits. The key words here are effectiveness, efficiency and economic viability. There is also a new chapter where you, Mr Caldeira, make it clear in your report that the Commission often does not achieve the goals which it sets itself. Mr Šemeta, we will be interested to see the evaluation report from the Commission, which is expected in December. However, we would also like to say that in times of financial crisis, we must use taxpayers’ money in a way which is even more effective, more precise, more carefully targeted and more efficient. That is our job. I would like to thank the Court of Auditors for helping us to do this. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,

 Mr President, Mr Korolec, Commissioner, energy is the lifeblood of our national economies. We therefore want price developments to remain transparent for consumers. I regret to say that there are still too many deals and agreements being made behind the scenes. In the end, it is consumers who foot the bill, in the form of severely inflated energy prices. This is not just annoying; it also has real effects on growth and employment. We want a better internal energy market. Europe needs transparent energy markets that are protected from abuse. This is precisely what the regulation on energy market integrity and transparency aims to achieve, and that is what we are talking about here. I would specifically like to thank the Commission and Commissioner Oettinger for their positive cooperation. This is exactly how European legislation needs to be made – in the way that we have brought it about here. I am particularly pleased that the European dimension of energy trading is stressed in the text that will be put to the vote tomorrow. One of the main issues was whether or not we need a special law on this. Do we need a sector-specific approach or could energy trading simply be subject to the general regulations for financial markets? When it comes down to it, however, energy markets have different rules; energy traders are not banks. I am particularly grateful to Commissioner Oettinger for having done all he could to ensure this matter was put to the House quickly. That was essential for a sector-specific approach. The negotiations with the Hungarian Presidency were tough and we succeeded in getting a result at first reading. Parliament – my fellow Members – introduced seven new points into the Commission’s text. The first important point was the introduction of an approval system for a register of electricity traders. This regulation now sets out the requirement of a national register of electricity traders. It also provides for the establishment of a European register which is to be organised by the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER). The Commission is to evaluate the registration system in the future and propose further instruments to improve it. Secondly: there is a link-up with CO2
 emissions trading. The regulation gives the ACER access to existing databases relating to trading in emissions certificates. Although Member States are not required to keep such records and the ACER is not being given the rights of control, the Commission is asked to present a legislative proposal to deal with the deficits in the CO2
 market system. Thirdly: there will be penalties, and we have worked to harmonise these penalties and to achieve minimum standards. Following pressure from Parliament, the damage caused to consumers is to be given particular consideration when deciding on sanctions. In addition, the Commission has been given the opportunity to table a proposal on minimum standards for penalties. Fourthly: the role of the agency and the national regulatory authorities have been strengthened. Parliament wanted to strengthen the ACER, which is why we have pushed for the director of the ACER to be more independent. The director of the ACER is to consult national provisions, but should not be bound by these. A fifth important point: there is a revision clause in respect of staffing and resources. Parliament would like the ACER to be provided with the appropriate financial and human resources to be able to perform its new tasks. This is emphasised in a new recital. The ACER needs to be better equipped if it is to be guaranteed a strong presence in important organised market places. Sixthly: naturally, insider trading is banned, but we have agreed one exemption when it comes to insider trading. This exemption may be applied only in the event of a direct physical loss resulting from unplanned outages. This exemption is allowed in order to provide security in the system, since otherwise players in the market would be unable to discharge their contractual obligations or to act by agreement with the competent transmission system operator. Mr President, I should like to continue speaking now rather than saving two minutes until the end. The seventh and final point concerns delegated acts versus implementing acts. This was a tough one in the negotiations – it was a central issue, and, in part, we were breaking new ground as a result of the Treaty of Lisbon. Parliament has conceded some of its demands concerning delegated acts in favour of a stronger role for the ACER and in favour of more detailed directions in the section on penalties. This was a trade-off that we made. One important element of the final package is that all the aspects relating to data collection will be laid down by an implementing act rather than a delegated act. This also applies to the setting of a de minimis
 threshold for the definition of reporting obligations. Nonetheless, the Commission will reserve the right to make a proposal ahead of any legislative proposal on such a threshold. This is also enshrined in the text as part of a declaration. Overall, we have achieved a good result. I am very satisfied. The Hungarian Presidency was a tough negotiating partner, but with the assistance of my colleagues from all the other groups, we succeeded in achieving a genuinely satisfactory result. I would like to express my warmest thanks to everyone, especially to my Hungarian colleague, Mr Gyürk, because he naturally had a particularly direct line to the Presidency; however, everyone was involved in the trialogue negotiations. We achieved near unanimity in committee. I would be pleased if we could do the same in plenary. Thank you for your cooperation. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,

 Mr President, it only remains for me to thank everyone and, in particular, once again to wish Mr Pototschnig, the director of the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER), who is with us today, every success with his work. He only assumed responsibility for this area in March and it is already becoming clear that the resources available to him may be inadequate, as the two previous speakers and many other of my fellow Members have said. Therefore, we will soon be in the position where we have to provide the ACER with additional resources. I would like to give Mr Pototschnig and his team my best wishes for their work on an issue which is important to consumers. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control
. – (DE)
 Mr President, from the perspective of budgetary control, the European Union is often accused of taking a sloppy approach to spending. Who is responsible for this? In 80% of cases it is actually the Member States, which have joint responsibility for the expenditure. It is often the Member States. We all remember how the British Prime Minister, Mr Cameron, said to the President of the European Parliament that instead of asking for more money, we must first of all make sure that the money is spent more effectively. Which country was the biggest offender in 2010? The United Kingdom. All the British programmes were stopped in 2010. Why is that? It is because the rules are too complicated. Therefore, I would like to ask my fellow Members and, in particular, the Commission to campaign together with the Member States for simpler rules, for more effective and simpler monitoring systems and for the introduction of new components. For example, if research policy were to include an award or a prize for a particularly successful, innovative project, this would make it much easier to monitor. The same applies to cohesion policy, where we could create a leverage effect by providing project-related loans. There are a lot of opportunities open to us for innovation. We should take a brave step forward. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner Šemeta, ladies and gentlemen, the process we are dealing with today – that is, the discharge for the expenditure of the European Commission – is an essential process. In recent years it may perhaps have been taken rather lightly, but in fact granting discharge for all the expenditure of the European Commission for the year 2009 is an essential task of the European Parliament. We are aware that 80% of these funds were spent as a shared responsibility between the Commission and the Member States. Nonetheless, the overall responsibility for this process lies with the Commission. I would therefore like to address you quite directly, Commissioner Šemeta. Firstly, I would like to thank you. I would like to make that clear at the outset. I would like to include my fellow Members who have worked very well together and who have supported Parliament’s position very strongly. However, the discussions that we had were very intense, Commissioner Šemeta. You have only shared responsibility for 2009, yet you have thrown yourself into it. In some cases we have had heated arguments and have gone into very great detail. I should like to emphasise, however, that you have put the discharge at the top of the agenda in the College, in the Commission. The President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, spent over an hour negotiating with us on the details. You yourself played a major part in changing the attitude of the Commission to the discharge and the attitude of the Commission officials to this whole process. I am grateful to you for having said quite openly that the pressure that Parliament has exerted this year will in the final event help you to improve transparency. You now have in your hands a means of exerting pressure not just on the Member States, but also on your own administration – which has until now been a little lax in dealing with these matters. However, I also think that we need to utilise this momentum that we have created together, Commissioner Šemeta – and I would ask you to pass on our thanks to President Barroso – and this dynamism for the other discharge reports. For there is one thing that must be clear to us, which is that for the 16th time in succession the European Court of Auditors has not given a positive statement. That is not insignificant, as it means that you have not actually met the criteria for 16 years running. Nonetheless, we have set key criteria that I would like to mention briefly and that you have met. I am pleased to have Mr Fjellner, the forthcoming rapporteur on the budget discharge, at my side. I hope that he will continue the work with the same impetus. The Commission has begun – and this is crucial, because we are after all talking about 80% shared responsibility here – quite clearly to state erroneous expenditure in the accounts of the European Union for 2009. It has listed these items openly. Building on this new transparency, therefore, we have set five key requirements. The first is a long-running issue – an old favourite – that Parliament has been dealing with for a long time, and that is the national management declarations. As a representative of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I am also pleased to be able to point out that this has been brought about by Dutch members of the ALDE Group in particular. We are talking here about the confirmation by the finance ministers that EU funds have been spent correctly in their home countries. We do not yet have these national management declarations, but we want to get them. In this respect I will be building on my cooperation with Mr Fjellner in the future. Commissioner, you have promised that we will look into whether stricter conditions can be introduced by the next financial perspective in 2014. It is important that you have drawn up guidelines – we are grateful to you for that – that you have shown which countries have actually provided national management declarations – it is not many: basically, only the Netherlands meets the requirements in full – and that you have instructed the Directorates General to show for the first time in the activity report for 2010 what components will be present in a future national administrative declaration, even if this will only take place at working level. The second key requirement is that the commissioners must also accept greater responsibility. You have proposed that the Directorates General be obliged to inform their commissioners of irregularities and I want to thank you for that. The third, and essential, requirement was for the instrument of stopping or suspending payments to be used to a greater extent. You have listed clear criteria for when you will do that. You have shown us clearly how you have already done this in the last couple of years. Thank you for such openness and transparency, which helps us exert pressure on the Member States. Thank you also for the guidelines that will help the Member States. In addition, you promised that when evaluating the performance audit you will set clear standards; this is an obligation that you have anyway under the Treaty of Lisbon. Thank you also for involving us to a considerable extent in the performance audit process. You have also promised to make simplifications, because often the material is so complex that people hide behind the rules and indulge in abuse. Thank you also for having set very specific requirements for the next financial perspective. I advocate that we continue along this path. I believe that Parliament can make a great contribution towards raising the Commission to another level. I wish Mr Fjellner all the best and would like to extend my warm thanks to my parliamentary staff, particularly Bent Adamsen and Dominykas Mordas. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the Commissioner once again on behalf of Parliament for his excellent cooperation. You have now raised certain points once again. We should take these as a starting point for our continued work. However, I would also ask you to pass on our thanks to your colleagues, because we had a very intense exchange with many individuals – I should particularly like to mention Mr Cioloş and Mr Hahn – and both were very cooperative. Please would you pass this message on to them once again. I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Becsey, for his clear words. He spoke very clearly; we may not like what he said, but at least he was clear in what he said and we are grateful for that. I consider it only right that you are here. I do not think there is particular cause to mention it. Nonetheless, it is good that you are here. I have saved my final thanks for the President of the European Court of Auditors, Mr Caldeira, with whom Parliament always enjoys genuinely open and positive cooperation. We very much appreciate that. Our work would not be possible without your background work. Our discharge is based mainly on your contributions. We would like to see you playing a greater role in the future assessment of the performance audit, Mr Caldeira. The future of the European Union depends not just on the funds being spent legally and correctly, but also and above all on their being spent usefully; in other words, effectively and efficiently. That will form part of the performance audit under Article 318 of the Treaty of Lisbon. As Parliament, we would like to see an annual debate on the performance audit of the Commission and we would like you to be invited here to debate it with us as a representative of the European Court of Auditors. My sincere thanks to my fellow Members and to everyone involved. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 In the vote on the Lange report, I am abstaining on paragraph 31 because of the ambiguous wording, which refers to Eurobonds as well as project bonds. However, taking it as a whole, I am voting for the report, as I have nothing against project bonds in themselves. Project bonds serve as finance for extensive innovation, infrastructure and reindustrialisation projects. This is not a question of instruments for the communitarisation of debts, as would be the case with Eurobonds. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,

 Madam President, Mr Tajani, thank you very much for your strong commitment to a European industrial policy. I have been looking over at Mr Lange and thinking that there has been a lot of commotion about an own-initiative report. A total of 500 amendments and 50 compromise proposals have been tabled with the aim of making industry in Europe a world leader again. We can only achieve this by means of an integrated and sustainable policy. We need to ensure that research and innovation are at the heart of our strategy. Therefore, we must put in place a regulatory framework which will support innovation and sustainability at the same time. The major challenge faced by your report was finding the right balance between environmental goals and economic competitiveness, while also avoiding protectionism. I am looking at Mrs Grossetête, because the French always want to introduce a touch of protectionism. At the same time, we need to support small and medium-sized businesses, promote the European patent and prevent knowledge theft, particularly with regard to China. We also want to see fewer regulations being imposed on European industry as a result of red tape. This means that we need to focus on reducing the amount of bureaucracy. Mr Lange, you have succeeded in covering this quite well in your report, so I would like to thank you for your hard work. However, this report can only represent the first step. We need to link the concept of industrial policy, which people in many Member States find it hard to discuss and which the Germans, in particular, have always been unwilling to talk about, with the competitiveness pact, which will be presented to the Heads of State or Government over the next few weeks in order to safeguard the euro area. If we do not manage to do this, then we will have a problem. We must coordinate areas such as cohesion, industry, trade, research and innovation, but also social issues, the climate and the environment. The current example of E10 in Germany demonstrates that this is not happening. This is all about adding bioethanol to petrol. The EU has put in place an important strategy, set itself the 20-20-20 targets, and we have said to the Member States that they must implement it. The Member States, and Germany in particular, were part of the decision-making process and supported everything that was decided. However, when it came to putting it into practice at home, they suddenly cut back the tax incentives and the consumers stopped cooperating. If we fail to convince consumers, as was the case in Germany with E10, then we will not be able to implement climate policy in combination with industrial policy. We need to have the consumers on our side. That is the central message. For this reason, I wish the industrial policy project every success. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 In overall terms, the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament supports the waste disposal directive. However, the subject of photovoltaic modules remains a problem. There is no understandable reason for excluding the entire sector from the regulations. We have a wide range of legislation governing waste streams. Therefore, it is not clear why a complete industry, which is expected to produce significant waste streams, is being exempted. For this reason, some of the FDP Members of the European Parliament have abstained from voting on the report. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Mr President, the Communication and the report are very good, and I would therefore like to express my thanks to Commissioner Dalli and Mrs Matias. Alzheimer’s is a plague of our times, and our biggest problem is that we simply know too little about Alzheimer’s. That is why we need research, research, and more research. We need to pool our strengths and I therefore welcome the Commission’s initiative to create an innovation partnership on the subject of healthy ageing; Alzheimer’s fits in with this perfectly. Many years ago, the US Government designated the fight against cancer as a lighthouse project. They have not conquered cancer, but a great many medicines and a great many therapies have emerged as a result. That is the kind of thing that we need here, and I therefore welcome the fact that we are to concentrate on Alzheimer’s. We need to know how to take preventive action. What can we do in the future to combat Alzheimer’s? That is why we cannot continue to adopt the watering can principle in European research policy. We need to concentrate on specific areas. Alzheimer’s could be one of the major themes that we get to grips with. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

Mr President, Commissioner, energy efficiency has always been the biggest resource proffered to us. It is the sleeping giant with the hidden but enormous potential for the European energy economy. All that is true, and the nice thing about it is that it is so free of ideology. Above all, the approach to this issue can be technology-neutral. All that interests us here, and it is a point that is clearly also a little divisive, is the issue of whether or not the targets are binding. I have to say, Commissioner, in this regard, that I like your two-stage approach whereby you start by trusting in the Member States and by building voluntary agreements and then, if we observe that we will not achieve the targets by 2020, we perhaps get the thumbscrews out. That is the right approach to take. This report, by and large, moves in the right direction – there is little to criticise. There is one issue that I would like to raise, however, which is the role of the regional funds. You mentioned this issue, Commissioner. In the regional funds, together with the Cohesion Funds, we have an immense instrument in our hands in the European Union that we are not making use of. In this field of energy efficiency, we could finally create European added value which we could put to use in an innovative way to get to grips with energy efficiency in a way that has not happened in the past. As the current rapporteur for budgetary discharge for the Commission, I can see just how badly we have wasted money in the sphere of cohesion. Let us put a stop to that waste! I endorse the focus that you are giving to this issue, Commissioner Oettinger, and the fact that you are seeking to bring about greater use of these funds, including for this energy efficiency instrument. That is the only way that we will ensure that there really is cohesion, at least in the energy sector. I feel I must warn against smear campaigns, as we saw with light bulbs and with shower heads. Such campaigns are the kind of things that alienate the citizens. We must thus ensure that we aim to achieve energy efficiency in general and that we keep this objective in mind without pursuing ideological smear campaigns that ultimately lead to the citizens losing their positive impression of the EU.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to congratulate Mr Almunia on the open debate that has taken place in the Commission. There are good reasons why you and the Commission President, Mr Barroso, took part in the debate in the College of Commissioners with a very different year in mind. I am pleased that the Commission is able to discuss issues so openly from a regulatory perspective and then to reverse its decision. That is both admirable and remarkable. It is a good thing that you are supporting the new decision here. There are a number of good grounds for this decision. Nevertheless, the Member States which are affected have been making plans. There are plans in place and I can only say that I am pleased that the review clause has been removed, which stated that we would have to open up the whole can of worms once again from 2012 onwards in the largest Member State affected, in other words, Germany. This means that your debate in the College of Commissioners has also had a very successful outcome. I know that 2018 will eventually come around. I am also pleased about the fact that the mining industry has the security to plan ahead and I will vote accordingly. However, I can see that regulatory policy is the winner here.

 Mr President, Mr Šemeta, Mr Caldeira, I would like to thank the Court of Auditors for this report. Your organisation, Mr Caldeira, provides an essential service for European taxpayers. It is a good thing that the reduction in the error rate has continued this year. This is the result of the reform of the Commission which was pushed through by the liberal Commissioner, Mr Kallas. There are major improvements over the previous year in the area of cohesion and only a slight deterioration in agriculture. However, the Commission should not now simply sit back and do nothing. We must make it clear that the huge improvements are based on a very lucky choice of samples. Therefore, I am concerned that the positive trend will not continue next year. We should make use of the momentum from the first budget discharge under the Treaty of Lisbon to introduce a decisive paradigm shift. I would like to make it clear once again that this year’s report from the Court of Auditors is the sixteenth in a row which does not have positive overall results. How can we finally bring an end to the inefficient and wasteful allocation of funding and to the political connivance in this area? My proposals as rapporteur are as follows: Firstly, the Commission must intervene more strongly in the case of obvious errors and, where these errors are repeated, it must suspend the funding. How is it that a Member State of many years standing like Greece is not subjected to sanctions over a period of 10 years, despite the fact that it is in obvious breach of the provisions of the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS)? Secondly, we must no longer impose double penalties on taxpayers. The beneficiaries of EU funding which has been allocated illegally are only required to repay 10%. In accordance with the 50:50 rule, the Member States contribute half of the amount from their national budgets. This is an insult to taxpayers. Let me give you a few figures. Between 1994 and 2006, the Member States have been wrongly allocated a phenomenal EUR 7.7 billion in the area of cohesion policy. The Commission itself has just made this fact public. Only EUR 709 million has been paid back, which demonstrates very clearly the difference in these circumstances. This is probably correct, because the Member States are not in a position to come up with accurate calculations. The Court of Auditors has confirmed this. Thirdly, all the Member States must finally sign and submit national management declarations. Fourthly, the Commission must be politically accountable. This is why we want signatures at least from Mr Barroso on the synthesis report on annual activities. We also want an evaluation report, which is provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon. There are still some things that are in need of improvement. All in all, I would like to thank the Court of Auditors very much for this report. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,

 Mr President, what exactly does European innovation policy do? What does European research policy do? If we ask ourselves this question and if we were to ask the citizens on the street, we would just get a blank look. This is because it is not clear what added value European research and European innovation brings. For that reason, we welcome the fact that Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn’s proposal begins by providing a definition of innovation. What is innovation? Innovation involves making money, a product or a licence from knowledge. That is something new. I am pleased that the Commission is going down this path. However, we also now need ‘man on the moon’ or ‘woman on the moon’ projects which are understood by the man on the street, so that EU taxpayers understand what we are doing here with their money. In this regard, I see great potential in the issue of increasing the number of healthy life years by two. That would be a project that everyone out there would understand. I am therefore pleased that the first innovation partnership proposed is being devoted precisely to achieving this goal. Two additional healthy years of life – that will be understood by everyone and it is something we should do. In this regard, you have our support. However, I would like to point out, and Mrs Merkies has already mentioned this, too, that if we simply look at the instruments that already exist, there is the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), the Joint Technology Initiatives (JTIs), the so-called Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP) – these are all programmes that already exist. If we add yet another programme, then we will make the whole area difficult to get to grips with. This is something we must not do. The innovation partnerships are intended to make a real contribution to bringing order to this situation and combining everything in a single system. That is why we will only accept this if it is all made clearer for taxpayers. We must always know the answer to the question: what brings more European added value? If that is the case, we will give it our full support. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Mr President, there is an error in the Dutch version of the resolution on the Gallo report. I am listed there among the signatories to the resolution by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left as a member of the GUE/NGL Group. In this regard, I would like to say that, firstly, I am not a member of the GUE/NGL Group, I am not a Leftist and I am no Communist. Secondly, I remain a member of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe – a Liberal – and will vote for the ALDE resolution, as will many members of the other groups in this House. Thirdly, I call on the GUE/NGL Group to also vote for the ALDE resolution. (Laughter) Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank Mr Oettinger and congratulate Mr Vidal-Quadras on his report. With the help of the Spanish Presidency, it has been possible to produce a very good document. Natural gas is important and its importance is increasing. In his speech, Mr Turmes said that we must change our perspective on the situation. In the country which I represent, half of all households are dependent on natural gas, but 40% of this comes from Russia. This is why adding legislation to the existing directive is important. It is also the right thing to do. It will give us prevention plans, preventive measures and emergency plans with three crisis levels. We do not want a repeat of the pictures which we saw in the gas crisis winter of 2009. We do not want to see our European partners and Europe’s neighbouring countries freezing. For this reason, this report forms part of our common European responsibility, which covers not just the EU Member States but also the neighbouring countries. Ladies and gentlemen, the legislation is good, but we also need to take other routes. For this reason, I welcome the announcement by Mr Oettinger that all the infrastructure measures, some of which have been mentioned here, including Nabucco, Nord Stream and South Stream, will receive support. This will allow us to diversify and will ensure that we are not dependent on a single supply. What we need is storage facilities. We definitely need more storage. In Germany, we have 70 days’ supply and that is not the case in every country. We must raise the standards in every country in this respect. The other issue is the energy mix. That remains our greatest challenge, which we must work together to overcome. Thank you very much and I hope that the new legislation will be successful. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Mr President, firstly, I would like to express my gratitude to and respect for Mrs Jeggle, who has been working on this report for years. However, Mrs Jeggle, there is one thing that I must say. As Europeans, we cannot take pride in this report. It is too vague and it permits too many things which a country or a continent that plays a leading role in animal welfare throughout the world should not allow. I foresee a worsening of the situation, in particular, as far as the reuse of experimental animals is concerned. Previously, this was more difficult, but I believe that the regulations have now been watered down. You are shaking your head, but it is true that when you look at this carefully, the small print and the nuances in the wording are the things that make the difference. The severity of the tests is also an area where, in many Member States, things are likely to get worse. Some Member States, such as Germany, the United Kingdom and Sweden, had already gone further than this. We have introduced a pain threshold and the Council has watered it down by permitting exceptions. In addition, the power of the Commission has been reduced with regard to inspections. Nevertheless, I will be voting in favour of this report, Mrs Jeggle, because it represents an improvement on the 1986 directive, which is now 24 years old. The authorisation mechanisms are in place. A licence is needed in advance for three stages of testing, which is a good thing. The procedures have been simplified, which is also a positive step. Personally, I am proud of the fact that we have been able to rescue the subject of alternative test methods from the last parliamentary term. However, we will need to provide more funding for this. This directive will have to be revised within the next seven years. It represents quite a good foundation, but in seven years, we will need to improve it so that we can live up to our reputation here in Europe for having the highest levels of animal welfare in the world.

 Providing consumers with information about food is undoubtedly important. However, the debate in Brussels has become a lobbying battle between large companies from the food industry and consumer protection organisations. There was no place in this debate for the reality of everyday life for consumers. The representatives of the German Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament are in favour of a minimum of labelling. Consumers should be able to make their purchasing decisions on the basis of transparent, legible information. Colour coded labelling influences consumers and does not form the basis for transparent information. The so-called guideline daily amounts (GDAs) also have their weak points. Instead of having neutral information about the amounts of nutrients per 100 grams or millilitres printed legibly on packaging, Parliament discussed whether the daily requirements of a 40-year-old woman could be used as the point of reference or whether the colour coding of nutrients was a useful decision-making tool. The proposed, far-reaching, mandatory requirements for the origin labelling of ingredients cannot be implemented in practice. We have also rejected the idea of special national provisions, because the labelling system should, as far as possible, be standardised. For these reasons, we were not able to vote in favour of the proposed report.

 Combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography is vitally important. We must use all our strength to combat the availability of child pornography in communications networks.

 Mr President, Commissioner thank you for your statement. I am very grateful for the initiative by the Spanish Presidency – and this is a very Spanish event as far as I can see – in adopting this series of proposals and leading the way in this regard. Electromobility must play a key role in future. However, as we all know, we are still a long way from achieving comprehensive electromobility. For that reason, we should also not make the mistake of allowing electric-car hype to arise, the claims of which we are not able to fulfil in political terms. Therefore, we should not abandon our focus on improving conventional means of locomotion, as crude oil will probably continue to fuel our mobility for a long time yet. The following points are crucial, however. Firstly, as you and all of the other speakers have said, we need a European strategy for the development of standards. The United States and China are working jointly on conductive charge couplers. We must not lag behind in this regard. We ought to lead the way and should not allow European vanity to take hold. Are the French quicker, or the Germans or the Spaniards? We should all pull together and the Commission should certainly take the lead in this. We need to develop cost-effective, high-performance batteries. Secondly, we need to extend network-infrastructure coverage to all areas. For us, that means that we have to focus our subsidy options on this in a more targeted way in the area of cohesion, in the regions and also in the development of rural areas. Citizens must be able to use electromobility across borders, otherwise they will not use this form of transport. Thirdly, we must also take electric cars into account in our CO2
 emissions calculations. Car manufacturers that are currently carrying out fleet calculations cannot yet include electric cars. We need to be able to take these into account in future. Fourthly, we must provide tax relief on electric cars throughout Europe. This applies to batteries in particular, which are still the most expensive part. We need to carry out research in this regard, but we also need to harmonise our taxes. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

Thank you, Mr President, that was very kind. Commissioner Šemeta, the adoption of the reports on the budgetary management of the European bodies and institutions is one of our most important obligations as representatives of the European people – it is our sovereign duty. The question of what Europe has done with taxpayers’ hard earned money is crucial for the acceptance of the European integration project. I would first like to thank all the rapporteurs for their efforts. However, I see light and shadow in the reports. I see light in budgetary management overall. Meanwhile, it is the case that everywhere the EU controls and manages funds itself, it runs things in accordance with the rules. Whether or not it is efficient is another matter altogether. As the European Parliament, we should pay closer attention to the efficiency of policies, political issues and implementation, in particular, with regard to the 2020 agenda. There is shadow in the area of cohesion policy. Eleven per cent of things do not comply with the rules and this percentage is too high. Therefore, it is very important that the EU tries harder to recover funds paid out incorrectly. The Committee on Budgetary Control has therefore adopted an amendment tabled by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. We want 100% of the money back. For 2010, I have the honour of being the rapporteur for the European Commission discharge. Due to the delayed entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, this will be no easy task. We must monitor very closely whether the new responsibilities of individual Commissioners lead to even less transparency and more concealment of responsibilities. We must and will examine this very closely. Allow me to single out two areas: firstly, the so-called non-governmental organisations and secondly, the gentlemen’s agreement. Between 2008 and 2009, the European Union paid NGOs over EUR 300 million in funds. These include honourable organisations like the Deutsche Welthungerhilfe
. However, there are also some that want to destroy the reputation of the European Union, namely Counter Balance, which has attacked the European Investment Bank. This is not acceptable and we must deal with it. We need a register and a definition of such non-governmental organisations, as they receive a lot of tax money. With regard to the gentlemen’s agreement I would like to thank Mr López Garrido. I would like to thank you for coming. I would also like to point to the historical element: questioning and revising the gentlemen’s agreement after 40 years is a huge step. Given the importance of Parliament due to the new Treaty of Lisbon, it is also a necessary step. We must ensure transparency, here and in the Council.

According to the resolution of the European Parliament on the draft general budget for the financial year 2010, adopted on 17 December 2009, a vote was taken today on the amending budget for the European Parliament, following the revised calculations made by the Parliamentary administration. The FDP in the European Parliament abstained, because there was a paragraph in the package of amendments concerned that we could not reconcile with our convictions. The FDP had already expressed its opposition to an increase in the secretarial allowance to EUR 1 500 during the discussions in committee. It is out of the secretarial allowance that MEPs’ assistants are paid. The FDP considers that the argument that more money is needed due to the additional work that MEPs have to do with the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is unsound, as there is nothing in past experience to support this. Certainly, due to the Treaty of Lisbon, which has just come into force, Parliament will overall need extra capacity for legislative work, but with the introduction of the Assistants’ Statute from the beginning of the current parliamentary term, there is still no proof that MEPs actually need more assistants. For this reason, there are grounds for concern that further demands and supplementary increases, or an extension of office capacity, will follow. For this reason, the FDP in the European Parliament abstained. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Mr President, as the head of the delegation, I would like, first of all, to congratulate Mr Thaler on his very balanced report. Skopje has carried out reforms and is on the way to joining the European Union. We welcome this very much and are very pleased about it. The visa liberalisation was perhaps the clearest and most visible sign. It was a milestone in our cooperation. This objective has only been achieved as a result of close collaboration with the EU Member States. It represents openness, interaction and cooperation. However, we must not forget that Macedonia was granted the status of accession candidate four years ago and since then, we have constantly been asking ourselves when it would finally join the European Union. I would like to call on all the parties to ensure that the name conflict, which is currently the focus of attention, is resolved. We must make use of the momentum generated by the Council decision in December and by the new Greek Government. This momentum is diminishing day by day. I would like to explain to the parties that if we concentrate now on other topics, such as the financial crisis, the goal of Macedonia’s accession will be pushed further into the background. We surely do not wish this to happen and this is why we must continue to make every effort in this area. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mr Kallas, Mr Caldeira, I can see both good things and bad things in the presentation of the Court of Auditors’ annual report on the EU budget. First of all, I would like to thank the Court of Auditors for a clearer, bolder and more political report which is easier for us to understand. The good areas include the management of the budget as a whole. In contrast to recent years, this has improved. This is, above all, the result of better management of funds in the area of agriculture and natural resources, which has been our biggest headache over the last few years. For the first time, Mr Caldeira, you do not give an adverse opinion in your report and that is good news. The report highlights the fact that wherever the EU itself controls and administers the funds, there is proper budget management. Whether it is efficient is another matter. I would like to congratulate Mr Kallas warmly in this respect. It is to your credit and during your period of office that this visible improvement has taken place. Congratulations! However, it is now the responsibility of the Member States in particular to improve their control systems. If there is continuing cause for criticism of budgetary management in the EU, this is not at an EU level – as we have now seen – but at the level of the Member States. This is where the problems lie. Cohesion policy, for example, which is implemented by the Member States and which receives around a third of the funds, is the major problem area. You say that 11% is irregular and the non-attached Member said that the figure was EUR 4 billion. That is not correct. It is over EUR 2.5 billion, which you specifically state is taxpayers’ money that should not have been spent. We must say this quite clearly and we must introduce clear controls. However, the consequence is that the European Commission must continue to exert pressure on the Member States and we will support you in this area, Mr Kallas. We must implement a policy of naming and shaming. We must publicly shame the wasteful Member States, which continue to exist, and describe the situation clearly. Overall, you come to the conclusion that the regulations must be simplified. We would like to support you in this and we would like to add one other request. There must be an increased focus not only on regularity but also on efficiency, to ensure that taxpayers’ money is spent correctly. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am speaking as head of the delegation to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and I will be concentrating on this country. I would like to offer my very warm thanks to Mr Rehn for his courage. His report and his green light for this country represent a bold step forward which has generated momentum. At the same time, elections have been held in Greece and there is a new government in Athens, which gives us a situation and a window in which we can achieve something. However, I would like to ask my fellow Members to react calmly. A meeting is being held on Friday between Mr Papandreou and Prime Minister Gruevski, and if we set expectations too high, we may increase the pressure so much that the whole thing falls apart and we do not want to risk that. We must encourage all sides to continue in friendship along the path that has already been taken. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Thaler, for describing this route so accurately. I would also like to wish my friend, Mr Rehn, a successful future in the Commission. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Madam President, thank you very much for the question. I believe that both sides need to change their spots and it is clear that both sides are ready to take a step forward. We are now expecting a lasting solution. For this reason, I expect the name issue to be resolved clearly and definitively in the course of a five-minute discussion. That is not the problem. The application of the name, the so-called scope, is the major issue and both sides obviously need time to resolve it. I would like to see a lasting solution because the alternative is a short-term solution which could lead to disaster. For this reason, all of us must give both sides friendly encouragement to find a long-term solution with a broad scope and a broad application. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner Kallas, first of all, I very much welcome the fact that the Swedish Presidency of the Council is present, and I would also like to personally thank Mrs Malmström for having made the procedure more transparent. Everything that my fellow Members have said is true – the procedure is more transparent, and even if she expressed herself in a somewhat more cautious manner today, we can still say that we will be granting discharge. There is still a very long way to go. We ask the Council to follow this first step with further steps, especially given that the Council’s competences in the field of foreign and security policy have been much more clearly defined under the Treaty of Lisbon. In future, this policy will also have a face, in the shape of Baroness Ashton. The citizens, however, did not previously know Baroness Ashton, and they, the European taxpayers, will still not know, in future, exactly how much money she has at her disposal and what she does with it. We must change this state of affairs. This, indeed, is an absolute must in a time where we are actually fighting for a transparent, democratic Europe. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Søndergaard for having applied pressure in our – Parliament’s – name, and we will maintain that pressure. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis,

 Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, today we are debating a motion for resolution on neurodegenerative diseases. The intention is actually for this to become a directive, and so next time, we should also be debating a directive on this subject. The diseases that we are discussing today – Alzheimer’s disease, although Parkinson’s disease is also referred to in the text – are diseases of the brain which constitute a major challenge for Europe. The long-term costs are set to soar and there is still a lot of research to do. Unfortunately, there is a lot of duplicated research and bureaucracy in Europe. Thus, with this motion for a resolution, we want to eliminate the duplicated research, bureaucracy and fragmentation. The Group of the United European Left – Nordic Green Left has tabled a motion for the research results to be made publicly available. I think this motion is a good one. Unfortunately, the wording is wrong, and I would therefore ask for it to be reworded so that it can be incorporated better. Essentially, there is a problem with regard to European patents. It would be good if the Commission, and the Council, too, could take up the subject of European patents in the areas of pharmaceuticals and bio-research and make it clear that we need this. In any case, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports this motion for a resolution. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis  (ALDE

Madam President, I'm delighted to be given the opportunity of taking the floor in the first meeting to be chaired by you. I am very pleased, in fact! Most of all, however, I would like to thank Commissioner Špidla for having spoken German, and I would like to express my heartfelt congratulations to Commissioner Kroes. Many people believe that the Opel-Vauxhall case is a German issue. It is not – it is a European issue! It relates to jobs all across Europe, and special treatment here for Germany would not be right. I am therefore particularly pleased to see that the Commission is willing to examine this case. The issues at hand are questions under European law in relation to competition law and State aid. We do want to save every job, but at what price? As counsel for the citizens and taxpayers, it is unclear in the Opel-Magna deal what long-term commitments will be laid at taxpayers’ doors. The Opel case is also questionable from an industrial policy point of view. It is always only the biggest who receive help. The smallest and those in the middle are left to look after themselves, yet they are the backbone of the economy. The fixation on one investor was clearly a wrong move. Better and more favourable offers were turned down early on – and by politicians, in fact. The Opel case has more to do with electioneering than with economic and industrial policy that is pure and above board from the point of view of EU law. To restate the point, it is important the Commission now plays an active role, even if the German Government does not approve. The Opel deal is a sham. That is becoming ever more obvious. It could mark the most expensive election campaign in the history of Germany. We want Opel to survive, we want it to be healthy and we want to fight for every job, but we do not want there to be costs involved, nor do we want a solution at the expense of our European partners, on whom Germany, as the biggest exporter in the world, is also dependent.

Mr President, Commissioner, dear colleagues, thank you for the opportunity to raise the issue of non-preferential rules of origin with you in plenary today. ‘Better late than never’, I feel compelled to say, as we already tabled this question about a year ago. This was at a time when the internal market and the Committee on International Trade were drafting their report on the modernisation of the customs code. Nevertheless it is still important to have this discussion on the proposed introduction of the ‘list rules’, as my colleague already mentioned, for the non-preferential origin of goods, and hear the Commission’s answers to our questions. This is all the more important as business and customs officials fear the rise of new bureaucratic burdens if these rules for the determination of the origin were to be changed. My colleagues from the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection have been working intensively on the recast of the Union Customs Code and adopted their report with a broad majority at the end of last year. The report states very clearly that the current concept for the determination of non-preferential origin of goods should be maintained. This is, and I quote, ‘when they underwent their last substantial economically justified processing or working’. This definition is very clear and has served as a solid basis in international trade for decades, so why change it? The Commission says the introduction of list rules would bring greater legal certainty for the determination of origin and in anti-dumping cases. Well, in my view this is quite a theoretical approach. Practitioners have been complaining that the legal certainty is not improved, and anti-dumping cases only involve 0.7% of all imports into the EU. So I think we should stick to the saying: ‘If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’. From the perspective of international trade, the proposed changes are particularly sensitive. They would have obliged EU importers to comply with the new EU rules instead of applying the domestic laws of origin as is currently the case. We should be very careful with such requests to our trade partners as it would also mean that EU producers would have to apply the multitude of rules of origin of the multitude of destination countries to which we are exporting. Knowing you, Commissioner De Gucht, I think it is not your intention to make trade more complicated for EU producers. So I would like to thank you for being here tonight and I am looking forward to hearing your answers on the questions we have raised. Silvana Koch-Mehrin,

 Madam President, while Russia and the European Union enjoy a very intertwined and intense relationship and today we are not only neighbours, but fortunately we are friends, the Liberals and Democrats also welcome the accession of Russia to the WTO after eighteen years of negotiations. It was high time indeed. I think it is good news for Russia but also for the European Union. Why? Because we can hope for a relationship based on clear rules and clear applicability. If we look at what happened to China after it joined the WTO, we can see that the growth and the success story of China really began with that date a few years ago. So I hope this will happen for Russia as well and that Russia can also envisage an extreme success story after the significant date in August this year. But I would also like to raise two concerns, two challenges. One has already been mentioned by Mr Sefčovič and other colleagues, and that is that Russia does not seem to be willing to live up 100 % to its obligations which come with the accession to the WTO but is instead undertaking some extensive and potentially restrictive trade measures like the examples which have already been mentioned. The second point I would like to make is that we have to look at the business environment in Russia. Russia has always been a very proud nation with a rich culture, with inventions and esprit
; Nobel Prize winners and astronauts have come from Russia. We all know about these important landmarks in Russian history. But why is it that today – apart from maybe vodka, caviar and Gazprom – we do not really know of any Russian brands? Why is it that they do not really thrive? Why are there not Russian success stories? I think this has to do with the applicability of the rule of law and human rights, and I think it is good that it has been raised in our resolution. It comes in a timely manner, because next week we go to Moscow and can discuss it there. Silvana Koch-Mehrin,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, every aspect of European trade policy has changed. The policy has a completely new legal basis and it is particularly obvious that the new Treaty has had major consequences for the European Parliament. The subject we are currently discussing concerns what at first sight are technical questions and these involve complex concepts, such as the introduction of delegated acts and the adoption of implementing provisions. However, behind these concepts lie tangible trade policy interests. We only need to think of the time limits for anti-dumping procedures or for the regulations on anti-subsidy instruments. In these cases, time really is money. The new requirements for transparency in the case of non-confidential information are also of great interest to the general public. Ms Quisthoudt-Rowohl has already mentioned the subject of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). If we had had more transparency in this area right from the beginning, who knows how many of the discussions could have been avoided. I think that at this point, I simply need to give my thanks to the rapporteur, who has guided us confidently through this subject and has managed the cooperation with her fellow Members very well. I hope that we will very soon reach a conclusion in this area. Silvana Koch-Mehrin  (ALDE
).

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, who in Europe is still talking about votes for women? The answer is that nobody is nowadays, as we take women’s right to vote for granted. How was that situation brought about? It was done through legislation, through compulsion, in other words. I therefore think it is important that we should also introduce gender quotas today through legislation. The result would be that we would not have to talk about it any more, as it would be just as self-evident as women’s right to vote. Voluntary self-imposed obligations either do not work or are not even entered into, and this applies just as much to the economy as to politics. In a representative democracy such as Europe, the majority of the population, which is to say women, must actually be represented accordingly in politics. Yet the reality in the parliaments and in the parties is something quite different. When it comes to the economy, numerous studies have shown that an equal distribution of women and men in executive positions considerably improves the economic success of a company. Moreover, it is also the case that the decision on whether or not to buy something is taken by women for nearly every product. As a liberal, I stand for competition, and I stand for a free and fair market economy. However, both of these only work when basic conditions are in place that permit that very freedom and fairness. Those conditions are not in place for women when it comes to executive positions. I therefore look forward, Ms Reding, to the proposals that you will be bringing forward in May on the participation of more women in executive positions. It is, I would say, high time for that to happen. Silvana Koch-Mehrin,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Petitions

 Mr President, in the Committee on Petitions we are concerned with ensuring that the European Ombudsman receives adequate funding. The office of the European Ombudsman is an important European body. It provides assistance to citizens and resolves problems and errors in the institutions. It also brings the EU closer to its citizens. In the 2012 budget there is very moderate increase of 0.47% for the European Ombudsman. For example, no new posts have been requested and no new employees will be appointed. Nevertheless, the Council wanted to make some cuts. Therefore, I would like to thank the Committee on Budgets for reversing these cuts and I hope that we can confirm the committee’s position today. This would send out a signal that the EU needs to move closer to its citizens. Silvana Koch-Mehrin,

 Madam President, this is certainly an important subject; we are all aware of that. Before the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, the national parliaments were constantly complaining that 80% of the laws they passed were actually decided by Europe; that they were simply rubber-stamping it as a kind of agent of the EU. The Treaty of Lisbon has changed that. The national parliaments play a leading role and can exert an influence. The Treaty of Lisbon has made the EU more democratic because it has given greater power to the representatives of the people. This applies to the European Parliament just as much as to the national parliaments. The national parliaments then continued to complain nonetheless; this time, about the increased workload, the mountains of documents constantly landing on their desks with just a few weeks for them to respond. The important thing, however, is that the representatives of the people in Europe’s capitals now have a means of exerting influence over the European Union’s initiatives – and I get the impression that the national parliaments are increasingly realising this and making use of it. Almost two years have now passed since the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force on 1 December 2009, when these procedures also took effect. I and a few of my fellow Members therefore felt that the time was right to ask how the Commission sees the situation now. Is it satisfied with the quality of the response from the national parliaments? How does the Commission deal with this? Does it have sufficient resources – including human resources – to deal with it? Moreover, in some Member States, the regions are important, such as the Bundesländer
 in the case of Germany. How is input from this political level dealt with? Does it have sufficient resonance? Is there also adequate cooperation with the Committee of the Regions? These are the questions put jointly by Andrew Duff, Alexandra Thein, Michael Theurer and myself. I look forward to hearing your answer. President.

 In the vote on the Lange report, I am abstaining on paragraph 31 because of the ambiguous wording of the vote, which refers to Eurobonds as well as project bonds. However, taking it as a whole, I am voting for the report, as I have nothing against project bonds in themselves. Project bonds serve as finance for extensive innovation, infrastructure and reindustrialisation projects. This is not a question of instruments for the communitarisation of debts, as would be the case with Eurobonds. Silvana Koch-Mehrin,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the equality of all human beings is enshrined in the first two articles of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This states: ‘All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood’. What a wonderful sentence. However, even one hundred years after the first International Women’s Day, we still have not achieved this: there is still no sign of true equality between men and women. Granted, we have achieved at great deal in Europe. Today, our primary concern is no longer the legal freedom of women. We have largely achieved this freedom. I would like to express my gratitude to the feminists, both male and female, for their work in the past. Today, our main concern is freedom in action, that men should take ownership of the issue of the compatibility of work and family life, and that seeing women at the top in business or politics is something that should become commonplace. It is fantastic to see how the liberation movements in North Africa look to us, the women of Europe. They look to us to play a pioneering role. It is vitally important that we do not lose sight of our goal: the freedom to live our lives according to our own conceptions. That is when equality will become something we take for granted and when International Women’s Day will be transformed from a day of remembrance to a day to celebrate freedom. President.

Madam President, Mr Oettinger, it is good that you have commissioned the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks to look at this issue again. I am pleased about this. However, the question remains: How can we explain to the citizens of Europe that they have to allow something into their houses under EU regulations which represents a health hazard for their children? You have children and you know how it is. Things often get broken. Mr Leichtfried from Austria and I are very concerned about this. How can we make it clear that this is something dangerous? We do not seem to be able to learn from past mistakes. However, you were not responsible for the original decision, so you can show a willingness to learn without losing face. You could have said that we will withdraw this ban, at least for private households. Would you be prepared to reconsider your decision? President.

 Mr President, competition policy is one of the most important, central policy areas of the EU. Good competition policy enables markets to function properly. Good competition policy also allows consumers to benefit from a wide variety of products at reasonable and affordable prices. Good competition policy also contributes to creating growth again in Europe. That is why it is so important, Commissioner, to include all the areas that you have mentioned in competition policy. It is also important to strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises, as they are the driving force behind growth in Europe. Market barriers must be abolished, which also means doing away with the excessive costs that still pertain where competition is not working, such as roaming charges on mobile phones, where competition still does not exist – something that needs to be changed. Finally, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Eppink, for his excellent work, and to the Commission I would say: be ambitious in your goals. (Applause) President.

There has been a great deal of interest in participating in the debate in the ‘catch the eye’ procedure, which is, of course, good and is also the point of the procedure.

 Combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography is vitally important. We must use all our strength to combat the availability of child pornography in communications networks. The permanent and effective control of child abuse is both a political responsibility and a precept of the rule of law. The German Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament is of the opinion that it is necessary to remove such criminal content as quickly as possible. President.

– As far as the list of speakers is concerned, the cause is being looked into. President.  
– Mr Ouzký, many thanks once again for bringing this to our attention. We have looked into it. It was a problem in the allocation caused by the computer system.

 Supplementary questions using the blue card are not permitted during the one-minute speeches. Thus, it was not a point of order. Your fellow Member could perhaps answer your question on a one-to-one basis, but in any case not during the plenary debate. President. - 
 Thank you very much. As you can imagine, as President of the High Level Group on Gender Equality and Diversity, equality is very important to me. We have a list of speakers and we did try to make it balanced. Who gets the opportunity to speak during the debate is, of course, also dependent on who is actually present. That concludes this item.

). President.  
– Blue card questions on a personal comment under Rule 151 are not permitted. Your request to speak on this point therefore cannot be accepted. President.  
– Many thanks. We will now continue with the debate. I allowed the personal explanation because the previous point of order referred directly to Mr Martin. We will now go on with the debate and also devote our full attention to it. President.  
– We had a technical problem here, so it was somewhat longer than a minute. However, the clock is now working again, and hopefully everything should now go according to the set timetable. President.

– The next item is the one-minute speeches in accordance with Rule 150. Rule 150 states that we may spend a maximum of 30 minutes on this item. We had more than 74 requests to speak under this item. That will clearly not be possible. Thirty minutes and 74 speakers for one minute will simply not work. Therefore, we have, for the first time, selected in advance the Members who will be granted speaking time using clear criteria, namely that those who requested speaking time in another debate with one-minute speeches but did not get chance to speak will now be granted speaking time where possible, whereas those who have already spoken in other debates will not be granted any speaking time. All of those who have not been granted speaking time were informed of this in advance by e-mail. Therefore, they do not need to be here to wait in vain for their speaking time. I hope that you understand that. This was the only possible way to enable the debate to proceed in an orderly manner. Therefore, those who have been granted speaking time can now begin straight away. President.  
– That concludes this item. Thank you all for your understanding and for the disciplined proceedings. I hope that all of those who did not have an opportunity to speak this time will get the chance to do so next time. President.

According to the resolution of the European Parliament on the draft general budget for the financial year 2010, adopted on 17 December 2009, a vote was taken today on the amending budget for the European Parliament, following the revised calculations made by the Parliamentary administration. The FDP in the European Parliament abstained, because there was a paragraph in the package of amendments concerned that we could not reconcile with our convictions. The FDP had already expressed its opposition to an increase in the secretarial allowance to EUR 1 500 during the discussions in committee. It is out of the secretarial allowance that MEPs’ assistants are paid. The FDP considers that the argument that more money is needed due to the additional work that MEPs have to do with the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is unsound, as there is nothing in past experience to support this. Certainly, due to the Treaty of Lisbon, which has just come into force, Parliament will overall need extra capacity for legislative work, but with the introduction of the Assistants’ Statute from the beginning of the current parliamentary term, there is still no proof that MEPs actually need more assistants. For this reason, there are grounds for concern that further demands and supplementary increases, or an extension of office capacity, will follow. For this reason, the FDP in the European Parliament abstained. President.

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Spain is now taking on the Presidency of the European Union for the fourth time. You know what it is to cooperate with the European Parliament in a very wide range of situations. We now have the Treaty of Lisbon, which means that the European Parliament is now your key contact partner. In your programme, you say that you want the EU to take root in the will of those who render it legitimate, namely European citizens. That is a very ambitious aim. The path to achieving it can only be found via the representatives of European citizens, in other words the parliaments. I am therefore very pleased to hear you say that cooperation between the national parliaments, the parliaments of the EU Member States, and the European Parliament is the cornerstone of such a path. You want to bring the parliaments closer together in order to bring citizens closer together. That is a good thing. You have a great responsibility in this regard, as you are the first Presidency following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. Other Presidencies will use you as an example. You are therefore creating the blueprint, so to speak. I would like subsequent presidencies to have to measure themselves against you where cooperation structures are concerned. I wish you much success! Silvana Koch-Mehrin  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Reinfeldt, your calm and steady Presidency was a success. You had difficult political issues to resolve and overall you did a good job. The people chosen by you for the important new EU posts can now define these without any preconceived ideas, as they are as yet largely unknown to most European citizens. As an aside, if I may say so, your best decision is sitting on your right. Nevertheless, Mr Reinfeldt, I cannot give your Presidency full marks. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, you increased the development towards making the European Council into a kind of EU ‘supergovernment’. Its comprehensive jurisdiction is increasing, from the environment to financial policy. At the same time, you are closing the doors ever tighter. This is not what transparent debates by representatives of the people look like. The second reason is this: the fact that you pushed SWIFT through the Council just hours before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon demonstrates a clear disregard for the European Parliament and hence a lack of respect for the citizens. Nevertheless, I would like to thank you for the last six months. President.

 Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would also like to thank our colleague Ms Thyssen for her extremely detailed and largely balanced report. We have known for some time that the euro area can only be successful in the long term if it achieves greater integration and actually becomes a genuine economic, financial and monetary union. What that means in detail and what measures need to be taken emerge from the report put forward by Mr Rompuy this summer. This report was drawn up by four Presidents. There is one President missing, however, namely President Martin Schulz, the representative of our House. To me this demonstrates the little esteem in which our House is actually held by the Council. This is also made clear by the fact that the Council is now trying to rush through a very important issue, namely the introduction of a powerful supervisory mechanism for the banking sector at the European Central Bank, with Parliament once again having been assigned nothing more than a role on the sidelines. I do not consider this to be compatible with the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon and I believe that the Council’s ‘sink or swim’ policy towards Parliament is doomed to failure in the long term.

 Mr President, … am not satisfied with the collaboration between Parliament and the Council on this point. The Crisis Committee’s proposals, some of which the Council is now taking up, were hardly commented on by the Council in any way at the time the report was presented, let alone adopted. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

Mr President, Commissioner, two years ago the European Parliament came to the conclusion that the European internal market for financial services also needs European supervision and it proposed establishing this supervision with, but not in, the European Central Bank, so as not to put the Bank’s independence at risk. The Commission now suggests establishing such supervision within the ECB and first focusing its work on the financial institutions of the euro area. The European internal market for financial service providers involves more than just the euro area, however. For this reason I believe it is crucial for us to act as quickly as possible to place not only the financial institutions of the euro area under this supervision, but also the entire European Union. The first step should be at least to place all the countries that have committed themselves to introducing the euro, in other words all countries except Denmark and the United Kingdom, under this supervision. It is important that this supervision should not become a bureaucratic monster. That is why it is crucial that the share-out of tasks between the ECB and the national supervisory bodies should be clarified quickly. It is also necessary to clarify the share-out of tasks between the ECB and the European Banking Authority (EBA). Democratic legitimation has been mentioned more than once here. The key is that the accountability of this supervision is assured without putting the independence of the bank at risk. One more point: the project must be implemented in such a way that citizens have no reason to be even more Eurosceptic. Be careful in your use of national rescue, resolution and deposit guarantee funds. Our citizens see this as their money and want it to be used in their own countries. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have a massive crisis of confidence, and therefore expectations of the last summit were relatively high. The summit was scarcely any different from earlier summits, with one exception: seldom have the negotiating tactics – which sometimes bordered on blackmail – and the differences between the negotiating partners been played out so clearly to the outside world as this time. In the end, agreement was reached on Friday morning. However, it turns out that, when it comes down to it, the consensus reached was only a formal compromise, which was then called into question again just 72 hours after being reached. The Dutch and the Finns have already announced that they do not support the buying of government bonds on the secondary market. The markets, which had, until then, reacted positively, are now also beginning to question and smear the result. I expressly welcome the fact that it was decided at the summit to get serious about creating a real banking union. If we have a common economic area and currency area, then we also need a genuine functioning internal market for financial services. Naturally, that includes bank supervision, but it also includes a banking resolution and rescue fund, and ultimately it also includes a deposit guarantee system. All that will take time, and I hope that the European Parliament will be adequately taken into consideration at least in the first step, the construction of supervision at the European Central Bank, and things will not continue as they have done recently. This summit was definitely not the great breakthrough. It was not a great act of liberation. The citizens are just as uncertain as before, and I fear that we will continue to muddle along. I can only hope that we have enough time in which to find the ultimate solution. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 The German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament has spoken out clearly in favour of the introduction of a debt redemption fund. However, participation in such a fund must be associated with clear and strict rules, such as were contained in the proposal made by the German Council of Economic Experts to the German Government in autumn 2011. Watering down the criteria for participation is neither productive nor effective. Linking the introduction of a debt redemption fund with the eurobonds project and the treatment of economic imbalances is unfair, and is rejected by the FDP in the European Parliament in the strongest possible terms. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis goes on. The measures adopted in recent months, or even years, have failed to convince the markets on a durable basis. There is an urgent need for the Member States to take seriously a disciplined, balanced budgetary policy. The ‘two-pack’ can help to make progress in that direction. It can provide the basis for stability and growth. However, a whole series of amendments are once again being tabled, with the aim of watering down the proposals. We do not need a watered-down ‘two-pack’, however. What we do require is a genuine act of release. This act of release could consist of two elements. The first element would be the debt redemption fund already mentioned by a number of speakers, which would help to consolidate the inherited debts and spread them out over a period of 25 years. The second element would be that we have to achieve real progress in the conversion of the euro area into a true internal financial market, in other words, into an internal market with cross-border banking supervision, a cross-border deposit guarantee fund and a uniform cross-border banking rescue and resolution regime. Wolf Klinz,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, all products and services are taxed, so one might well ask why financial transactions should not be taxed also. I can therefore fully understand the idea behind taxing such transactions. The financial sector has, after all, caused considerable damage in recent years, and is not exactly without blame for the difficult situation that we currently find ourselves in, particularly in Europe. The speculative losses of JPMorgan Chase that recently came to light bear witness once again to the fact that the financial industry really has not yet learnt from past mistakes. It seems that the greed of some players has still not been assuaged. The Commission has tabled a very creative proposal, and the residence principle that it has proposed has been supplemented by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs with the issuance and the ownership principles. Together, these should actually ensure that the risk of financial transactions being shifted out of the EU to other regions of the world can be relatively well averted. Nonetheless, naturally, there are still issues outstanding. Unlike the Commissioner, I feel that we should, in fact, exempt pension funds, because I do not see why savers who are putting aside money for their old age should be penalised. Moreover, there are naturally a few questions regarding the practical implementation of how the tax is levied that have yet to be clarified, and last but not least, how the revenue is actually going to be used. What will go to the EU and what will go to the Member States? In our approach to resolving this, there are two things that we should not lose sight of. Firstly, we must not weaken Europe. Secondly, we must ensure that we do not fragment Europe further. We have to achieve the exact opposite – not fragmentation, but as much progress as possible on the harmonisation of our taxes. A global introduction of the tax is not feasible at present; we know that. Regrettably, we cannot introduce it EU-wide either. It appears that the British veto cannot be broken. The rapporteur’s suggestion that we proceed now by means of enhanced cooperation does not seem to me to be sufficient. If we were to push ahead with only nine or ten Member States, we would actually be contributing to further fragmentation in Europe. That is not what we want. That is why I feel that as a minimum, we must have all 17 euro area members plus a couple more on board. We therefore have to look for alternatives that would enable all countries to participate. I feel that we could even take the UK’s stamp duty as a starting point, and then of course expand it and include not just shares, but also bonds, derivatives and professional dealers. If we content ourselves with the current proposal and the mechanism of enhanced cooperation, then I believe we will be going down the wrong route.

 I did, in fact, say that the matter of how the resources will be used has not yet been finally decided. How much will go to Brussels and how much will remain with the Member States is still a matter of debate. Even among the Member States, it has not yet been settled which Member State would receive the funds. Once we have fundamentally settled this issue and know how much is going to the EU budget in Brussels, then we can think about the question that you have raised. At the moment, it would be purely speculation. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I subscribe to your opinion that the highly indebted countries will only be able to extract themselves from their predicament through a combination of growth and austerity. Some of what you propose – such as European Investment Bank (EIB) financed infrastructure projects – could indeed make them more competitive and thus contribute to growth. However, much of what you say reminds me of what Christine Lagarde of the International Monetary Fund is proposing – namely, taking on more debt in order to stimulate growth. At the end of the day, such additional financial injections would be just a flash in the pan, and there would be nothing to show for it afterwards other than even higher levels of debt, even higher unemployment and even higher inflation. We experienced that in Germany in the 1970s, when Helmut Schmidt tried precisely that. What we are dealing with is not a cyclical problem, but rather a structural weakness. If we are to overcome it, we need courageous structural reforms. Unfortunately, we are seeing little of that in the countries concerned. We need to complete the internal market, including the services sector. We need to open up protected markets, we need to make the labour market more flexible and we need to get rid of red tape. All that can happen without taking any more money, and it would still lead to growth. Wolf Klinz,

To me, it was like a small miracle when President Thein Sein, a former member of the military junta, gave us a relatively credible explanation of his desire for reform. The critical test came at the beginning of this month, when the by-elections took place. It was very impressive to see how the opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who previously had to operate in secret, achieved an overwhelming victory, despite the fact that obstacles were occasionally placed in the way of her election campaign. However, one thing must be clear to us. Her party, the National League for Democracy, is still a very small party. It currently has only just over 40 seats. Therefore, the way in which it develops over the next few weeks, months and years will be decisive. The crucial landmark will be the 2015 elections. This is when it will become clear whether the citizens of Burma really have the opportunity to elect their members of parliament and their government freely, fairly and without outside influence. Until then, the reform process must continue at a rapid pace. It is essential that those who are currently in power make genuine progress and go on with the work that they have started. They must release the remaining political prisoners, as Mr Belet has already said. They must come to a ceasefire in the feuds that they are having with different ethnic groups and ultimately bring about peace. They must offer their citizens full democratic rights, such as freedom of expression in speech and writing, including on the Internet, in schools and in universities. They must ensure that there is a free and independent press and an independent judicial system. They must begin the systematic process of establishing the structures of a social market economy. We, together with our private sector, can and must help them to achieve this. As Burma introduces more democracy and freedom for its people, so the West can reduce its sanctions or even lift them altogether. It is in all our interests for Burma to free itself from China’s embrace and to overcome the mass poverty among its citizens. Wolf Klinz,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when the Lehman Brothers Bank in New York collapsed in March 2008, the global financial crisis reached its first high point. For small-scale savers and depositors, this crisis began a year earlier, when Northern Rock in the United Kingdom ran into difficulties and long queues of depositors suddenly began to form outside bank buildings, with customers waiting to withdraw their money. This was not just limited to Northern Rock, but was also evident in other banks too. The uncertainty among savers, in particular small-scale depositors, was enormous, which was why national governments found themselves forced to guarantee investments above the contractually guaranteed minimum level. Some states, like Germany and Ireland, actually guaranteed deposits to an unlimited extent, something that could not be sustained in the long term. The divergence between the deposit guarantee schemes in Europe came at a price at the time. That is why the Commission rightly said that we must ensure order and we must present a uniform deposit guarantee scheme for all 27 Member States of the European Union. It did this in an extremely convincing and acceptable way. The gaps were closed, depositor security was strengthened and a broad degree of harmonisation was established. As representatives of Parliament, we support this proposal. We had thought that we could have tabled one or two improvements. Unfortunately, as Mr Balz has already explained, our negotiations with the Council have been unsuccessful to date. Nonetheless, we are not giving up hope, but believe that we may still succeed in the coming months. The following is an important point, however: a deposit guarantee scheme protects depositors and is therefore necessary. However, it is even more important that it should not run out of money. Even more important again is that insolvency, or even difficulty, should be avoided, and that we should have preventive measures in place. That is why we urgently await the Commission’s presentation of the crisis and process management dossier. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union stands at an absolutely crucial crossroads. We need to deepen integration, especially in the fields of financial and economic policy. We need a strong Commissioner who combines the functions that are currently spread between the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Euro, the President of the Euro Group, a different Finance Minister every six months and the regent of economics Herman Van Rompuy into a single role and who represents the EU and the euro area to the outside world. If that does not succeed, we will not even be able to defend the status quo
, we will then inevitably find ourselves in a disintegration phase. We do not want a union of debt. We need a union of stability, and that is why the solution does not consist of issuing Eurobonds. Only today, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) had to pay 200 basis points more for its bond issues than Germany. The situation is getting worse – the bonds already issued are quoted far below face value. We need to attempt to also raise reserves that we still have in every Member State. The whole issue of the subsidies must be approached. In my country alone this is certainly a high two-digit, maybe even a three-digit, figure in billions that thus can be adjusted in the budget, with the effect of raising taxes. Mr Trichet hit the nail on the head today when he said that time is of the essence. The reality is that we must act fast or else the markets will continue to set the course for politics. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis was established in autumn 2009, many observers commented that it was too late. It should have been launched a year earlier and the crisis was almost over, they said. Today, we find ourselves not in the first or second year following the crisis, but rather in the fourth year of the crisis. The problem is still ongoing. Fukushima has shown that, one day, everything that can possibly go wrong will go wrong. It was a similar story with the global financial crisis. Numerous negative factors coincided and, if it were not for the decisive action by the European Union and the USA, things might have hit a new low, leading to economic melt-down and a repeat of the great depression of the last century. Happily, this has been avoided. However, we now have the so-called debt crisis or the euro crisis in Europe. We have been in the grip of this problem for eighteen months now. I get the impression that Europe’s decision makers have not been providing active leadership for the last year-and-a-half. They react to market distortions and turbulences in the market, but they do not act with foresight on the basis of a clear vision of where they want to take Europe. That is what is missing. There is a lack of vision, and our citizens have the impression that it is business as usual for those who caused the crisis: profits are privatised, losses are socialised and the actual issues are side-stepped. That is where our report has its starting point. It makes proposals for the overall direction of the future development of the European Union and the euro area. Mrs Berès explained these proposals in detail and Mr Karas also discussed them. I do not need to go into further detail at this point. There is one important point to note, however, which is that Europe has reached an extremely critical turning point. If we do not choose the right path now, we will not even be able to maintain the status quo of the integration already achieved, and will instead find ourselves taking a step backwards. It is important that all of us who believe in Europe and who want to shape Europe’s future should support these ideas, addressing our citizens and the representatives of the national parliaments and trying to win them over to our cause. (Applause) Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we do not know precisely what role short selling or naked short selling played in the bankruptcies of Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers, but we do know that they made at least a substantial contribution to the collapse of these institutions. Claiming that naked short selling is useful for the market is as hard to prove as saying that it will be the end of the world if we do not prohibit it. We are dealing here with a highly complex, extremely technical area and I would not dare to claim that one thing or another was definitely right. However, it seems to me absurd to want to sell something that you do not even have, and moreover to want to do this on a speculative basis. It goes against my basic understanding of how one should behave in business. If I do not have the title to something then it is difficult for me to offer it for sale. Whether this is genuinely useful for the market is something that I am not in a position to judge. Perhaps it is – but my instinct suggests it is not. I would therefore suggest that we should deal with it by saying that shares, debt instruments and credit default swaps (CDSs) can only be offered for sale if you either hold the title or – if you do not hold the title – a loan agreement has been concluded or at least an agreement that says that the title will be available the next day or in a certain number of days’ time if the transaction is actually concluded and settled, so that no risk arises. I thought that the Council and Parliament had already agreed on this when they agreed the intraday rule. I regret to say that the Council has since moved away from this position, and I hope that it may find its way back to it. One thing is certain: in the final event, these are international transactions and it is therefore important for us to have very clear supervisory rules. It seems to me that the recently established European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) is the ideal institution to have a sole mandate to intervene in serious cases and to establish what needs to be prohibited, what needs at least to be recorded, where we need a repository, where we need a reporting requirement and so on. In this respect we have an ideal opportunity to use ESMA productively. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for a long time we believed that the internal market and the introduction of a common currency would automatically result in economic convergence and convergence of the Member States, and that the Maastricht criteria were sufficient to ensure discipline. Reality has now caught up with us. The management instruments have proved to be inadequate and in the past they have been grossly transgressed. A single currency and a single monetary policy are not feasible in the long term unless the rules have teeth in the area of fiscal, budgetary, economic and social policy. The EU is now trying a new approach. To speak metaphorically, it has one last shot. If this last shot fails to hit the target, the damage could be severe. The EU could find itself in a regressive phase, we could see the return of renationalisation and protectionism, and the first signs of disintegration in the euro area. The new package attempts to prevent this and to lay a new foundation. I am in favour of this package, even though I consider it rather half-hearted in view of the problems that I have just outlined. There is a risk that the European semester will turn out to be a centralist, bureaucratic exercise. The pact for the euro may possibly be toothless. What we need are binding recommendations from the Commission. What we need are automatic initiatives and sanctions which the Council can only stop by means of reversed qualified majority voting. This is undoubtedly necessary if the disgraceful, opaque wrangles by Council members in back rooms are finally to be brought to an end. What we urgently need is a clear resolution mechanism for the financial sector so that it can work again. Wolf Klinz,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, credit rating agencies certainly did not cause the global financial crisis, but, in my opinion, they were responsible to a significant extent for its severity. When the so-called structured financial products were developed in America on the basis of the subprime mortgages, the credit rating agencies supported this process by rating dozens, if not hundreds, of products each day in an almost conveyor-belt fashion. In so doing, they also accepted conflicts of interests, in that they supported the issuers with advice and help in designing these products. They continued to claim that they were only expressing an opinion, although they knew very well that their ratings were, in fact, being used as a seal of approval. My report deals with numerous deficiencies and puts forward proposals in the hope that the Commission will perhaps be able to include some of them in its legislative proposal that it will be tabling in the autumn. I put forward five proposals. The first is that the reliance on ratings must be reduced. In practice, we have found that the regulatory environment has led to the use of ratings being absolutely essential, by banks, insurance companies, pension funds etc. which invest their money. Basel II made this very clear and, in fact, the credit rating agencies have become regulatory certification bodies. We need to make it possible once again for market operators, particularly institutional investors, which possess their own expertise to actually take responsibility themselves and not outsource the responsibility for investment decisions. It needs to be made clear that investors should only invest if they actually understand the product and cannot use the excuse that they can, to a certain extent, automatically make a triple A product the goal of their investment strategy. Secondly, we must ensure that the information on which credit rating agencies base their decisions is made publicly available, that it is understood, and that the models used are also known. That will lead to transparency and will also make it easier for institutional investors seeking to invest to make their own decisions. It will also help to enable unsolicited ratings to be given. In this connection, we should also consider whether the proposal that the United States is considering is a sensible one, namely, that where only one credit rating agency is chosen by issuers, a second, independent body could be encouraged to give a rating and this second body could be allowed to work on the basis of the information that is publicly available. Thirdly, we need more competition. We have a de facto oligopoly. The three credit rating agencies that exist and operate worldwide control 95% of the global business. They have a so-called monopoly income of 40% return on turnover, and therefore I am proposing that we set up a European credit rating agency. It should be based on a foundation model and the start-up financing should be provided by the finance sector by means of interest-bearing loans. After five years, we will know whether it is working and then this credit rating foundation will also have to pay back the funds that it has received. However, I am sure that there are also other options. It would also make sense to perhaps allow national and regional credit rating agencies to operate in the form of a European network. Fourthly, we still have an outstanding matter with regard to the payment model. Currently, we have an issuer-pays model. That is the model that essentially works throughout the world. Thus, the issuer pays, but clearly there is a conflict of interests here that we could reduce if there was no more advising of issuers and if the staff of the supervisory bodies was genuinely independent. Other possible models include a subscriber-pays model. Here, there is obviously the risk of conflicts of interest as well as of this being an invitation to freeloaders. Therefore, this needs consideration. The third option would be a performance-based payment, in other words, an up-front payment and then the final payment only once it is clear how good the rating is. The last, but important, point is that we must introduce liability. Credit rating agencies must accept responsibility for what they actually do, and therefore I believe that we should make them liable, obviously not for the rating as such, but for failures and negligence in their work. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

Madam President, Mr Barroso, Mr Van Rompuy, listening to you carefully one gets the impression that everything is ship-shape: the euro is secure, we have a new Stability and Growth Pact, we have an ESM and we have a Euro Plus Pact. I would say this quite clearly: ‘While I have heard the message, I am not sure I believe it.’ We should not lose sight of the starting point for all these deliberations and measures, namely the run-away debt of some euro Member States, the loss of competitiveness, economic distortions and, as a consequence, an increasing current account deficit that has to be financed. It is already obvious that many Member States will not be able to meet the conditions of the new Stability and Growth Pact with the best will in the world. The ESM will not help to overcome economic distortions because no one has seriously faced up to the idea that a euro Member State could become insolvent and because the prospect of financial aid from the ESM will lead to further laxity. The so-called stringent regulations will prove to be relatively lightweight in practice. The need for unanimous resolutions is resulting in the horse-trading that was a familiar fixture in the past. Finally, the pact for the euro is much too non-committal to cause destitute countries to implement far-reaching real economic reforms. Overall, therefore, I fear that we will not succeed in eliminating the root cause of the problem. We shall have a permanent overdraft facility whose credit parameters will have to be increased at regular intervals. This will turn into a bottomless pit and the citizens in the states that will have to foot the bill will find themselves duped once again. Public confidence in Europe will decline even further as a result. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

Madam President, Mr Schulz is right. We are in the midst of a huge crisis of confidence and the members of the Council are pulling the wool over the citizens’ eyes. They are telling them that everything is under control, we just need to make small changes to the treaty by introducing a permanent stability mechanism and then the problem will be resolved. In fact, the situation is not under control. The Member States are reacting rather than actually taking action. They are desperately firefighting, but they cannot put out the flames. The markets are asking themselves: Who is actually in control in Europe and in the euro area? The EU has reached a critical turning point. If we do not choose the right path now, we will not even be able to maintain the status quo. Instead we will take a step backwards. What we need are further moves towards integration. We need more Europe. We must finish establishing the internal market, including the service sector. Alongside the monetary union, we need an economic, budgetary and fiscal union. We also need a strong Commission which has the right and the power to control and monitor this economic union and to impose sanctions automatically, in cases where this is justified. If we take these steps towards more integration, then we can talk about the introduction of eurobonds. Then we will have laid the foundations for them. However, during all of this we must ensure that we have the long-term investment funding that we need, despite all of the justifiable austerity measures, to secure the European Union’s competitive ability in the medium and long term. We must finally tell the citizens the truth. We need solutions without blinkers, we must discuss the issues without bringing in ideologies and we must stop trying to muddle through. What we require is action for the long term, rather than short-term reactions. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in a few weeks’ time, we will have a new supervisory structure in Europe, which has been shaped to a considerable extent by the European Parliament. Among these three new supervisory authorities will be one that is responsible for markets and securities: the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). ESMA will have the last word in connection with the registration and oversight of credit rating agencies and be responsible for ensuring that the credit rating agencies actually comply with the new regulations. If it so wishes, ESMA can delegate this cross-border responsibility to national supervisory authorities if these supervisory authorities are small and only operate nationally. This proposal is therefore nothing more than an adaptation of the regulation of April 2009 to the new circumstances, but it strengthens the role of ESMA. It gives the new supervisory authority more powers and – something that is completely new – it gives ESMA the power to punish non-application of the regulation. I very much welcome this, because I believe that strengthening the position of a new supervisory authority of European mould will genuinely increase its credibility on the market. I just have one point of criticism. When drawing up the regulation in April 2009, we took a political decision with regard to how we should deal with ratings from third countries in Europe. We said at that time that they can be used in Europe if they either comply with the equivalence procedure or are supported by a credit rating agency that is registered and approved in Europe, the so-called endorsement procedure. The Commission has now changed this at level 2 and said that endorsement will no longer be possible. Therefore, only the equivalence procedure actually applies. I consider this – as it was undertaken unilaterally – to be an undemocratic way of going about things, and I believe that we should stick to the decision that we made at the time in April 2009. As the Commissioner also mentioned, there are still a lot of outstanding issues where credit rating agencies are concerned, namely, the lack of competition, insufficient transparency, the business model as to whether the issuer or the investor should pay, which need to be looked at critically. There are questions with regard to the payment system and also with regard to excessive dependency, because in reality, it is the case that, as a result of regulatory provisions, many ratings agencies have become de facto regulatory certification authorities. I am taking this up in the own-initiative report, and I am pleased that the Commission is going to table a legislative proposal on this matter in the next year. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE
).

 Madam President, Mr Almunia, we need to bite the bullet now, rather than prolonging the agony. This is what comes to mind when I think about the subject that we are discussing today. I support the Commission proposal to phase out State aid in 2014 for the pits which are not competitive by that date. The cost of each job in the coal mining industry is much higher than the average. This money is not being spent on developing sustainable and competitive employment for the future. Therefore, I believe it is right to phase out state subsidies for uncompetitive mines in 2014. We must invest the money which becomes available in research and development and in education and training. This is the only way in which we can maintain our technological head start and remain competitive in the global economy as a whole. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE
).

Madam President, Mr Trichet, we all know that the main task of the European Central Bank is to ensure monetary stability and that you can best achieve this aim by being politically independent. We have always supported you in this. The crises of the last two years have shown that you have a further task, and that is to ensure the stability of the financial markets and of the financial system. This task, too, you have performed very professionally and convincingly. However, to do so, you have had to accept being yoked together with the governments concerned. In other words, you were not able to act with complete political independence here; instead, you had to work together with the governments. I would be interested to know how exactly you would like to arrange this role in the future to ensure firstly, that you are independent, and secondly, that you can continue to perform this task properly without governments exploiting this opportunity to in fact undermine your independence.

 Mr President, after lengthy rounds of negotiations, Parliament, the Council and the Commission have finally agreed on a joint text for regulating alternative investment fund managers. I welcome this, and I have to correct Mr Goebbels: We wished to send the original proposal back because we believed that the alternative investment funds were so different – hedge funds, private equity funds and property funds – that they each need to be regulated separately. Nevertheless, we now have a text that we can fully accept and support. The all-embracing approach that we found disturbing at first has been amended in respect of key elements. As a result, we no longer have a problem with it. The goal of the directive was to create greater transparency for the supervisory bodies but, above all, for the investors, in order to be able to identify systemic risks in due time and at an early stage and so to be able to deal with them accordingly. Personally, I am in favour of rules that all fund managers operating in the EU have to abide by. At the same time, however, I do not like the idea of us turning Europe into a fortress or even a prison or of European institutions seeking to invest not being able to do so outside Europe. We were therefore initially unable to support the proposal as presented in committee. The compromise that has now been found solves this problem. It promises to keep the markets open. Another reason for our initial rejection was the regulations relating to the area of private equity, which would, in fact, have led to distortions of competition in this area. The requirements for private equity, as they were initially formulated, would have placed even listed companies under a definite disadvantage. The compromise that we now have before us eliminates this shortcoming and it prevents asset stripping, which is something that we expressly welcome. Overall, therefore, we are very pleased with the proposal. It creates clear framework conditions and rules for alternative investment fund managers. It will ensure greater transparency for identifying systemic risks. It will therefore ensure greater stability. It will strengthen the internal market because it introduces the EU passport, which, following a transitional period, will also be introduced for managers outside Europe. It will ensure clear, undistorted competition. Finally, it will establish a clear, new task for the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). To conclude, I would like to thank not only my fellow Members but, above all, the Belgian Presidency, which has brought this matter to a successful conclusion with its untiring efforts.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the height of the financial crisis, the G20 countries promised joint action to stabilise the financial markets. Today, two years later, we are still a long way away from a global answer. In many instances, the measures adopted pursue national interests and considerations. The initial energy has dissipated and all too often we are back to ‘business as usual’. Mervyn King of the Bank of England put it succinctly when he said: ‘The need to act in the collective interest has yet to emerge’. In its interim report, the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis makes it clear that Europe is at a critical crossroads. We need to intensify our integration, we need to harmonise our economic and budgetary policies more, we need European infrastructure projects in the areas of energy, transport and telecommunications. We need a functioning internal market and labour market, and we need the resources required in order to achieve the demanding growth targets set out in the EU 2020 strategy. We need innovative sources of financing if we are to be able to exploit the potential of the SME sector. We need more Community method and less intergovernmentalism. A standstill here is a backward move; it will not preserve the status quo
. The debt crisis in Europe clearly demonstrates that stability and confidence are not achievable without discipline. The proposals made by Commissioner Rehn and by Mr Van Rompuy’s task force are intended to ensure that the Member States act in a disciplined manner. I regret to say that in Luxembourg the other day, the finance ministers cast aside these proposals at the behest of our Franco-German couple – a missed opportunity and a bad day for our citizens, who quite rightly feel betrayed by politics yet again. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if banks have to hold more capital for loans and financial instruments, that increases their ability to bear losses. The most recent proposals from the Basel Committee take this stability-based approach as their basis. Unfortunately, the Basel Committee has not, as yet, satisfactorily addressed the problem of system-relevant banks. I therefore welcome Mr Karas’s call for the requirements for the liquidity standards to be made independent of system-relevance. In other words, appropriately tougher requirements need to apply to banks that, due to their size or interconnectedness with the global financial system, need to be bailed out using taxpayers’ money in crisis situations. We should take a more differentiated approach to the factor of debt leverage. Only when it is empirically proven that this instrument does not lead to arbitrage and distortions of competition and actually counters the overheated granting of loans should we consider permanently incorporating it into the first pillar. There is a need, in any case, for these proposals to be implemented at the global level. We cannot allow the US authorities to have a decisive influence on the Basel proposals only to not then implement them. The G20 summit in Seoul next month will show whether, and to what extent, we can achieve this objective. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 I support the European Union’s initiative to refocus the current remuneration policy on long-term success and more liability for decision makers. However, this must not lead to salary levels being set by politicians. This task should remain the responsibility of the existing structures within the banks, such as the supervisory board and the general meeting. Therefore, the proposed remuneration policy should not replace existing structures, but should supplement them where necessary, ensuring that this helps to improve the quality of financial decision making.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, even the members of the Council realise that the weaknesses of the supervisory system are or were one of the causes of the biggest global financial crisis experienced since the 1930s. They are also aware that national measures alone are not sufficient to deal with the consequences of this crisis, but that we need to look for global, or at least European, solutions. The Council should know that the European Parliament does not want an independent European supervisory structure and systemic risk board to be set up out of dogmatism or stubbornness, but from a deeply-held, cross-party conviction. This is the only way of guaranteeing transparency and protection for investors, based on a uniform regulatory framework and a uniform interpretation and application of this framework. One clear message from the crisis is that we need not less, but greater involvement from Europe in the financial sector; if we do not go forwards, than we will go backwards. Member States should drop the hypocrisy they display when calling for global solutions at G20 meetings and demanding at least European regulations at home, but actually refusing to make any compromise in the trialogues.

 Combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography is vitally important. We must use all our strength to combat the availability of child pornography in communications networks.

 Mr President, Commissioner, rating agencies have played an appalling role in the global financial crisis and in the euro difficulties and are far from deserving of praise. Lack of transparency, conflicts of interest, financing through contracting entities and the publication of ratings at questionable times with a procyclical effect, or shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted, speak for themselves. Rating agencies have been, and continue to be, oblivious to this and do not see these problems. I personally have proposed that the EU should act now and I am pleased that you, too, feel the same. We should establish a European rating agency on the basis of a foundation model. Obviously, this foundation model must be financially independent. It must not be subject to any political interference, either from the European Central Bank, the Commission or any Member States. As an independent foundation, this European agency could become a serious competitor to the oligopoly, or indeed the monopoly, of the three rating agencies we are discussing now. It should be the case that any product offered in Europe and all issuers operating in Europe be required to give two ratings, one of which must come from this European agency. In order to be independent, this foundation must also be financially independent. This means that we need seed-funding that could be provided by the European Investment Bank or perhaps the Commission, and from that point on, this European foundation would have to finance itself. The question of whether such financing should come from contracting authorities or users remains to be clarified. This was raised earlier on by Mr Giegold. We have to reach a decision on this as well. On a general note, we should also consider whether we could restrict our reliance on rating agencies somewhat because it seems to me that we are much too dependent on them at present. Wolf Klinz,

 Mr President, Commissioner, if I take a little more than four minutes, I will make my concluding remarks shorter so that I do not overrun my six minutes. The Prospectus Directive was originally put together in 2003 with the condition that it be reviewed in September 2009. That has been the case. The Prospectus Directive concerns the completion, approval and publication of prospectuses as a prerequisite for the public offering of securities or their emission into a regulated market within the European Union. In general, the current review concerns technical aspects and is intended to eliminate legal uncertainties and unjustifiably onerous requirements. First of all, I would very much like to thank all the Members who have worked together with us on this, as well as all the shadow rapporteurs. We have had very good cooperation, and that includes with the Commission. Without such good cooperation, we would not actually have been able to see this package through to a successful conclusion at first reading in less than ten months. I would now like to present briefly the agreement we have forged – and this includes the tripartite talks – in the form of eight principal points on which we were able to reach agreement. Firstly, one of our objectives was to facilitate access to capital in the market for small and medium-sized enterprises. You know that in the US, there is a much higher percentage of companies, including SMEs, that obtain finance through the market, whereas in Europe, the common practice, especially amongst small businesses, is to obtain finance through bank loans. What we want to do here is open up the opportunity for small businesses to use the market more often than before. We have therefore raised the threshold for exemption from the threshold requirements, which ultimately saddle SMEs with red tape and costs, from EUR 2.5 million to EUR 5 million. My second point concerns investor protection: we want to make sure that, in the course of such facilitation, we can provide sufficient safeguards to the small private investor. This is why we have raised the threshold for exemption from the prospectus requirements for securities denominated in 50 000 to a denomination of 100 000. The third point I would like to raise concerns the issue of how to enable employees to participate in a company’s share capital without that company needing to bear the relatively high costs of launching a prospectus. So, this is about relaxing the prospectus requirement when offering employee participation programmes. Here, we have introduced a proportionality clause in that we have eliminated the unnecessary disclosure requirement. At the same time, however, we have made sure that we have a document detailing basic information so that those employees who benefit from this form of participation can have an idea about what it is they are getting. We have also made sure that companies listed in a third country, that is, a country outside the European Union, be exempted from the prospectus requirement as well – just like European companies – where they offer their employees shares, on the condition that they are able to prove equivalence with the disclosure requirements. The fourth area we discussed and on which we have reached agreement concerns what is commonly known as a ‘prospectus summary’. You can look at it this way: typically, a prospectus is a thick and voluminous document frequently containing several hundred pages. However, there is also the summary which frequently contains another 50, 60 or 70 pages. What we want Parliament to do is to shorten this to what is known as ‘key investor information’ or a document with essential information for investors of the kind provided by traditional investment funds, the UCITS. The Commission did not, in fact, consider this, wanting merely to ensure that key information really is contained in the summary. We have now agreed that, while keeping the summary in its present form, we should also ensure that it does indeed contain key information which will eventually be set out through directive requirements and a level 2 elaboration. This will help shorten the summary considerably, cutting it down from the current 60, 70 or 80 pages to some 20 or 30, perhaps, and help make it an easy read, especially for the small investor. This is important, because we do not want to leave the small investor out of the picture. Fifthly, the issue of liability: when a prospectus is drawn up, who is it that guarantees the accuracy of the contents? In particular, if an intermediary uses this prospectus, if he makes arbitrary changes to the contents, then the liable party is the intermediary. The prospectus requirement expires either when the offer period has expired or when the trading has begun, whichever is the later date. Seventhly, the review clause: as with the previous one, this directive will also be reviewed in five years’ time. My last point is that, in this document, we have the first piece of legislation that has been brought into line with the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon. Last but not least, allow me to point out that the Chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has managed to ensure that Parliament is given sufficient time. We have three months to respond to the Commission and another extension of three months, if necessary. Having said that, we have undertaken, in the event that all other options fail, to grant early approval, that is, to push this piece of legislation through within the shortest time. This satisfies all parties. Wolf Klinz,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, I will make just a few brief comments. First of all, I wish to thank the Commissioner and all the Members for their friendly comments. I am pleased that you share my views. Our cooperation has actually enabled us to balance out various objectives, namely easier access to capital for SMEs and the removal of administrative hurdles, on the one hand, and improvement and securing of investor protection and making progress in terms of creating a genuine European internal market, on the other. I hope that, when this new version of the Prospectus Directive comes up for review in a few years’ time, we will be able to establish a link between the Prospectus Directive and the Market Abuse and Transparency Directives, and that we might perhaps go so far as to choose, in terms of non-equity securities, not the home market, but another Member State of the European Union as a starting point for emission.

Madam President, I am delighted to be able to welcome Estonia as the 17th member of the euro area from 1 January 2011. Our Baltic neighbour, as previous speakers have already said, is actually one of the very few countries that meet the Maastricht criteria, and indeed with enthusiasm! In the current climate, we can be certain that the Commission, Eurostat and the European Central Bank have looked very closely at everything and made no allowances in their evaluation of the figures. The Council will also take its decision without any political benefit. Ten years after its introduction, the euro is, as we all know, currently facing its greatest test and challenge. It is testimony to an enormous degree of commitment, an unbelievable will and an extraordinary amount of effort that Estonia has succeeded in actually meeting the accession criteria under these circumstances. I believe that it is also evidence of the fact that it wants to meet these criteria as laid down in the Treaty. Estonia knows that, as a Member of the European Union, it is also obliged one day to become a member of the euro area and the fact that it wants to do that so quickly makes me, personally, very happy. It shows that there are still countries that have real confidence in this European project. It is fortunate that the Estonian Government did not have to put this accession decision to the people in a referendum, as we are well aware that citizens are to some extent very concerned. If they follow the media, they will view the euro as a soft currency and the euro area as a transfer union, and they are scared that the introduction of the euro will lead to large price increases. Slovenia and Germany are examples of this, and in Germany it is not without reason that the expensive euro has been referred to using the play on words as the ‘Teuro’ (‘der teure Euro
’ – expensive euro). The fact, then, that all of this is just perceived inflation, as the European Central Bank says, is surely something of an understatement. As a member of the euro area, Estonia will also have to deal with the problems facing the single currency and thus also sign up to the euro area rescue plan. What impact that might have on the budget, we do not know. I would like to ask the Commission to provide some clarity in this regard. I hope Estonia continues its excellent development and I hope that its achievements, particularly with regard to budgetary discipline and combating inflation, will prove to be sustainable in future, too.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European governments are being driven by the markets. At last they are reacting, but they are reacting after the event and not in advance. It is scandalous that the governments and the Commission only react when the real weaknesses appear in the markets. They should have identified these weaknesses themselves at an early stage. When the euro was introduced, we knew that we would not have a single monetary and fiscal policy, as is normally the case in individual states. For this reason, we have taken measures to find a substitute for this, but we have not adhered closely to these measures. The rules were broken very quickly and right at the start, even by the larger Member States. We need another effective set of rules with sanction mechanisms, including a name and shame policy, the loss of voting rights and suspension of payments from the European funds until the fines have been paid. Secondly, it has become clear that there are internal tensions within the euro area which are on the verge of putting its strength to the test and which take the form of differences in competitiveness. The Commission must take action in this area. It must investigate the budgets of the individual Member States to determine whether they represent a risk for the euro area. Of course, we know that the right to draw up a budget is a central right of the national parliaments. However, that is no reason for failing to develop a common European approach. This is urgently needed. We need more Europe and not less Europe. This may well be our last chance. If the Commission and the Council do not negotiate with Parliament, I am afraid that the result will be a major disaster at some point in the future. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from my economic experience I know that strategies are only as good as their specific implementation measures and the means of monitoring them. The Commission is yet to provide an answer in this regard. We listen to the goals, with which we can thoroughly identify, we hear the lofty intentions, but we hear next to nothing about how these goals are to be achieved in concrete terms. I had actually assumed that the financial and economic crisis – the largest we have experienced since the Second World War and which has now deepened on account of the additional problem of the national debt crisis – would have been at the top of the Commission’s list of considerations. In my opinion, that should have been the logical starting point, as both crises have changed the situation significantly. If we do not just stop at lofty intentions but actually want to achieve something in the next ten years then we will have to address a number of points in very concrete terms: Firstly, we need to review our finances – not only in the EU, but in each Member State, according to uniform criteria – so that we know where we really stand, what our financial leeway is and what we can actually afford to do. Secondly, we need to develop a crisis resolution mechanism to prevent us being thrown out of kilter again in the future should there be further storms on the markets. Thirdly, we need to complete the internal market in areas where it is not yet complete – I am expecting a great deal from Mr Monti’s report – including for services. Fourthly, we need to convincingly set out how we are to supplement the common monetary policy with a common, closely interlinked economic and finance policy and even a fiscal policy. Fifthly, we need to set out very specifically how we can replace the divergence that we have observed between the Member States with increasing convergence by concentrating on economic projects that are truly European in nature. There are very many of these: energy policy, energy interconnections, high-speed rail and road networks, navigation systems and many similar projects. Wolf Klinz,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the partnership between the EU and Canada works very well, not only in the area of the economy, but also on questions of foreign policy, such as Iran, Afghanistan, Haiti and other similar cases. Despite this, we are faced with a number of serious challenges. I am sure that we can overcome them, because we have such a close friendship and partnership. I am thinking about five points in particular. Firstly, we must do the job of regulating the financial sector properly. A great deal was promised by the G20 and I believe that it is important for it to be clearly shown at the G20 summit in Toronto, which is hosted by Canada, that the G20 countries are taking concrete measures and not just making promises. My second point has already been mentioned. We have very similar objectives with regard to climate policy. We in Europe can definitely learn from Canada about carbon capture and storage projects and other developments in this sector. We hope to be able to agree on joint standards for reductions. My third point concerns the need for a new trade agreement and I believe that our objectives are very similar in this area as well. I would like to highlight two points where action is needed and where we intend to move closer together, but still remain some distance apart. One of these concerns visa-free travel, which you, Baroness Ashton, have already referred to. I hope that it will be possible to treat ethnic minorities from EU Member States in the same way as all other EU citizens. My last point relates to the passenger data agreement which expired in the autumn of last year. It is de facto still in force, but no longer has a basis in law. We need a new legal basis, so that we can produce a new agreement. This new legal basis must ensure that civil rights are respected. Modern technological opportunities for networking should not be used to make all the information on names, dates of birth, flight details, credit cards, and so on, readily available in such a way that this information can be misused. We hope that we can work together to create a legal basis which corresponds to our European concept of civil rights. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, VAT fraud is not a mere peccadillo. It is a criminal act and a problem which either escalates or diminishes over time. According to the latest estimates, citizens, and thereby taxpayers, lose up to EUR 100 billion every year, perhaps even more. At a time of accelerating public debt and crisis, citizens have no sympathy for the fact that the European Union has so far not been able to tackle this problem successfully. This is why I welcome a fresh attempt to introduce the reverse charge procedure, on which we will be taking a vote the day after tomorrow. What we are trying to do with the reverse charge procedure is effectively eliminate the problem of VAT evasion or at least reduce it. We have to wait and see, however, whether or not this procedure will generate the desired increase in VAT receipts and deter new cases of fraud. However, it is certainly worth the attempt. We will monitor closely the results of the procedure, the application of which is currently limited to 2014, and carry out a critical assessment. However, I would have liked an amendment to one specific point: I am in favour of enterprises which duly discharge their duty of care in the context of a review of their VAT registration numbers, being exempted from any liability, even if the recipient commits fraud. I explicitly regret that my amendment to that effect did not command a majority in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Wolf Klinz  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the fast and decisive reaction of the G20 to the global financial crisis. A great deal has happened. The fire appears to have been put out, but the foundations of our financial system are still shaky. The citizens are unsettled. Profits are being ploughed back for the benefit of shareholders and losses are being socialised, that is how the citizens see it. In the meantime, it is back to business as usual for more and more market players, who are making big moves, rather than focusing on what they should really be doing as service providers, namely supporting the real economy. Financial ethics and responsibility appear, as ever, to be foreign words to many of them. I am expecting specific – and fast – measures from the G20. I hope that the EU Member States will all pull together. In addition to new supervisory structures, we also need bigger equity bases, which increase in line with the risk, long-term – not short-term – incentive systems, a coordinated exit strategy from State aid, contained protectionism, congruent regulation, rather than regulation arbitrage, an end to pro-cyclicity and a solution to the ‘too big to fail’ problem and, above all, we must abide by the tried and tested social market economy.Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the democratic structure of the European Union is the subject of much discussion at the moment. The Commission’s report on monitoring the application of EU law makes it clear that this is a complex topic and also involves the Member States. Citizens have a right not only to European legislation being drawn up in accordance with democratic principles, but also to European laws being transposed so they – the citizens – as well as businesses can benefit from them. Member States are also under a democratic obligation in this respect. They are obliged to transpose the legislation. If they fail to fulfil this obligation, they are infringing the European legal order and therefore the rule of law. Observing this rule of law is, however, a necessary condition for the legitimacy of any form of democratic governance. It is a guarantee for citizens that they will be able to benefit from the rights provided for in law. The Commission’s reports show year on year that many Member States frequently flout the transposition deadlines for Directives. As guardian of the Treaties, the Commission is therefore forced to institute costly infringement proceedings, which are embarrassing for the Member States. Here the Commission must keep a particularly close eye on those Member States with very poor transposition records. As Parliament we are also required to do this. Our citizens are turning to us with increasing frequency with petitions and in this way drawing our attention to transposition infringements by Member States. We must therefore make sure that communication between Parliament and the Commission is improved, so that infringements can be identified and remedied as early as possible. We owe it to our citizens!

Mr President, I do not wish to advance any political arguments against the ACAA Protocol, such as the idea that we are rewarding Israel for its human rights violations and sending out the wrong signal. Instead, I shall present some legal arguments. The Protocol states that the territorial competence of the Israeli Responsible Authority for pharmaceuticals, in this instance the Ministry of Health, is to be defined by Israel – in accordance with its own national law, of course. However, under Israel’s national law, the settlements in the West Bank, which are illegal under international law, and the illegally annexed areas of East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights are deemed to be Israeli territory. Due to the absence of any provision to the contrary in the Protocol, the worry is that Israel will extend the jurisdiction of the Responsible Authority to the Occupied Territories as well. When implementing the Protocol, the EU would thus be forced to recognise, for the first time, Israel’s claims to sovereignty over parts of the Occupied Territories. I therefore urge the Members of this House to vote against the ACAA Protocol today. As democratically elected Members of this House, we have an obligation to respect and uphold EU and international law as part of our set of values.  The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the EU because we apply rule-of-law and democratic principles – not only in relation to the EU itself. How can we ... this important ...

Madam President, legal, cross-border online access to orphan works is fundamental to the fostering of our diverse cultural treasures in Europe. The directive to be adopted will finally enable public institutions in Europe – libraries, museums, archives and the like – to dig out orphan works from their cellars, digitise them and thus make them available to the general public. After long and also difficult discussions in Parliament and with the Council, we have found a solution that serves both the individual rights holders’ interest in the reasonable protection of their works and the public interest in the distribution of such works. We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, in particular, insisted that there must be a truly thorough and effective search for the rights holder whose rights are to be protected before a work is published. If the rights holder makes himself/herself known at a later date, he/she should be due at least reasonable compensation. It is also important that we have put a stop to purely commercial use of such works. On the other hand, public institutions, especially in times of tight purse strings, depend on private bodies to assist them with the digitisation. Public-private partnerships are exactly the right approach to take in order to make as many works as possible accessible to the public. It is high time that the European Parliament finally made hitherto unused cultural heritage available to the public. I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, as these negotiations were truly difficult and we had proposed various different ways forward at the outset. I do not share the view of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance that there is, to all intents and purposes, no value in this directive. I take the view that, if that were the case, the review clause makes it possible to overhaul the directive after two years. I am, however, quite sure that digitisation can get under way straight away now, and also that the necessary funds for that are available. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, only simple and comprehensible law is good law. We issue European legislation in the public interest and for the benefit of the citizens. It is therefore essential that European law should be simple, easy-to-understand and accessible to everyone. As European legislators, we need to constantly monitor and optimise our work. That is what our citizens expect of us. It is important that we should have an ever more intensive exchange with the national parliaments in order to give shape to laws and act together as guardians of the principle of subsidiarity. In that way, we can ensure, together, that we really do only legislate at European level what is too much to deal with at national level. Good law making also includes not putting in place regulations that could be at least as well dealt with at national level. Particularly in these difficult times for the European Union, it is absolutely critical that European legislation should be accepted by everyone, including by our national elected representatives. The early warning mechanism established in the Treaty of Lisbon, which many people have labelled a paper tiger, showed its potential power for the first time yesterday. After reprimands about subsidiarity from 18 national parliaments, the Commission decided to withdraw its proposed regulation on collective striking law. There is cause to criticise the fact that there has still been no updating of the existing interinstitutional agreement on better legislation from 2003 to fit in with the Treaty of Lisbon. The Treaty of Lisbon brought in changes in respect of secondary legislation. Given the immense practical importance of such legislation, the agreement needs to be updated. Alexandra Thein,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are about to vote on two technical reports on the European Court of Justice. I would like to make the following non-partisan comments: the European Parliament expressly regrets the fact that the increase in the number of judges at the European Court of Justice, the necessity of which has also been accepted by the Council, has failed simply because the Member States were unable to agree on the Member States from which the extra judges were to be drawn. This is despite the fact that there were several possible solutions on the table. Thus, in procedural terms, we have an absolutely exceptional case here that is almost without precedent in Parliament, as we are about to vote on the proposed regulation and the first part today in order to relieve the Court of Justice of at least some of its workload, while leaving the second part hanging; it will hopefully be possible to bring this more important part to a successful conclusion by summer 2013. On behalf of our citizens and businesses, I once again call on the Member States not to play their usual power games with the third estate and to afford it the respect it deserves. Alexandra Thein,  
rapporteur

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg is overstretched. Tomorrow’s decision may seem technical and non-political at first glance, relating to the internal reorganisation of the three courts that comprise the Court of Justice of the European Union; however there is more to it than that. The European Union has been, and continues to be, invested with more and more powers and responsibilities, most recently through the Treaty of Lisbon. Accordingly, the responsibilities of the Court of Justice of the European Union have also gradually expanded. Thus, the excessive workload cannot be attributed solely to the increasing number of cases – in common with many Member States – quite apart from the accession of 12 new Member States. In fact, the number of cases concluded has lagged behind the number of newly received cases for many years. In this context, it becomes clear that the reform of the internal organisation of the Court of Justice will have a major impact on the functioning or the European Union as a whole and, in the final analysis, on the lives of Europe’s citizens. For this reason it was important for me that all of the participating legislative bodies – including the Court of Justice, which we included in the trilogue negotiations – should cooperate from the start and find practical compromises. We have only partly succeeded in doing this. Let me begin with the part for which we have actually found reasonable compromises, which make the work of the Court more efficient and which will reduce the length of court proceedings. The key points are as follows: the office of Vice-President is to be established at the suggestion of the Court itself. In future, the Vice-President will relieve the President of some of the burden involved in representing and administering the Court and will attend all Grand Chamber sessions. In addition, personnel structures are to be changed in the Chambers and in the Grand Chamber, which is to consist of 15 judges, so that the Presidents of the Chambers with five judges will also have their workload reduced and it will be possible to share the workload of all judges more evenly. The proposals in relation to the Civil Service Tribunal are also easy to explain. This Tribunal has always had seven judges. The small number of judges means that, in the event that a judge is absent, for example, due to lengthy illness, the Tribunal as a whole is seriously impaired in its judicial functions. In order to prevent this, an option is to be established whereby judges can be appointed to this technical tribunal on an interim basis. The judges in question are former members of the Court of Justice and they are to be appointed from a list in a particular order, so as to satisfy the requirements in relation to legally eligible judges. These judges can then replace individual judges should they be unable to fulfil their duties. So much for the positive and rational compromises which we have hammered out together and for which I wish to thank all those involved. As was stated at the outset, however, we have not been able to bring all the necessary proposals to a conclusion. I wish to emphasise clearly that the reason for this lies not with the European Parliament, but with the Council and the national vanity of the individual Member States. It was suggested that the number of judges in the Court of First Instance should be increased by 12, rising from 27 to 39 judges. This is the right decision in view of the increasing workload of the judges, although the precise number of additional judges required might be open to debate. Parliament is certainly convinced that increasing the number of judges will, in the final analysis, contribute to better jurisprudence for individual citizens and businesses alike. From which the Member States the additional judges are drawn should not really matter and appointments should be made solely on the basis of qualifications. After all, the principle of impartiality among judges also applies in the European Union. This, however, is something for the future. We have proposed a fair system for the appointment of judges, with numerous suggestions for how they could be selected. The Member States however, were unwilling and unable to agree to any of these solutions in the Council, which is why we shall not have an agreement to increase the number of judges for the foreseeable future. The motives behind this are purely national in character and cannot be justified in objective terms. I find this extremely unsatisfactory. In the future too it will be necessary to ensure that European jurisprudence follows a reasonable timescale. Our citizens and businesses are entitled to that. Excessively long cases, sometimes lasting over five-and-a-half years, represent a violation of our Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. That is why it is vital that, in view of the present, well-balanced proposals in relation to the selection of additional judges, Member States should finally consider their position and avoid any loss of confidence in the European legal system. Alexandra Thein,

Mr President, I would like to thank all my colleagues and I am particularly pleased that we have cross-group agreement that the number of judges must be increased, as Ms Regner has also indicated how many there will eventually be. This still has to be discussed. The third estate is often neglected because it is unable to make its voice sufficiently heard in politics. It is reticent by nature. It is essentially important, however. Mr Häfner has underlined its importance for the public at large, while Mr Karim has explained its significance for the business community. I hope that the friendship group established by the Council will not only deal with further internal reforms of the Court of Justice of the European Union, particularly because it has already achieved a major reform that has also contributed to a drop in case numbers and concluded cases. It is extremely important that the principle of the separation of powers should be followed here, and the system as a whole must not be overburdened. The work on the two dossiers has shown that some questions remain outstanding and that we must take a closer look at the Court of Justice in our Committee on Legal Affairs when it comes to the issue of divergent opinions, even though these are not required by the Court, or the establishment of special chambers and technical tribunals. A number of questions have arisen during the negotiations and need to be clarified. We were under considerable time pressure because 14 new judges must be appointed in October and I hope that we will have concluded the negotiations on the additional new judges to be appointed before the next appointment of 13 new judges in September 2013. Mr President, as we have saved some time because a number of colleagues have failed to attend, please permit me to present once again the various options for appointing the additional judges. We tabled a cross-group resolution that was never adopted, despite unanimous support, because Parliament changed its Rules of Procedure in the interim. The following proposals are on the table: Firstly, the selection takes place in strict rotation and involves all 27 Member States. The second option: six judges are drawn from the most populous Member States, while the remaining six are drawn from the other 21 Member States in strict rotation. Alternatively: six judges are drawn from the most populous Member States, while the remaining six are drawn from the medium-sized Member States in strict rotation. Yet another option: six judges are drawn from the most populous Member States, while the remaining six are selected using the same system as that used to appoint advocates-general. Another possible interim solution would be to appoint temporary judges for approximately five or six years, as suggested by the Danish Presidency of the Council. Thus, there are plenty of solutions available, but the Council needs to agree. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 I was unable to vote in favour of the Ferreira report because of Amendments 68, 27 and 67. In its proposal to the German Government in autumn 2011, the German Council of Economic Experts demanded clear and strict rules on participation in a debt redemption fund (Amendment 67). Whatever one’s general position on such a debt redemption fund, which was not even foreseen in the Commission proposal, these participation criteria have been greatly watered down in the report that has now been adopted. Moreover, linking the introduction of a debt redemption fund with a road map for eurobonds or stability bonds and the treatment of economic imbalances is unfair and inappropriate.

 Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, as a liberal, I, too, welcome the hearing instigated by the Commission on the future of European company law. This is a key element of a functioning internal market. There are particular problems in respect of the mobility of our enterprises – in other words, the outstanding 14th company law directive on the cross-border transfer of company seats without having to establish a new company. The Commission has been slow in presenting draft legislation because the Member States are unable to agree on a common line, and negotiations are therefore likely to be difficult. Similarly, it is scarcely possible for shareholder rights to be exercised across borders and we are still awaiting harmonised framework conditions in this area. There are also problems with the European private company, where the Member States are again blocking progress, being unable to agree on, among other things, the necessity of cross-border aspects, the level of capital stock and worker codetermination. My final point is that in the current proposed directive on accounting, the Commission has, in my view, made a technical legal error. In principle, the idea of making payment flows from the commodities industry in developing countries transparent is to be welcomed. In terms of legal technicalities, however, this topic does not belong there. If we want to help fight corruption, EU accounting law is not the right place to do it. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, it was only on 8 June that you condemned settlement building in the occupied territories. Today, you referred for the umpteenth time to the fact that settlement building is illegal under the terms of international law. Furthermore, on 14 May, the Council reaffirmed in its conclusions on the peace process the fact that we must maintain the viability of a two-state solution. Therefore, it is incomprehensible that we in the European Parliament are now being asked to vote in favour of the additional protocol to the association agreement with Israel on conformity assessment and acceptance of industrial products (ACAA). I think it is particularly important to make the following point. We have not yet had a clear explanation of the precise way in which products manufactured in the settlements are handled in the agreement between the EU and Israel. These products are still finding their way onto the EU market. Before we conclude any further trade agreements with Israel, we need to resolve this problem. We must investigate whether there are any effective mechanisms for monitoring this which can be introduced and implemented. In the meantime, Israel continues to disregard its obligations under international law. More settlements are being built, enlarged and even relocated as Israel sees fit, while the EU stands helplessly by. A two-state solution is quite literally being buried under the settlements.

 I spoke against the report because two amendments tabled by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe did not receive a majority in plenary.

 Mr President, Mr Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome this discussion about the European corporate governance framework. Normally in the Committee on Legal Affairs, when it comes to own-initiative reports, in other words, non-legislative proposals, we try to bring all the political groups on board by means of compromises. On this occasion we did not succeed and that is a good thing, because in the case of corporate governance there are fundamental differences in the political perspectives of the Social Democrats and the Greens on the one hand and the Liberals, the Christian Democrats and the Conservatives on the other. For example, we believe that the comply-or-explain system is a useful tool in corporate governance. Any deviation from the code of conduct should be justified in an appropriate way and the alternative corporate governance measure that is taken should be described and explained. Calling for binding rules in this area, as the Social Democrats do in their alternative motion for a resolution, involves intervening to an excessive extent in companies’ freedom to do business and this is unacceptable, particularly when it is not dependent on the size of the company. Listed companies, some of which are small organisations, must not be lumped together with non-listed companies and small and medium-sized enterprises, especially given the additional call for sanctions to be imposed whenever there is a well-justified deviation from the code of conduct. This is pure socialism. We cannot simply force companies to accept the German or Austrian codetermination model in the light of the different corporate cultures in other Member States, even if this would perhaps prevent a few unnecessary strikes of the kind that often take place in southern Europe. I would now like to discuss the quotas for women. We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have tabled a far-reaching amendment concerning the representation of women on boards. We are not fully in agreement within our group and we have heard the same thing from speakers from other groups. Nevertheless, I hope that this issue will receive broad support. In future, I would like to see the Commission giving more consideration to the dual structure that we have in Europe and not focusing solely on the system with a single board. Alexandra Thein,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as a member of both the Palestine and Israel delegations, I welcome the fact that Parliament has decided to speak out on these unacceptable Israeli raids on two television stations in Ramallah. I would remind you that Ramallah is located in Zone A of the West Bank, in other words in the small area that the Palestinians are permitted to administer for themselves. This means that there is no legal basis in any agreement for such action by the Israeli authorities, particularly since it was unannounced. In addition to the fact that this action ran contrary to the right of free expression and freedom of information, what we have here is the illegal destruction of Palestinian property by the Israeli occupying powers, something that is stereotypically defended by Israel as necessary on security grounds, which does not make it any less illegal under international law: we witness the destruction of drinking fountains and energy sources, the almost weekly destruction of agricultural land and olive trees, as well as the continuous demolition of hundreds of Palestinian homes, including in Jerusalem itself. What is particularly galling is that the Israeli authorities do not even baulk at the destruction of infrastructural projects financed by the EU or its Member States. According to a recent report in Der Spiegel
 and elsewhere, solar energy systems funded by German taxes are once again being torn down. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Madam President, I welcome the fact that Parliament has taken up the issue of human rights violations in Bahrain. According to the list kept by the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, the number of fatalities since 14 February 2011 is much higher than indicated in the resolution. The number quoted there is 63. The debate is made all the more important by the fact that a large number of Member States were very quiet and indecisive about the events in Bahrain, when they actually should have made their voices heard. If one compares the way the Member States reacted to the very first killings in Syria, then it is apparent that the response was quite different. In the final analysis, this is what leads me to hope that the standards applied in the European Parliament at least will be the same, whatever country is under consideration. We cannot use a different yardstick here simply because Bahrain is the location of a US naval base rather than a Russian one, because it receives supplies of US weapons rather than Russian ones and because our trade relations with the country are better than with Syria. The same standards need to apply in Bahrain and in all the countries of the Arab world when it comes to compliance with human rights. Alexandra Thein,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are in the process of re-regulating succession and family law in respect of which law is to be applied, which courts have competence and the recognition and enforcement of judgments from other countries. We have done so already in respect of the arrangement of child support and divorce law. Tomorrow we will be voting on the law of succession, and marital property law will follow. As Mr Lehne has already said, in the plenary today we are not discussing any old abstract political issues. Instead, we are helping our citizens in a quite tangible way to solve what are currently in some ways irresolvable problems. In the worst case scenario it can happen in a cross-border succession case that the heirs appeal to the highest instance of the courts in different Member States, spend a great deal of time and money and that there are then two contradicting decisions because each of the courts applies the law in that Member State. The aim is for such situations to be avoided in future. We are on the verge of a change of system when it comes to succession law. In future, the entire succession will be in the competence of the courts of the Member State in the territory of which the bequeather was habitually resident at the time of their death. This is because we are working on the basis that people have a stronger relationship with the country in which they reside. However, someone who, by way of example, as a German permanently resident in Strasbourg, regards him- or herself as having a closer connection with Germany, can choose to have German law apply to their succession. In order to avoid a French court having to apply complicated German succession law, there is, in such circumstances, also a provision for the succession to be brought before a German probate court. Meanwhile, those who like to winter in Mallorca need have no fear either, as, wherever you go on holiday, it does not constitute habitual residence in the country in which you holiday. Furthermore, this regulation will not affect inheritance tax. Denmark, the United Kingdom and Ireland, as we have heard, will not initially be involved as a result of their opt-outs. That is a shame, as so many Britons, in particular, have holiday homes in southern Europe and these would then also be subject to the common law and not, as up to now, to the law of the Member State in which the land is located. A major information campaign will be necessary. I would also like to thank Mr Lechner once again for his comprehensive work and for the solution that he reached. His work shows how important it is that this Parliament should contain not only career politicians but also professionals from other walks of life. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, I welcome the fact that trading relations are to be established with a view to creating a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area in response to the Arab Spring, and that the over 100 bilateral protocols are to be brought together in a single regional agreement. I would, however, like to draw attention to one critical point, namely, products that purportedly originate from Israel. There have been some serious flaws in the implementation of the association agreement between the EU and Israel concluded in 1995. We in this House are all aware of this. I recently drew attention to precisely this flaw in a written question to the Commission. We know from several sources, including our customs authorities, that Israeli settlers have intentionally falsely labelled goods produced in the occupied Palestinian territories, including fruit and vegetables, also issuing these goods with falsified certificates, declaring the country of origin of these products to be Israel. This was in order for this produce to gain access to the EU’s single market at preferential conditions, including lower tax rates. We cannot have a situation whereby this new agreement will also be misused in further extending this illegal practice. Mr Barnier, I believe it is extremely important that the aforementioned list of the designations of origin of the various Palestinian villages and towns should be published. Our delegation has long been of the view that this list should not be kept secret, but should be published in the interests of greater transparency and clarity and to help restrict abuses.

– The FDP Delegation abstained in today’s vote on the motion for a resolution on the feasibility of introducing stability bonds. We believe that the introduction of Eurobonds would set the wrong incentives. Since the introduction of the euro, low interest rates have led to a substantial increase in debt levels in many euro area countries. Eurobonds would take the pressure off highly indebted euro area Member States to consolidate their budgets and introduce much needed structural reforms. Therefore, we believe that Eurobonds would aggravate, rather than alleviate the current crisis. However, we did not vote against the resolution as many of our concerns have been taken on board by the rapporteur. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

Mr President, Commissioner, in 2009 the European Parliament resolved to set up a European Observatory on Counterfeiting and Piracy in order to capture reliable objective data on the actual number of counterfeit and imitation products, rather than being solely reliant on the data made available by producers and the trade. The Observatory, which in the end only commenced operations in 2010, was a complete success. It has become a centre of excellence, collecting information and data on all the counterfeit products – such as drugs, toys and car parts – that threaten the lives and health of our citizens. This Observatory, which was co-managed by the Commission – the bottom line is that it was actually only co-managed – now needs to be restructured, and given additional human and other resources to deal with the increase in its tasks. To bring this about, we have decided – for reasons of costs and efficiency – not to establish a new agency, but to utilise an existing agency and, in effect, to transfer the Observatory’s tasks to the existing agency, the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market in Alicante. This agency in fact employs 650 people, and they are already responsible for the registration of Community trade marks and designs. May I therefore explicitly repeat to the Member from the United Kingdom – who has, unfortunately, already left – that this Office is therefore able to work on a cost-neutral basis, because it finances itself from the fees received for the said trade marks; in other words, we are merely imposing additional tasks on an existing agency and are benefiting from the agreement on fees. I would also like to repeat that analysis of the problem of data theft is mentioned only in the recitals, and that it is stated there that the Observatory will primarily deal with counterfeiting and product piracy.

 The obvious answer to that question is yes. I think that was the point of the question. I find it genuinely regrettable that comments are made here without any detailed knowledge of the facts. I, too, come from a liberal party that is extremely concerned about costs and efficiency, and naturally I hope that the people working there are performing their duties properly. Above all, however, I hope that this agency will continue to work on a cost-neutral basis by continuing to finance itself from fees and requiring no subsidies of any kind. Alexandra Thein,

Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, the interconnection of companies and commercial registers is a further milestone along the way to creating a European area of law. I am pleased that this matter, which is so important for our small and medium-sized enterprises in particular, and which I advocated and promised to work for during my electoral campaign, has now – following trialogue negotiations – been successfully incorporated into a directive. There are two aspects to this. Firstly, it gives citizens and companies easier cross-border access to commercial registers. Until now, if you wanted to access, say, a Greek commercial register, you had to instruct a Greek lawyer – who of course also had to speak your language, or at least a language that you had in common. The end result was extra costs and wasted time. This should now be able to take place via a platform. What is special about this platform is that I can make an enquiry in my own language and get an answer in my own language. Secondly, the commercial registers will now cooperate in a more institutionalised way, rather than on a voluntary basis as they have until now. Moreover, I regret to say that in the past one could not always rely on the entries in commercial registers of other Member States, particularly where the registration of branches in other Member States was concerned. We have now incorporated a requirement stating that, in future, entries must be made without delay or at latest within 21 days – provided, of course, that the conditions are met. Every company and every branch is to be given an identifier. The existing national commercial registers are not just kept only in their national language, but they also differ in many respects de facto
 and de jure
; for example, as regards their legal significance and the reliability of the data recorded. The directive aims only to interconnect the national registers in technical terms, not to harmonise the national systems. Nonetheless, for practical business life it is an extremely helpful measure that will encourage further integration of the internal market and will improve legal clarity and legal certainty for companies and citizens. I hope that the considerable technical work and software work that will be required for this can be achieved on time, by the year 2014. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

I abstained from voting on paragraph 6 of the motion for a resolution on the meeting of the European Council of 30 January 2012, calling for a road map for the introduction of stability bonds. I believe that such a road map would be wrong at present because it would simply ‘reward’ the excessive indebtedness of some Member States and lead to the morally unjustifiable joint and several liability of other Member States. Naturally, in the distant future, the euro area is interested in a joint liquid bond market as an alternative to the market for US dollar bonds, making the euro an internationally secure currency and replacing the dollar in this respect. The right conditions for such a move are still very far off, because, at present, some southern European Member States have no understanding of reasonable budgetary, fiscal and stability policies.

Madam President, securing better access to justice is one of the main objectives of the European Union’s policy of creating an area of freedom, security and justice. In a modern, globalised and digital economy, the confidence of the citizens in justice is a crucial factor. The Mediation Directive represents a milestone in this connection. Now, every judge in the EU has the opportunity to ensure, in every phase of the process, that two parties to a dispute voluntarily and on their own responsibility strive, with the assistance of a mediator, to settle their differences amicably. The directive ensures that utilisation of the mediation process will prevent the expiry of limitation and prescription periods. Moreover, the agreements reached as a result of limitation and prescription could be given the status of enforceable official documents. Also important are sound training of the mediators in the field of quality assurance and the strengthening of citizens’ trust in this system. Most Member States announced transposition after the deadline for transposition had already passed. However, it is not only the fact that transposition takes place that is important – how transposition is effected is the most important thing. To that end, specialists and legal practitioners must be consulted in order to ensure the greatest possible improvement of the directive. Alexandra Thein,

 Madam President, Mr Duff, first and foremost, on behalf of our group I would like to thank you most sincerely for the many years of work that you have put into this project and for the energy and enthusiasm with which you are trying to persuade us to support it. We all know that we will have to get to this stage at some point. You, yourself, asked earlier on whether now is the right time. I think that, first of all, we really must adopt a report in September. We all know that it will still probably take years, perhaps even decades, until this is actually implemented. However, if we do not start now, we might not even succeed in putting it in place in the next few decades, either. Personally, I would like to still be around to see us become a real Parliament with a single transnational list, because even the German Federal Constitutional Court has called for this and observed that we will only have true legitimacy if we are able to be elected by any citizen of the Union. However, in order to still reach a compromise, I would recommend that – in order to accommodate the small States – we extend the group of people who are allowed to stand as candidates on the transnational list slightly, perhaps to 10%. Our group Chair, Mr Verhofstadt, mentioned this somewhat light-heartedly in his speech yesterday. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 The German Free Democratic Party delegation in the European Parliament assumes that the inclusion of Romania and Bulgaria in the Schengen area will further improve freedom of movement within the EU. Now that both Member States have achieved positive evaluation results in all areas of the Schengen review, there should be no more obstacles to delay inclusion further. There is no denying that technically securing borders will not automatically make them secure as long as problems persist in combating corruption in the justice and policing system. However, this challenge also concerns Member States already in the Schengen area. For this reason, the German Free Democratic Party delegation believes that criteria such as the fight against corruption must receive greater attention when evaluating the Schengen mechanism, and any misdemeanours must be punished appropriately.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it will be an important step in the right direction when we vote on the transparency register tomorrow, but no doubt this will not be the last word on the matter. Firstly, I am pleased that we have chosen a new name for the lobby register of the European Parliament, which dates back to 1996 and which is now to be known as the transparency register. I find it regrettable to see who will be required to register in order to obtain a one-year building pass – the list includes public institutions and bodies. As I have stated before, I can understand why it is necessary for a law society to register, but I find it harder to understand why public bodies which have never been active on a party-political level, and never will be, are also required to register. In the final analysis, irrespective of all the transparency achieved, it all comes down to the moral compass of each Member of this House, as this dictates what he thinks is right, whom he meets and whom he decides not to meet, whom he listens to and whom he decides not to listen to. After all, people also contact us using many other different communication channels. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, very few of our citizens are aware of the existence of European parties and foundations. Until now these have simply been umbrella organisations for their national member parties, established according to national laws, mainly Belgian laws in this case. What is it that these European parties do? They discuss European issues, hold party conferences and play an indispensable role in reforming the European Parliament’s electoral system. According to the Treaty of Lisbon, they are required to help establish European democracy – a political forum at European level. The own-initiative report to be voted on tomorrow calls on the Commission to reform the legal basis for these European parties. In future, these parties will be based on a European legal statute and will have a European legal personality. As liberals, we have campaigned to ensure that a clear distinction is made between recognition as a European party and an entitlement to funding, as there was a certain greed in evidence. It is also important that European parties should follow democratic principles in their internal workings, something that cannot be taken for granted. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 In the vote on the Lange report, I am abstaining on paragraph 31 because of the ambiguous wording of the vote, which refers to Eurobonds as well as project bonds. However, taking it as a whole, I am voting for the report, as I have nothing against project bonds in themselves. Project bonds serve as finance for extensive innovation, infrastructure and reindustrialisation projects. This is not a question of instruments for the communitarisation of debts, as would be the case with Eurobonds. Alexandra Thein,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we will pass our third resolution against the criminalisation of homosexuality in Uganda. Within a short space of time gay people have been declared fair game in Uganda. Even children or minors are affected. This is all due to the irresponsible actions of a US-based Christian sect and the call by local newspaper Rolling Stone for a hundred people whom it named as being gay to be hanged. Now David Kato – one such person publicly named as being gay – has been hammered to a pulp on a public street; this is, in fact, what we were hoping to prevent with our last resolution. We call on Uganda firstly to hold an independent investigation into the murder of David Kato and not to arrest just anybody for the crime. Further, we call on Uganda to prosecute those who call for the public murder of gay people. We also call on Uganda to revise its legislation. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I come from Berlin, and the whole world rejoiced with us Berliners when the border in our city fell and the borders opened everywhere in Eastern Europe. Now, in the case of Egypt, we reacted too late, too cautiously and, above all, too unemotionally. Where was our joy? Every other word from us was simply about ‘maintaining stability’. However, freedom is the most important thing for every person in the world. We Germans in particular know what we are talking about. What we had in Egypt was not stability; it was oppression. Freedom and stability can go hand in hand any time. Therefore, we should not dictate to the Egyptians who they should elect. Provided the elections proceed in a fair and democratic way, we will have to recognise the result and must not be so arrogant – as we were at the time in Palestine or even in Algeria – as to decide whether or not we will recognise those who are elected. We must recognise the choice that is made. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 In overall terms, the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament supports the waste disposal directive. However, the subject of photovoltaic modules remains a problem. There is no understandable reason for excluding the solar industry from the regulations. We have a wide range of legislation governing waste streams. Therefore, it is not clear why a complete industry, which is expected to produce significant waste streams, is being excluded, particularly as the solar industry is likely to be responsible for a large amount of waste in the near future, when the first solar cells installed on large numbers on European roofs have to be replaced. Solar cells may contain toxic substances which can be reused. For this reason, I have abstained from voting on the report. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, today we are discussing a motion for a resolution on the situation of Christians throughout the world in relation to freedom of religion. The European Parliament supports fundamental freedoms and human rights all over the world. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is one of the driving forces behind this support and this distinguishes us from the conservatives who are focusing specifically on the situation of Christians. In general terms, this is not just about the position of Christians. From a liberal perspective, this concerns freedom of religion as a whole. By this I mean all the religions throughout our entire world. It is about protection for religious minorities and the obligation of every state to protect to the best of its ability the members of those religious minorities which are under threat. We also have problems in Europe. I come from Berlin, and there alone, we have had six arson attacks against mosques within the space of six months, fortunately not resulting in any deaths, following the uproar sparked by a social-democratic former central banker. However, the German state is attempting to provide the best possible protection for religious buildings. In the same way, Egypt is also increasing the measures it is taking following the second major terrorist attack against Christians. Of course, we cannot have a policeman standing in front of every church, mosque or synagogue. I very much regret the fact that in many countries, including my own, Jewish buildings have come to look like high-security institutions. For this reason, it is important that we as politicians take responsibility for the attitude to religious minorities in our countries and that we promote an open, friendly approach to all religions.

 Madam President, Commissioner, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union ban discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union and Article 19 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union oblige the bodies of the EU and all the Member States to fight discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. Lithuania is a Member State of the EU and has thus undertaken to share these common values of the 500 million citizens of the Union. Firstly, I welcome the fact that following our first resolution in 2009, the planned act entered into force in Lithuania in a less severe form and that we have not yet become aware of any instance of this law having been applied, and that its application in respect of the ban on the Christopher Street Day Parade failed and the parade took place. I am all the more astonished, therefore, that new legislative measures are now being proposed under which speaking publicly about or providing information on homosexual relations could effectively result in fines of up to EUR 2 900 and there will no longer be equal opportunities for homosexual people – but at least for women. I therefore welcome the Commission’s strategy to combat homophobia and would particularly like to thank Commissioner Reding for emphasising the importance of protecting these fundamental rights through her attendance here in plenary when the time is nearly midnight.

 Mr President, only recently, we held an international workshop in the large plenary chamber of our Parliamentary building in Brussels on Parental Responsibility and the Protection of Children, which I had the honour of leading. In Europe, there are more and more vulnerable and abandoned children who should not be living permanently in orphanages. It is therefore our duty as legislators to strengthen the right to international adoption within the EU in order to help these children. Article 24 of our Charter of Fundamental Rights also demands this when it states: ‘Children shall have the right to such protection and care as is necessary for their wellbeing’. Although we have the Hague Adoption Convention and a Council of Europe convention, these are not enough. In practice, major legal problems still arise in connection with international adoptions. In these cases, only international regulations which eliminate the differences in national regulations that still exist and replace them with clear and simple principles can help. In this regard, and with all our legislative zeal, we must not lose sight of the fact that the EU must cooperate with the Hague Conference on International Private Law in order to ensure a coordinated procedure. Thus, the EU should not reinvent the wheel in this area. I welcome the Commissioner’s statements in this regard. Alexandra Thein,

 Mr President, the United Nations Convention on Human Rights, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as well as the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, ban discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. The European Union not only has obligations in relation to human rights within its territory, but also an international duty to insist on compliance with these rights and to criticise abuses when dealing with third countries, particularly when we provide financial support through the European Development Fund to third countries like Uganda, which have entered into partnership agreements with us. Accordingly, we actually have the right to comment when these third countries fail to meet the human rights requirements set down in such partnership agreements. Hence, Uganda must respect international human rights standards because it was party to the Cotonou Agreement, which sets down our organised development aid to the ACP countries. Just one year ago, we called on Uganda not to follow through on its plans for a law to criminalise homosexuals. One year on, the situation has deteriorated. There is still the threat of long prison sentences or even the death penalty. With others, I myself demonstrated in front of the Ugandan Embassy in May of this year. This had no effect. We wish to emphasise once again that the EU is generally opposed to the death penalty and to homophobic legislation of this kind. Alexandra Thein,

 Mr President, what is meant by better lawmaking? We want to make simple and transparent laws that EU citizens and companies can understand. In this regard, it is important, above all, to respect the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. We want to regulate at European level only what cannot be regulated at national or local level. An important element of better lawmaking is, above all, having a clear idea of the impact of the planned regulations. Only with this can we achieve the best possible effects and, at the same time, keep any negative impact to a minimum. The impact assessment must therefore be prepared by the Commission with the greatest possible meticulousness. It is right, therefore, that, under pressure from the European Parliament, an independent board was set up to monitor the quality of impact assessments. However, this board is intended to be accountable to the European Parliament. For companies, authorities and citizens, the regulations are associated with costs, whether it is in relation to providing information, labelling products or complying with monitoring obligations. If the costs are too high, it cancels out the benefit of a policy. We therefore have the ambitious goal, which is also the right one, of reducing administrative costs by reducing red tape by 25% by 2012. To achieve this goal we need to act at European level, and the chances of achieving it are good. However, at this point it should also be mentioned that a good third – some people say two thirds – of the administrative burden that is derived from the EU is due to the fact that the Member States simply enact too many unnecessary administrative and bureaucratic regulations when transposing EU law. EU bodies and Member States should therefore actively work together to prevent unnecessary red tape. The transposition of Community law must also be fundamentally and actively scrutinised. Above all, the national parliaments should also fulfil their obligation for involvement in accordance with the Treaty of Lisbon. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Israel for taking seriously the many concerns about its proposed legislation and for at least watering down the provisions slightly. Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have, for many years, been required to disclose their sources of funding in a completely transparent way and even to publish this information on their websites. The planned legislation, even in its watered-down form, is ultimately aimed only at specific NGOs: firstly at human rights organisations and secondly at those which receive public funding. This includes, for example, public money from the United Nations or the European Union. In contrast, far-right groups or non-governmental organisations which are privately funded and which, for example, support the building of illegal settlements, are not subject to any legal restrictions and do not have to make their funding sources public. The problem with the proposed legislation lies in this unequal treatment. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, firstly I want to reject the numerous accusations from outside and, in some cases, from within Parliament, claiming that we are discussing this subject at the wrong time, after the peace talks have begun. The parliamentary question which I helped to draw up was tabled at a time when none of us thought that direct peace talks would start up again. I have been involved in this area since the early 1990s and this subject has been under discussion in Parliament for a long time. This is ultimately all about preventing the Lower Jordan River from finally running dry. The lower part of the river has already been reduced to a mere trickle. It consists only of waste water and contains no fresh water at all. All the scientists are agreed that the Lower Jordan River will be as good as dead in one or two years. I find it disturbing that the resolution addresses Israel, Jordan, Syria and the Palestinian Authority on equal terms. The Lower Jordan River area is located entirely in zone C, which means that the Palestinian Authority does not even have a right to access the area, never mind any administrative rights or any influence at all over it. It has already been said that the Palestinian Authority can do nothing in this area. Therefore, this resolution should be aimed at other countries. When a country, in this case Israel, uses 75% of the water available in the Lower Jordan River, although part of the water has already been taken by other countries, and leaves almost no water for the Palestinians to live on, this is a political issue. This problem was supposedly resolved in the Oslo II Agreement and we have not made any progress since then. The specific difficulty at the moment is that the Palestinians are constantly attempting to drill wells, which are immediately destroyed, and also that the Israeli water authority, which is a monopoly, is not drilling wells for the Palestinians, but only for the illegal settlements.

Madam President, Commissioner, the financial crisis has highlighted that a uniform financial supervisory authority is an absolute necessity for the European Union. The three EU-wide supervisory authorities which are envisaged for banking, insurance and securities should thereby be provided with the right to intervene directly in national institutions, such as Deutsche Bank. These intervention rights are restricted to absolutely exceptional cases and will hopefully never be used. As a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I regret that the committee responsible has not given any consideration to our constitutional objections regarding the envisaged intervention rights, both at European and national level, especially in the wake of the Lisbon judgment of the German Federal Constitutional Court. A recommendation from the Committee on Legal Affairs, whereby the Commission, as guardian of the treaties, would act as the final decision-making authority within the framework of a set procedure, or, in other words, have the last say, was not followed. On this point, the Committee on Legal Affairs recognises that the technical expertise required to make judgments is indisputably available in the national and European supervisory authorities and not in the Commission. I hope that during the current negotiations, too, a solution will also be found to this constitutional problem. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

Along with the majority of Members in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I have decided to vote in favour of the Sommer report. It is true that the Liberals were not able to achieve their goals in every area. The adoption of origin labelling for meat and milk in processed products is a regrettable move, because it imposes significant costs on producers and seems almost impossible to implement in practice. However, for me, the positive results of the vote outweigh the negative ones. For the first time, we have uniform regulations on food labelling throughout the entire internal market, with no possibility of individual countries going it alone. In addition, one of the decisive successes of this vote for me is the fact that the misleading traffic light model was rejected. A mandatory colour coded nutrient declaration will not be permitted either at a European or a national level. Uniform Europe-wide labelling rules will bring clear advantages for companies and consumers. The cost of manufacturing and selling products will fall because manufacturers will only have to follow a single regulation. Consumers will benefit from uniform nutrient labelling when comparing products that come from within Europe. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mr Vice-President, our plenary sessions are public and this gives a very poor impression. I would like to add my voice to what has been said. I am not asking for an email; instead I would actually like it to be officially presented and explained on Parliament’s website, because one statement at least must be incorrect. 168 cannot have been the threshold. If 621 votes were cast, then the threshold must have been 310 – if I have understood things correctly. I would therefore ask for a written explanation on the website so that every citizen can also understand it. In view of the large number of people who were watching, we have really given an extremely poor public impression. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography is vitally important. We must make every effort to prevent child pornography being made available over the Internet. The permanent and effective prevention of child abuse is both a political responsibility and a principle of the rule of law. The members of the German Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament are of the opinion that criminal content of this kind must be deleted as quickly as possible. Alexandra Thein,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the security and law enforcement authorities are working ever closer together to improve the cross-border prosecution of crimes in order to protect the safety of citizens in the European Union. In this regard, I could mention the European Arrest Warrant, for example. In return, however, the fundamental rights of citizens accused of crimes are being left out of the legislation. Up to now, all attempts to secure the guarantees afforded by the rule of law in criminal proceedings throughout the EU have failed to achieve the requisite unanimity in the Council or to receive mutual recognition. With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, we now have new opportunities for protecting the basic procedural rights of citizens in criminal proceedings. Now, for the first time, the European Parliament has the power of codecision, and only a qualified majority is now required in the Council. As you know, we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are in favour of protecting and continuing to extend citizens’ rights. Therefore, we have also worked to ensure that, in future, all EU citizens will have the right to an interpreter and to a written translation if they are arrested by the police or brought before a court as an accused person in a Member State whose language they do not speak or understand. It is vital not only that criminal proceedings be better coordinated across borders, but also that the rights of citizens in criminal investigations and proceedings – for example, the right to a fair trial – be adequately available to citizens throughout Europe.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I simply cannot understand how anyone can be against freeing micro-entities – and I stress micro-entities, not small or medium-sized businesses – from annual accounting obligations. Here we are not talking about the export-oriented medium-sized company from Baden-Württemberg with a hundred employees, but small craft enterprises, the flower shop, the baker around the corner, the newly founded IT start-up business. For years, politicians have been repeating over and over, both at national and European level, that precisely these micro-entities must be relieved. Relieved from unnecessary costs, in this case, unnecessary costs for a tax advisor, not from the otherwise essential costs – in Belgium it is lawyers who complete these annual accounts, in France auditors – and relieved from an unnecessary amount of work and administrative burdens, now more than ever in the current financial and economic crisis. Now that the Commission has finally tabled the proposal, which Parliament has called on it to do for so long, all of a sudden, the sceptics and nay-sayers express concerns. Only seven per cent of the micro-entities that we are talking about are involved in cross-border activities. Therefore, with regard to the principle of subsidiarity, there should not be any regulation at all at European level. To make matters worse, the accounting rules have continued to be oriented towards the needs of large and medium-sized businesses, and have been totally inappropriate for the micro-entities we are talking about here from the outset. I hear the arguments of the opposition, firstly, that the micro-entrepreneur might need a loan and then not be able to present his bank with anything. I say to you, anyone who is familiar with Basel II knows that for the bank, the annual balance sheet is at best a nice bonus, but nothing more. Secondly, the supposed creditor protection: creditors who depend on the annual balance sheet are in the minority. In all my time as a lawyer, when a business of this size is sold, I have never experienced a buyer depending on the significance of annual accounts in whatever form. Thirdly, the southern Member States of the European Union – yes, precisely those that right now are the subject of constant inglorious reports in our newspapers – want to maintain the old regulation. They can do this as the regulation is optional. However, states that demand annual financial statements from micro-enterprises because they do not have effective tax administration and exercise no control, apart from the receipt of the annual financial statement, should hardly be surprised if they have missing tax revenue or tax fraud. I therefore call on all MEPs, in particular, the Social Democrats, to approve this sensible regulation, especially as Mr Lehne from our Committee on Legal Affairs took all concerns into account through compromise regulations, subsequent to which no further relevant arguments were put forward.

According to the resolution of the European Parliament on the draft general budget for the financial year 2010, adopted on 17 December 2009, a vote was taken today on the amending budget for the European Parliament, following the revised calculations made by the Parliamentary administration. The FDP in the European Parliament abstained, because there was a paragraph in the package of amendments concerned that we could not reconcile with our convictions. The FDP had already expressed its opposition to an increase in the secretarial allowance to EUR 1 500 during the discussions in committee. It is out of the secretarial allowance that MEPs’ assistants are paid. The FDP considers that the argument that more money is needed due to the additional work that MEPs have to do with the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is unsound, as there is nothing in past experience to support this. Certainly, due to the Treaty of Lisbon, which has just come into force, Parliament will overall need extra capacity for legislative work, but with the introduction of the Assistants’ Statute from the beginning of the current parliamentary term, there is still no proof that MEPs actually need more assistants. For this reason, there are grounds for concern that further demands and supplementary increases, or an extension of office capacity, will follow. For this reason, the FDP in the European Parliament abstained. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, neither party to the conflict has so far met the demands of the United Nations for a credible and independent investigation into the accusations of the Goldstone report. This is regrettable, particularly on Israel’s part, because, however controversial the Goldstone report might be, any state that calls itself a democratic state based on the rule of law is obliged to allow such serious accusations to be subjected to an independent investigation. An internal military investigation by the Israeli army, which is itself under suspicion, is not sufficient. If the EU takes its own principles of respect for human rights and international law seriously, it must increase the pressure on both sides, including in the context of its bilateral relations, and insist that the investigation that has been called for into possible violations of international and humanitarian law is carried out according to the principles of the rule of law. War crimes must be punished under international law, as has been said here many times. If necessary, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court will have to carry out the investigations on the basis of Article 12(3) of the Rome Statute. However, irrespective of the Goldstone report, there is currently no reason to continue the siege on Gaza. Alexandra Thein  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mrs Malmström, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I am a member of the delegation for relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council, in other words, the Palestinian parliament. Last week, our delegation was refused entry to Gaza by Israel. The situation in Gaza is very disturbing, particularly now that winter has come. Only 10% of the population can obtain the supplies they need by smuggling goods through the tunnels and this is exactly why the tunnels are tolerated by everyone. Before operation ‘Cast Lead’ the situation was exactly the reverse and 90% of the population of Gaza could take care of themselves. As an occupying power, Israel should be responsible for providing for the population in all the occupied areas. Israel is shirking its responsibility under international law, which means that the international community and, above all, the EU have to step in. If we are supplying food to 90% of the population of Gaza, we have a right to see where European taxpayers’ money is being spent, whether it is being used appropriately and whether it is reaching the people who need it.

 The German Free Democratic Party members of the European Parliament have abstained from voting on the Copenhagen resolution for the following reasons. The resolution contains statements about financing for climate protection measures in third countries without defining the specific criteria or purpose of the financing. We cannot justify this to taxpayers. In addition, we believe that blanket criticism of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) is wrong. The ICAO is the organisation which deals with aviation matters at an international level. Both the criticism and the statement about the alleged failure of ICAO negotiations are incorrect and inappropriate. The call for specific arrangements for a CO2
 trading system for the aviation industry goes against current EU legislation and overburdens the EU’s negotiating position in an international climate agreement with unrealistic demands. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

I voted for the Protocol as I believe that it will benefit the European Union. The Protocol is not the right instrument to address the issue of human rights abuses.

The Protocol does not imply recognition of these settlements under international law. Britta Reimers,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we now have three years of discussions and negotiations under our belts in a process that occasionally stalled and sometimes got quite tough. We set ourselves the goal of simplifying the quality systems, ensuring the reliability of quality and also establishing a way to get better prices for farmers. We did not succeed in controlling marketing standards or the regulation of supply. We now intend doing this in the common organisation of the markets. Overall, however, it must said that we have taken a first step towards a uniform quality policy. The long time spent in negotiations also shows how much we have struggled among ourselves to reach an agreement and that it is not always easy to make progress at first reading. The agreement has now also been confirmed by the Council. Speaking on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I have no choice other than to support the compromise before us and to ask you to support the amendments. We have failed to achieve a lot of what we wanted. The ALDE Group was not happy with the introduction of another new quality characteristic like the mountain products, however when one considers what has been achieved overall as a package, then we can support this. I think our colleagues will also be satisfied with this. Britta Reimers,

 Mr President, Ms Reding, ladies and gentlemen, the last reform of the sugar regime was a very positive development and the industry adapted to the market as a result. However, the complaints from all sides show that we need to go further and that we must continue to develop the sugar market, because the Commission’s forecasts were not accurate. The African, Caribbean and Pacific States have not been supplying Europe with sugar. Instead, they have sold it to other countries, because markets all over the world have changed. They have undergone huge changes in recent years, but not in the way that was predicted. Demand has grown in many third countries and we were not able to foresee this. This means that demand for sugar has increased all over the world and, therefore, that there have been reductions in supplies to the European market. The problem is that sugar is not the only product of the agricultural industry, and so farmers have also had to adapt increasingly to the requirements of the market. They are considering alternative crops. For example, in my area of Germany, energy crops are being cultivated and they are genuine competitors for sugar beet. In the course of the market reform, we should discuss whether it is time to abolish the quota regulations that apply to the sugar market and to give it more freedom in future. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we need to take note of the fact that we are discussing two subjects here. I will not, at this point, say anything about the voluntary labelling of the meat; I will stick mainly to the electronic identification of the animals. In that connection, Mr Schnellhardt, I need to disagree with you quite stridently. Sheep farmers are telling us very clearly that they have major problems with electronic identification, as there are technical shortcomings with it. The tags are not coming out of the animals, but the technology is malfunctioning. The fault that occurs as a result is blamed on the farmers. That is not acceptable, and it is a situation that we must avoid in the case of cattle. It is therefore right that we should leave this system as voluntary in cattle in future, too, until the system has matured. As a farmer, I am not saying that the system should not be developed or introduced, but allowing something to mature takes time. Moreover, it is important – for public health in particular – to call electronic identification into question if it does not work. As regards public health, it is quite clear that we need certainty. As long as that certainty is not in place, we should stick to a voluntary system. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Since a postponement of the vote on the ACTA in order to be able to evaluate and take into account the pending ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union was not possible, I abstained from voting. With regard to tackling product piracy and strengthening copyright, ACTA is something that I could support. Nevertheless, the fears and concerns of a section of the population, which feels its freedoms will be restricted by ACTA, must be taken into account.

It is important that we take up a clear position in this transitional year. I would also like to emphasise that I welcome the constructive way in which we have worked together and I hope that we can continue to work even more constructively in future, because in the past, we were often only able to make progress on agricultural reform in fits and starts.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, ever since it was decided to abandon the milk quota, people have been watching you closely, Commissioner, to see how you behave and what action you are taking to exit the scheme in a rational way. Is there really any pattern discernible here? We have had a year of regional over-production and a rise in global production, which is hardly surprising since there was previously a shortage on the market, leading to higher prices. In addition, over the last two years there has been a rise in operating costs of about 20 %, principally due to direct and indirect rises in energy costs. The market reacted in the normal way to the increased supply and came under pressure. This caused prices to drop. The market is now stabilising again because the farmers are displaying an ability to manage the market and are slowing their production more than is usual for the season. The criticised price decreases have led to a rise in demand in the market. The decline in the euro exchange rate promotes marketability in the global market, making European dairy produce competitive. In the case of cheese, stocks have been reduced to such an extent that more milk is now needed for cheese production. In other words, this is a normal market cycle. Now we come to the Commission: if the market is working, why do we need a super levy? Is its sole purpose to acquire funds for the EU? Has the time perhaps come to put the super levy on a European footing, finally transferring it from a national administrative level?

 The German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament has spoken out clearly in favour of the introduction of a debt redemption fund. However, participation in such a fund must be associated with clear and strict rules, such as were contained in the proposal made by the German Council of Economic Experts to the German Government in autumn 2011. Watering down the criteria for participation is neither productive nor effective. Linking the introduction of a debt redemption fund with the eurobonds project and the treatment of economic imbalances is unfair, and is rejected by the FDP in the European Parliament in the strongest possible terms.

Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, it is utterly astounding that we are to decide here on the future of the common agricultural policy, but have had essential criteria for this decision withheld from us. There is nothing to prevent a new delimitation of less-favoured areas being carried out. It is also acceptable to try to base this on fewer criteria than is currently the case. However, if these are to be limited to eight criteria, made up of climate-related and geological criteria, it is unacceptable for MEPs to be denied the opportunity to scrutinise whether these criteria are indeed appropriate. We need maps of the new distribution of less-favoured areas in order to be able to examine whether this new distribution based on the eight criteria makes any sense at all. However, the withholding of the map material will obviously arouse distrust as to whether there really is any desire at all to enable Parliament to exercise its right of codecision. As a farmer, I have serious doubts from a purely professional point of view as to whether these simple criteria will enable this sort of area classification to be made appropriately. There are, after all, other criteria that could convey disadvantage, such as a lack of infrastructure, labour market access or general historical farm structures. Moreover, different combinations of various criteria could lead to very different results. It is high time that we were able to evaluate the Commission’s proposals in an objective way in order to be able to improve them if necessary. Otherwise, I would agree with my fellow Members who wish to leave less-favoured areas out of the current agricultural reform discussion. Britta Reimers,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, within the last year, a new viral disease has been discovered in sheep and cattle that leads to deformity or even still-birth among lambs and calves. The disease is apparently communicated by midges, which also seem to have been responsible for carrying it into the EU. The affected farms have suffered serious damage, in some cases even fighting for survival, and have been left to fend for themselves until now. We are all agreed that technically correct monitoring is essential for new diseases so that it is possible to determine, on a scientific basis, whether or not it is a new epizootic. This requires time, however, and time is precisely what the affected parties at local level do not have. They need help. Funds based on mutuality, such as an animal disease fund, require mandatory notification in order to be able to distribute financial assistance. When will the Commission finally develop a standard strategy for new diseases that clearly defines when remedial measures and assistance can be provided to those affected by new diseases, in addition to the monitoring services? We are running out of time. The disease is continuing to spread. Trading partners outside Europe are responding with export embargos, so that the damage is also spreading to non-infected farms. The insemination and breeding livestock trade is restricted, despite the fact that the disease is spread by midges and direct infection seems unlikely. How does the Commission intend to proceed in relation to export embargos? Climate change and increased trade and mobility in society will lead to a rise in diseases entering our territory. We need a rational concept to reduce the consequences. We need answers for those affected that will help them and us all. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 I have voted against the motion for a resolution on the feasibility of introducing stability bonds because I am of the opinion that the creation of Eurobonds would send out the wrong signal. Since the introduction of the euro, low interest rates have led to higher debt levels in many euro area countries.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Nicholson for his successful handling of the negotiations. We have decided on the abolition of the existing cost-intensive and market-distorting milk quota system and analysed the findings of the high level group for milk. The dairy package that has resulted from the negotiations is an important first step towards a market and competition-oriented dairy sector. The formation of inter-branch organisations is being promoted, with these organisations to be given the ability to negotiate contracts on behalf of their members. The negotiating power of milk producers is to be bolstered – in future they will be able to negotiate on an equal footing, if they so wish. It is also good that we will not be overshooting the mark. These contracts will not be permitted to make up more than 33% of the national and 3.5% of the European market. This ensures that there will be no new imbalance and that the necessary market freedom is retained. As there is no general requirement for contracts, farmers’ individual commercial freedom to make decisions remains secure. This is an important element of a functional market. We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will support the dairy package, and I ask you all to vote in favour of this package in tomorrow’s vote in plenary. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we need functioning markets with scope for competition in Europe. We will only achieve this, however, when everyone has equal rights. The role of farmers in the market is that of relatively small sole traders. Upstream and downstream of them, by contrast, we often see quite large business structures. I therefore welcome the fact that the Commission is, for once, looking into the market not only from the consumer point of view, but also from that of producers. If we have imbalances, we need to find ways to tackle them without giving rise to excessive bureaucracy and without creating new imbalances elsewhere. We all know how sensitively markets react. In these times of the debt crisis, in particular, that is something we see day in, day out. It is therefore important to test the waters carefully if we intervene. Markets need sensible frameworks in order to facilitate a minimum level of balance. However, they also need enough freedom to act and to be able to do so. Agriculture cannot be excepted from this principle. Only a balance of freedom and responsibility will enable all market participants to make the most of their advantages and thus help bring about long-term growth and prosperity.

However, the super weapon seems to be losing its effectiveness. I agree with the authors of the motion for a resolution that we need to be more prudent and more careful with antimicrobial agents. The aim must be to limit the use of antibiotics to the essential curing of infections. We also need incentives for further research and development of new agents and alternative solutions. However, it is vital that we all pull in the same direction.

 I am 100% behind Mr Duff’s resolution. It is right and important to draw attention to the situation of the population of Western Sahara. The Moroccan authorities must provide information on the extent to which its economic activities relating to the natural resources in the territory of Western Sahara are for the benefit of the population of the territory and in accordance with their wishes. The status of the region under international law must be clarified. A court ruling on the territory of Western Sahara would bring about clarity in respect of relations between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco. Nonetheless, this resolution comes at the wrong time. Had it been passed, the resolution would have de facto
 blocked the EU’s fisheries agreement with Morocco, since this expires on 28 February 2012, and it is unlikely that the European Court of Justice would have passed a ruling by this date. Had this resolution been passed, it would have sent out the wrong signal to our Moroccan partners. Morocco is the only country in North Africa to have succeeded in initiating reforms to bring about democracy by peaceful means. This process should not be disrupted. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 In terms of social and economic policy, I believe it to be fundamentally right to increase the proportion of women in management positions. However, I have deliberately voted against the report, because paragraph 16b calls for the Europe-wide introduction of quotas for women. This is going too far. A mandatory quota will interfere on a large scale with companies’ freedom to do business and is therefore questionable from a constitutional perspective. In addition, an across-the-board quota does not take into consideration the specific circumstances of each company and industry. For example, it would not currently be possible to impose a standard quota in the construction, engineering or IT industries in Germany. In this area, it is essential to focus initially on training and study opportunities in order to bring about a significant increase in the proportion of young women employed in these traditionally male-dominated industries. In addition, we need to improve conditions for working parents, in particular, by introducing family-conscious, flexible work models and developing the child care infrastructure. Against this background, I would rather see a voluntary undertaking by companies and cooperation between the worlds of politics and business instead of an inflexible, mandatory quota.

In my opinion, it exacerbates the problem of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), rather than resolving it. We need a standard, EU-wide solution.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his persistent and positive work. Where the future of agricultural policy after 2013 is concerned, we have to decide the direction in which we want to go. Do we want an agricultural sector that faces up to the challenges by acting in an innovative, modern, courageous, self-aware, responsible and independent way in the market? Or do we want an agricultural sector that continues to be drip-fed by Europe and which needs its hand to be held and encouraging words from Mummy with each step it takes into the future? That is the course we are currently setting. To cope with the challenges of the future we need to promote modern technologies in the agricultural sector instead of having endless debates on ideologies. If farms are to be enabled to plan with certainty then we cannot keep changing course every couple of years. It is too much of a strain on our farmers’ finances. Everyone here must surely be aware that each political change of direction results in new laws and directives, which in turn demand investment by farms without at the same time increasing their incomes. We should not care whether a farm is large or small; instead we should be concerned with whether it is run in an economically sound manner. We should not care whether it produces conventionally or organically, so long as it handles resources responsibly. We should also not care how many animals are kept, so long as those animals are treated well. The important thing for us must be that we have sufficient good quality food in the future at affordable prices in Europe. After all, Europe is not alone in the world. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 The German Free Democratic Party delegation in the European Parliament assumes that the inclusion of Romania and Bulgaria in the Schengen area will further improve freedom of movement within the EU. Now that both Member States have achieved positive evaluation results in all areas of the Schengen review, there should be no more obstacles to delay inclusion further. There is no denying that the technical securing of borders will not automatically make them impermeable as long as problems persist in combating corruption in the justice and policing system. Accordingly, this challenge also relates to Member States already in the Schengen area. For this reason, the German Free Democratic Party delegation believes that criteria such as the fight against corruption must receive greater attention when evaluating the Schengen mechanism, and any misdemeanours must be punished appropriately.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for many companies in the European Union, the continual rise in fuel prices represents an additional burden. European fishermen in particular are suffering as a result of this price rise because they cannot simply compensate for the additional costs by increasing their catch or by charging better prices. The current political situation in North Africa and the Middle East has exacerbated the problem. We therefore need to investigate the effects of the rise in fuel prices on the economy and employment in the EU. Which sectors are particularly at risk and what sort of support could be provided without it distorting competition? We therefore call on the Commission to look into this. It is important that we support the European fishing industry, among other things, in order not to increase our dependence on imports from third countries. We are on the verge of reforming the common fisheries policy and therefore, we are under a particular obligation to be cautious and not to act prematurely with regard to this matter either.

 Mr President, Mrs Damanaki, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that Parliament is finally to vote on this issue and would like to thank the rapporteurs for their work. The amendment to the Council regulation on the financial measures in the Community is one of the main tools we need in order to implement the common fisheries policy. This is true in particular for the areas of international fishery relations, data collection and scientific studies. The control systems of the common fisheries policy and their implementation are particularly important. The rapporteur has made every effort to convince his fellow Members of the need to increase the co-financing rate to a maximum of 75%. We have been unable to acquiesce to his wishes. The existing regulations have proven themselves in practice and already allow for some exceptions. The Member States already make use of the opportunity to avail of co-financing and there is no need for any further incentives. It is important that the amendment to the regulation should clear the way for a coherent legal framework. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 In the vote on the Lange report, I am abstaining on paragraph 31 because of the ambiguous wording, which refers to Eurobonds as well as project bonds. However, taking it as a whole, I am voting for the report, as I have nothing against project bonds in themselves. Project bonds serve as finance for extensive innovation, infrastructure and reindustrialisation projects. This is not a question of instruments for the communitarisation of debts, as would be the case with Eurobonds. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

Madam President, market fluctuations are important for the proper functioning of markets in order to create incentives for the buying and selling of goods. For us farmers, commodity futures trading is a basic component of the buying and selling of harvested crops. It provides an important opportunity to achieve planning certainty through the early setting of prices and quantities. In contrast to the situation in our prosperous industrialised nations, rising food prices are a particular problem in the poor regions of the world where people have to spend a large proportion of their income on food. We must not intervene in the markets every time the prices change in an attempt to combat natural fluctuations. However, without internationally applicable framework legislation for the financial markets, we cannot even start to think about regulating the commodities markets, because if there is too much money in the financial market it will find suitable equivalents, and commodities are currently highly regarded. Therefore, we should not be surprised if agricultural commodities are now also a sought-after trading objective. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 In general, I support the waste disposal directive. However, the subject of photovoltaic modules remains a problem. There is no understandable reason for excluding the entire sector from the regulations. We have a wide range of legislation governing waste streams. Therefore, it is not clear why a complete industry, which is expected to produce significant waste streams, is being exempted. For this reason, I have abstained from voting on the report.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the current dioxin incident is more than just a scandal. The people of Europe have been shown their reflection. How long have we been complaining that there is an extreme fight for prices and survival going on in agriculture, fuelled by the insatiable demand for ever cheaper food. For a long time now, this fight has been more than simply a trial of strength. Individuals are increasingly resorting to criminal means and methods. However, we will all lose out in the end as a result. We can enact more laws and directives, we can carry out more checks at even more cost, we can impose more severe penalties – none of these things will succeed against the criminal energy fuelled by such a tough fight for existence. We must finally tackle the causes of this problem. We must at last put an end to the constant demand for more and cheaper food. As a farmer, I have experienced the powerlessness against the criminal activities of certain individuals – as in this case – on my own doorstep. Together with my professional colleagues, I have shuddered at the thought of who will be next in line and innocently drawn into this maelstrom. I would therefore like to ask the Commission: what do you and your colleagues intend to do to restore the value of food? I welcome your proposals, but with these you will not solve the main problem.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have known for twelve years that battery farming practices would be banned in the EU from 1 January 2012 onwards. How can it be that twelve years have not been enough for some Member States to implement this ban in good time and to prepare their poultry industry accordingly? This is just one of many examples of how poor implementation leads to frustration. Egg producers in Member States who have implemented the changes in good time are already experiencing competitive anomalies that run counter to the principles of the EU. I am calling on the Commission to require that the relevant law should be upheld in all Member States and to do all it can to ensure that it is implemented. Eggs should no longer be produced in battery cages after January 2012 and the then illegal eggs should no longer be allowed to reach the shops, putting an end to their negative effect on competition. The farmers who have changed their practices to comply with EU requirements should not experience financial disadvantage while those who flout the changeover reap the economic benefits. It is impossible to explain to people in Europe why EU law does not apply equally in all Member States and why some Member States are always seen to be dragging their feet. The recent crises show where this can lead us. We need a Europe that acts in a concerted way, rather than one in which every member can do as it pleases, regardless of the rest. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Madam President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, one of our top priorities as Members of the European Parliament is to reduce bureaucracy and simplify legislation and regulations in all the political areas of the European Union. This is the only way in which we can manage taxpayers’ money efficiently and increase the acceptance of our political decisions among the citizens of Europe. For this reason, it is important for farmers to feel the direct effect of simplification measures of this kind in the agricultural sector. Their job is to produce food, not to write books. At a time when local authority budgets are becoming increasingly tight, it is also important for us to reduce the amount of work to be done by their administrative staff. Regulations must be drawn up in such a way that they are not padded out unnecessarily. In addition, we must ensure that the sanctions we impose are in proportion to the breach of regulations. An efficient, long-term policy is characterised by the fact that it places a greater emphasis on advice than it does on punishment. This is the only way that we can give our citizens and our farmers the incentives to implement new findings and to fulfil society’s requirements. We need to take all of this into account when we discuss the future common agricultural policy. We also need to focus more closely on ensuring that there is no duplication of formalities and controls and that forms are only filled out when they provide real added value for the administrative bodies and for the farmers themselves. We must finally learn to work together and not against one another. Britta Reimers,

 Madam President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, providing protection for bees is in the best interests of the agricultural sector and many farmers are also beekeepers. We have seen a decline in the bee population in many regions of Europe. We must identify the causes of this problem and take the necessary countermeasures. It is a good thing that the budget funding for the national bee programmes up to 2013 has been increased from EUR 26 million to EUR 32 million. However, that is not enough. We must ensure that these programmes are continued after 2013. In order to achieve this, it is also particularly important for us to improve and simplify the process which allows researchers, beekeepers and farmers to share specialist knowledge. We should focus as soon as possible on combating the diseases and parasites to which bees are subject. We must not leave the beekeepers to fight this battle on their own. We urgently need better and more standardised statistics from all the Member States throughout the EU. This is because we need to work with facts and not just with speculation. As the number of beekeepers is constantly falling, we also need to invest more in education and training. We should provide more support for young beekeepers and also for full-time beekeepers, to ensure that the profession has a future and does not die out. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports this resolution. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks to the rapporteurs. In view of the high level of imports of fish and fish products into the EU, it is essential that we maintain and support our local fishermen, as well as the domestic aquaculture sector. We urgently need improved catch methods in order to secure the long-term livelihood of both our seas and our fishermen. It is equally essential that we enable aquaculture to expand further. We are in urgent need of more effective data collection and more intensive research, since only once we know what is actually going on will we be able to make the right decisions for the future. Our lack of success in combining economics with ecology – which are not actually that different – is often down to excessive bureaucracy and insufficient knowledge. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 The motion for a resolution on the crisis in the livestock sector which has been adopted by the European Parliament calls for the introduction of new market management mechanisms in the livestock industry and of safety nets in all the cereal sectors. I oppose these market interventions. However, the motion for a resolution also includes important liberal requirements for pragmatic thresholds for GMOs in imported feeds and a review of the ban on feeding meat and bone meal. Therefore, I did not vote against the resolution, but instead abstained in the final vote. In order to guarantee a supply of feed for the European livestock sector, we must relieve farmers of their burden of red tape and create a framework of legal certainty. A market focus in the agricultural industry will also mean that farmers can take responsibility for their own businesses and need not expect constant protective interventions in the market to be made by politicians. If agricultural policy is based only on individual interests, the result will be a spiral of exemptions which it will not be possible to finance and which will distort the market. This will turn farmers into the victims of a bureaucratic, state-run control system. In order for the market to function effectively, we need a clearly defined framework for the entire agricultural industry and not just for individual areas. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, integrated maritime policy is a forward-looking area. The oceans are being used increasingly intensively for transport, maritime economic activities, offshore energy and fishing, and the development of these areas must be coordinated. The space available is limited and, therefore, the various maritime sectors must take a responsible and thoughtful approach to working together. The use and the protection of the seas must not conflict with one another. These two areas are mutually dependent, because the oceans can only support us if they are healthy. I would like to highlight the positive cooperation between countries bordering on the Baltic who are working together to promote the dynamic development of the fisheries, the environment, the infrastructure and tourism in coastal regions. We must continue to focus on the fishing industry, which is in a weak position and is often regarded as being a low priority, but which, because it provides us with food, represents a vital link in the coastal economy. I would like to congratulate Mrs Meissner on this positive report. Britta Reimers,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Convention on Future Multilateral Cooperation in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries established a very important organisation: the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation, or NAFO. Its aim is the conservation and optimum utilisation of the fishery resources in the Northwest Atlantic. The convention has since been amended and brought more into line with other regional conventions. Modern concepts such as stock management have been incorporated. I feel it is important that the structure of the organisation is streamlined and that the obligations of the contracting parties are clearly defined. It is also good that the possibility of resolving conflicts through a dispute settlement procedure is provided. The fishing possibilities accruing to the European Union under the convention are of great interest to the EU. Parliament should give its approval under the new powers granted to it by the Treaty of Lisbon.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the distribution of profits in the food supply chain has become unbalanced, and generally to the detriment of farmers. That is the correct conclusion drawn in this report. Unfortunately, the rapporteur has focused on the old instruments of agricultural policy. He believes that farmers’ incomes can be improved by regulating supply in the manner of a planned economy. Experience tells us that planned economies go hand in hand with greater bureaucracy, but our farmers want to produce – they do not want more paperwork. Measures that are not based on the basic principles of a social market economy have failed in the past. A planned economy has not worked in the agricultural sector in recent decades. A social market economy, on the other hand, offers farmers the opportunity to run a successful business. If we are to improve the situation of farmers, then we must ensure that the European farming sector is competitive in the long term. To achieve this, it is essential that we improve the bargaining position of farmers vis-à-vis the other actors in the food supply chain. This can be achieved by means of a fair and transparent market that is also capable of holding its own in the global market. At present, I have my doubts as to whether I can vote in favour of the report. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank our rapporteur for his constructive cooperation and for the important aspects highlighted by his report on the future of the CAP after 2013. This report calls for further development of the existing common agricultural policy rather than the development of a new policy. This is a good thing. The primary function of agriculture is and remains the production of food for our citizens. The ever-increasing need for public goods, the growth in population numbers and the simultaneous shortage of natural resources make this more difficult to achieve. Farmers are required to produce more and more with less and less. This is impossible without increasing efficiency. The European Parliament, the Commission and the Council are responsible for securing the necessary framework conditions for this. If we in Europe want to maintain a healthy and diverse agricultural sector in the future, we will also need to take account of the needs of farmers, namely by imposing as little bureaucracy as necessary and by allowing as much entrepreneurial freedom as possible to enable them to earn a reasonable income for themselves.

 Mr President, Commissioners, I would like to congratulate Mr Cadec on his successful and balanced report. I would also like to thank him for his excellent cooperation. There are major challenges involved in regulating the import of fishery and aquaculture products into the EU. With a volume of 12 million tonnes and a value of EUR 55 billion, the EU fisheries market is the largest in the world. This market is growing rapidly and is increasingly dependent on imports from third countries. It is therefore important for us to control the conditions under which the products from third countries are produced and imported. We have now submitted two amendments in plenary. These relate to the need for us to recognise the special economic situation in the peripheral regions of Europe. However, we do not hold market liberalisation alone responsible for the difficulties. The huge introduction of fish products onto the EU market, which has been described as unfair, also has no direct effect on... (The President cut off the speaker) Britta Reimers  (ALDE

I support the action of the European Union in reorganising the current remuneration policy to provide long-term success and more accountability for decision makers. However, this must not lead to a situation in which policy determines salaries. This should remain the task of the authorities which are already in place, such as the board of governors and the general meeting of the banks. The proposed remuneration policy must therefore not replace existing structures, but at most complement them where necessary, insofar as this is beneficial to the quality of economic decisions.

 It is certainly important to tighten the regulations on internships. The representatives of the German Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament have supported this. Young people often work for months on end without payment, hoping that they might still get a permanent job afterwards. This is an unsustainable situation. Internships should not destroy jobs. However, today’s plenary vote is going to pave the way in the future for a complete ban on unpaid internships. We believe that this gives a wrong message. It should still be possible to do a three-month unpaid internship, for example. There are numerous non profit-making or social organisations where a young person can acquire exciting, interesting experiences. However, such organisations are often unable to pay any remuneration for the internship. The key factor should be the duration of an internship. In the case of any internship lasting longer than six months, the employer can rely on productive output from the intern. From then on, remuneration should also be paid. The decision made today is impracticable and goes too far. We therefore do not support this part of the resolution. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mr Milana, the rapporteur, on his report. In a world in which fish stocks are becoming smaller and the demand for fish and fish products is rising, aquaculture is becoming more and more important. The report underlines the important role of European aquaculture in satisfying our needs and our demand. The growth in European aquaculture has proven to be insufficient. The Community legal framework is responsible, among other things, for development in the European Union coming to a near standstill since 2001, while the rest of the world has seen considerable growth. The Member States could evidently not be persuaded to model the national and Community legal framework in a way that would allow aquaculture in the EU to be developed in a dynamic way. Bureaucratic obstacles and a substantial administrative burden are the consequences of this legal framework. I therefore call on the Commission to adapt the directives relating to the designated Natura 2000 areas as soon as possible, in such a way as to enable sustainable aquaculture in these areas too, thereby making a positive contribution to their management. A total ban on aquaculture in these areas is unacceptable. There are always complaints about the excessive requirements involved in impact assessments for the establishment of new farms or for the expansion of existing farms. That should not be the case. Furthermore, we can see that the damage caused by the voracious cormorants in many areas is jeopardising the existence of traditional fish ponds. To ensure that this is not also the case in the aquaculture that is still to be developed, we need the European Cormorant Management Plan that we have been calling for for a long time to finally be adopted. My last point concerns aquaculturists in developing countries. These aquaculturists must be made more aware of a policy on quality and higher production standards – particularly as regards environmental protection, hygiene and social standards – in their production.

 Mandatory origin labelling of meat, poultry, dairy products, fresh fruit and vegetables and processed products made from one ingredient, which is called for in the report on the provision of food information to consumers, puts an unreasonable burden on food processing companies. For this reason, I have voted against the report. Food is produced across national borders within the European internal market. For example, in the dairy industry, milk from different countries is collected and processed. Separate labelling of the batches that are being processed from different countries is technically impossible. This will place bureaucratic obstacles in the path of European companies which are successful on the global market.

 Combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography is vitally important. We must use all our strength to combat the availability of child pornography in communications networks.

 In the vote on the Scottà report on agricultural product quality policy, Amendment 5 was accepted, which called for the mandatory labelling of the origin of foods made from only one ingredient.

For this reason, I have voted against this amendment. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when discussing quality logos and mandatory designations of origin for food, we must not forget that our political decisions need to be implementable in practice. I cannot see how Amendments 4 and 5 can be implemented in practice and I will therefore be rejecting them. Quality logos should, in principle, be viewed as beneficial if they are voluntary. They give producers and processors of goods the opportunity to be successful in niche markets. However, we need to take account of the fact that, through the market dominance of a few chain stores, many voluntary private logos are interpreted as quasi standards. This robs producers and processors of their entrepreneurial freedom and also narrows the choice for consumers. There is a similar situation with regard to the mandatory indication of the place of origin for agricultural products, such as milk. Implementing this requirement in agriculture and in the processing industry would scarcely be possible from a technical point of view. We need to be careful that good intentions do not descend into excessive bureaucracy. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is only one step on the long road to the reform of the common fisheries policy. I would like to thank the rapporteur for the report and our coordinator for doing such an efficient job. I am in favour of fundamental reform of the common fisheries policy. However, if we lack the courage to do this, it is important to me that we retain the principle of relative stability. Furthermore, I would like to mention specifically the major problem represented by the greedy cormorants and the management plan that Parliament has already called for. The fishing industry is of fundamental economic and cultural importance to our coastal regions. Therefore, achieving a balance between the economy and the environment is of great significance for me in the context of the forthcoming reform of the common fisheries policy.

According to the resolution of the European Parliament on the draft general budget for the financial year 2010, adopted on 17 December 2009, a vote was taken today on the amending budget for the European Parliament, following the revised calculations made by the Parliamentary administration. The FDP in the European Parliament abstained, because there was a paragraph in the package of amendments concerned that we could not reconcile with our convictions. The FDP had already expressed its opposition to an increase in the secretarial allowance to EUR 1 500 during the discussions in committee. It is out of the secretarial allowance that MEPs’ assistants are paid. The FDP considers that the argument that more money is needed due to the additional work that MEPs have to do with the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is unsound, as there is nothing in past experience to support this. Certainly, due to the Treaty of Lisbon, which has just come into force, Parliament will overall need extra capacity for legislative work, but with the introduction of the Assistants’ Statute from the beginning of the current parliamentary term, there is still no proof that MEPs actually need more assistants. For this reason, there are grounds for concern that further demands and supplementary increases, or an extension of office capacity, will follow. For this reason, the FDP in the European Parliament abstained. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

The German members of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe voted differently from the group as a whole on two points.

The idea here is precisely to find common forward-looking solutions at an EU level. FDP members supported Amendment 33 because it supports the important principle of relative stability, which is important for Germans. This concerns the basis for quota allocation.

 The German Free Democratic Party members of the European Parliament have abstained from voting on the Copenhagen resolution for the following reasons. The resolution contains statements about financing for climate protection measures in third countries without defining the specific criteria or purpose of the financing. We cannot justify this to taxpayers. In addition, we believe that blanket criticism of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) is wrong. The ICAO is the organisation which deals with aviation matters at an international level. Both the criticism and the statement about the alleged failure of ICAO negotiations are incorrect and inappropriate. The call for specific arrangements for a CO2

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a farmer, I see the tabled amendment of Articles 78 and 79 as a deviation by the Commission from its hitherto sound route through agricultural reform at the expense of efficient and forward-looking farms. It is dangerous to tamper, simply because of a desire to do something, so close to the final phasing out of the milk quota system, a system that has really been to the disadvantage of dairy farmers hitherto. It has also been left behind by developments on the ground, as the market is currently finally beginning to recover. I therefore reject this amendment. It is easy to see how the Commission is seeking to exploit Parliament’s call for urgent measures for its own ends. It is doing this by attempting, shortly before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, to ensure for itself permanent scope to act without Parliament’s consent through this amendment of Article 186. I therefore reject this amendment. However, I could live with Parliament granting the Commission scope to act for a limited period in cases of crisis. This ability would also be available to Parliament in future times of crisis, with very rapid effect, through Rule 142 of its Rules of Procedure. Britta Reimers  (ALDE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the world economic crisis has thrown the global market off balance. As milk producers we are suffering the effects of prices having hit an all-time low. We are hearing over and over again that the adopted milk quota regulations should be amended. As a dairy farmer myself, I can only warn you against doing this. The Commission’s intervention measures have also succeeded in preventing milk prices from falling even further and the market seems to be relaxing. However, I do not think that this intervention is really a good means of achieving this, because it will result in stocks piling up which could burden a recovering market later on. I therefore call on the Commission to explain how it is going to deal with this problem. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we all know, most people are frightened of sharks. However, sharks have populated the world’s oceans for centuries, and I believe that we should not try to imagine a world without them. In my view, we have spoken for every person in Europe by voting by such a large majority to prohibit shark finning today. Shark fin soup is a particular delicacy, and shark finning was therefore a common practice in the past as well. After finning, the sharks are dumped back in the sea. This is not only barbaric; it is also a massive waste of resources. The fins are the most valuable part of the shark because they are the ingredients for soup, which is a lucrative business, but this practice cannot be allowed to continue. With this large majority, we have sent a very clear message today that this practice cannot continue. In fact, a ban has been in place in Europe since 2003, but there were a great many exemptions. We can remove these exemptions if we specify that the sharks must be landed with their fins naturally attached to the body. That is the only way to put a stop to this barbaric practice.

Mr President, we have some very interesting reports on fisheries reform before the House today. I would like to comment on three of them. Firstly, as we all know, fishing is one of the oldest crafts practised by humankind. Even now, many forms of fishing are practised by small-scale and medium-sized operations and artisanal fishermen. We put SMEs at the heart of our policies in Europe and I think it is right that this report also focuses very strongly on their needs. That is my first comment. Secondly, with regard to the external dimension of the Common Fisheries Policy, fish is already an important source of protein in many countries; this applies particularly to developing countries and their populations. With a growing world population, it is important in future to ensure, to an even greater extent than before, that people who rely on local fish as a source of protein can actually catch fish off their own coasts and that only the surplus is available to European fishermen, for example, under fisheries agreements.  My final comment relates to shark finning. It is unacceptable, it is barbaric, and it should be banned. I think there is general agreement on that. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mr Torvalds has said that the common fisheries policy (CFP) as it currently stands is one of the EU’s greatest failures to date. I think he is right. He has also said that it is an economic, social and environmental catastrophe for our fisheries. The fishing industry is not just a means of producing or catching food. It is the oldest trade in the world and, of course, we want to preserve it for the future. Therefore, I would like to thank all the rapporteurs. I believe that we have taken an important step forwards today and I know how committed Ms Damanaki is in this area. For example, we need aquaculture as a response to overfishing. I am very interested in an integrated maritime policy which is all about maritime environmental planning. There are some interesting concepts in this area involving, for example, integrating aquaculture into offshore wind farms. This may be something for the future, but we must ensure that we can expand this sector in the most effective way possible. Finally, I would like to tell you about a small success story from Germany. The North Sea and Baltic fisheries policy has resulted in stocks of cod, herring and plaice gradually recovering. I hope that in future, all the fish stocks in Europe will also recover.

With regard to tackling product piracy and strengthening copyright, ACTA is something that I could support. Nevertheless, the fears and concerns of a section of the population, which feels its freedoms will be restricted by ACTA, must be taken into account.

 Mr President, it has already been pointed out that we do not have a single European railway area, although many people assume that we do. In fact, all our citizens probably assume that we do. We have a lack of tracks in some areas, we have different gauges, we have different technologies and we also do not have fair competition. There are some countries where it is very difficult for other competitors to enter the railway market. That is something that we must do something about. I would like to offer special thanks to Commissioner Kallas. He has grabbed the bull by the horns and set something in motion that has actually been due for 9 years, as we have noticed that the Member States are not implementing what we decided. I would like to thank Ms Serracchiani, who has really done us all a great service here. We now actually have a process in which we emphasise a strong regulator. We have always said that that is the most important thing. The second most important thing is the separation of networks and operators, which is something that we have to discuss and on which we await the Commission proposal before we can see how far it corresponds with the reality on the ground. It is very important that we should have within the package what has become known as ‘mini-unbundling’, in other words, more transparency with regard to funding streams. Mr Ertug just addressed this issue, which I believe is very important. We must do everything we can to obtain a truly complete single European railway area. Gesine Meissner,

 Mr President, with the digital tachograph, the truth is that we actually agreed on many points during the negotiations. I, too, would like to offer my sincere thanks to Ms Ţicău, who was very committed in her negotiations with us shadow rapporteurs. We also really are in agreement about major points – the fact that this is about adapting practically everything, the fact that a technological innovation facilitates an improvement in control checks, which also need to be tightened up, as well as greater requirements for transparency in relation to what can now be installed, what we can check. I am thus in agreement with much of what has been put forward. There is just one area with which I do not agree, and I would like to concentrate on that area now. I will start off in something of a general way. In the Europe 2020 strategy, we constantly stress the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises. There are many of these companies, and they create the jobs and the training places. In 2009, a proposal for cutting red tape specifically for these small and medium-sized enterprises was awarded a prize here. Under the proposal, there were to be options for derogations in respect of tachographs for the Member States, whereby a tradesperson who, for example, drives a 3.5-tonne vehicle himself/herself, requires no tachograph if he or she is located only 50 kilometres from his/her place of work. That should now be extended to 150 kilometres. This proposal was awarded a prize. There was actually a great deal of agreement here – albeit not with everyone – that it was a good thing to move in this direction, that this really would mean a cut in red tape. Now, though, the Commission has only proposed 100 kilometres, unfortunately. In committee, we initially amended that to 150 kilometres with a narrow majority. We had a majority for 150 kilometres, for exactly that proposal. That now hangs in the balance. We have now provided on a general basis that the rules should only apply once over the 100 kilometres line – and rightly so – but, at the same time, the weight limit is to be reduced to 2.8 tonnes. The current situation in Germany is that, while the regulations do specify 2.8-tonne vehicles, there are so many derogations provided that the likes of small-scale painters and electricians are not subject to the regulations at all. That would change under these proposals. Because of that, I believe that we must vote against Amendment 134 and in favour of Amendment 129, which I proposed. In that way, we will be moving in the direction of cutting red tape and really doing something for small and medium-sized enterprises. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr Grosch, we agree on a great many issues. You just said that we need common applicability. I absolutely do not agree with that. You also said, however, that it should apply to professional drivers and not to the other groups. It seems to me that that is already not the case at present. Let us take the example of a master roofer, as a non-professional driver, who drives his materials himself and has a 2.8-tonne vehicle. That is a light goods vehicle, and many people have those, and let us then imagine that he drives over 100 kilometres once every three years, namely 103 kilometres one way, and so actually has to fit a digital tachograph. Does that sound proportionate to you? Do you, moreover, believe that safety would be jeopardised if that were not the case? Gesine Meissner,

Mr President, we have already heard from many quarters that the Sahel region is a particular source of problems in Africa. The people there are living in inhuman conditions, which is something that we cannot simply accept. We need to do something to prevent this. The fact is that the people there are caught in a spiralling trap: they are facing drought, preventing them from keeping animals, they are coping with waves of refugees, terrorist attacks and unstable governments – in other words they are encountering a security problem of unimaginable magnitude. A number of EU citizens have been affected, falling victim to attack. This is not our sole concern, however, as we are particularly concerned with the plight of the people living in such enormous difficulties. We need to take action, particularly to protect women and girls, who are the victims of violence, and who are also denied education. This is truly a Herculean task for all policy areas in the EU, affecting development policy and security policy equally, as organised crime seems to be the most lucrative business in this area, as well as many other external policies. We need progress, which is why we have gathered today for this debate. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 I can offer a short answer to this. This is something we should really consider, because I believe that when we talk about human rights violations here we sometimes feel quite helpless; because many policies are moving in this direction and are proving inadequate, the question is: what additional steps can be taken? I think we should now take up this idea and discuss it between the groups. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr President, I believe that Ms Wikström has achieved a great deal in her report. It is obviously important to set up a central body which can find a solution in these cases and identify the correct location in the case of legal issues concerning the country responsible for resolving media conflicts of this kind. I believe that Ms Wikström has done a very good job. It is a pity that so few people have chosen to speak on this subject. Of course, there is a great deal of agreement in this area and so perhaps it is not necessary. This really is an important step forward that we are taking in Parliament and I am pleased about that. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, Commissioner Malmström, I very much respect your efforts to improve the agreement. Nonetheless, I believe that the agreement in its current form is not good enough. I could, in essence, continue from where the previous speaker left off. Of course when someone comes into your home, you will want to know who they are and what they want. However, you do not necessarily want to store data about them for long periods, also allowing others to access this information. Commissioner, you have stated, for example, that the data will be depersonalised after six months. That is correct. However, as you said yourself, this only occurs after six months. We need to take numerous concerns into account. It has also been stated that this data is gathered anyway. I do not see this as a reason to sign up to this agreement. There have been no complaints to date, according to Mr Voss. Likewise, I do not see this as a reason to sign up this agreement either. There is no need to rush. Negotiations with the US are not always a meeting of equals. I am aware of this from the EU-US air transport agreement. We agreed to this, despite its inequities, because it offered us economic benefits. In this case, however, I agree entirely with Ms Weber: it is better to have no law at all than a bad one.

 Mr President, chocolate and cocoa are something to be enjoyed not just by children, but also by adults. It is true that we are now in Strasbourg, but we are often in Brussels, where many people like to buy Belgian chocolate and to give it as a gift. Most of them do not think about where the cocoa comes from, under what conditions it is cultivated, and how the chocolate is manufactured. This debate has already made it clear that we must understand that the cocoa which we import has, in many cases, been produced using child labour. As Ms Köstinger has said, this is not just about finding out whether the children are there with or without their families and whether or not forced labour is involved. We must also be aware that the conditions under which these children work are damaging to their health. Cocoa is produced under conditions which are extremely harmful to health, including that of children. We need to stop this from happening. We must do everything we can to buy cocoa fairly from countries like Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire which are attempting to bring about better living conditions for their people. This has already been said on several occasions and, therefore, I think that introducing a quality mark would be the right approach to take. I am pleased that there is widespread agreement in Parliament on this subject. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
).

 Madam President, Ms Bauer said earlier that nothing has changed. We do talk about equality every year, that much is true. Many things are changing a little bit, though. I get the impression that there are more men in the Chamber for the debate this year than last time, and that is a very positive thing, in my opinion. I would like to offer my sincere thanks to Mr Gustafsson, the chair of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, who fights in a very committed fashion for women’s rights, and also to my Liberal colleague Mr Schmidt, who will be speaking later. We are, after all, talking about fairness, and men, too, can see that things are unfair and are critical of that fact, which I think is excellent. There is another thing that is different this year. Last week there was the Gender Pay Gap conference in Brussels, and one of the speakers there began her address in a very unusual way. She said that men are less well qualified, yet they receive more money and pay more tax. Women are better qualified, they have university degrees, yet they receive less money and they pass less tax. She went on to question whether maybe it was perhaps the wrong approach to subsidise places in higher education for women if they then go on to pay less tax. She meant this as a joke, of course. What she meant was the exact opposite, and that is also the way that it has to be seen. When 60% of qualified graduates are women, can we afford for so few women to have the opportunity to develop into good jobs? Can we afford that? The truth is that this is crazy. After all, what we are doing is throwing away economic opportunities galore. It has already been said that, with one third female membership of executive boards, the working atmosphere and the success of companies are demonstrably improved. That is the case for businesses, but of course it could also be the case for politics. I therefore wholeheartedly thank the rapporteur, as well as Ms Reding and all those who champion this cause. We need more fairness in this area. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

Madam President, last year, when I drew up the report on integrated maritime policy, the accident in the Gulf of Mexico had just happened. At that time, we were already considering what we could do in order to be able to intervene better in such cases and how we could also implement some form of preventive measures. At the time, we came up with the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA). I would therefore also like to offer my sincere thanks to Mr Fleckenstein for his excellent work. It really is important for us to look at what institutions we have and to consider how we can involve them further and in different ways. The sea is, in general, being used more, and, in future, it will be used significantly more still, because it also contains raw materials. It is important not only for shipping, but also for energy production. In this regard, however, it is important to consider how we can protect the sea. If we have an institution that is perfectly capable of doing this with additional powers, then we ought to instruct it to do so. It will obviously need funds for this, but that is why it was right for us to say to the Commission during the budget debate when it wanted to cut back on the funding for the agencies that that was not on. We already knew, with regard to EMSA in particular, that we would be giving it an additional task. This is therefore an excellent report. We ought to give Mr Fleckenstein the negotiating mandate soon. Gesine Meissner,

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Grosch, the work that has been done here is truly excellent. There were 413 amendments, and we genuinely all supported the majority of the 32 compromises. It shows that we all know that it is important to take as united an approach as possible with regard to the subject of transport. Of course, we have different ideas in the various groups about the details of individual matters, but by and large, we all said that transport is important. It really is the backbone of the internal market. It is a foundation of European policy that we say that we want free movement of people, goods and services. For this, we clearly need to make various improvements, which we will continue to do in subsequent reports. We can truly say that it has just become clear – and it is also clear in this report – that we need all modes of transport. Naturally, we want transport to be more efficient, more environmentally friendly and safer. That is something that we all need to take into consideration. However, in order to be able to continue to take the internal market forward, we really need all modes of transport, even if one area might produce higher emissions than another. That has become very clear in this case. There are essentially very few points on which we do not agree. One of them concerns road trains. This is currently very elegantly worded. I know that not all parties will agree, but in this regard, it is the case that we need a European modular system. In other words, we wanted an option to have a larger volume or perhaps also a bit more length and a bit more weight in the lorries. Not everyone thinks that is a good idea. However, in some areas of Europe, that has already been put into practice – and successfully. This system cannot be used everywhere. On behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I would like to refer to an amendment that we tabled after the vote. I think it is more correct, and should also meet with much approval, to say that it is not a question of us asking the Commission to submit something relating to the railway package describing the relationship between the network and operators, but rather that it should actually be about the separation of the network and operators, which we also addressed in the recast of the railway package. That is a correction, so I would imagine that everyone would be able to go along with it. Thank you once again. I look forward to tomorrow’s vote. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Madam President, Commissioner, I am pleased that we have been able to meet up again. I stood here one year ago in my capacity as rapporteur on the further development of an integrated maritime policy. We have now reached a position where we can actually anchor a fixed maritime policy in European policy making and where we will have the appropriate financial framework. This is the major advantage gained from Mr Koumoutsakos’s follow-up report. For me, integrated maritime policy is not just what you might call a truly major concern, but also an enormously important future task for the European Union. It has already been pointed out that more of the earth is covered by water than land: the ratio is about 30% land to 70% water. There is a great deal of added value to be gained from water. This includes marine transport – 95% of all transport involves the sea – as well as, of course, fishing, research or offshore energy sources. We have a very broad range of options open to us when it comes to using the sea as a resource. We have just one earth and one mass of water, which is why we need to husband it as prudently as possible. This is a major challenge that we face. In practical terms, 40% of the EU’s gross domestic product comes from the IMP, the integrated maritime policy. As I have already said, our major success this time round is that the IMP now has a fixed basis. Although we have not achieved the hoped for EUR 50 million, a figure I believed to be a certainty last year, we have received EUR 40 million, most of which will be spent on cross-border projects. After all, it is important that cooperation should be practised that embraces various countries. Naturally I must express my sincere thanks to Mr Koumoutsakos. We made a good team when negotiating in the trialogue, which has now closed. We achieved an awful lot because we stuck together so well. Thank you again. I wish us both well with the integrated maritime policy. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, we have just been discussing the integrated maritime policy and, of course, fishing also plays a role there. Since I have been dealing with this topic for some time, I am aware that fishing is usually the last policy to be decided. Fishermen naturally play an important role in our food supply, however. It is also important for small and medium-sized enterprises that they should be able to work in a secure area and that illegal fishing should be prevented as it makes their work and their position in the marketplace more difficult. What we have heard is quite true: this issue does not just affect cooperation with developing countries. It goes without saying that this is significant because these countries also import fish. It is also important for us, however, because we need to prevent illegal fishing. For this reason, I should like to pick up on one of the points Mr Milana and Ms Lövin raised. I know that not everyone equally favours the European coastguard service. However, I do believe that we need better cooperation on this front in Europe at least. This was already called for in a Parliamentary report on integrated maritime policy dating from 2008. I have brought this up repeatedly and the Commission also needs to table a proposal in this area. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Madam President, Mr Kallas, I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Serracchiani. This was a tough task for her, as this really is a difficult portfolio. As has already been mentioned, the first railway package was established 10 years ago, when all Member States agreed on how the railway market in Europe could be opened up. The crazy thing is that a review carried out in 2009 indicated that only four states had actually met the provisions contained in the package. Two countries do not count as they do not have a rail network. The remainder have failed to stick to their own resolutions. This is why we need to take action once again. It is evident that we need a comprehensive railway sector in Europe, both in the interests of the internal market and in the interests of our citizens. What we find is not just gaps in the rail lines and incompatible systems, but also legal and organisational hurdles. It is these hurdles that we have tried to eliminate here. The good news is that we now have a strong regulator at European and national level. This regulator must be independent and must also be able to take action quickly. A lot of people have said this. We have also noticed that although the separation of networks and operators may be the right solution, a lot of comparisons are required in order to establish the nature of this separation and to ensure that we have a consistent system throughout Europe. This is something that will need urgent attention next year. There is one thing that we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe disagree with – Mr Tremosa has already pointed it out and we have also asked for a separate vote on this issue – and that is Article 6(4). Mr Kuhn has already indicated that he wants transparency in relation to the financial flow. We do not want to see public monies being invested in areas other than infrastructure. This is not assured by the current wording, however. This is why we really do need to vote against the last section, as otherwise we shall have no transparency. This is not in the interest of progress in the rail market. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, as has already been stated here, China is a super power and for that reason is very important for the Member States of the European Union. I know that, when it comes to human rights violations in China, some people would say we should leave the Chinese in peace. They have a different culture and do not share our value system, hence we should not seek to impose our values on them. When, however, we find that people are voluntarily setting themselves on fire, when young people of 18 and 19 years of age who simply want to live according to their faith have no other choice than to take their own lives, then it is no longer possible to remain silent. The fact is that the representatives of the Dalai Lama are constantly calling on our support, placing their hope in the European Parliament, even though they know that even if we debate the issue here, nothing will happen and nothing will change for a long time. All we can do is repeatedly point out the injustices happening there and call on anyone who has contact with China to keep putting this issue on the agenda. After all, I believe one thing is quite clear: if everyone brings up this issue again and again, then China will be unable to ignore it and something must eventually happen. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, if Ms Rafah Nached is sentenced, then this really will be a sign of the despotism and brutality of the Syrian state, as well as its helplessness and paranoia, as a previous speaker has already said. After all, what does a state have to fear from a woman who is old and infirm and who is only doing her job by helping traumatised people? What is so dangerous about this? She has been accused of having a destabilising effect on the state. In this case, however, the government, the dictatorship, is completely at a loss and, in a completely misguided move, is attempting to make an example of her. As my colleague Mr Preda has already pointed out, we now find ourselves in the realms of the surreal. We all welcomed the Arab Spring and the democratisation of the region. Of course we Europeans are pleased to see such developments and are trying to support this movement, including though a variety of contacts. However, we must also protest when individuals are imprisoned without grounds. This is truly a violation of human rights, and we must not accept it. Gesine Meissner,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

Madam President, I am much obliged to the Commissioner for his presentation. Commissioner, you said that in this case, this proposal largely meets all Parliament’s demands. In my opinion, that is not the case, and also in my opinion, it is not the case either that all the privacy rights of passengers have been safeguarded. That is why we have just tabled an oral question on this. In fact, as Mr de Grandes Pascual stated, we had a report in which we discussed and set out what form scanners should take where these are permitted to be deployed as an additional security measure at airports. In this report, we also said that people must have a free choice as to whether or not they go through them. Health and human dignity must be protected; data and privacy must also be safeguarded. In fact, what has now been proposed is exactly what we did not want. We did not want to have scanners that show real images – whether or not these are blurred. I am familiar with these images; I have been to the US and have seen such scanners. I do not want something like that placed in Europe’s airports. These scanners do, in fact, allow quite a lot of a person’s body to be seen. To me it makes no difference whether or not the person looking at them is in another room and does not see the people in real life. It is a violation of privacy and intimacy, and we expressly discussed the fact that that is exactly what we do not want. Despite this, the Commission’s proposal now states that something along these lines is to be permitted in order to implement our decision. Naturally, we are upset about it. That is why we are asking you to reconsider. There is the option of having simple stick figures, as they are known – in other words, schematic illustrations; either a green OK or a stick figure with red dots – showing, for example, that an arm should be investigated because something suspicious is indicated there. That really is something that we would like, without images being stored. That would protect people’s privacy as well as protecting data. We are astonished, and we are not happy that something different is now being proposed. If the installation of something that is actually quite different is being considered, then we need a legislative process. We are talking about the citizens of Europe and that is why the representatives of these citizens need to be involved in a proper procedure. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, the honourable Member has said that he also wishes to protect privacy, but that he wants to avoid monopolies. Does he really believe – knowing the way the European market works – that if we want to have something on the market, such as a particular type of scanner, it will remain the case that only one company makes them? Does he not think that more companies would then start producing them simply in order to be able to compete for this market? Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
),

 The German Free Democratic Party delegation abstained from the final vote on the own-initiative report on European road safety 2011-2020. This non-legislative text contains a large number of recommendations for increasing safety on Europe’s roads. Naturally, we support this goal, as we also want to reduce the number of fatalities and injuries on the roads. Some measures are quite over the top, however; for example, the call for a general 30 km/h speed limit in built-up areas, the mandatory carrying of warning jackets for all vehicle occupants, or the use of rear-facing child seats for children under three years of age. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr President, I would like to respond directly to Ms Stassen, who is the only one so far to say that we do not actually need tourism in Europe. I believe that we do indeed need it, and, moreover, it will not undermine the competitiveness and autonomy of the individual Member States. It is indeed the case that Europe is currently the number one tourist destination in the world, and, naturally enough, we would like it to stay that way. We want it to stay that way with all the diversity that we have. The diversity that we have in Europe can be seen from the previous speeches. These alone have made it worthwhile to be part of this debate, because if anyone thinks that 10 days is sufficient in which to see Europe – thus, the Acropolis, the Tower of London, the Eiffel Tower and perhaps Neuschwanstein in Germany – he or she is mistaken. Europe offers much more and it has developed a great deal more in terms of tourism. I would now like to mention something in particular that we have in north Germany, where I come from. We have cycling tourism, we also have nature-oriented tourism, not only holidays on the farm, which certainly also awakens a real understanding of nature, but, for example, also tourism in very sensitive areas such as the Wadden Sea beside the North Sea. That is a globally unique area. There you can really see how, right next to main shipping routes, a very sensitive form of tourism can be developed that also awakens an understanding of the diversity of nature. This is something that we need more of. Something that has not had any, or very little, mention is the fact that we also have old mines and old industrial heritage sites, for example, that you can view and where you can learn a great deal about the history of Europe and the working environment. Thus, there is a very broad spectrum, and in that regard we ought to consider how we can bring this to the outside world and how we can maintain Europe as a very attractive tourist destination in future, too. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the White Paper, Commissioner Kallas sets out various possibilities for the future of transport. For instance, he describes how there is a need for incentive systems in order to give transport a more environmentally friendly form, and he also states that new sources of funding are needed, including, for example, in order to be able to work according to the ‘polluter pays’ principle. The Eurovignette Directive that we are debating today is one way that both of these points really can be achieved. This was a major Belgian effort, I believe we can say, begun under the Belgian Presidency of the Council with three important Belgians involved and, above all, because of the rapporteur, who succeeded in opening a door to the new routes. As it happens, I would have wished Belgium’s major effort greater success than what we now have. What we actually managed to achieve is a small and weak compromise. Although we do now have earmarking to a very limited extent – 15% of infrastructure costs and 15% of external costs must go to the TEN-T networks – it is really far too little. All national transport policy representatives say that we need considerable resources in order to be able to sustain our infrastructure networks. It is self-evident that the resources collected in this area should also be able to be invested there. That is a point on which we can all fail to be satisfied. The fact is that, in this connection, we have nonetheless taken a step in a direction in which we will be able to move further at a later date. That is also the reason why we intend to vote in favour of this compromise. It was a tough struggle, though. It very definitely could have been the case that we ended up with nothing at all on the table, since a few Member States would have preferred to have nothing at all. This is therefore a success, and it will have our backing in the vote today. (Applause) Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr President, I would first like to agree with Mr Verhofstadt. It is indeed shameful that these human rights debates, which are actually very important to us Europeans who believe in values, always take place on Thursday afternoons when most people have already left. I would like that noted in the record once more. It is something that we must change. Right now, however, we are talking about China and there we are more or less powerless, as has already been said. Mrs Lichtenberger spoke of a brick wall. Mr Posselt, I do not believe by the way that it is really in the Chinese interest – as you said – to help bring about a breakthrough in human rights. It is apparently not in the interest of the Chinese Government, although it is undoubtedly in the interest of the Chinese people. We are talking today about many people: Ai Weiwei and Liu Xiaobo have already been mentioned. We have frequently debated in the past how we can bring about a human rights breakthrough. It is not just a matter of instructing Baroness Ashton to speak out against the human rights abuses in China at every opportunity. All our foreign ministers and representatives must do so, and we need to stick together. I think that is the only way that we can actually have a small influence on China. Otherwise, as a strong economic power, China will play us off against each other and we will achieve nothing whatsoever. That would be a very bad thing, especially for the people concerned. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr President, I would first of all like to offer my sincere thanks to Mr Simpson. In the Committee on Transport and Tourism, we know that, if our Chair prepares a report, we will not actually have anything to say against it. He always takes a great number of things into account, and the only thing we can say is: excellent Brian, we can support that. In this case, it has been variously said that it is a technical report. That sounds so boring. I do not find it at all boring. Although it is technical, it describes tourism, which really is a very important economic objective for us in Europe. It has already been mentioned that 40% of people worldwide travel to Europe. Thus, Europe is an important region for tourism, and therefore it is, of course, vital to know why these people travel to Europe. If, with our new competence under the Treaty of Lisbon, we now want to develop a new European framework, we must be familiar with the data and also be able to exchange this data in a harmonised way. That is the purpose of this report, and it also shows the new developments, for example, in terms of same-day visits or bicycle tourism. We also want to include our industrial heritage. All of this must be included in future so that we will really know how to set our objectives. Therefore, thank you very much – it is a good report and I believe we are able to support it. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr President, it has been very clear in the debate that violence against women is not a trivial offence; it is quite clearly a violation of human rights. It has already been said that even children are sometimes indirect victims of violence against women. They can even be direct victims of violence against women, because the main cause of still births and miscarriages is certainly the effects of violence against women. It is not only a question of domestic violence; there is also forced prostitution, honour killings – where there can actually be no question of honour – human trafficking, genital mutilation and much more besides. The trigger for this report, for which I am very grateful to Mrs Svensson, was, in this case, not only the fact that it was noticed in the context of the report on equality that equality is also put at serious risk as a result of violence against women, but also the fact that, through the Treaty of Lisbon, we now have the opportunity to enact a directive and to establish a common legal framework in Europe. That is urgently needed for us to make significant progress here, because this is a cross-border European problem that we must combat. Gesine Meissner,

Madam President, firstly I too would like to thank the rapporteur. We have already discussed the fact that, following the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament now has the opportunity to vote in favour of air service agreements of this kind or to reject them. We cannot change the contents, but we can accept or oppose them. This does not always make things simple, but it is at least a new task, which we are taking very seriously. It makes sense to replace a number of different bilateral agreements with one standardised EU agreement. It is clear that there are no boundaries in airspace, which is a good way of explaining this. The European Union is also a strong economic community and so it is sensible to discuss agreements made by the EU with different third countries, which is what we are doing now. We have a number of very different agreements on the table today. I will start with Vietnam. This is the least complex agreement. It concerns different accesses and services and also safety regulations, but it is a relatively short agreement, which is why I am only mentioning it briefly. The most comprehensive agreement is the one with Canada. In this agreement it was not just a case of ensuring free access to air services which can be used in different ways, but also of covering issues such as the environment, safety and also market access and ownership. In that respect we have long since passed the first stage of 25% and already reached the second stage of 49% ownership of each other’s air services market. Now we are about to enter stages 3 and 4. In stage 3 it is possible to establish airlines in another country and another region. Stage 4 would allow a European airline to fly from A to B within Canada. We have not come nearly as far as this with the USA, despite the fact that we have been negotiating with the USA for a long time. I would like to make one more point. Mr Kallas said that we were all very much in support of this issue, but in the case of the USA our reaction is more restrained, because the agreement does not represent a true partnership. The USA wants to take more from us than it is prepared to give. We need to continue negotiating on this. Apart from this issue, we will vote in favour, because it is clear that progress has been made. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 In today’s vote on the text of the directive on consumer rights, some members of the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament abstained. The compromise adopted undoubtedly contains many improvements on the original draft from the European Commission. For example, we have succeeded in ensuring that small businesses are not affected by most of the new rules or burdened with additional bureaucracy. However, the text adopted today also contains rules that would heavily burden companies without increasing consumer protection. Article 5, for example, will mean that a company will have to provide very extensive pre-contractual information even when goods are purchased in store. This will hardly benefit consumers, as they can assess the product directly in the shop. Article 22a places companies under obligation, in the case of distance contracts, to supply their goods to customers in any Member State. Such an obligation contradicts the freedom of contract and exposes small and medium-sized enterprises in particular to considerable legal and financial risks. Furthermore, the FDP was unable to succeed in its core demand for the complete deletion of Chapters IV and V of the directive. The FDP calls for these provisions to be amended during the trilogue negotiations with the Council and Commission. Gesine Meissner,

 Mr President, we have just spoken about natural disasters in the previous agenda item. In this case, it was a force of nature that brought air traffic to a complete standstill. Eyjafjallajökull – everyone probably knows of this volcano now – erupted last year and brought a large proportion of air traffic to a complete standstill. Incidentally, I just noticed once again during the previous speech that we have an excellent chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, because what he said is very similar to what I wanted to say. I will now try to change my speech somewhat. It was indeed chaos – Mr Simpson has already said that. As Europeans, with high-tech capabilities and with so much already coordinated, we were, in fact, helpless when it came to dealing with this disaster and finding solutions to it. We realised that there were too few agreements in place. We then set up a task force. The questions that concerned us with regard to this issue were whether the task force actually has any valid results already that could be discussed and has it published any studies? I do not know of any at least. Have all of the international experts on such volcanic eruptions actually been consulted? After all, as we already discussed here in plenary last year, there are other parts of the world where volcanic eruptions are much more frequent than in Europe and they somehow manage to have up-to-date data and to coordinate the whole situation. There is also something else that causes me concern. On 4 May, it was also mentioned in the Council of transport ministers that we need a linked-up European transport system. That can, of course, help in such cases. How far have we come in terms of being able to respond better in the event of a further volcanic eruption? We cannot predict this, of course. It will just happen. I have one further question: do we know exactly what technology we would need to be able to deal with this situation better? In Germany, we now have appropriate devices at all weather stations that collect the data and are able to pass on this up-to-date data very quickly to the people responsible at the airlines and also to pilots so that they can decide whether or not it is safe to fly. One further point which has not been mentioned yet but which I think is important in this context is the following: this ash crisis, and the subsequent problems it posed for the air transport industry, affected 10 million passengers and, of course, also many companies. Some passengers were stranded and were unable to continue their journeys. The question therefore arises as to how things stand with regard to passengers’ rights. We have rights for air passengers, but I have the impression that, in this case, they have not always been fully utilised. Perhaps we should also revise these passenger rights once more. There are a lot of questions here. Mr Hahn, I do not know whether you will be able to answer them now, as transport is not actually your area. Otherwise, I am sure that the questions I raised in addition to the written question can be answered later. You will notice that this subject is of great concern to us. After all, the air transport industry is very important, and we therefore need a Single European Sky. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 In the vote on the Lange report, I am abstaining on paragraph 31 because of the ambiguous wording of the vote, which refers to Eurobonds as well as project bonds. However, taking it as a whole, I am voting for the report, as I have nothing against project bonds in themselves. Project bonds serve as finance for extensive innovation, infrastructure and reindustrialisation projects. This is not a question of instruments for the communitarisation of debts, as would be the case with Eurobonds. Gesine Meissner,

 Mr President, a long procedure has now come to an end, which is good news. There are some positive aspects to all of this. One is that the basic rights for people with disabilities include the right to information and the right to access. Another positive feature is that the damages paid by small and medium-sized businesses have been kept to a reasonable level, which was not originally the case. It is also good that we have reached an agreement, because otherwise, we would have been stuck in the conciliation procedure and there would have been no regulations at all covering one specific area of transport. However, I would also like to pick up on some negative points, as we have not been able to produce a genuine European solution. Although we say that the free movement of people, goods and services is a European principle, we have not reached a European solution in this area, if three countries are not included and other countries do not have bus routes of this length. The right of people with disabilities to be accompanied, which is something they often need in order to be able to travel, is only guaranteed over long distances. In addition, the clause on major natural disasters, which does not apply to air travel, because damages had to be paid in the case of the ash cloud, has been applied to buses and coaches. This means that poorer passengers in particular who are making short journeys will not be compensated and have no rights. That, of course, is not a good thing. Therefore, because of this mix of positive and negative features, we abstained from voting during the midnight session in the conciliation procedure and we will do the same today. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, I would like to explain why the majority of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has abstained from voting on this directive. It is good that we have made a decision and that the rights of people with disabilities are being respected. However, that is only the case over longer distances. Many of the other points are not worthy of a European directive. For example, because the directive only covers journeys over 250 kilometres, there are many countries where it does not apply. Cyprus, Malta and Luxembourg have no rights, in just the same way as some other Member States which do not have bus routes that are longer than 250 kilometres. The free movement of people, goods and services is one of Europe’s central principles. Now it is the poorer passengers who are not protected, because some Member States have no system of passengers’ rights. This is why we have abstained. There are some positive aspects, but also many negative aspects, and this is the reason for our abstention. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
),  
in writing.

 This regulation is a step in the right direction as it creates an EU set of rights for bus passengers. However, except for some basic rights, it applies to regular services equal to, or longer than, 250 km. Such a limited scope can hardly be a basis for truly European legislation in the interest of all bus passengers and ALDE cannot support such a deal. We also oppose the force majeure
 clause exempting carriers from the obligation to provide accommodation for passengers in case of cancellations or delays if these are caused by severe weather conditions or major natural disasters, as it can set a precedent for other EU passenger rights legislation. Even though this is not a triumph, it is an improvement, especially for travellers with disabilities and reduced mobility. We managed to ensure non-discriminatory access conditions, disability-related training for the staff of carriers and terminal authorities who deal directly with passengers and compensation for damage or loss of mobility equipment on all routes, regardless of distance. Keeping that in mind, and with a view to creating a harmonised EU set of rights for all passengers, we did not oppose the agreement and abstained in the final vote. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mrs Malmström, we definitely do not need walls to resolve the asylum problem. A proposal was made to erect a wall, which is why I have chosen to speak. Anyone who says something of this kind has completely failed to understand European values. For us, this is all about protecting fundamental rights and human rights. We cannot say about people who have fled from their country and sought asylum in Europe, for whatever reason, and about people who have voluntarily climbed into an overcrowded boat and put their lives at risk: ‘We want to send these people back before they have even arrived’. We need sensible asylum processes for these people which function properly. We cannot leave the southern European countries, where these people arrive, to cope with the problem alone. I agree completely with my colleague, Mrs Hirsch, on that point. From another perspective, it is wrong to say that we want all these people to stay outside Europe and we do not want to take them in. Demographic change is taking place in Europe and in future, we will need integration and also asylum seekers who want to stay here. This is not just an issue of humanity, but also of common sense. For this reason, we need to come up with solutions to this problem quickly. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
).

Madam President, I have now been in Parliament for a year and I have dealt with various dossiers, but none of them have been as difficult as what we have on the table here. At this point, I would like to offer my sincere thanks once again to Mrs Mathieu and Mr Cercas, the two rapporteurs from the relevant committees. This really is a very difficult matter, and the reason for this is that naturally we have very high ideals in Europe. We want to treat everyone who lives and works here fairly and equally. That, in principle, is something we can all agree on as a starting point. However, the question remains as to how much we can really implement this in detail. We have already been reminded that with the Treaty of Lisbon, we now wish to draw up a common policy on asylum and migration. Asylum policy is something close to our hearts, and not just because of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. We also need a migration policy for economic reasons, because demographic changes are taking place and we have a very urgent need not just for highly qualified workers, but also for less skilled workers. Basically, the great difficulty here is what to do. As has already been said – Mrs in ’t Veld mentioned it – the Member States stated back in 1990 in Tampere that they wanted to develop a common structure. Nothing has yet been placed on the table. In other words, what we have today is a compromise – we are not completely happy with it, but in my view, it is a way for us to move forward. Speaking personally, I can well understand why some are saying that we need more time for discussion. I am not completely happy with it either. It is particularly important to me, for example, that everyone should have access to training and further education, because this is absolutely crucial – not just for the persons concerned, so that they can work in the labour market, but also for us with our real need for workers. In the case of social security, for example, where we already have so many different systems anyway that have not even been harmonised within the EU, it raises the question of how we can really create a common set of rights for third country nationals in all cases even if we want to. It is difficult, and that is why I see the compromise that is currently on the table as a good thing. We really should vote in favour; then at least we will have something. Gesine Meissner,

 Mr President, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn, the arrival of a container full of trainers on an island somewhere, which was received enthusiastically by the residents, has in the past made headline news. In another case, a contingent of rubber ducks floated ashore. These are, of course, the pleasant examples of ships’ cargoes going missing, but the fact is that in many cases lost containers can cause serious damage. It has become clear that we must do something about this. The Dutch Government was concerned about this problem and set up an investigation to find out why it was happening. The investigation identified a number of causes. Although there are EU regulations which specify how cargoes should be secured and although all ships have the manual containing the regulations on board, only 46% of ships have their cargoes properly lashed down. This means that we do not need any new rules. You were right about that, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn. In many cases, the weight of the cargo has not been correctly balanced. Another reason is that many crews in the short sea shipping sector unlash cargoes before they have reached their destination to speed up the unloading process. Stacking errors can also be a cause of the problem, together with old or damaged equipment. All of this can, of course, have a major impact on the environment. Around 70% of items lost from ships at sea sink to the bottom, but this gives rise to the question of what damage they are causing on the sea bed. A total of 15% of the goods reach land. The remaining 15% float around in the ocean and obviously represent a major hazard for other ships, platforms and the environment. This means that when accidents happen at sea we must investigate the extent to which containers were involved. Then we need to speak to shipping companies and port operators to ensure that they comply with the regulations. In addition, regular inspections must be made. Two thousand containers really are too many and I think that carrying out feasibility studies would take too long. We must take immediate action, because the situation simply cannot go on as it is. Gesine Meissner,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn, ladies and gentlemen, I wish that the Chamber were full to bursting, not on my account or because this is my first report, but because of the subject matter, which is unfamiliar to many people, but nevertheless highly important. Hardly anyone has heard of integrated maritime policy, but it is a decisive subject for us all, because it really is true that our future lies in the sea. A total of 70% of the earth’s surface consists of water. Population levels are growing, not in Europe, but throughout the rest of the world and by 2050 they will have reached 9 billion. The earth is becoming too small and many experts have already discovered the significant potential of the oceans. Our objective must now be to keep the resources of the seas safe for future generations by means of the integrated maritime policy. So far only 10% of the oceans and their resources have been explored, but we already have 50 000 products which come from the sea. Efforts are now being made to produce energy from the sea and to extract raw materials for medicines, cosmetics and industry. While we are developing our overall maritime policy, it is important to ensure that the sea does not strike back, as it did in a sensational novel by bestselling author Frank Schätzing. We have the opportunity to turn the maritime economy into the largest area of growth in our economy as a whole. For this reason, people are talking today not only about green jobs, but also about blue jobs and blue growth. The coastline of the EU is 23 000 kilometres in length and one third of the population lives by the sea. Green shipping and offshore energy are areas where Europe has extensive expertise which can be developed further. For this reason, we need an integrated approach so that we can achieve all of these objectives with great care. Which individual areas are covered by integrated maritime policy? The first of these areas is transport. Shipping can be described as the powerhouse of European transport, because 95% of global trade and 40% of internal European trade travels by sea, via ports with hinterland connections and logistics. Further growth is being forecast and therefore we must ensure in particular that we can reduce emissions by developing greener ships. The next area is shipbuilding. We have a great deal of expertise in this field, as I have already mentioned. We must make sure that we use this expertise productively to secure existing jobs and create new ones. Of course, maritime policy also includes fisheries and aquaculture. Fish are not just a source of food. In addition, aquaculture is the area of agriculture and fisheries which is showing the highest levels of growth. It is important for us to be aware of this. In the field of energy there is a great deal happening on and around the sea. We have oil and gas pipelines, oil platforms and offshore wind farms and there are already plans to fit tankers with sails so that they can cut their energy consumption by 20% by using wind energy. Wave power is an area with future potential and microalgae, which can be used as biomass, represent an almost unlimited source of energy. In the area of research there is a focus on using blue biotechnology to develop medicines. We already have painkillers and anti-malaria drugs and work is currently underway on cancer medicines. Protecting our coasts is an important issue which is also covered by integrated maritime policy. Our coasts are threatened by storm tides and we need to protect them, not only against the tides, but also against oil, piracy and smuggling. In addition, we must deal with the problem of asylum seekers in Italy. Finally our coasts are also, of course, very popular tourist destinations and we are working on developing a sustainable tourism concept for the coastline. You can see that there are many individual areas involved here, all of which are related to water. The objective of the integrated maritime policy is to develop these areas carefully and in harmony by working together. Many people are not aware of this, but it is hugely important. The European Union has already achieved a great deal in this respect, but it needs to do even more. For this reason, I have focused in this report not so much on the individual areas, but primarily on what has happened in the last few years since the 2007 Blue Paper was published, what still needs to be developed and what has to be continued. These are the areas which I will mention again briefly in my conclusion. Gesine Meissner,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I think it is good that you have been counting, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn. I did not know how many speeches had been made, but 37 really is a lot. I would like to thank everyone who has taken part in the debate today. Right at the beginning, I also forgot to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their work. We really have worked together very constructively and I enjoyed it very much. I have covered a lot of subjects in the report, because it is very important to me to have a convincing majority in this crucial area. Many of the speeches on different subjects have highlighted the fact that we need joint action on research, planning, implementation and control of maritime activities by means of joint governance, spatial planning and monitoring. This is what the report is all about. However, it is a very varied subject. I should now like to discuss a few of the speeches. Mr Fleckenstein raised the problem of the sulphur emissions. We have included it in the report because it was important to us that there is no distortion of competition, but we also need to make sure that shipping is more environmentally friendly. However, what you said about shipbuilding, Mr Fleckenstein, is not quite true. It is not the case that the Liberals and the Conservatives did not want to include this. It was simply a question of how we should implement it, of whether we should create a new fund at a European level for refitting old ships or whether we should put in place a strategy. That is the current wording. The subject of my amendment was also raised, which I introduced in order to include emissions trading in the report. In the committee it was rejected by a very small margin, but in my opinion we are all convinced that we must continue to follow this route. For this reason, I am hoping for support in these areas. Mr Kohlíček, you said that it was difficult to link all the areas together, but I know that this is possible. A group of stakeholders and business people from all the different maritime areas meets twice a year to share ideas. These are prominent players at a European level and they all very much value the opportunity to come together. My last point concerns the reference to the fact that there are so many different regions. I have included the position of islands in the report and it is not true that this has been omitted. The only area not covered by the strategies is the North Sea. I live closest to the North Sea and, therefore, I wanted to mention that when we talk about the Black Sea, the Mediterranean and the Danube, we should not forget the North Sea. Finally I would like to express my thanks, in particular for the remark that we should take moral responsibility for the sea and for future generations. This is why I have chosen the title ‘We need a new awareness of the sea’. If we continue to work on this, we will be able to achieve a great deal. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking today about the working conditions of women, which we want to improve in Europe. I will specifically address the Thomsen report, for which I was shadow rapporteur; in other words, the subject of ‘precarious women workers’. This year is the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion. It is an established fact that poverty disproportionately affects women. Naturally, we cannot, on any account, allow this to remain the case. Poverty among women may be the result of various things. It may result from the fact that women are not paid as well as men. Naturally, that is not the only cause. Women also take more career breaks, for example, when they have children and take time off to bring them up. Women also perform the lower skilled jobs. Things are particularly serious in the case of women whose employment conditions are precarious, because in some cases, they may not even have an employment contract or may have irregular employment contracts; they may have no protection whatsoever and they may have little access to information. The situation is particularly bad for women with a background of migration. This can lead to the poverty continuing, so that they also end up poor in old age. We need to break out of this spiral, which affects women more than men. One of the ways this can be done is through education and training. Every woman – every girl – needs to get a qualification, whatever their background, and they need access to a profession which will genuinely secure them a proper living. Lifelong learning must generally be possible for women too. We also need to ensure that we have more women and girls going into the better paid professions. These are frequently the professions that are more heavily dominated by men. In other words, access to education in any event, and access to social security systems – that way, we can achieve many improvements for women. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
).

 Mr President, Commissioner, you have stated that human rights are core values in the European Union. Last December, we proudly signed off on the Treaty of Lisbon and the legally binding Convention on Human Rights associated with it. What you have said is absolutely correct and of vital importance: we must defend these human rights at every turn and we must also allow these principles to guide our trade activities. As you have pointed out, this is a difficult matter. However, as has already been stated, a list of camps producing laogai products already exists. I have a book here with all the relevant information. It shows which prison manufactures which products and under which trade name. Hence, it is possible to research this issue. That is why, for example, the Laogai Research Foundation, which is active both internationally and within Europe – I say this for the benefit of President Müller, who is with us here today – has written to Commissioner De Gucht to ask him to enable the UN Special Envoy to visit the camps of his choice and to examine the question of whether it is possible to halt tariff preferences for such products on a temporary basis, following the example of the US, which is somewhat more courageous on this issue than we are. I would like to know what progress has been made with the Commission’s promised investigation into this issue? (Applause) Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
).

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by addressing a matter that our shadow rapporteur, Mr Kacin, was unable to mention due to a lack of time, but which he nevertheless feels is very important. It is imperative, in this connection, not only to investigate the causes of accidents but also to protect victims and their families. My group, in particular, has spoken out very strongly in favour of information regarding the circumstances of accidents being provided quickly, at least to the relatives, and in favour of this information also being provided in the case of same-sex partnerships. In general, we have already noted that the report drawn up by the rapporteur is indeed a groundbreaking one. We cannot praise it enough. The fact of the matter is that the previous directive is 16 years old. Many technical developments have been made in the meantime and we need better aviation safety. In order to be able to investigate accidents, we need information that can be independently assessed. The United States has had an independent investigation agency of this kind for a long time, as well as the guarantee of protection if someone gives evidence that could later be used against that person as a party involved. We have now achieved this. I would like to thank Mrs De Veyrac most sincerely for her excellent work. Gesine Meissner,

 Mr President, we live in a Europe where we want people to be able to live together happily and to have access to all areas of life that are important to them. As you know very well, we are experiencing demographic change in Europe. In future, there will be fewer people living in many areas than there are now. Nevertheless, we want all citizens to be provided with the services that they require and that they need in order to be able to have their say. This includes – very importantly – the postal service, which is to be guaranteed by means of a universal service. Firstly, there is the question of how we can ensure the provision of the service in remote rural areas with little money in the coffer, and at affordable prices. We also need people to deliver this post who are paid a reasonable wage for doing so. That is not a simple task for the Member States. However, we have decided that that is what we want and you, Commissioner, have indicated that a large majority of the Member States have also agreed to it. We now also need to make it possible for users to complain. I can see a problem with this. It has not yet been mentioned. However, the directive states that if something goes wrong, citizens should have a body they can complain to. It is not so easy, either, to maintain the appropriate infrastructure in this regard, particularly where there are not many people. Commissioner Barnier, you said that you are still new to this office and that you will at least take everything into account. I believe you. However, you have to understand that we are extremely sceptical, particularly in the Committee on Transport and Tourism. Mr Simpson said that the same thing happened in the case of the railway package – the previous Commission was responsible for monitoring its implementation – practically nothing was implemented and nothing happened. In other areas, too, things have not always proceeded in the way we would have liked them to. I know that, because I was also previously in politics in Germany. Decisions are made which are extremely good and which everyone is agreed on, and then no one thinks to check to see whether it is implemented and whether it is implemented quickly in the interests of the people of Europe and in the interests of workers. That is what we want from you. Therefore, show us that we can trust you. We will be very pleased if that turns out to be justified. Gesine Meissner,

 Mr President, as a previous speaker rightly said, it is important that passengers’ rights are protected in Europe, regardless of what mode of transport they are using. It is simply a logical conclusion for us to move from air and rail transport to passengers’ rights on ships, buses and coaches. Yet another speaker has already mentioned the fact that we have unfortunately not succeeded in dealing with both subjects as a package, as we had originally planned. Although we were able to reach a compromise on the rights of passengers on ships and complete the trialogue, this was sadly not the case with bus and coach transport. I would like to look specifically at the rights of bus and coach passengers, because I am also the shadow rapporteur in this area. I very much regret that we have not managed to achieve a compromise, because in the trialogue meeting, we were able to bring the position of the Council, on the one hand, and the positions of the European Parliament and the Commission, on the other, much closer together. We were concerned – and this is also very important – about protecting passengers’ rights; above all, we wanted to ensure that people with restricted mobility and with disabilities can always make use of transport, including buses and coaches. A range of measures are needed to make this possible and this is what we have been calling for. I believe that this is particularly important because in future, there will be more people with disabilities and restricted mobility, simply as a result of the ageing population. This is a very important point. Of course, we must also take into account the fact that consumers’ rights involve having an offering available. In particular, those small and medium-sized companies which provide coach trips are not able to do everything. For example, they cannot provide unlimited compensation. There is also the question of how they will cope with advance payments. We managed to bring our positions closer together in this area and this is why I regret the fact that we have been unable to reach an overall compromise. As the rapporteur said, it is important that we consider both passengers’ rights and the options open to transport providers. I would very much like to see some sort of agreement reached during the forthcoming mediation process, because I agree absolutely with Mr Simpson when he says that the exclusion of buses and coaches is unacceptable, given that other means of transport are covered by the regulation.

 Mr President, I believe that Mr Koch is right when he says that intelligent transport systems will take us into a new era. In the last year, I have come across lorries that can talk to one another. It sounds crazy, but this really is the intelligent transport management system of the future. Special devices enable lorries to identify for safety reasons whether there is an obstacle or a pedestrian crossing the road in front of them. They can then pass the information to the lorry travelling behind, so that it can brake in good time and prevent an accident from occurring. Of course, this is not yet on the agenda. In this case, the major benefit of Mrs Jensen’s report is that it gives us an overview of the current situation and an insight into what we will need in future in order to improve safety, prevent congestion, reduce accidents and take more effective action on the environment. My final point concerns something which I have experienced myself near Hanover in Germany. On the motorway, there is an intelligent transport system consisting of variable speed limits. These tell drivers what speed they should travel at in order to prevent traffic jams. This is good for drivers and for the environment and also reduces the number of accidents. We need systems of this kind and much more. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
).

 Mr President, Mr Kallas referred to a European maritime transport space without barriers. I believe that this is something that we all want. We also need it urgently and this report is another step in the right direction. It is a fact that 95% of our exports and 40% of intra-European goods are transported by sea and therefore pass through ports. For this reason, it is clearly absolutely essential for administrative procedures to be simplified and harmonised within this growth area. This report will meet both these objectives, which is why it cannot be praised highly enough. I regret the fact that Mr Sterckx was not able to achieve everything. Two points which were very close to his heart and which many other Members supported, as we have heard, are the simplification of the pilot licensing system, because this would be a really sensible, practical solution, and the lack of a common language. I believe that English really is the right language. It is unacceptable for accidents to happen in which people can even lose their lives simply because many seafarers speak different languages. It would be much better to introduce a common language in this very environmentally friendly area of transport, in just the same way as in the air transport industry. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, this has really been an afternoon devoted to transport and this is the report which basically summarises everything. Many people say that the greatest achievement made on behalf of the citizens of Europe is the internal market. As Mr Kallas has said, the transport routes are the arteries of the internal market. Therefore, it is, of course, important to ensure that these transport routes are safe, that they are developed in an environmentally friendly way, and that we take a general look at what can be improved in future using intelligent transport systems, for example. We must think about how we can structure the more environmentally friendly areas, such as rail and sea transport, in a more effective way, how we can move more transport away from the roads and into these areas, and how we can reduce the environmental impact of the emissions from sea transport. At the same time, we must also consider how to meet the specific needs of urban transport, which are very different from those of international transport. The future of urban transport may lie with managers who travel on e-bikes that also provide them with exercise. Of course, we need quite different options over longer distances, which would also fulfil a cross-border function. This is a good and very forward-looking report. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE

 Providing consumers with information about food is undoubtedly important. However, the debate in Brussels has become a lobbying battle between large companies from the food industry and consumer protection organisations. There was no place in this debate for the reality of everyday life for consumers. The representatives of the German Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament are in favour of a minimum of labelling. Consumers should be able to make their purchasing decisions on the basis of transparent, legible information. Colour coded labelling influences consumers and does not form the basis for transparent information. The so-called guideline daily amounts (GDAs) also have their weak points. Instead of having neutral information about the amounts of nutrients per 100 grams or millilitres printed legibly on packaging, Parliament discussed whether the daily requirements of a 40-year-old woman could be used as the point of reference or whether the colour coding of nutrients was a useful decision-making tool. The proposed, far-reaching, mandatory requirements for the origin labelling of ingredients cannot be implemented in practice. We have also rejected the idea of special national provisions, because the labelling system should, as far as possible, be standardised. For these reasons, we were not able to vote in favour of the proposed report. Gesine Meissner,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, Mrs Georgieva, you have presented this existing agreement and have said that there has been significant progress. We in Parliament take a less generous approach than you, as you have already heard. It is important that this agreement is in place, because the EU and the USA together account for about 60% of global air traffic and the USA is an important partner of ours in general terms. The problem is simply that, in a partnership, the conditions for both partners should be roughly the same. However, it is not possible to say that the conditions are the same when the USA has a 49% share of our market and we are only allowed about a 25% share of theirs. It is clear that this represents an imbalance. A small delegation went to the USA and took part in negotiations in the spring of this year. The Americans said to us that, if we wanted greater market access, we would have to lift the limitations on night flights and change the noise restrictions. We explained that for us, this is a question of subsidiarity which has to be respected. Basically, we can only negotiate on other issues if we have a reasonably level playing field. Four points were mentioned. The environment: we can make some joint progress via the emissions trading system, simply because we have such a large share of the world market. Social standards: something has been achieved in this area and passengers’ rights were also mentioned. Competition: this still leaves something to be desired. As far as security is concerned, I would now like to talk about data. The American concept of data protection and privacy is different from ours. We understandably want our concept of privacy to be respected. We looked at the body scanners while we were in the USA. There, it is normal for the scanners to show an image of the entire body, with only the face being concealed. This was completely inconceivable to us. We want privacy and data to be protected in every case. This has to be respected. We in Parliament, with our new powers from the Treaty of Lisbon, will be happy to discuss this with you.

 Mr President, Mrs Georgieva, you have now moved from air travel to rail travel, which is our second subject this evening. I must say that it is often the case in politics that fine words are followed by actions that leave a lot to be desired and that is what has happened here. In the European Union, we have a lot of excellent objectives. We have already achieved some of them, but others we are far from fulfilling. There is still a great deal to be done with regard to the internal transport market and rail transport in particular. We had good intentions, but we have to ask ourselves whether the European Union is a paper tiger. Or perhaps we do not have the wherewithal to get to where we want to go? In the past, competition on the rail market has been very varied. We need an independent regulatory body. This has functioned quite well for the rail system in Germany, but that does not mean that there is no room for improvement. We really need the option of dividing up the lines independently, so that everything runs smoothly and there can be real competition. That is one of the points that I wanted to make. It is, of course, embarrassing for us that, out of the 27 Member States, only the United Kingdom, Finland and the Netherlands have implemented the directive. The two Member States which have no railway system – Malta and Cyprus – were obviously unable to do so. All the others have not done their homework and have obviously got away with it, because we have not reprimanded them. Therefore, it is important for the European Union to put in place appropriate sanction mechanisms, otherwise we will not be taken seriously. It is also important to make it clear to the Member States that everyone will benefit from this. In principle, everyone wants the rail market to be opened up to competition. That is what everyone says. However, when it comes to taking action, nothing much happens. We must make progress on the finances. It finally became clear in Saragossa recently that there is a general lack of funding available. It could be our job to subsidise cross-border projects and we must, of course, call on the Member States to do more. We know that the situation is difficult everywhere at the moment, but this is what Europe needs. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, we have heard a great deal already. It is true, as Mrs Figueiredo said, that this is a directive that was intended to be aimed at employees. That is correct. However, there are also self-employed people who are not classed as employees. It is important for people in Europe to be able to decide how they want to work – whether as an employee or as a self-employed worker. That is only right. Naturally, the self-employed also have to play by certain rules. Digital tachographs are already present in all heavy goods vehicles and the equivalent vehicles that we are talking about here. If we were now to include self-employed workers in this directive, it would unduly restrict their freedom of choice. That is why my group is in favour of excluding the self-employed from this directive at all costs. We consider Mrs Bauer’s proposal, and the proposal from the Commission, to be right. That should be taken into account. We want to protect small and medium-sized businesses, and in this case, we can do so by adopting the proposal. Gesine Meissner  (ALDE
).

 Madam President, Commissioner, we are in complete agreement about the need for an internal market in rail freight transport as well. This is very important. We have had this on paper for a long time, but unfortunately we do not yet have it in practice. If we still have a few differences of opinion, that is due to the fact that we have different experiences in the various Member States in terms of the functioning or non-functioning of the rail network. I come from Germany, where it would be terrible if freight transport took priority over passenger transport. That would have a very negative effect on local public passenger transport. At the same time, we are very well aware that we need a continuous system in Europe. This is something that we want as well as need. There is just the question of how it will be implemented, how many corridors it will have and then, of course, also who will now lay down the one-stop shop rules, who will allocate the train paths. There are completely different opinions on this. Some people think that we would create a parallel system if we had a one-stop shop per corridor and not functional national one-stop shops, which should perhaps be included. That is the only source of dissent that we have. Otherwise, we all agree that we need this freight transport in Europe. Gesine Meissner,

 Madam President, Commissioner, we have already held a debate about the ash cloud and the associated problems for aviation in the immediate aftermath of the volcanic eruption. We observed various things in this crisis. We observed, for one thing, that aviation really is essential for the transport sector, as it is not only passengers that get stranded, but goods, too, can be left untransported. In Germany, for example, BMW had some production bottlenecks due to not receiving deliveries. We observed that we need every mode of transport, including aviation. For another thing, we observed that it is a significant crisis for the airlines if it is not possible to fly for several days. A five-day break, the airlines said, could be coped with. A 20-day break, however, could perhaps have caused a collapse of the entire industry lasting quite some time. We need not talk about compensation just yet, the airlines themselves said, but if it had lasted longer, that would have been necessary. Passenger rights have been subject to varying comments from different speakers. They have now put to the test the rule that, in such extraordinary cases, too, everything can be done for passengers in relation to information, compensation and recompense to the extent that they need it and in the way we originally laid it down here. There are still two subjects in particular that I would like to go into. The first is the Single European Sky. We do not have a single European airspace, and that is something that was painfully absent this time, too. A single European airspace clearly would not have prevented the volcanic eruption, we all know that, but we would certainly have been better able to bring about the smooth evacuation of passengers. We have appointed a Functional Airspace Blocks (FAB) coordinator, of course. He is now starting work, and we all very much hope that his work will relatively soon be able to lead to a single European airspace. The question is also how long will it take until we actually achieve this? Perhaps you are not in a position to answer that precisely. We have also discussed before whether better European coordination of the railway sector – something that we have long been wanting and, on paper, have long had – could have helped passengers to get home more quickly. In this regard, too, we observed quite clearly where our difficulties lie. I will now move on to my final question. Do we have good crisis management arrangements for cases like this? We have the institute in London, which is actually there to provide information when there are earthquakes. It also deals with volcanic eruptions as a secondary responsibility. Now it has been producing computer projections based on second-hand data, and it has been criticised for that. What can we learn from other parts of the world where volcano eruptions are more common, such as the United States, Indonesia and others? What other measurements do they take? According to my information, they are better prepared for such situations. Perhaps we had not planned for this in Europe, but we do then have to learn the resultant lessons. We are a hi-tech location, we have a lot of opportunities, and researchers in Germany, for example, have called for a specialised monitoring network for those aerosols, those minuscule items, that volcanic ash contains. What else do you think that we can do? How can we improve our technologies in the interests of aviation, the people and goods? Jürgen Creutzmann,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European single market, Europe’s greatest achievement, is celebrating its 20th anniversary. Border-free travel, work and study, a huge market for businesses and consumers: the single market gives us more freedoms and is a driver of trade and productivity. However, the benefit that the European Union derives from the single market could be doubled if further barriers to trade – especially in the service sector – were to be removed by promoting the digital single market and integrating infrastructure. If we examine infrastructure in the single market, two things become clear. Firstly, it is fragmented: few countries place a priority on cross-border links. Let us take the example of rail traffic: a goods train travelling from Italy to Sweden has to change its locomotive and crew up to four times. Secondly, the integration of national systems is extremely costly. Physical and regulatory hurdles must be overcome. The Commission’s proposals currently being discussed for trans-European transport, energy and telecommunications networks address these and other problems. However, these ambitious aims can only be achieved if enough money is made available. Investments in infrastructure are the best use of EU funds, because they encourage sustainable growth, employment and European competitiveness. This is why it is so important that the Member States, as part of the ongoing negotiations over the multiannual financial framework, do not make any cuts in the Connecting Europe Facility. SMEs must also benefit more from the European single market. Ninety-nine per cent of European enterprises are SMEs, but only 25 % export within the single market. The further completion of the single market holds no dangers for Member States. On the contrary, it is an opportunity for more growth, more jobs and thereby more prosperity for people in Europe. Jürgen Creutzmann,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in many political areas we already speak with a single European voice at international level. Unfortunately, this is not true with regard to external energy policy. It is regrettable that the Commission’s proposal and the ambitious position of Parliament were rejected by the Member States. In formal terms the Council may be right in claiming that the European Union does not have executive powers. However, it must be clear to all of us that we must all pull together in the energy sector if we are to meet the challenges of security of supply and affordable energy in the long term. As globalisation progresses and various actors in the energy markets flex their muscles, even the large Member States must realise that in the long run we can only succeed by acting in concert. This is even more the case for the smaller Member States. We knew from the start that our parliamentary position was very ambitious. We had to expect resistance. However, it gives one pause to realise that the Council saw no room for negotiations. Having weighed up all the options, we can agree to the results of the negotiations. After all, we have the opportunity to agree at least a legal framework, a basis on which we can build in a few years’ time. I believe that this is better than a failed legislative text that would have forced us to start again from scratch next time around. For this reason, we will vote against the amendments tabled by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament. I would like to express my sincere thanks again to the rapporteurs for their commitment and for their efforts to support the Commission in this. Jürgen Creutzmann,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the protection of intellectual property rights is of life and death importance to the European economy. Increasingly frequent infringements of rights and the constantly increasing trade in rights-infringing products threaten the growth of our economy and, with it, also jobs. Counterfeit products damage not only the industry affected, but can also represent a serious threat to the health and safety of consumers. This is often forgotten when this matter is discussed. The customs authorities at the EU’s external borders are in a comparatively favourable position to retain rights-infringing products before they reach the internal market. That is why it is so important that this regulation should be adapted to meet the new challenges of our times. The Commission has recognised the need for action and produced a sound proposal last year in which it extended the scope of the regulation, increased legal certainty for transiting goods, and put forward a special procedure for small consignments in view of the burgeoning online trade in counterfeit products. In my view, however, there is still considerable potential to further improve the conditions for the affected actors. I am referring, in this regard in particular, to the customs authorities, rights holders and consumers. With my report, I pursued four goals; namely, increasing protection for consumers, relieving the burden on customs authorities, strengthening the position of rights holders and observing data protection. With regard to the first objective, in contrast to the oft-cited view, the enforcement of intellectual property rights is in the interests of consumers more than anyone. This is because counterfeit products generally do not meet the statutory requirements and are generally not subject to any quality control. As a result, these products often endanger the health and safety of consumers. During our committee’s consultation, we were shown horrific pictures of consumers seriously disfigured after using counterfeit toiletries. It is not going too far to say that counterfeit products can even put people’s lives at risk. By way of example, one German carmaker brought to my attention the deadly risk that counterfeit braking systems entail. With regard to the second objective, the customs authorities can only effectively enforce the various intellectual property rights if they can quickly and efficiently instigate proceedings. We therefore put forward a series of proposals in order to ease the work of the customs authorities. In principle, a procedure to destroy the goods and launch proceedings that is as standardised and simplified as possible should be used for all cases of infringed rights. The procedure proposed by our committee makes it possible to destroy products without a court having to determine an infringement of rights, provided that the rights holder confirms the infringement and – a very important detail – that neither the party reporting the infringement nor the holder of the goods objects. This ensures the protection of rights and a procedure in accordance with the rule of law. Moreover, the special procedure for small consignments makes it easier to destroy goods, as the customs authority no longer needs to contact the rights holder in each individual case. This is of benefit both to the customs authorities and the rights holders. The conditions for information exchange between customs authorities in the Union and the competent authorities in third countries should also be improved. That will make it possible to prevent the production and sale of counterfeit goods closer to the source. With regard to the third objective, with the new regulation, we are also aiming to strengthen the rights of the holders of intellectual property rights. It is they, after all, who generate significant growth and jobs in Europe through their innovations. If we Europeans want to continue to be competitive, we need to promote innovation by effectively enforcing intellectual property rights. We have a series of proposals to that end: a) Rights holders are to be given better access to information about goods seized.
 b) They may also use this information to determine the identity of the rights holder, both in connection with criminal proceedings and out-of-court settlements. c) The biggest improvement is to be found in the reversal of the burden of proof in the case of transiting goods. I will go into that again later in my summing up. Jürgen Creutzmann,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I am still a little shocked by this debate. Mr Engström, it goes without saying that the customs authorities will not become the arbiters of patents, as the Commissioner has stressed once again. Similarly, I do not understand the concerns of social democratic Members. I believe that their worry is completely unfounded as, when it comes to generic products, for the first time, the text states quite specifically that the customs authorities may not obstruct the free trade of medicines and, in particular, generic products. We further reinforced this basic principle in our report. I also thought it important – and there were some points to debate in this regard – to ensure the rule of law. This is, after all, a highly important criterion, in other words, that those whose rights are infringed can also take legal action against customs decisions. On another note, I have been pleased to see that the Council has adopted many of our amendments in its compromise text, for example, Commissioner, when it comes to the delegated acts for small consignments. We proposed two kilogrammes and three items, from which the Council has made three kilogrammes and five items, so we will certainly reach a positive result in this regard. I hope that plenary will back this report with a large majority tomorrow so that we can immediately enter into negotiations with the Council, and that, as the Commissioner said in his speech, at the end of the year, a regulation will then enter into force that offers benefits all round, which is to say, to consumers, data protection, businesses – that has been stressed once again in the speeches we have heard – but also the customs authorities. Our contribution was reducing the red tape for the customs authorities in order to help them to be able to resolve cases. I believe that we succeeded in doing so. Jürgen Creutzmann  (ALDE

 The German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament has spoken out clearly in favour of the introduction of a debt redemption fund. However, participation in such a fund must be associated with clear and strict rules, such as were contained in the proposal made by the German Council of Economic Experts to the German Government in autumn 2011. Watering down the criteria for participation is neither productive nor effective. Linking the introduction of a debt redemption fund with the eurobonds project and the treatment of economic imbalances is unfair, and is rejected by the FDP in the European Parliament in the strongest possible terms.

 Mr President, Mr Potočnik, cooperation between the European Union and Switzerland is something dear to my heart. That is why it is important to deal with these issues hampering cooperation. We have heard that the provisions for the granting of residence permits for eight European countries no longer correspond to the agreements. We regret this action on the part of the Swiss authorities, particularly in view of the fact that this is just one of many measures that threaten the transposition of bilateral agreements between Switzerland and the European Union; Mr Potočnik has outlined the problems already. It is evident from this that, within the Joint Committee, the Commission still needs to deal with the still outstanding measures for the free provision of services in Switzerland and the implementation of an internal market. If we succeed in making progress here and in reaching an agreement between Switzerland and the European Union that sets down binding rules when it comes to points under dispute, then this can only be to everyone’s benefit. The decision by the Swiss authorities is not just unwise in political terms, but also from an economic perspective. We know, for example, that there are many well-qualified young Polish citizens who would have had the opportunity to work in Switzerland in future and to contribute to prosperity there. I hope that Switzerland will revise this decision and withdraw it again. Jürgen Creutzmann,

 Mr President, one of the most serious problems for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is access to finance. The Commission’s cohesion policy should be able to help resolve this problem. There are various programmes which have already been mentioned. A study by the European Parliament on the effectiveness of the Structural Funds and other measures aimed at regional SMEs has evidently highlighted some weaknesses. These include a failure to distinguish between different types of SMEs – such as micro-enterprises, but also self-employed people – major bureaucratic obstacles during the process of applying for finance, together with the reporting and monitoring requirements, the need for advance funding for projects and a lack of standardisation of the rules and procedures across different subsidy programmes. This leads me to make a few requests to the Commission. We should be able to simplify the process of obtaining finance from the Structural Funds. We need to improve the access to Joint European Resources for Micro to Medium Enterprises (JEREMIE). The contribution of EUR 50 000 required from the applicants is too high. We need to relax the requirement for advance funding for projects. We also need to take a more targeted approach to providing finance for different types of SMEs, to reduce the amount of cofinancing required and to close the financing gap between the individual depreciation cycles. In addition, we need more support to help SMEs to help themselves in the area of financing. Professional organisations could make a contribution in this respect. We must help SMEs to become stronger and to increase their capital. They have to do this in order to obtain loans from the banks. Mr Hahn, it is, of course, also important that Basel III is implemented in such a way that it does not obstruct the process of lending to SMEs, but instead creates opportunities for companies to access loans easily and under favourable terms. Jürgen Creutzmann  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today’s vote will introduce a regulation which brings direct added value for the citizens of Europe. During the next summer holidays, mobile phone calls from abroad will be significantly cheaper and, for the first time, there will be price transparency outside Europe, which is also important. For me, an essential feature of this regulation is that we have not repeated the mistakes of Roaming I and Roaming II. It has become clear that simple price limits, which actually have the same effect as price fixing, do not lead to more competition. Therefore, it is important for us to focus now on unbundling roaming services and national contracts for mobile communication services. We are creating a market which will lead to low prices of its own accord by providing genuine consumer choice and introducing new market players. Of course, we still need a safety net for prices as a transitional measure and to protect consumers from abuse. However, more competition also requires more market players and they will not come onto the market while the price limits are too low and there is too little scope for innovative offers. It will also not help consumers if operators do not have enough money in future to invest in new, faster networks. Ultimately, we do not want to fall behind in Europe. For these reasons, I welcome the fact that we have found a sensible solution and I would like to thank Ms Niebler specifically for her important contribution to this common-sense regulation. Consumers will notice the benefits of the new Roaming Regulation in their wallets. By 2014, there will be significant falls of up to 45% in the cost of incoming and outgoing calls and, as early as July 2012, consumers will be paying almost 20% less. Particularly in the case of data roaming, there have been no limits to misuse until now, which has, in some cases, resulted in horrendous prices. A cap will be put on these in future. We must continue to work towards completing the internal market and, if possible, finding a solution which means that in future, we do not need roaming charges at all.

 Mr President, I should like to start by expressing my deep gratitude to all the shadow rapporteurs, who made this report possible through their excellent cooperation. The committee agreed to this report with an overwhelming vote of 30 in favour, one against and one abstention. Online gambling is an international phenomenon that is growing on a daily basis. Consumers find it easy to gamble online with providers who are either completely unregulated or who are registered in other countries where different rules apply. As a result, some individual Member States are no longer able to guarantee sufficient protection for their consumers. Children and young people or gambling addicts are particularly affected by this. In addition, frequently illegal foreign competition causes Member States to lose many millions of euro in tax revenue every year. This comes at a cost to the promotion of charitable projects, combating addiction and support for amateur sport. Finally, legal uncertainties make it difficult to offer cross-border gambling services within the internal market. Given that there are no European licensing standards, it is necessary to decide on a case-by-case basis whether practices in the Member States comply with European law. The existing level of legal uncertainty is made clear by the large number of contractual violation cases in recent years. That is why there is an urgent need to close the existing gap between legislation and reality. The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has come to a clear conclusion. The Member States need to cooperate much more closely on this issue. This will not be enough to resolve the problems outlined, however. In addition, the European Union will also have to play a significant role in future. This has been demanded by our committee with an overwhelming majority. In addition to other measures, an EU directive is also to be considered that will set shared minimum standards for consumer and youth protection, combating crime in the area of online gambling. Although the committee emphasises the principle of subsidiarity in its report on online gambling, the Member States need to regulate online betting for themselves insofar as possible within their own territory. However, this means that certain rules will need to be met in accordance with the judicial rulings of the European Court of Justice: restrictions in the legal range of gambling services, through state monopoly for example, are only permitted if they are coherent and proportionate. We cannot have a situation where a state explains away its monopoly by arguing that it wishes to protect consumers from the negative effects of gambling, while at the same time intensively advertising its range of state-backed gambling options. The best example of this can be found in Germany, where we have a state monopoly on gambling and lotteries, but with frequent advertising informing consumers of the current size of the jackpot, naturally encouraging players to invest their money in the lottery. To avoid such situations in the future, the European Union should set down quality standards for state licensing models. If a Member State decides in favour of a state licensing model, this model must comply with the principles of transparency and fair competition. In other words, all providers of gambling services that comply with the relevant conditions should be able to apply for a licence. At the same time, trust between the national regulatory authorities needs to be strengthened so as to achieve greater cooperation. In addition, the Commission is called upon to examine ways to use legislation to prevent the flow of payments between illegal providers and their customers. This could be achieved, for example, if each Member State were to draw up a white list of licensed gambling operators in its territory. Banks and credit institutions would only then be permitted to authorise transactions with these approved operators. I believe that this is a sensible and realistic alternative to the blocking of Internet sites, something that we, as liberals, would not favour. This measure would also be an important step in securing tax income from legal gambling, combating organised crime, and protecting the consumer from unregulated gambling. Everyone, regulated providers, the public purse and consumers alike, would benefit from the measures called for in the report. Nonetheless, the European Commission needs the full backing of the European Parliament in order to present the necessary initiatives. It is for this reason I am hopeful that there will be a broad majority in favour at tomorrow’s vote, giving the Commission a clear mandate for action. Mr Barnier, it is over to you.

In my opinion, it exacerbates the problem of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), rather than resolving it. We need a standard, EU-wide solution. We do not need renationalisation, which will prevent us from achieving our internal market objectives. In addition, it will weaken the position of the EU in future World Trade Organisation negotiations.

 The German Free Democratic Party delegation in the European Parliament assumes that the inclusion of Romania and Bulgaria in the Schengen area will further improve freedom of movement within the EU. Now that both Member States have achieved positive evaluation results in all areas of the Schengen review, there should be no more obstacles to delay inclusion further. There is no denying that the technical securing of borders will not automatically make them impermeable as long as problems persist in combating corruption in the justice and policing system. Accordingly, this challenge also relates to Member States already in the Schengen area. For this reason, the German Free Democratic Party delegation believes that criteria such as the fight against corruption must receive greater attention when evaluating the Schengen mechanism, and any misdemeanours must be punished appropriately.

Mr President, Mr Rehn, the joint question on the review of the Small Business Act shows that there is still a great deal to be done to ensure that medium-sized companies in Europe have freedom to act, particularly on a national level. However, I am pleased that in recent years, we have succeeded in implementing almost all the provisions of the Small Business Act in the European Union. Most recently, a new directive on combating late payment in commercial transactions came into force in March, which will make an important contribution to improving payment practice in Europe. Now the Member States have two years to implement the new directive. I would like to call for this timeframe to be shortened, in particular, in the Member States where this would not present a significant problem. Instead of delaying implementation for two years, it could be completed, where possible, within one year. The Member States have not yet been able to agree on the statute for a European private company. Therefore, I very much welcome the fact that the Hungarian Presidency is following up this issue and making it one of the focal points of its work. This form of company in particular could enable small and medium-sized enterprises to save a great deal of money. I am thinking, in particular, of accounting, establishing a company and ongoing legal advice. Therefore, I would like to say again how pleased I am that the Hungarian Presidency is focusing on this area. The issue just mentioned by Mrs Riera Madurell is also important, and that is public procurement. Here, we can still achieve a great deal for small and medium-sized enterprises. There are many bureaucratic regulations in this area and it is often particularly difficult for small and medium-sized businesses to take part in the public procurement process. We need greater transparency and we must also try to make the most of the opportunities presented by the modern media and, in particular, the Internet. Jürgen Creutzmann,

Mr President, Mr Barnier, I would like to respond to my fellow Member’s remarks. Instead of a social clause, the committee has proposed investigating the impact that the measures in the internal market will have on employment. This is much more important than applying general formulae. If we want to make progress with the internal market, we must pay attention to social issues and put the emphasis on them in everything we do. For this reason, an impact assessment which specifically takes these requirements into account is particularly important. I would like to make one more comment. I was surprised to hear the President speak about economic governance, which is still translated in German as Wirtschaftslenkung
. This term is also used to mean central state control of the economy. We have had very bad experiences of state control of the economy in one area of Germany. I am certain that we can only develop the internal market further if we coordinate all our national economies. That is abundantly clear. However, we will not be able to make progress with the internal market by means of economic governance. Today, we are discussing how we can bring some momentum to the internal market. This is long overdue, because we will be celebrating the 20th anniversary of the internal market next year. Therefore, I welcome Mr Barnier’s statement in which he said that he wants to focus on a few specific measures that have not yet been implemented and that will give a new impetus to the internal market. The internal market represents a huge opportunity for all of us. It can lead to the creation of more jobs and our goal must be to find work for people. This is the very best social policy that we can put in place, because people who are employed will also develop self-esteem. Therefore, we must do everything we can to make sure that progress is made in this area. We need a balanced package of measures which brings advantages for businesses and for citizens. On the one hand, we want medium-sized companies in particular to benefit more from the internal market than they have done in the past. Therefore, we urgently need an EU patent system, so that companies can at last protect and sell their innovative products throughout Europe for a reasonable cost. In addition, businesses need more funding to develop innovations. A European venture capital market is just one of many measures that can be taken. The harmonisation of value-added tax and the corporate tax base that we are now discussing will also give a boost to the internal market. On the other hand, we also need to take specific measures which will increase citizens’ trust in the internal market. We must improve the recognition of professional qualifications, possibly by means of the European professional card. This will make it easier to work in another Member State and will create more mobility for citizens within the European internal market. We also need a European market surveillance organisation, and I would like to emphasise this point, because the Member States are constantly failing to put the dossier into practice. We do not want dangerous products to be sold on the internal market. If we can adopt this proposal with a large majority, we will be able to give a new impetus to the internal market.

 In overall terms, the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament supports the waste disposal directive. However, the subject of photovoltaic modules remains a problem. There is no understandable reason for excluding the entire sector from the regulations. We have a wide range of legislation governing waste streams. Therefore, it is not clear why a complete industry, which is expected to produce significant waste streams, is being exempted. For this reason, I have abstained from voting on the report.

 Madam President, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, the largest single market in the world in terms of economic power has developed in the globalised era into a crucial location advantage for the European Union. That is why it is so important to oppose protectionist tendencies and to expand the single market further. In view of the excessively indebted national budgets, there is nothing left for Europe to do but to strengthen the economy by means of structural reforms. Since its establishment in 1992, the single market has already generated additional growth of 1.85%. Implementation of the measures that have been announced is intended to bring about further growth of 2 to 4%. We can divide the Commission’s 50 proposals for single market initiatives into three categories: firstly, into the many specific proposals that will, in any case, enhance the single market for enterprises and citizens. These include the creation of a fully operational internal energy market which, for Europe as an economic and industrial centre, is particularly important. Then there is a European professional card and a European Skills Passport to facilitate mobility within the European Union, which will become more and more important in future in order to maintain Europe’s competitiveness in a globalised world, and the strengthening of electronic commerce by means of better management of copyrights and new guidelines for the effective implementation of the Services Directive in order to create new jobs. Secondly, there are, however, also many proposals which are worded in too vague a manner for us to be able to assess them yet. Therefore, we still need to wait for the Commission’s specific proposals. I include here the revision of the EU rules for public procurement, measures for services of general interest and also – Mrs Gebhardt – the deliberations on a European approach to collective redress. I do not know whether we ought to go down the same erroneous path as the United States. Thirdly, the communication also contains proposals which, in my view, are counterproductive in terms of strengthening the single market, because they burden enterprises with additional bureaucracy. We therefore need to discuss these proposals, and we are ready to do so. Jürgen Creutzmann,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

Madam President, Commissioner Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow, the European Parliament will adopt a directive on combating late payment that will make history. It is the first directive that can quite simply be explained in three sentences: firstly, public authorities will, as a matter of principle, have to pay within 30 days in future if no shorter payment targets have been agreed and if no special circumstances make a payment target of no more than 60 days necessary. Secondly, when agreeing payment targets, enterprises have freedom of contract within 60 days and payment targets of more than 60 days are no longer permitted, except if expressly agreed and if it does not pose a serious disadvantage to the creditor. Thirdly, if the aforementioned payment deadlines are exceeded, recovery costs of at least EUR 40 and interest of at least 8% above the European Central Bank base interest rate can be charged without a prior reminder. This directive will help small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe to a great extent to improve their liquidity, and they will not need to accept as much credit from the banks. Debtors with a strong market presence will no longer be able to force small and medium-sized enterprises into granting longer payment deadlines, and that is a good thing. Furthermore, individual Member States will not only be able to retain shorter payment target deadlines in the form that has been customary up to now; we assume that, in fact, they will be retained, because we cannot imagine that the Late Payments Directive will lead to a deterioration in payment practices within the Member States. Enterprises that do business within Europe know that, in future, their claims will be settled after no more than 60 days. This is a huge step forward and a further step towards the completion of the European internal market. We can be very satisfied with the adoption of this legislation. It will help small and medium-sized enterprises and it will help the European internal market. Jürgen Creutzmann  (ALDE

 Madam President, Commissioner, in Pakistan, we have witnessed devastating floods, and we must help the suffering, destitute people of this country. In this regard, what saddens me, in particular, is the fact that there are regions in Pakistan that the central government is not allowing any proper aid to reach. Thus, for example, the region of Gilgit-Baltistan, north of Jammu and Kashmir within the Pakistani border region, has also been badly hit by heavy rainfall and its effects. According to information I have received, in Gilgit-Baltistan alone, 500 people have died and 50 000 people have been made homeless. Four bridges have been washed away and many areas of land have been completely cut off from the outside world. So far, however, aid equivalent to only around EUR 10 000 has reached Gilgit-Baltistan. Therefore, the European Union should not just hand over its aid to the Pakistani central government but provide direct support to the non-governmental organisations that are also looking after the interests of the remote regions of Pakistan.

Along with the majority of Members in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I have decided to vote in favour of the Sommer report. It is true that the Liberals were not able to achieve their goals in every area. The adoption of origin labelling for meat and milk in processed products is a regrettable move, because it imposes significant costs on producers and seems almost impossible to implement in practice. However, for me, the positive results of the vote clearly outweigh the negative ones. For the first time, we have uniform regulations on food labelling throughout the entire internal market, with no possibility of individual countries going it alone. In addition, one of the decisive successes of this vote for me is the fact that the misleading traffic light model was rejected. A mandatory colour coded nutrient declaration will not be permitted either at a European or a national level. Uniform Europe-wide labelling rules will bring clear advantages for companies and consumers. The cost of manufacturing and selling products will fall because manufacturers will only have to follow a single regulation. Consumers will benefit from uniform nutrient labelling when comparing products that come from within Europe.

 Combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography is vitally important. We must use all our strength to combat the availability of child pornography in communications networks. The permanent and effective control of child abuse is both a political responsibility and a precept of the rule of law. The German Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament is of the opinion that it is necessary to remove such criminal content as quickly as possible. Jürgen Creutzmann  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, Commissioner Dalli, the fact that we are discussing three own-initiative reports on consumer protection and the internal market today shows that, despite all of our successes in these areas, there is still much that is in need of improvement. Admittedly, the Member States’ transposition of the internal market directives has, on average, greatly improved, but seven Member States have failed to meet the target set by the Commission of reducing the transposition deficit for the internal market directives to 1%. The main problem, however, has more to do with the application of EU law than with its transposition. Thus, in the event of treaty infringements by Member States, it takes, on average, 18 months – in other words, still far too long – for them to comply with the judgment of the European Court of Justice. This can be seen from the current internal market scorecard, and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe finds that unacceptable. This deficit will lead to problems for citizens and, in particular, for small and medium-sized enterprises, which depend on harmonised rules within the internal market, but which meet with unexpected, time-consuming and bureaucratic obstacles when they want to operate across borders. This is why it is important for SOLVIT to be developed further. SOLVIT is an online problem-solving network in which the Member States work together in a pragmatic way to resolve problems that have arisen as a result of the misapplication of internal market rules by public authorities. All Member States must ultimately provide the financial resources and adequately trained staff for the SOLVIT centres. The ALDE Group calls emphatically for people to be made more aware of SOLVIT in the Member States in order to facilitate the cross-border sale of their products and services. For this purpose, the involvement of the relevant associations in large-scale information campaigns is just as necessary as a uniform, easy-to-understand and easy-to-find Internet portal for receiving all kinds of complaints.

 According to the resolution of the European Parliament on the draft general budget for the financial year 2010, adopted on 17 December 2009, a vote was taken today on the amending budget for the European Parliament, following the revised calculations made by the Parliamentary administration. The FDP in the European Parliament abstained, because there was a paragraph in the package of amendments concerned that we could not reconcile with our convictions. The FDP had already expressed its opposition to an increase in the secretarial allowance to EUR 1 500 during the discussions in committee. It is out of the secretarial allowance that MEPs’ assistants are paid. The FDP considers that the argument that more money is needed due to the additional work that MEPs have to do with the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is unsound, as there is nothing in past experience to support this. Certainly, under the Treaty of Lisbon, which has just come into force, Parliament will overall need extra capacity for legislative work, but with the introduction of the Assistants’ Statute from the beginning of the current parliamentary term, there is still no proof that MEPs actually need more assistants. For this reason, there are grounds for concern that further demands and supplementary increases, or an extension of office capacity, will follow. For this reason, the FDP in the European Parliament abstained from voting. Jürgen Creutzmann

 Mr President, Commissioner, if what you are calling for is further development and harmonisation of the internal market, then we need to have a common set of rules. There are three aspects to online gambling which ought to be considered in this debate. How can we best protect the interests of our citizens and consumers? How can we best prevent fraud and criminal activity? How can we best protect our citizens from harm? The European Parliament resolution of 10 March 2009 on the integrity of online gambling has indicated methods and ways to proceed with regard to this issue. Now, as before, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe endorses the principles concerning the integrity of online gambling contained in Parliament’s resolution of 10 March 2009. In accordance with a ruling of the European Court of Justice, each Member State is free, under certain conditions, to regulate online gambling itself and the resolution of 10 March stresses that emphatically. National rules are better suited to combating match-fixing fraud, although this type of fraud cannot be eliminated entirely, as demonstrated by some recent examples in Germany. It has to be said, though, that gambling markets are much better regulated at national level, according to the tradition and culture of the country concerned. Players are offered better protection against addiction, fraud, money laundering and match-fixing if they can play through major online gambling service providers, who always, by definition, operate across borders. We cannot regulate everything according to the internal market concept and particularly not the prevention of underage gambling or gambling addiction. Online gambling provides increased opportunities for corrupt practices, such as fraud, match-fixing and illegal betting cartels, as online games can be set up and dismantled very rapidly. Illegal offshore betting operators present a particular problem in this regard, as it is almost impossible for them to be regulated or controlled. Profits from gambling should primarily be used for the benefit of society in order to promote amateur sport, amongst other things. It is best to leave this to the competence of national administrations. Continuous funding, for culture and professional and amateur sport, for example, gives individual Member States some justification for permitting gambling. However, a precondition for that is that the risk of addiction must be highlighted and proactively combated. As the full impact on consumers of the specific forms of gambling services offered online is not yet known, we need to take urgent action to fill this knowledge gap. It is essential in this context that Member States really do fulfil their tasks. Market surveillance is also key, when it comes to online gambling. If we in the European Parliament can agree that Member States have the right, under the principle of subsidiarity, to regulate their gambling markets according to their own traditions and cultures, we also then have to ensure that this is actually happening, through efficient control and market surveillance. Jürgen Creutzmann,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports the views expressed in the opinion of the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment to the effect that the ALARA principle, in other words, the principle of ‘as low as reasonably achievable’, should apply in the assessment of carcinogenic substances. Secondly, there is consequently a need for the Commission to examine whether this principle is also satisfied by the limit values laid down in the Toys Directive. Thirdly, if this does not happen, we call on the Commission to ensure that, until the Toys Directive has been transposed by all the Member States in 2011, the limit values are laid down in the Toys Directive in such a way as to rule out any risk to the health of children from softening agents in toys. Fourthly, the principle enshrined in the Toys Directive, whereby chemicals that are potentially carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction are impermissible, must be implemented with regard to accessible parts of toys. This must actually be achieved by the limit values set, as otherwise such a directive is worthless. Fifthly, this calls, in particular, for better and more efficient market surveillance, because it is usually toys that have been imported into the EU that exceed the limit values set by the Union. However, efficient market surveillance would also enable toys manufactured within the EU to be tested to see whether they, too, comply with the limit values. Sixthly, it is totally unacceptable, should this be the case, that lower standards should apply to imports into the EU than, for example, into the US. However, the threat by the German Federal Minister for Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection, Ilse Aigner, to go it alone and prohibit so-called ‘toxic toys’ herself is, in my view, completely the wrong way to go about it and totally counterproductive when it comes to creating confidence in the European internal market. Merely cultivating national popular opinion not only destroys confidence in the European Institutions; it also damages the German Federal Government, because it approved the Toys Directive.

 The German Free Democratic Party members of the European Parliament have abstained from voting on the Copenhagen resolution for the following reasons. The resolution contains statements about financing for climate protection measures in third countries without defining the specific criteria or purpose of the financing. We cannot justify this to taxpayers. In addition, we believe that blanket criticism of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) is wrong. The ICAO is the organisation which deals with aviation matters at an international level. Both the criticism and the statement about the alleged failure of ICAO negotiations are incorrect and inappropriate. The call for specific arrangements for a CO2
 trading system for the aviation industry goes against current EU legislation and overburdens the EU’s negotiating position in an international climate agreement with unrealistic demands. Jürgen Creutzmann,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s response is, of course, not only discouraging, as Mr Schwab said, but also very disappointing. When it comes to the transposition, we need to realise that if you say that around 50% are on schedule, then we have to assume that the other 50% are a long way from achieving that. Take my own country, Germany, for example: the individual Federal Länder 
are currently transposing this directive. In Rhineland-Palatinate, where I live, I had the opportunity, on 2 September, to participate in the first reading for the transposition of the Services Directive for this Federal Land
. As you can imagine, it will be impossible to achieve the transposition on time, and I believe that the other Federal Länder
 are in a similar position. The crucial factor for us, of course, will be how the transposition is carried out. If Article 13(2) stipulates that ‘authorisation procedures and formalities shall not be dissuasive and shall not unduly complicate or delay the provision of the service’ then we must take great care to ensure that this does not happen in practice. A decisive factor, for example, will be how the single points of contact are equipped. Will they have language skills? Will they work closely enough with the administrations to also be able to deal with the concerns put to them? We very much doubt it. In fact, the committee should now be asking which countries are behind schedule with this, which countries make up the 50% and when do they expect to achieve this. It would then be better to create a moratorium, or something similar, for these countries. I am certain that, in most countries, this directive will not be transposed by 1 January 2010, even though these countries have had more than four years to do this. That is a major problem and it is very disappointing. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

Mr President, the delegated act as adopted on 30 September 2013 foresees that public-private partnership bodies are to receive an indirect discharge via the Commission, instead of an individual discharge as they receive now. We fought against this as a team of rapporteurs, and I thank Ingeborg Gräßle for this good compromise. We rechecked with the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Controls which, acting under Rule 51 and unanimously, adopted the motion for resolution objecting to the delegated act. An alternative approach was now agreed upon by the Parliament, Council and Commission teams, which they are to endorse via a trilateral joint statement which foresees that, firstly, Parliament, the Council and the Commission agree that the joint undertakings should continue to be subject to a separate discharge by the European Parliament upon recommendation of the Council, and secondly, that the Commission will include derogations in the financial rules of the joint undertakings to reflect the separate discharge. Subsequently, the Commission will propose corresponding modifications to Articles 209 and 60 of the Financial Regulation. Thirdly (and last but not least), the Commission Delegated Regulation of 30 September 2013 on the model financial regulation for public-private partnership bodies will enter into force in order to allow joint undertakings to benefit from the simplifications introduced in the new financial framework. As just mentioned by the Presidency, the Council will endorse the joint statement on 20 January. In the light of this, the Committee on Budgetary Control and, I believe, the Committee on Budgets are ready to endorse this trilateral joint statement on the separate discharge for joint undertakings. In the name of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I request the withdrawal of the resolution objecting to the delegated act which was initially planned for vote tomorrow in Plenary.

 Mr President, Commissioner Šefčovič, Parliament has always actively supported the Danube Strategy. The Danube Forum, of which I am the Chair, has 60 MEPs. Therefore, I am pleased to be the first signatory of the oral question to put the subject of the Danube on today’s agenda. There has been some progress with regard to the Danube, such as the bridges I saw this summer between Widin and Calafat, on the international Danube bicycle tour. However, this progress is moving at a snail’s pace. There are still major difficulties: mayors in Bulgaria tell us that construction works on the Danube require consultation with seven ministries in Sofia. Other Danube residents have the impression in their Member States that the Danube is being marginalised in capital cities and not being placed in the foreground. This is why we are asking the Commission for more substantial results and measures. In the current programming period, the Danube Strategy should be provided with resources and for the future period we need a dedicated budget line for the Danube. We have specific projects, such as the Danube Manager, for which administration capacity needs to be developed. Small and medium-sized enterprises should be supported while they cooperate. There should be technology transfer centres. More than anything else, we need more opportunities for citizens to meet. We note that these citizens’ meetings must be supported otherwise they do not function. I have written to Chancellor Merkel and Commissioner Lewandowski to propose the formation of a Danube Youth Foundation. I therefore pose the question: can the Commission imagine itself financially supporting such a Danube Youth Foundation? Many young people would like to meet up, but cannot afford the tank of petrol or the train tickets they need to get to a meeting. Ladies and gentlemen, parliaments should play a greater role. I hope that we in the European Parliament will act as leaders and invite the other national and regional parliaments to join in, so that we, too, take greater ownership of the Danube Strategy than ever before.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the level of dissatisfaction in the wake of the Rio conference is significant. We recognise that Europe cannot force its ideas in relation to environmental policy on the rest of the world. This phase of disillusionment can also be seen as an opportunity, however. Europe can act as a role model. That is my first point. My second point is that we need to focus more on adjusting to the new situation brought about by climate change, as well as working towards climate protection. Above all, I believe that Europe’s development organisations, research institutions, universities and private enterprises can make a significant contribution; after all, we need to see economic development and environmental policy as two sides of the same coin. Weaker countries will only be able to pursue environmental policies if they also make progress on the economic development front. So, let us press forward with environmental technology. This is something Europe can offer other countries. Perhaps we need to question the idea of greening. Perhaps we should create blue growth that is mainly based on technology. As the world’s population continues to grow, this will only be possible if we see economics and environmental policy as inextricably linked.

 The German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament has spoken out clearly in favour of the introduction of a debt redemption fund. However, participation in such a fund must be associated with clear and strict rules, such as were contained in the proposal made by the German Council of Economic Experts to the German Government in autumn 2011. Watering down the criteria for participation is neither productive nor effective. Linking the introduction of a debt redemption fund with the eurobonds project and the treatment of economic imbalances is unfair, and is rejected by the FDP in the European Parliament in the strongest possible terms.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, do you know Mr Hanselmann? If not, you should get to know him. Around 20 years ago, Mr Hanselmann founded a company with three colleagues from the University of Paderborn. Now it has 1 000 employees. He received a loan from the state subsidy system in North Rhine-Westphalia to set up his company. This shows that state subsidies for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and subsidised loans are helpful. We need an initiative in Europe to promote the start-up of SMEs. The aid available must be made simpler. It must have lower thresholds and involve less red tape. One approach could be innovation vouchers. In addition, we must reallocate the unused money from the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund so that SMEs in Greece, for example, can obtain loans. However, to be able to do this, we also need different banking systems. One possibility would be cooperative banks and savings banks which the outlying countries in particular do not have. We need both things: a solution for the outlying countries and a policy for highly innovative companies in wealthier regions which will reinforce their strengths. That is what is currently required.

 Mr Lamberts, when you say we need growth and we need to create structures to allow states to borrow money again, it is also the case that the states which will be lending the money are afraid that this is just a bottomless pit.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating the 2010 budget and the European Court of Auditor’s report in this regard. This report contains both encouraging and less encouraging elements. Firstly, with regard to the funds that are directly controlled as well as managed by the Commission, it can be seen that the error rate is falling. This is the case in agricultural policy in particular, where an encouraging result was achieved with a 2.3% error rate. On the other hand, in cohesion policy, which has been a problem area for many years, we have an error rate of 7.7% – and two thirds of these errors should have been rectified by the Member States. That should not allow us to cease in our attempts to influence the Member States in this regard to ensure that the error rate is reduced. At this point, I would like first of all – on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, but also as committee chair – to thank Commissioner Šemeta as well as the President of the European Court of Auditors most sincerely for their excellent cooperation. I expressly agree with those Members who welcome the fact that the Council is also here today, represented by Mr Wammen from the Danish Presidency. The cooperation with the Commission and the European Court of Auditors is exemplary. The cooperation with the Council, Mr Wammen, is in need of improvement – and it is on the part of the Council that this improvement is required. I would like to ask and encourage you to pass that message on to the other members of the Council, too. As Parliament, we expect an improvement in use of funds for which we have shared responsibility, and for the Council now to accommodate Parliament here in the trialogue so that in future, we can reduce the error rate. After all, we must also finally make some progress on the discharge of the Council. It is not acceptable for there to be public expenditure that is not subject to any democratic scrutiny. ‘No taxation without representation’ was the battle cry of the American Revolution. Democracy requires there to be no public expenditure without democratic scrutiny. You mentioned the principle of reciprocity, but that is clearly not appropriate in terms of the relationship between the Council and Parliament, as the Treaty of Lisbon clearly stipulates that the Council recommends, but Parliament decides. That is not reciprocity; it is not symmetry, but asymmetry. Here it is important for Parliament, as the directly elected body of the citizens, to have its rights upheld. Michael Theurer,

 Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I would like to welcome the President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), Werner Hoyer, and to congratulate him on his committed and convincing debut. Following monetary stabilisation, we must now focus fully on real growth in the economy. One of the key aspects of this is the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises. The EIB supported 115 000 small and medium-sized enterprises in 2010 with funds totalling EUR 10 billion. A credit squeeze nonetheless persists for medium-sized businesses, particularly in the crisis countries and on the periphery of the European Union. We in the European Parliament expect the EIB to do all it can to provide greater support to small and medium-sized enterprises. We would be interested to learn more about the significance of the guarantees for small and medium-sized enterprises and the options with regard to the Risk Sharing Finance Facility. We also believe it is important that the EIB should play a role in financing infrastructure in the context of the EU project bonds. In summary, we believe that infrastructure, technology and innovation – in short, blue growth – should be at the centre of EIB strategy. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was an own-initiative report by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe which pointed out that the absorption capacity of certain Member States was not very high. As rapporteur on that report, I pointed to the causes of that situation. It is now necessary that the Commission take appropriate action here. We will also support the Commission in finally taking action in problem countries – in Greece, Romania, Bulgaria and in southern Italy. A reallocation of resources towards small and medium-sized enterprises, dual vocational training and tackling youth unemployment is absolutely the right course to take. That has to be our starting point. However, the vital thing is that capacities are built up, if we are to solve these problems. The impression the citizens of Europe have is that – as in Greece – all-out austerity is not working and that the government simply agrees measures which then remain unimplemented. However, it is crucial that, to use a car analogy, we do not put our foot down on the accelerator only to find that nothing happens. Now we need to engage a gear, so that the engine can provide thrust to the wheels! After all, we need to take action to develop a real economy: that is, to improve competitiveness, so that the problem is tackled at the root. Michael Theurer,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development
. – (DE)
 Mr President, Commissioner Rehn, ladies and gentlemen, in the discussion regarding the economic and financial crisis, which has led to the introduction of the European semester, the focus for the public is on the question of monetary policy and the sovereign debt crisis. For the Committee on Regional Development, however, it is important for more light to be shed on the question of the real economy. We want to eliminate the causes of the differences in competitiveness that result in some countries lagging behind. That is the central focus of European policy, and it must remain so in future, too. It is disgraceful that some countries do not utilise the Structural Funds. We need to investigate the causes here, as Parliament also determined in connection with my report on the absorption rate. It is not just a question of cofinancing; it is also a question of decentralising the responsibility for decision-making and of increasing administrative capacity. In this regard, the Committee on Regional Development is grateful to the rapporteur for including our proposals, because we now need to tackle the root of the problem and eliminate the causes of the imbalances. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Michael Theurer  (ALDE

 Mr President, the differences in competitiveness are undoubtedly also due to the different responses of Member States to global economic changes. It would be carrying things too far to investigate this, as even the opinions of the experts differ. The fact is that, even within Member States, individual regions are developing differently. Therefore, the Committee on Regional Development believes that current cohesion and regional policy offers a good approach for providing assistance to regions, cities and communities and the companies established there to enable them to adapt better. However, on investigating the actual effects it emerges that some Member States – such as Estonia or even Poland, which are achieving very good results – deal with the Structural Funds better than others, which find it difficult to absorb the funds – for example regions like Calabria and Sicily, as well as Greece and Romania. In the committee’s view, what is now needed is for us to tackle these problems specifically in order to utilise the Structural Funds better and to deal with the causes of the problem.

 Madam President, Commissioner, first of all, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Rühle, for her report and for such good cooperation. In view of the current debate, this is an appropriate moment to point out that public procurement is a very important way of achieving fair prices for public services and for the procurement of goods for the public sector. Competition is one element of using our scarce resources economically. It is thus a positive aspect of this report that public procurement is to be simplified. This should also facilitate access to public procurement for small and medium-sized enterprises. The measures for achieving this includes consistently allowing self-declarations, the division of contracts into lots – in other words, an SME-friendly tendering procedure – and the introduction of an electronic procurement passport. Moreover, when awarding contracts, the contracting authorities should give greater consideration to the quality of the goods and services to be procured, in addition to the price. It is also sensible for contracting authorities to attach greater weight to future life-cycle costs. In other words, it is no longer simply a matter of the cheapest offer, but rather the most economic offer over the entire life cycle. Greater consideration also needs to be given to environmental sustainability. These are the positive points. However, we in the ALDE Group feel there are some points that need revising. There are calls for the bureaucratic requirements on subcontractors to be increased. We see this as a major problem. We also want to have an open market worldwide that cannot be distorted by giving preference to domestic bidders. In return, we want other countries to open up their markets. We are also critical as regards award criteria introduced through bureaucracy; in other words, where certain local authorities are allowed to introduce their own criteria. It is in the interests of the market as a whole to prevent this. Michael Theurer,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, President Barroso has already highlighted the significance of small and medium-sized enterprises: 99% of all enterprises in Europe employ fewer than 250 people. Small and medium-sized enterprises are thus the backbone of employment and training. With the Small Business Act, the European Union began an initiative to improve national and European legislation for small and medium-sized enterprises. It was in this context that the test of the impact of legislation on small and medium-sized enterprises was introduced. Now, however, a study by the European Parliament has shown significant variation in the way that this SME test is being implemented in the individual Member States, and that in some cases, it is being implemented badly. Only five Member States have made this SME text a binding requirement. Fourteen Member States apply it half-heartedly, irregularly and with varying quality, while eight Member States practically do not carry out the test at all. That is why we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have tabled this question and are calling for the Commission to start an initiative to make this impact assessment a genuinely binding requirement in the Member States. We want the costs of administration and red tape to be quantified, in order to work towards reducing these. Small and medium-sized enterprises need to be saved from national and European legislation that burdens them with more and more additional costs for bureaucracy and administration. We are in favour of implementation being made very flexible, so that the Member States have room to manoeuvre. However, the aim must be for the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises to be taken into consideration as part of an integrated approach to law making. We also want the Commission to set an example by being the driving force behind this SME-friendly implementation of legislation. We in the European Union should take the lead in making laws that are genuinely capable of being implemented by small and medium-sized enterprises in practice. Michael Theurer,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at a late hour this evening, we are debating a subject that is of absolutely crucial importance for us. In any case, 37% of the EU budget goes on cohesion policy. Let us take a closer look – today, in the middle of the period, in 2011 – at how much in the way of resources has actually been taken from the Structural and Cohesion Funds so far. We can see that, unfortunately, in many Member States, the absorption rate and absorption capacity are well below what should actually have been paid out already by this stage. We have new Members States, such as Bulgaria and Romania, which have a poor absorption rate, but it is not only the new Member States; there are also Member States that have been in the Union for a long time, with regions such as Calabria and Sicily in the founder State of Italy, that with a rate of 7% – if we are to believe the budgetary controllers in the Committee on Budgetary Control – are well behind. This raises the question: why are these regions unable to spend the financial resources that we make available? There is Greece, too. Here in Parliament we have been highlighting where action is needed for months and have been pointing out that a country like Greece is not absorbing these resources, and we are pleased that the Commission, which to start with did not attach the necessary importance to this matter, has now given it high priority. With regard to Greece in particular, President Barroso has pointed out that, out of 20 billion, 15 billion has not been spent, and Commissioner Hahn has also just been there. We have considered what we can do to help these regions. The first thing to consider, as always, is the subject of cofinancing. The fact is that the regions are finding it difficult, in this global economic crisis, to finance their own share and Member States like Greece, which appear to be on the brink of insolvency, are also finding it difficult to finance their own share. There is no question that help must be provided here. However, it is clearly not just a matter of cofinancing, because there are also regions in Greece that really do not want an increase in European Union subsidies, are happy with the current rate of 80% and would rather implement more projects. Thus, it is not just a question of cofinancing; there are many different reasons. The procedures are too complex and need to be simplified as a matter of urgency. There is also the problem that, in many Member States, the central administrations of the governments in the capital cities take too long and the regions and regional authorities at local level have insufficient decision-making options in order to use the resources. Take Romania, for example, where the local authorities take 20 to 30 days to process applications, the regional authorities take around 60 days, but the central government takes 260 days. All of this provides an argument for delegating responsibility from the top down and introducing a strong local self-administration. Where are the Council, the Council Presidency and Mr van Rompuy this evening, in fact? He has taken the floor with regard to other matters. We are talking about 37% of the EU budget here. The EU is putting off payment obligations of EUR 250 billion. How are they to be fulfilled? The President-in-Office of the Council from Poland could have attempted to answer this, as Poland, of course, has shown how the absorption rate can be increased. There are also examples of good governance. Poland has managed it – its absorption capacities have increased – but so has Estonia. As Parliament, we are of the opinion that the Member States are now called on to ensure, as a matter of urgency, that the resources that we as Parliament have made available for the citizens in the regions are actually spent, also in the interests of increasing competitiveness and stabilisation of jobs and employment. In this regard, we expect the Commission to push forward with the method adopted and to very strongly urge the Member States to bring this matter to a positive conclusion. Michael Theurer,

 Madam President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased that, at my initiative, this oral question has received so much support here in Parliament and that it is being answered so promptly by the Commission. Thank you very much, Mr Tajani, for your response. As you know, because of globalisation, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are facing increasing competition from other countries, including from emerging economies outside the European Union. This involves major challenges, but also significant opportunities. In order to remain competitive, to secure growth and to support the sustainability of our companies, SMEs must take part in international activities. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is convinced of this. This concerns imports and exports, foreign direct investment and, of course, also acting as or using foreign subcontractors. However, only a small proportion of European SMEs are doing business with third countries. A total of 99% of the companies in the European Union are SMEs. However, only 29% of the SMEs in the EU import products, of which 50% import from countries outside the internal market. Only 25% of the SMEs in the EU are involved in exports, of which 50% export to countries outside the internal market. This means that our SMEs are not yet fully integrated into the global market. There are still opportunities to be exploited in this area and we now need to consider how we can encourage SMEs to do more business outside Europe. Not many SMEs are familiar with the public support programmes, such as the Enterprise Europe Network, or with information resources, such as the Market Access Database and the Export Helpdesk. There are also similar programmes available at a national and regional level. We need to know what concrete measures the Commission is planning in order to ensure that SMEs are better informed about the available tools and programmes. We would also like to know what the Commission intends to do to make the confusing subsidy system more transparent and clearer for SMEs. Following the decision made by the Court of Justice of the European Union on 10 December 2009, the Commission intends to include product-specific list rules in the implementing regulations for the Modernised Customs Code, in other words, to make these rules legally binding. The intention is to replace the current regulation, which has proved its worth over several decades and which specifies that the origin of a product is based on its last substantial processing or working, by countless product-specific origin rules for products imported into the EU. We are concerned that this will lead to an increase in red tape and, most importantly, will put SMEs at a disadvantage. We believe that this is not in line with the Small Business Act for Europe. Therefore, we are calling for a simplified form of this system which is beneficial for SMEs. How does the Commission intend to ensure that safety-related adaptations and changes to the Modernised Customs Code do not conflict with the existing simplified procedure and lead to competitive disadvantages? This is all about the position of SMEs on the world market, which will ensure their continued existence and allow them to safeguard jobs here in the European Union. Michael Theurer  (ALDE
).

 Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bütikofer, for a very good report. Commissioner Tajani, you have given a very clear signal this evening, which gives us hope. After all, we were disappointed with the presentation of the Commission’s strategy in the beginning. However, the raw materials strategy is a vital ingredient for business, employment and jobs here in the European Union. That is why a coherent strategy is essential. It goes without saying that we need the three pillars: security for our sources of raw materials, a recycling strategy, including greater efficiencies, as well as a joint approach so that partnerships can be established with the main raw materials suppliers of this world. The amendments tabled by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe focus on the idea that we should include more members of the scientific community in this strategy because there are many modern techniques for using raw materials found on the sea bed in the world’s oceans that still need to be researched and developed. This is precisely where Europeans have something to offer raw materials suppliers in developing countries and emerging economies as part of a common raw materials strategy. As liberals we believe it is important to remember that small and medium-sized enterprises require our particular help. Big business can secure raw materials for itself, while small and medium-sized enterprises need a joint strategy. Hence our call on you: let us work together to unite the Member States under the umbrella of the EU and establish long-term partnerships with the countries with the raw materials. The aim of the raw materials strategy must be to bring economic policy, environmental policy and international trade, together with development policy, under one roof. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mr Oettinger, ladies and gentlemen, even 25 years down the road, Chernobyl continues to be a cause for concern. Fukushima will also be a source of anxiety for years to come. The debate surrounding these major accidents is a sign that nuclear technology has inherent risks that it may not be possible to control. This is leading to a rethink in energy policy. However, it is also evident that unilateral action by individual countries is a mistake. We need international strategies, or at least EU-wide strategies when it comes to safety. That is why I fully support the Commissioner for Energy, who has made a number of important proposals in this direction. I would call on everyone here to work together to produce common principles so that the existing nuclear reactors really are safe, so that power failures are not allowed to happen and so that earthquake safety and other risks can be better estimated. We should then take a pro-active approach in bringing these principles to the attention of the international bodies. Michael Theurer,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Baltic Sea strategy set the ball rolling, the Danube strategy that we have debated this year in Parliament was the second step and now it is the turn of the Atlantic region. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in Parliament supports this macro-regional approach and was actively involved in this resolution. What we are concerned with here are improvements to the protection of the seas and the environment, and naturally also maritime affairs and fisheries – but it goes beyond this into lots of other areas, and three pillars in particular. The first of these is cooperation between Member States, so that synergies can be better exploited. Secondly, the Atlantic links the EU Member States and regions bordering the Atlantic with transatlantic partners such as Canada and the US and with other neighbouring countries such as Norway and Iceland. Thirdly, it is also concerned with bringing about closer links between stakeholders in the regions. We should emphasise the aspect of bringing together and networking towns and communities, regions, Member States and, above all, citizens, civil society and businesses, so that these actors can bring this framework – that is, the macro-regional strategy – to life. After all, the intention is not to create new institutions or new bodies; the idea is to have an effect using existing funding. The resources that exist are bound to contain unexploited synergies and opportunities that can be used as a basis for our activities. It is precisely because of this that the ALDE Group considers this strategy to be urgently needed, because it affects international trade. Goods from all over the world come across the Atlantic into the European Union. Naturally, this trade must take place in an ecologically sustainable way. Moreover, there are likely to be large reserves of raw materials in the Atlantic that we may be able to utilise, provided there is sustainable protection for the environment. We call on the Commission to draw up and submit a strategy for this area as soon as possible. Michael Theurer,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are currently witnessing a historic situation, because the Free Trade Agreement with South Korea that we are debating and that we intend to adopt is the first Free Trade Agreement that has been debated under the new Lisbon system, which grants Parliament full power of codecision. This makes an important area of policy – trade policy – more democratic. We, as Parliament, consider this to be important. The debate here in Parliament has also shown that, as regards safeguard clauses, we were able to include important concerns expressed to us by workers, companies and associations in an improved safeguard clause that is intended to protect the interests of industry and, above all, jobs in the future by creating a level playing field and fair conditions for competition and avoiding asymmetries. That is what we as the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have concentrated on. As shadow rapporteur for our group, I am pleased that we were able to be successful in this regard. The duty drawback mechanism, which caused us concern to start with, has now been explicitly included in the safeguard clause and there is the option for industry, and also for Parliament, to call on the Commission to carry out an investigation. A monitoring process is planned, which is intended to be established in a transparent way via an online platform, and there is greater scope for the investigation of the factors that will decide whether significant damage has been done to European industry. Mechanisms for monitoring to be carried out by the Commission, particularly for sensitive sectors in the event of increased imports, are also provided for. We can start with this and focus on the advantages associated with the South Korea agreement, such as the considerable reduction in duties – the Commission expects enterprises in Europe to be able to save EUR 1.6 billion. I would therefore like to thank Commissioner De Gucht, who has personally worked hard to enable us to reach a compromise, including with the Council. I would also like to thank the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, especially Mr Sturdy and Mr Zalba Bidegain, for their excellent work. We have achieved something really good here. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn, ladies and gentlemen, we must preserve the world’s oceans as an ecosystem. However, the oceans and the concept of globalisation are not mutually exclusive. Shipping routes are essential to our prosperity, because they are the arteries of world trade. There is a lot to be done in this context in order to ensure that we protect the environment and that our transport routes are secure. In future, we will also have to secure our supply of raw materials. Scientists are predicting that valuable raw materials can be found on the sea bed and in the sea itself. The important consideration is to extract them in an environmentally friendly way. The third aspect I would like to look at is the link between the oceans and inland waterways. I believe it is important to establish a connection with inland waterway transport. The development of the Danube plays a major role in this respect. As the longest river in the EU, in combination with the Rhine-Main-Danube canal, it can link the Black Sea with the North Sea. We should be creating a connection between integrated maritime policy and inland waterways. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, my fellow Members have explained that it is an urgent human rights issue that the import of these products into the European Union should be halted. I am also of the opinion that, in the context of such inhuman conditions, the question arises as to whether these products are being sold at dumping prices. I believe that we should look at the need for anti-dumping measures. In addition, we in the EU should make it quite clear that, irrespective of the commercial issues involved, the conditions in these labour camps are unacceptable to us. Naturally we should concern ourselves not just with the products themselves, but with improving conditions for the people interned in these camps who have no recourse to the principles of the rule of law. We should once again make this very clear to the People’s Republic of China. Michael Theurer,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I would like to thank Commissioner De Gucht as well as the rapporteur, Mr Zalba, for their positive cooperation in connection with the Free Trade Agreement with South Korea and the safeguard clauses. I would first like to emphasise that we Liberals and Democrats here in the European Parliament would like to see the agreement ratified and adopted as soon as possible, because we are in favour of free trade and because we see an agreement with South Korea as providing great opportunities for both the economy of the European Union and that of South Korea. Where the safeguard clauses are concerned, however, we need to take the concerns raised with us by European industry very seriously. We believe that the safeguard clauses represent an instrument that is capable of taking account of these concerns. We hope that the vote this week will send a signal that the political forces in Parliament are united and that these safeguard clauses will result in a well-functioning agreement being concluded here. We therefore call on the Council and the Commission to move towards us on the important outstanding issues. Above all, we do not want to see the duty drawback system being abused. We cannot allow duty drawback to provide an open door via South Korea for cheap products, particularly cheap primary products from China and other Asian countries. Moreover, we want the South Koreans to dismantle their non-tariff barriers to trade – such as the CO2
 regulations for cars – so that we do not have new barriers to trade coming in through the back door. We want social and environmental standards to be upheld. Naturally, the matter of comitology must also be settled; that is, for the later application of the agreement. Here, we want to see a strong role for Parliament. We also want industry itself and the Member States to be able to initiate such investigations and monitoring in future. One last point is a cause for concern: in the coming days, the Council will debate the provisional application of the agreement and possibly also vote on this. I must sound a note of warning here that, under the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament must give its consent. Provisional application would be contrary to the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon. I therefore call on the Council not to approve provisional application of the agreement, but to wait for Parliament to make its decision. We have done everything in our power to make a timely decision possible, and we should demonstrate this again by showing a united front in the vote. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

I support the action of the European Union in reorganising the current remuneration policy to provide long-term success and more accountability for decision makers. However, this must not lead to a situation in which policy determines salaries. This should remain the task of the authorities which are already in place, such as the board of governors and the general meeting of the banks. The proposed remuneration policy must therefore not replace existing structures but, at most, complement them where necessary, insofar as this is beneficial to the quality of economic decisions.

 It is certainly important to tighten the regulations on internships. The representatives of the German Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament have supported this. Young people often work for months on end without payment, hoping that they might still get a permanent job afterwards. This is an unsustainable situation. Internships should not destroy jobs. However, today’s plenary vote is going to pave the way in the future for a complete ban on unpaid internships. We believe that this gives a wrong message. It should still be possible to do a three-month unpaid internship, for example. There are numerous non profit-making or social organisations where a young person can acquire exciting, interesting experiences. However, such organisations are often unable to pay any remuneration for the internship. The key factor should be the duration of an internship. In the case of any internship lasting longer than six months, the employer can rely on productive output from the intern. From then on, remuneration should also be paid. The decision made today is impracticable and goes too far. We therefore do not support this part of the resolution.

 Combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography is vitally important. We must use all our strength to combat the availability of child pornography in communications networks. The permanent and effective control of child abuse is both a political responsibility and a precept of the rule of law.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the current debate on a functioning system of European economic governance, the long-term perspective is being neglected, in my opinion. Now is the right time to incorporate the short-term stabilisation measures into a long-term strategy. We need a vision of a market economy. The fundamental principle of the social market economy is already laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon. We must now bring it to life. The social market economy was the successful model behind Germany’s economic miracle. Walter Eugen, the guiding light of the economic miracle, remarked as early as 1950 that the economic activity of the state should focus on designing the regulatory systems for the economy and not on managing the economic processes. Therefore, I am calling for a regulatory approach, in other words, measures taken by the state to influence the basic conditions of economic activity by means of general legislation. It is not the state which creates jobs, but it must create a regulatory framework for job creation and this is what we need to focus on. Competitiveness is not the start but the result of economic activity. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, as we have heard, the financial markets need to be packaged in a new regulatory framework so that in future, we can avoid the excesses that have led to the crisis. However, if we highlight the underlying causes of the indebtedness of governments, then it becomes clear that, here in Parliament, we talk too much about public debt and too little about how we can achieve prosperity and growth. What determines our growth? Our growth and prosperity depend on people in the European Union developing products and generating new ideas that can also be sold on the global market. It is therefore right that one chapter in the EU 2020 strategy is Innovation Union. We need to focus on inventions and on how we can reinforce research and development. With that, it is important that we enhance the synergies of research funding and regional development policy. A great deal more could be done in those areas. Together with the Liberals and the German Free Democratic Party (FDP), I would argue that we focus on small and medium-sized enterprises. We should see to it that we, as the EU, spend our funding so that SMEs really get access to that funding and so that there is a technology transfer between universities and colleges and SMEs. We should encourage people to take their destinies into their own hands through personal responsibility and self-initiative. Governments cannot create jobs; they need to be created in the economy itself. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Takkula has just said, cyanide technology is a common method in mining. However, as we have heard, it is highly dangerous. The disaster that Mrs Băsescu just mentioned contaminated the Danube at the time and shocked us all, and you know that I campaign strongly for the Danube region. For that reason, as a trade politician, I wonder what can we do about it? In the European Union, we only have limited gold mining capacities. The goal is to make a difference worldwide with technical innovations. Here, there is high technology, I know. In Germany environmental technologies were developed that will help to avoid cyanide in the future. We must make these European high technologies commercially viable and we must make them affordable. I see great potential for trade in this. We should not confine ourselves to the European Union, but ensure that here, we also achieve a breakthrough in international trade, in the interests of the environment and our economy.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate about the euro, the debate about Greece, has defined recent days. I would like to draw your attention, at this point, to what strikes me as a disturbing piece of news, namely that 40% of Germans now believe that the introduction of the euro was a mistake. We have to be disturbed by that, because the introduction of a Community currency is not a one-way street. Europe’s integration process is not irreversible. I believe that we must keep the promise that we gave the German people when they gave up their national currency, namely, that the euro would be just as stable as the German mark. I am also firmly convinced that we in Europe need a discussion about the social market economy, about the regulatory framework. We should not be talking about how we are making Germany less competitive. Instead, we should be discussing how we can make the whole of Europe competitive so that we can be successful on global markets. That is what our aim must be; that is why I am calling for a debate on the social market economy in Europe. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

 The European Commission’s negotiations relating to the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) have raised a few questions. Although the agreement deals with justified concerns, namely combating the counterfeiting and smuggling of products and brands, it needs to be more firmly based on our European principles. It must not lead to the harmonisation of copyright law, patent law or trade mark law in the EU – on the contrary, the principle of subsidiarity must remain our most important principle. Trade agreements must not be misused in order to curtail the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals. Before Parliament can give the approval that is required for the ratification of this agreement, significant improvements still need to be made, and not only in terms of content. Parliament must be involved to a greater degree in the negotiations and the negotiation documents must be made available to us in full. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

 Mr President, the Goldstone report describes human rights violations by both sides. Over 1 400 victims in the Gaza Strip are obviously too many. However, I am also certain that, without the rocket attacks on Israel, there would have been no military response. During a visit to the country by the Delegation to Israel, we discovered that Israel does not take military action lightly. The main accusation of the Goldstone report, that Israel deliberately and continually attacked civilians, does not hold water. The question of the extent to which Hamas used civilians as shields has not been adequately investigated. However, the report mentions that the Israeli army provided warnings by means of telephone calls and flyers. Hamas did nothing like this in connection with the rocket attacks on Israel. However, we also need to ask whether the UN itself did enough in Gaza, for example, to prevent the Hamas rockets being fired in the vicinity of UN facilities. I do not believe that the Goldstone report is a basis for further terrorist attacks on Israel – it does not justify that. It perhaps does not help any further, either. However, it is clear that, here in the European Parliament, we must demand respect for human rights and call on both sides to return to the peace process. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

Madam President, Commissioner, firstly I would like to congratulate you on your appointment as commissioner. We are pleased to see such an astute and successful politician and a well-known Liberal on the Commission. You will need all your powers of persuasion to bring a new impetus to international trade policy in the EU. We must fight against any protectionist tendencies. History clearly shows that countries which have taken part in world trade have enjoyed better growth than those which did not. We are also facing a new world order. Some of the players involved, for example, China, have State capitalist systems, but may be using quite different methods in this arena. Therefore, I call on the Commission to develop a new strategy for world trade. It is clear that we must move forward with the Doha development round, because a multilateral approach is the right one. However, we will need all our efforts to make progress in relation to China. Michael Theurer,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon is opening a new chapter in the cooperation between the Commission, the Council and Parliament. The right of codecision of the European Parliament that has been directly elected by the citizens of Europe gives us the opportunity to bring democracy back into decisions on trade policy. This is the right thing to do, because it will have consequences for employees and consumers in the Member States. Free and fair trade forms the basis for Europe’s prosperity. We must therefore firmly oppose any protectionist tendencies. Free trade agreements like this one with South Korea can make an important contribution to stimulating world trade, growth and employment. However, it is in the nature of agreements of this kind, that, depending on their specific structure, they bring more benefits for some sectors of industry than for others. It is our job in Parliament to weigh up carefully the impact on different industries and sectors within the EU. In order to do this, we need the relevant data and impact assessments and it is the Commission’s task to provide them. However, despite many requests from the committee and in the plenary session, we have not yet received data which we believe to be satisfactory. This is the reason why the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has joined with other groups to ask this question. According to the information that we have received so far, the agreement offers opportunities for the service, mechanical engineering and plant construction, chemical and agricultural industries in the European economy. However, the concern is that the agreement will have a negative impact on the car industry and the textile and electronics sectors. The free trade agreement with South Korea is the only agreement with a developed country which does not include a ban on duty drawbacks. This may lead to one-sided cost benefits for South Korean industry. As the Commission has assured us on several occasions, the provisions on the duty drawback include a safeguard clause, which allows for a waiver on the basis of certain criteria. However, we urgently need to clarify this in the interests of the companies involved. The system must be applicable in practice. It must not be the case that the safeguard clauses are worthless because the companies cannot provide the necessary proof. As the agreement seems to contain one-sided regulations and as it sets a precedent for future agreements, for example, with India or with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, we feel that the specific wording of the safeguard clauses, the procedure for settling disputes and the other regulations relating to the application of the agreement are of central importance. We are therefore calling on the Commission to submit the free trade agreement together with the provisions on its application to Parliament for approval. We want a decision quickly. For this reason, a provisional version of the agreement must not be allowed to come into force. I know from discussions with companies what an important impact the implementation has. Therefore, my question to the Commission is as follows: Will the development of the European External Action Service lead to it playing a stronger role in trade policy? In our opinion, at least, this should be included. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against tax fraud is a necessity. Of course, tax evasion and tax fraud are not the causes of the economic and financial crisis. It seems important to me to make it clear once again in this House that we must regain the confidence of the taxpayer through simple tax systems and through low and fair taxes. However, that is not to say that we should not actively fight tax evasion and tax fraud, because any tax evasion undermines our sense of justice. That also brings us to the subject of tax havens. Germany’s neighbour, Switzerland, has voiced concerns that it is being placed under pressure. On this point, I would like to ask the Commission specifically: are proposals being made, or rather, are measures being taken to place Switzerland under particular pressure? My personal view is that Switzerland cannot afford to treat the EU any less well than the USA. Therefore, that means that Switzerland must actually join in our concerted efforts to fight tax evasion.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the importance of the Danube Region is evident by the very fact that 80 million people in six EU Member States and in four neighbouring countries live along the Danube. In the Black Forest – 100 km away as the crow flies – the Danube begins and then flows down to the delta and into the Black Sea. Therefore, we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe support the call for a Danube Strategy and, as the European Parliament, we are also making an important point this evening by having the subject of the Danube Strategy on the agenda. Twenty years after the collapse of the Iron Curtain, after putting an end to the division of Europe, the Danube is once again a symbol of unification. From a founder member of the EU, Germany, via Austria, which joined in 1995, through to the new Member States in Central and Eastern Europe that joined in 2004, the Danube also connects neighbouring countries like the accession country Croatia as well as other neighbouring countries that have aspirations for accession. It is therefore almost possible to see the reunification of Europe along the Danube. Ladies and gentlemen – and this is something to which the ALDE Group attaches a great deal of importance – we now need to take the appropriate measures to also make the Danube Strategy a regional policy priority in the new funding period. There are many ways to go about this. One option is for small and medium-sized enterprises to conclude more mutual partnerships. There are, of course, other major tasks in the area of infrastructure. This is particularly important to the ALDE Group because, as a result of the division of Europe, the historical transport links were broken and have not been modernised. Therefore, the development of the Danube as an inland waterway, the modernisation and improvement of its ports, locks and passability will provide an environmentally sound method of transport. However, work still needs to be done on the road and rail network. It is also particularly important that we involve the municipalities, towns, districts and the citizens in this. Michael Theurer  (ALDE
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, funding for the regions and structural funding form part of our practical economic policy and make Europe widely visible. In local authority areas, towns and municipalities in the regions, different players are working closely together. For this reason, we must retain this integrated approach for the entire European Union. I call on the Commission to focus much more closely on small and medium-sized enterprises and to involve the local authority areas, the towns and the municipalities much more in the future cohesion policy. We will definitely need to invest in the infrastructure in future, but most importantly, we must ensure that innovation and technology transfer are guaranteed for small and medium-sized enterprises. In future, we should also enable jobs to be subsidised. These are the crucial issues in choosing a new direction for the structural and cohesion policy in the European Union. Michael Theurer,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, two weeks ago, the Seventh Session of the World Trade Organisation Ministerial Conference was held in Geneva. I had the opportunity, as the representative of the delegation of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, to attend the conference and, as co-author, to contribute to the present joint motion for a resolution. There are four lessons that can and need to be learned from these experiences. The economic and financial crisis also brought a sharp fall in world trade. A speedy conclusion to the negotiations in the Doha Round is therefore crucial in order to give new impetus to the world economy. The revival of fair and free world trade is something that Doha can, and indeed must, achieve. The European Union has gone a long way to accommodate its partners, in particular those in the developing countries. For example, we have promised to abolish all export subsidies for agricultural products. Now we need to bring the negotiations to a conclusion. For this to happen, we need a signal of political will. In the ALDE Group, we are determined to achieve a conclusion to Doha. Now! It is therefore vital to join forces in order to bring the Round to a conclusion. The European Union can and must play a leading role in this. We should also take on a bridging role, for example, to bring together the United States and the emerging economies and developing countries, just as we call for in our joint resolution. We must now also raise the public’s awareness. We need broader support from the citizens. We should emphasise the advantages of global trade, as free and fair world trade is good for all of us. I do not see any alternative to Doha. The alternative would be competition for bilateral agreements, which would put access for the weaker countries and the inclusion of human rights and environmental aims at risk. That must not happen. We therefore need a conclusion to the Doha Round now. Michael Theurer  (ALDE
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have drawn up a major resolution which covers a number of themes. However, one important point – trade – is only touched on briefly. I believe that international trade is a decisive factor. The fall in world trade is one of the causes of the economic and financial crisis and I would like to see a greater focus on world trade, even now in the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC). It is not the case that the US and the European Union agree on every area. On the contrary, we have only a few trade agreements, there is a risk of bilateralism and there is the possibility that the Doha Development Round will not be continued by the US. Therefore, we should address the critical points and I hope that the TEC will introduce some new stimuli to revive international trade. Michael Theurer  (ALDE

 Mr President, I would like to congratulate you warmly on your speech. The process of bringing an end to the division of Europe was the result, on the one hand, of the desire for freedom among Central and Eastern European countries and, on the other, of course, of the attractiveness of Europe as an economic model. I believe that we have too little confidence, too little confidence in the future. If we cannot achieve this in Europe, then who can? We should explain with greater conviction that we can work on resolving our problems with confidence. We have a great deal of potential and there are still opportunities for growth throughout the world. While there are still people in the world who need goods and services, there will still be opportunities for growth. We can make sure that in Europe, we have a slice of this cake and everyone involved will benefit. I would like to encourage all of us to have more confidence in Europe as a successful model and I would like to ask you to convey this idea in your speeches. Michael Theurer,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank you, Commissioner Ashton, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, for the information that you have given us this evening in the extraordinary committee meeting and here in plenary. Clearly, the free trade agreement with South Korea is close to being concluded. From a Liberal viewpoint, and particularly from the point of view of my own German Free Democratic Party, the objective of free and fair world trade is of great importance, particularly right now, as, in the course of the economic and financial crisis, we see tendencies towards protectionism, tendencies which must be resolutely countered in the interests of prosperity and jobs in the European Union. In this context, the question arises of what significance the Commission attaches to the free trade agreement with South Korea, as there has, for a long time, been a focus on progress in the Doha development round, without any agreement being reached so far. That is the reason behind my question, Commissioner Ashton: do you see concluding the free trade agreement with South Korea as a first step towards further bilateral free trade agreements, and does that, in your view, mean a move away from Doha? Or are such bilateral agreements merely a supplement to or expansion of the European Union’s free trade policy? As you know, furthermore, the clause on the refunding of duties is a cause of concern in a number of Member States and sectors of industry – in particular, in the car industry. This clause could lead to supporting business in low-cost countries such as India and China, thereby threatening European manufacturing. Can you see a way that these concerns on the part of a number of Member States in respect of such refunding of duties can still be addressed? Nadja Hirsch,

 Mr President, it is necessary to change the year, because we have already decided that 2015 should be the European Year of Development.

 I abstained from today’s vote, as the report presents the internet as a source of dangers to children and young people in too one-sided a way. It also intends to protect them by taking measures whose effects on freedom of expression on the internet cannot be foreseen. Too little reference is made to the huge opportunities that the internet offers young people, in the areas of education and participation for example. I also consider effectively disempowering parents by means of an ‘educational alliance’ among families, schools and civil society to be a crucial point. Instead of creating an artificial safe area for children, we should make sure that children and young people are empowered to use the internet confidently and independently. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE

 In addition to supporting the ‘eight hours’ campaign, the alternative resolution also contains a call for a legislative proposal introducing a ban on cloning. On balance, I decided to support the alternative resolution, despite the call for a ban on cloning, as limiting the transport time for farmed animals to eight hours is something that takes absolute priority. For one thing, the European Parliament has supported a written declaration in this regard. In addition, more than 1 000 000 people throughout the EU have put their signature to the ‘eight hours’ campaign. It is therefore only logical that the demand of the majority in Parliament and one of the first citizens’ initiatives should be reflected in the EU Animal Welfare Strategy. Nadja Hirsch,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is actually absurd. With regard to this important subject of a resettlement programme, we have achieved agreement across all of the groups. Many of the Member States are already implementing resettlement programmes. In other words, there is broad consensus that this is necessary and, above all, that it is not only an urgent, but also a highly volatile situation – as demonstrated in particular by the current situation in Africa. Thus, it is actually absurd that, even though there is agreement from almost all sides, this can founder simply as a result of the technical implementation. It is the duty of both the European Parliament – we are aware of this and that is why we have tabled a proposal – and the Council to assume responsibility here and to push this matter forward. I have experienced the Polish Presidency to be very creative, also in connection with the asylum package. It has tabled new proposals. For that reason, I am really placing my hope in the fact that you will now see the opportunity and present us with a proposal that is workable for the Council, the Commission and for us as Parliament, and that now, as we are in any case all in agreement, we can finally also tackle the implementation and – as Mr Tavares also said – can finally bridge that period that costs some people their lives. That is something that we need to be aware of in relation to this matter. I do not mean to be dramatic here, but each additional day that it takes us can cost someone’s life. Nadja Hirsch,

Madam President, Commissioner, a good education policy is the best kind of employment policy. It is true that many highly qualified people are currently unemployed, but despite this, the people who have no education or few qualifications are also the ones who have little or no chance of finding a job, even when the economy recovers and the labour market takes off again. Therefore, it is precisely these people that we should be concerned about. It is our responsibility to ensure that these people have the chance of a new life. I would like to point out that 14.4% of pupils in the EU leave school early and this is an average, which means that in some places, the figure is much higher. What is happening to all these young people? They will have no opportunity in the foreseeable future, regardless of whether or not the economy is growing, to live an independent life or get a well-paid job. For this reason, we must invest in this area. I believe that, while it is a good thing for the European Parliament to call for this to happen, it is primarily the responsibility of the Member States. It is up to us to demonstrate which projects are already running successfully. At the moment, there is a model pilot project which involves looking after early school leavers and providing a youth guarantee. The project is attracting attention to this subject and giving it a high priority. This is a key issue on which we need to take action. In addition, there are, of course, all the people who already have a job. We must not forget that in many countries, the talk is of people retiring much later. My generation will probably retire at 70, if at all. This also means that it is not enough to train once for a job. We must invest in further education and make flexible and attractive training available within the European Union, so that people can continue their education alongside their family life. These are all factors that we need to take into account and I am confident that we will be successful and will take a step in the right direction. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE
).

Mr President, Mr Mleczko, it is not the case that we are starting from nothing. We should always remember that we in Europe have a good minimum standard in comparison with many other countries. Regardless of that, the Commission has submitted a new proposal. It is simply a result of the timing that the situation with regard to equality has changed. Therefore, the Commission proposal was a wise move, a step forward, which sent out a clear signal, but, at the same time, it was sufficiently moderate, at 18 weeks and 75%, that it would have been practicable. Unfortunately, I can only agree with the other speaker. Here in the European Parliament, a small majority put together a huge wish list. At the moment, it is sadly the case that we must either stick with this wish list or get nothing. I would like to make it quite clear to you that I would rather we took the new Commission proposal as our basis, so that we can at least move forward. Each individual country can then decide whether to add other provisions. Then it will be up to every individual Member State to raise its own standards even further. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE

 The German Free Democratic Party delegation in the European Parliament assumes that the inclusion of Romania and Bulgaria in the Schengen area will further improve freedom of movement within the EU. Now that both Member States have achieved positive evaluation results in all areas of the Schengen review, there should be no more obstacles to delay inclusion further. There is no denying that the technical securing of borders will not automatically make them impermeable as long as problems persist in combating corruption in the justice and policing system. Accordingly, this challenge also relates to Member States already in the Schengen area. For this reason, the German Free Democratic Party delegation believes that criteria such as the fight against corruption must receive greater attention when evaluating the Schengen mechanism, and any misdemeanours must be punished appropriately. Nadja Hirsch,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, tomorrow, we will vote on the role of vocational education and training in the Europe 2020 strategy. In this connection, it is worth taking a brief look at the position we are starting from. We currently have a level of youth unemployment of 21%, in other words, almost double the normal average. We have an EU-wide school drop-out rate of over 14%. The participation of women in gainful employment is still very low. Many people with disabilities, as well as migrants, are without jobs. The goal of the Europe 2020 strategy is precisely to tap this potential in terms of workers and to bring them into the workplace so that the EU, too, can deal with globalisation. Thus, it is also our job to ensure that initial vocational education in particular is of high quality. The discussion began in connection with the Copenhagen process, followed by the Bruges Communiqué, and now it is up to us to see to what extent this area can also be incorporated into the Europe 2020 strategy. An absolutely key element is the fact that young people must have the opportunity, not only in their studies, but also in their vocational training, to undertake part of their training in another EU Member State. It is a key element because someone who has already worked in another Member State will also take the opportunity later on to regard the European labour market as his or her labour market, with all the opportunities that that offers. It is therefore an absolutely key aspect that we must pursue. The second major area is, of course, that of further training. On account of demographic change, people are having to work for longer and longer – or they can work for longer, but everyone has to take that decision for themselves. People are living until they are much older and will continue with their careers for much longer, and in order to be able to carry on in skilled work until they are older, they will also need to undertake further training. There is currently a very low level of participation in further training initiatives. Here, too, it must be ensured that the willingness of both employers and workers exists and increases when it comes to taking advantage of further training and continuing to gain education by means of lifelong learning. For this, of course, the options on offer also need to be flexible. We must take everyone into consideration. Further training must fit in with other elements of people’s lives and it must be possible to do it alongside work and family life. For that reason, we clearly need to create flexible opportunities in future. The area of universities has received a great deal of attention – in connection with the Bologna Process, for example – and a similar situation faces us in the area of vocational training, including with regard to mobility. We could almost say that no one has noticed this. Nevertheless, alongside the universities, the area of vocational education and training is particularly important and we therefore must not ignore it. For that reason, I would like at this point to thank my fellow Members from the other groups once again for their very committed cooperation. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE

Madam President, the borders have been removed for the first time in Germany and Austria and we finally have free movement for workers from the countries of Eastern Europe. On the one hand, borders are being torn down, while on the other you are trying to build barriers yet again. I find it impossible to accept that two Member States and two gentlemen looking to make a name for themselves have managed to bring the issue of the reintroduction of border controls back to the debating chamber. There is no going back on this matter and we cannot allow ourselves to be put under pressure by this single-issue discussion. The refugee problem cannot be automatically resolved by returning to a regime of border controls. Pardon me. These people have risked their lives in making their way to Europe and they will also succeed in bypassing border crossings. The only ones who stand to gain from the reintroduction of border controls would be the human traffickers because the refugees would have to find new ways to cross the borders, providing the human traffickers with a new source of income. I cannot accept the fact that we are seriously contemplating this matter and I would call on the Commission not to compromise here. Nadja Hirsch,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, Mrs Malmström, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs most sincerely. We had very many debates. In the end, we reached some very good compromises, even though we all know that it is not always quite so easy, of course. On behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, however, I would like to say that, in any case, we still have the goal of establishing a common, EU-wide asylum system by 2012. That also means that we must now make some real progress and also send a clear signal to the Council that we have not lost sight of this goal and that we are, of course, still prepared to enter into negotiations. That goes without saying. However, I also believe that we need to make it clear that, above all, we want a common asylum system. It is not acceptable, as has already been said, for it to be almost like a lottery depending on where an asylum seeker makes his application. It is not acceptable – and in this regard I am pleased that, at the last minute, we achieved success here – for every individual Member State to have its own national list of what constitutes a safe third country. Either a country is safe or it is not – and then it still must be examined in each individual case whether it can, in fact, be a safe third country for the particular person who has made an application or whether, in this individual situation, it is perhaps not possible to simply say that is the case as such. I am also convinced that, ultimately, the Member States will benefit from this, but so will the asylum seekers, who will have the chance, in future, to receive a ruling directly at the first instance in a fair and nevertheless rapid application procedure if this is implemented in the way that we envisage it. I believe this also to be a right; asylum is a right, not a favour. We must take an absolutely clear position on this and then also have a clear procedure. Above all, I welcome the fact that we have managed to further extend the rights of minors. I am in favour of that and so is the ALDE Group, and I will be pleased if we get a good result in this regard tomorrow. Nadja Hirsch,

 Mr President, the resettlement programme is something that we worked extremely intensively on, investing a lot of energy, across all group divides and allegiances. We were unanimous in wanting to send out a clear signal on this matter. We also made it our top priority simply because it is such an important issue: people’s lives are at stake. Nonetheless, the situation and ongoing developments in North Africa mean that we are called on once again to produce results in double-quick time. We have already lost one year. We have made the best use of the time available to provoke a civil and social debate because, in the final analysis, we also need the support of the Member States, regional authorities and the local population if such a programme is to become established in the new Member States, too. This discussion and the social consensus that has gradually resulted cannot be abandoned just because the Council and other key players are unable to agree and have reached an impasse. The issue is too important. We have instigated this debate and, true to our liberal credentials, our aim is to make this matter a genuine priority. I believe that we have agreement across all the groups in Parliament. We have signalled our position and now await a clear course to be set by the Council so that the issue will be placed on the agenda and that the other Member States that have so far not played an active role will now be encouraged to get involved. The feedback that we have received during our discussions indicates that these Member States are willing to come on board. For this reason, the main concern on the part of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe – although I believe I can speak for all the groups involved because the level of cooperation was really excellent – is that this matter should be given priority and the debate that we have engendered on a broad social level should be encouraged, rather than jeopardised by continuously the matter being continuously put on the long finger.

 Madam President, as the rapporteur for the opinion on the report on equality, I concentrated on the labour market. Unfortunately, the pay differential is still 17% and women are still not always represented in management and supervisory boards. There is an urgent need for action here. We can no longer afford to waste the potential of females in society, whatever their age. We have a good level of education and the state invests in these young women and mothers. We really do need to make progress here and demand that companies finally put their fine words into action. To this extent, I welcome the fact that companies really are taking a step in the direction of a voluntary quota. However, on the other side, any report on equality should not forget that men are also disadvantaged in some respects. In particular, boys are not always given the opportunity to develop in school. Deficits exist in the area of housework and childcare and men can become more active here, too. This is one task we should all adopt for ourselves. Each of us, whatever our gender, should be given an opportunity to find our niche and live our lives as we see fit. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE

 Mr President, Mrs Malmström, we are talking today about the judgment passed by the European Court of Human Rights. This is ultimately about Belgium, but it concerns every Member State of the European Union. Germany has also decided no longer to send asylum seekers back to Greece. As one of my fellow Members has mentioned, we must ask ourselves whether we want to build walls around Europe or whether we want to maintain and develop the right to asylum, something which I, as a Liberal, strongly support. However, this also means that we must give every asylum seeker the chance of a properly organised process. We must realise that it is unfair and shows a lack of solidarity if we allow the southern countries to bear the entire burden alone. Because of their geographical position, these countries have been exposed to an increased influx of refugees. In Lampedusa, this is because of current events in Tunisia. However, this is also an ongoing situation which the local asylum authorities cannot cope with. The recent liberalisation with regard to Kosovo also resulted in a huge influx of asylum seekers into Germany just a few weeks ago. We also had the problem that we could not initially process all the applications properly. Therefore, if we really want to retain this right to asylum, we must restructure the system to ensure that it offers greater solidarity in future. Dublin II cannot continue in its current form.

 Madam President, Mrs Malmström, we were all pleased, as were the citizens of Europe, about the revolution in Egypt and Tunisia and the fact that values such as freedom and democracy were suddenly on the agenda. Images from these countries have dominated the news over the last few days. However, for two or three days, we have also been seeing pictures of the streams of refugees and people in boats on our television screens and in our newspapers. We must act quickly to ensure that we do not miss this historic moment and that it is not only the pictures of refugees which remain in our memories. We must remember what these countries have really achieved. We must explain to the public that although a lot of people are coming here, the majority of them will go back, because they have no right to asylum as we define it. Of course, we have to ask ourselves the question which is frequently posed about economic migrants. One thing is clear. If these young people have no future prospects, they will come back. Perhaps not the same people, but constant streams of new migrants. This is why we need to deal with this problem now. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE

 In overall terms, the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament supports the waste disposal directive. However, the subject of photovoltaic modules remains a problem. There is no understandable reason for excluding the entire sector from the regulations. We have a wide range of legislation governing waste streams. Therefore, it is not clear why a complete industry, which is expected to produce significant waste streams, is being exempted. For this reason, some of the FDP Members of the European Parliament have abstained from voting on the report. Nadja Hirsch,

 Mr President, we have agreed in the European Parliament that we want a common European asylum system to be in place by 2012. This also involves having the same or similar conditions in all the Member States. However, the implementation of the system has met with resistance and that is primarily due to the fact that during the discussions on the asylum package, we were given inadequate information, sometimes no information at all, or even conflicting information. We had very little data as the basis for the financial estimates relating to the Procedures Directive and the costs in the Member States. Our aim is to call on the Commission to provide Parliament with a study or with the necessary information. This concerns areas such as the interpreting service and also legal advice. It is not clear what effects this will actually have in the Member States. On the other hand, during the process of revising the Procedures Directive, it has become clear that we can produce a high quality, fast procedure which is of benefit to both sides, because it helps decisions to be made quickly so that the situation is clear to people and there is a low error rate. Our objective as liberals is to give the Commission our complete support for its plans. However, we need arguments, including in the discussions with the Member States, which will demonstrate the effects of the revision of this asylum package and, in particular, the Procedures Directive. For this reason, we are calling on the Commission to give us genuine support to ensure that this asylum package becomes reality by 2012, so that we can establish a common European asylum system.

 Madam President, Commissioner, as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I, too, would like to express my sincere thanks to the two rapporteurs. Thank you for your cooperation. I think we have put together a good document today. We can take a decision on something today that can really put paid to human trafficking. However, the challenge will be getting the Member States to put this directive into practice. It is crucial that the enforcement bodies, such as the police and the courts, are made aware of how to actually recognise and to prosecute this crime. This is vital, and it is also very important to raise public awareness – as Mrs Matera has already mentioned – so that people are aware of the fact that human trafficking is happening within the EU. It is not just happening somewhere else; theoretically, it could also be happening right outside my front door. Another important point that, as Liberals from Germany in particular, we had difficulty with – although this has now been resolved in a positive manner by empowering the Member States – is the criminalisation of people who make use of this sort of service, because if someone is liable to prosecution, he can refuse to make a statement in a subsequent trial. If someone makes use of this right to refuse to give evidence – for example, a man who had been with a prostitute who had been endangered through human trafficking – information will be lost that could be used further to finally uncover this network of human traffickers. It is therefore a good thing that this rests with the Member States, and I would like to thank you very much for your cooperation. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE

Madam President, the question that we must ask ourselves is what is this directive intended to achieve? There is relatively substantial agreement that there should be health protection for mothers-to-be and new mothers. The great debate concerns the areas in which the aspect of equality should also be included. On the other hand, as the European Parliament, we also need to be aware that we are adopting a directive that will be in force not just for five years, but perhaps for the next 20 or 25 years. However, I hope that by then, women’s working conditions will be substantially better and companies will be keen to employ young mothers – not least because of a shortage of skilled labour – and, above all, will also build up the appropriate infrastructure for this. We need to bear in mind this perspective too. Notwithstanding this, I also realise that at present, we do not have a majority that is prepared to adopt this perspective. In view of this, we will probably arrive at a point where we agree on a compromise such as eighteen weeks, a higher rate of statutory payments or the continued payment of 75% of salary, which will indeed bring about an improvement in some European countries in particular. A much more important point, and one which goes beyond the aspect of maternity leave, is the framework conditions surrounding young families. This means childcare facilities; in Germany, for example, there are still not enough of these. That would be a real equality policy that gives women a chance to go back to work. Nadja Hirsch,

 Mr President, I think it is right and proper for us to be championing the cause of a coordinated cohesion and regional policy. This is extremely important in order to deliver efficiency and to be able to use the money well, despite the limited amounts in question. I must warn, however, that the plan is to achieve this efficiency by applying one and the same set of rules to everyone. The funds are very varied, have very different target groups and different contents. With that in mind, coordination is very important but the same rules are not. That is exactly what we are experiencing with the European Social Fund at the moment, which is to say that it would be extremely well received by just those little communities, municipalities, if – just as the speaker before me said – for these small bodies on the ground, in particular, such an enormous amount of time and effort did not have to be spent in order to actually be able to access and use this money. That is exactly what we need though, as unemployment, poverty and socially excluded people are to be found in every Member State of the European Union, not just in certain regions, but in every Member State. With that in mind, I find it particularly important that the European Social Fund, in particular, should truly continue to be available to minorities, which, to an extent, also includes young people, but also the elderly and often people from an immigrant background, in future and actually, that it should be more available, in order to give these people the chance to enter the labour market, as that is precisely what we are aiming to achieve. The Europe 2020 strategy represents our attempt to achieve greater inclusion in the labour market for the different groups. I hope that that will not remain simply a goal; instead, we now have to genuinely provide the measures and the instruments to achieve it. The European Social Fund is a very effective tool in this regard. We just need to optimise it and, above all, make it useable. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE

 I cannot support the animal experiments directive in its current form. It is true that this version is more progressive that the old directive from 1986. However, in comparison with the huge scientific and technical advances made over the last 24 years, the measures for replacing animal testing seem very feeble. There are too many exceptions. In addition, the wording is weak and allows too much scope for interpretation and implementation. It is also absurd that Member States cannot put in place animal welfare measures which are stricter than those required by the EU. Market distortion is given as the justification for this. This sends the wrong message to the citizens of Europe, to the research community and to industry. On the one hand, the state must take into account the changes in citizens’ ethical awareness. On the other hand, more pressure must be exerted on the research sector and on industry. No one wants to put the status of Germany or Europe as a research location at risk, but investment costs are not a valid argument for postponing the further development and use of methods which do not involve laboratory animals.

 The German Free Democratic Party is fundamentally in favour of positive labelling (process labelling) of genetically modified organisms at a European level in order to ensure the necessary transparency for consumers. However, in this case, we were not able to vote in favour of the report, because it proposes unequal treatment for different sectors. It calls for labelling for foods of animal origin, but not for those of plant origin. Unfair labelling of this kind for products of animal origin could distort the market to the disadvantage of one side. This counteracts our efforts to ensure fair competition and is clearly in conflict with the principle of equality enshrined in our legal system.

 It is certainly important to tighten the regulations on internships. The representatives of the German Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament have supported this. Young people often work for months on end without payment, hoping that they might still get a permanent job afterwards. This is an unsustainable situation. Internships should not destroy jobs. However, today’s plenary vote is going to pave the way in the future for a complete ban on unpaid internships. We believe that this gives a wrong message. It should still be possible to do a three-month unpaid internship, for example. There are numerous non profit-making or social organisations where a young person can acquire exciting, interesting experiences. However, such organisations are often unable to pay any remuneration for the internship. The key factor should be the duration of an internship. In the case of any internship lasting longer than six months, the employer can rely on productive output from the intern. From then on, remuneration should also be paid. The decision made today is impracticable and goes too far. We therefore do not support this part of the resolution. Nadja Hirsch,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, what we all discussed on this subject was that we simply must convince more Member States to take part in this programme. I believe there is much to be achieved in this regard by explaining the programme and also highlighting its benefits, as those who take part have thus far always said that they will continue to do so and that they welcome the programme. It is very important to make clear which people this relates to. It relates to people who do not, themselves, have the power to come to Europe. These are women, children and the sick, who find themselves in refugee camps outside the EU and need our help. I think it is very positive that we will be deciding to make a larger proportion of the European Refugee Fund available in future. At the same time, I also believe that it is very important that this money, if it is paid to the national Parliaments, the nation states, in other words, must not just disappear into the budget, but it really must be used in order to build a durable structure, that the money, in fact, even has to be passed on to the local authorities and to the towns and cities where the integration actually takes place, where the nursery places and housing are provided. It is a very important point that the towns and cities and the local authorities, as our allies, must be involved in this discussion. The Member States are perhaps more inclined to reject this in the short term than the local authorities on the ground. In the predictability that this brings with it, I see an important element connecting us – the EU – and those on the ground bringing about the integration. All together, this could certainly give a boost to the resettlement programme, something that I think is very positive. Above all, there is one thing that needs to be stated very clearly, which is that the citizens cannot be left behind – people and associations must be found who ease the path of people who want to start a new life locally and who show them how their new town works or where the nearest swimming pool is. We need a cross-society consensus that we want to take part in a resettlement programme, that it is a good solution, and that people will actually bring about integration on the ground.

According to the resolution of the European Parliament on the draft general budget for the financial year 2010, adopted on 17 December 2009, a vote was taken today on the amending budget for the European Parliament, following the revised calculations made by the Parliamentary administration. The FDP in the European Parliament abstained, because there was a paragraph in the package of amendments concerned that we could not reconcile with our convictions. The FDP had already expressed its opposition to an increase in the secretarial allowance to EUR 1 500 during the discussions in committee. It is out of the secretarial allowance that MEPs’ assistants are paid. The FDP considers that the argument that more money is needed due to the additional work that MEPs have to do with the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is unsound, as there is nothing in past experience to support this. Certainly, due to the Treaty of Lisbon, which has just come into force, Parliament will overall need extra capacity for legislative work, but with the introduction of the Assistants’ Statute from the beginning of the current parliamentary term, there is still no proof that MEPs actually need more assistants. For this reason, there are grounds for concern that further demands and supplementary increases, or an extension of office capacity, will follow. For this reason, the FDP in the European Parliament abstained. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE

Madam President, firstly, congratulations to Mr Füle on his appointment as Commissioner. I would also like to congratulate Mr Swoboda, the rapporteur, on his report. It is a very balanced presentation of the progress made in Croatia. At the same time, it clearly indicates the areas where Croatia still has work to do in order to be able to complete the accession process. It is also significant that statistics taken from a Eurobarometer survey carried out in the autumn of last year show that 84% of Croats are dissatisfied with democracy in their country. This means that not only are reforms to the judiciary required, but also an improvement in the situation of minorities. It is also important to ensure that the freedom of the press is guaranteed. These reforms must be initiated and implemented and, above all, they must be supported by the population. In formal terms, the criteria can certainly be met very quickly, but the entire population must be behind the process and must welcome Croatia’s accession to the EU. Nadja Hirsch  (ALDE

 Madam President, we have the European Year against Poverty and Exclusion. Women are still at a very high risk of becoming poor or having to live in poverty. There are many small steps which land them in that position: girls tend to choose jobs which do not pay so well. They then decide to have children, which often leads them to only be able to work part-time. Alternatively, they might decide to look after their parents or grandparents, which again puts older women in a situation where they are unable to return to work. These periods add up and, as a result, women’s professional careers progress much more slowly. This is also reflected in the fact that they have lower pensions, for example. There are many aspects to this, and many have been included in this report. The really important message we need to put across is that there are already many opportunities out there, but girls and women need to make use of them. The awareness that a girl is studying engineering, and that she is brave enough to do so – that is what we have to promote in schools. This also applies particularly to immigrant women. I would also like to make another point: if you look around the Chamber today, you will see that two thirds of us attending this debate are women and one third are men. We must also win men over to taking a much greater interest in this subject, so that, one day, we can have the two remaining thirds of men attending and supporting women’s issues. Nadja Hirsch,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her commitment and excellent cooperation, as this really is an important subject. As we have said already, human trafficking is perhaps the very worst form of crime. Europol’s figures, cited in the question, show that there has been no improvement in this field. The opposite is true, in fact. In the area of forced labour, specifically, the figures are going up, whilst the figures on the trafficking of women remain unchanged. It is thus absolutely clear that there is an urgent need, above all, for consistent action. In order for such action to succeed, it is necessary, first and foremost, to adopt an integrated approach in the most varied of areas. One absolutely essential element is to increase awareness – including amongst the population within Europe – that human trafficking takes place right in the middle of Europe, in every country. We need, above all, to get to work on education in this regard, as we did, for example, for the football World Cup in Germany, in order to bring the issue of forced prostitution to light, and to show that this really happens everywhere, and also to inspire debate amongst the populace so that there is an awareness there which will lead to the victims being helped. My second point concerns the protection of victims. Precisely when people are rescued from such a dramatic situation, the Member States, too, must ensure that there is medical and psychological care for them so that they are supported in going back to their countries of origin where appropriate or so that the way is opened to asylum or other similar possibilities here to find a new home and to begin a new life.

 The German Free Democratic Party members of the European Parliament have abstained from voting on the Copenhagen resolution for the following reasons. The resolution contains statements about financing for climate protection measures in third countries without defining the specific criteria or purpose of the financing. We cannot justify this to taxpayers. In addition, we believe that blanket criticism of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) is wrong. The ICAO is the organisation which deals with aviation matters at an international level. Both the criticism and the statement about the alleged failure of ICAO negotiations are incorrect and inappropriate. The call for specific arrangements for a CO2
 trading system for the aviation industry goes against current EU legislation and overburdens the EU’s negotiating position in an international climate agreement with unrealistic demands.
