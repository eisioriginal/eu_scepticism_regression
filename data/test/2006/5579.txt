 Mr President, I may perhaps be a bit late in calling halt, but this is an important question relating to Amendment 15 to paragraph 27. This paragraph discusses the abuse of children in Africa by UN troops, and the amendment asserts that the UN did not do enough to investigate it. For a start, that has nothing whatever to do with the reform of the UN, and, moreover, what it says bears no relation to the investigations the UN is carrying out. I believe I just saw that a majority supports our amendment aimed at deleting this paragraph, and I would ask you, if at all possible, to check this again.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been said, Azerbaijan is one of our partners in accordance with Europe’s neighbourhood policy, into which it was incorporated at this House’s insistence, even though – in common with all the other republics in the Southern Caucasus – it had not formed part of the first round. In Azerbaijan, then, we have a relatively demanding programme; it is on the basis of our principles, our values and our rule of law that the Azerbaijani state, too, is to act. The country report that the Commission has drawn up, which is intended to result, over the coming months, in plans of action, offers us the opportunity to give a shot in the arm to the process of democratisation and establishing the rule of law. While not using the same language in every instance, we should weigh our words when articulating criticisms and denounce really serious human rights violations for what they are. Nothing of what I have just heard from my fellow Members about the increasing number of arrests, about the absence of free elections – as Mr Meijer said – or the introduction of sharia law in Azerbaijan, which really is a tragedy – gets to grips with the reality of what is going on there. We have to bear in mind in which region the country is situated. This week, we have been discussing Uzbekistan, a country where the government had between 400 and 500 civilians shot for going on a demonstration, and here we are talking about what happened on 21 May, when a few demonstrators were arrested and then released after a few hours, and then on 4 June, when the government gave permission for a demonstration by the opposition. That may well be nowhere near our idea of what democracy and the rule of law are like, but I think we have to bear these things in mind in our assessment of these events and in the language we choose when describing them. It is indeed the case that we have to observe these elections. They are due to be held in November, and the European institutions must not make the same mistake that they did in Ukraine, where we did not at first take the elections at all seriously and did not follow their progress. Mr Solana, the High Representative, woke up to the situation only when the Ukrainian people took to the streets to demonstrate against the electoral fraud that had been going on. It follows that we in this House should, over the coming weeks and months, keep an eye on how this process progresses. We should send a delegation of observers and make use of the action plans now coming into force as a means of helping a country that is in a very difficult region, and parts of which are under occupation, yet which is determined to move towards democracy and towards becoming a good European neighbour. In so doing, we will be serving our own European interests, as well as democracy and the rule of law and human rights, better than if we were simply, with words of harsh criticism, to lay into countries with whose circumstances we are insufficiently familiar.

 Mr President, Mr Schmit, Commissioner Borg, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when the European Union is enduring and debating one crisis after another, the affirmation of belief in effective multilateralism and in a strong United Nations is a credo around which most of this House, along with the Council and the Commission, can unite. This September, in New York, the European Union should send out a clear message to the effect that we want reform and institutions that work better, and that we encourage Kofi Annan to proceed down this road. I see this as a typical example that we could put before those members of the public who think that the nation states might achieve more. The challenges that we face, though, leave us no alternative to action on a global scale. If we are to combat terrorism, to address the problems of failing states, if we are to deal with the world’s shifting climate and to campaign for human rights and democracy around the world, then we need a strong United Nations. So it is, then, that in the report to be put before the plenary tomorrow, the House’s Committee on Foreign Affairs has limited itself to responding to the High Panel’s proposals. Rather than drafting a new report on the UN in succession to the one we adopted last year, we have got to grips with what the High Panel has proposed, and one topic that has been very much on our minds in doing this has been that of collective security. Reform of the United Nations should be underpinned by the principles of prevention, awareness and shared responsibility. Something else that had a high priority for us was freedom from want, in the shape of a renewed development policy, something that ties in very well this year with the fifth anniversary of the year 2000’s Millennium Goals. The third thing that matters to us is that the institutions be renewed and made more representative and more efficient, and so we have reiterated our call for a seat for Europe. We know it is not realistic to expect to achieve this by September, but, even if Europe does not get a seat, we want it to be more present. If there are to be new seats of whatever kind, we want them to go to the European Union, which will then appoint its representatives in the Security Council. That would be a small sign that things were going in the right direction. The United Nations cannot be reformed by its Secretary-General; that is for the states to do. It is for that reason that we appeal to the European Council for the states represented within it to join together in supporting Kofi Annan and his programme of reform.

 Mr President, Mr President–
in–
Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I think that Mrs Malmström has, by dint of a great deal of effort, made a very good job of drafting this report, which makes clear not only the significance of our relations with Russia, but also the fact that Russia is not merely a partner in Europe and an anchor of stability, but has also, as a result of enlargement, become our neighbour, and that it is for that reason that we must, both today and in the future, devote particular attention to our relations with it. Russia, though, is not a candidate country; this is not a progress report in which we sit in judgment, saying, ‘that is wrong and that is wrong and there you need to do more’. In this instance, we are applying a quite different procedure. While drawing attention to violations of human rights or developments in democracy that we regard as undesirable, we should refrain from itemising what is going on in Russia and passing didactic judgment on each individual item. It is important that this summit has brought concrete results, laying a foundation on which internal and external security may be established, economic cooperation guaranteed, and joint projects in research, education and culture facilitated. What struck me as very important in today’s debate was what Commissioner Ferrero–
Waldner had to say: if the whole thing is to work, Europe must speak with one voice. In that case, it will not be acceptable for individual Member States – Germany, France or Spain – to hold separate summits with Russia and pursue a contrary policy, without, moreover, informing either our Baltic friends or the European institutions. One might be so bold as to say that Germany will refrain from such things after September of this year, but in the case of France and Spain we will, no doubt, have to live with it for some time yet. By way of a final comment, let me say that cooperation in regional conflicts appears to me to be very important. Reference has been made to Transnistria, Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Nagorno–
Karabakh, and the EU has offered to help in Chechnya as well. Rather than being limited to humanitarian operations, it must also have a political dimension, and Russia would be well advised to respond to this signal from Europe. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, any German in this House will find it particularly difficult to talk about the forthcoming Council and the Stability and Growth Pact, for you know how hard the Germans found it to abandon the Deutschmark. The only way in which the German public could be persuaded to part with the Deutschmark was with the explicit promise that there would be a Stability and Growth Pact that would draw on the tradition of the Deutschmark and maintain the currency’s long-term stability. Of course, it is particularly problematic when, out of all the Member States, it is the larger ones, such as Germany and France, who, having compelled the smaller countries – including those in southern Europe – to accept this Pact, themselves breach it, breaking its rules and even altering it when they get into difficulties. For that reason, I can only encourage the Luxembourg presidency to stick to its guns at the summit, and urge all the other members of the Council to do likewise. Altering the Pact is certainly worth thinking about; here in this House, we have heard important arguments as to why it can be applied in different ways at certain stages. The worst option, though, is to alter the Pact precisely when one has oneself broken the rules and got away scot-free, and so the sixteen-point list that Mr Juncker has put forward is the right way to go about reforming it. Our position on this issue is that the Commission’s hand must be strengthened, and it must continue to be a player. It cannot be for the Member States to decide when and where this or that special rule should apply where the Stability Pact is concerned. What the European Council should bear in mind, when coming to its conclusions on 22 and 23 March, is that the Commission must be put in a stronger position, and that there are several changes we can talk about. As this Council is meeting in a special international situation, let me add the final comment that, in the Middle East, among our Mediterranean neighbours, a lot of things are in a state of flux. There too, it is important that we should be alongside the democrats and supporting human rights. For that reason, I would like to see this Council – in contrast to what we in this House have heard from it so far – send, by the way it votes, a clear message concerning the activities of terrorists, of Hezbollah, and everything associated with them.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, having spent recent weeks and months holding highly theoretic and very intense debates on European Neighbourhood Policy, we can now see that the spirit of democracy and human rights that we breathed into this policy has now taken possession of our neighbours. First the Georgians, then the Ukrainians, and now, tentatively, the Lebanese, are standing up for the values enshrined in our Neighbourhood Policy. Secondly, among our neighbours around the Mediterranean the Palestinian Authority has been the first to organise free elections – more free than any hitherto held in the Arab world. Many Members of this House were able, in early January, to see with what pride the Palestinian people organised these democratic elections. Now, then, we must set our sights higher. If Jordan supports this peace process and Egypt does likewise, then those who want to disrupt it cannot be partners in our Neighbourhood Policy, and we must not mince our words in saying so. What that means in plain language is that Hezbollah’s offices in Damascus and its activities in Lebanon demand that we in the European Union say loud and clear that it is intolerable that President Abbas’ peace process should continue to be undermined. Today, Hezbollah’s activities are not so much directed against Israel; rather, they are targeted responses to individual actions taken by President Abbas in pursuit of peace. Hezbollah knows that if it can still mastermind one or two terrorist acts, as it has succeeded in doing in Tel Aviv, then the process is again in jeopardy. So, then, it is in the interests of the Palestinian people and of President Abbas that we should make it quite clear that, if Hezbollah does not change tack, then it should be put on the European Union’s list of terrorist organisations, just as it already is on that of the United States. I find it regrettable that this has not found its way into our compromise, although there is an amendment intended to insert it. I think that any new European neighbourhood policy must make that clear, for the sake of the Palestinians and the Arabs in the region beset by conflicts, and that it would also be in Europe’s interests.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, many speakers this morning have described how this year, 2005, can be a year of neighbourhood policy. The prospects have rarely been so good. It is the tenth anniversary of the Barcelona Process, there are peaceful developments between Israel and Palestine in the Middle East – something that would have seemed impossible only a few months ago – and President Yushchenko is here with us today – from an eastern part of the neighbourhood where democracy and human rights are increasingly being asserted. That is why it is important that we, in this European Parliament, make a positive contribution to this neighbourhood policy process. In the countries themselves, too, we see that the mood is changing. Only a few days ago, delegates from Morocco told me that when they launched a human rights dialogue with the Council within the EU-Morocco Association Council, all the other neighbours said to them: 'Have you lost your minds? How can you talk about human rights with the EU? It will only backfire on you when the EU starts to interfere.' However, the impact is positive. The dialogue is taking place and it means that they have an opportunity to talk about the human rights of Moroccans in the European Union as well. In other words, it is a productive dialogue, and one which will undoubtedly have a positive effect on all the other neighbours too. I believe we are on the right track and now we must become more ambitious. We always said that if corruption in the Palestinian Authority is addressed, if there is an end to terrorism, then we Europeans must help out with even more money if necessary. That means that we must be prepared to support this process on our own initiative. Mr Brok has undoubtedly voiced the opinion of the majority in this House, Commissioner. In other words, if you take action now, you will have our backing. The prediction that chaos would break out after Arafat's death has proved wrong. What has broken out is peace; anti-corruption measures are now in place, and we Europeans should support this process. Let me make a final comment on Syria, which Mr Eurlings has already mentioned. Mr Solana's comments are unacceptable in this form. We must now make more demands on Syria as well. All our Arab neighbours are keen to support the peace process and Syria must now be judged by whether it combats Hamas and Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria. If it fails to do so, it cannot be a good partner for EU policy. This must be made clear and, in this respect, the Commissioner has been rather more forthright in her comments than Mr Solana in recent weeks.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, those who were present at this election, on a day which started with the transparent ballot boxes being meticulously sealed at seven in the morning and continued with everything being conducted with a great deal of pride and precision, can well imagine what that all meant for the Palestinian people themselves, in terms firstly, of course, of their relations with Israel, and secondly of their relations with the Arab world, for they gave a demonstration of something that is wholly unknown there. That is what made this election so significant, and the desire for peace was tangible; people have had enough of conflict, and Hamas and its call for a boycott were ignored. I think that all those – and there were some of them in this House – who have constantly been telling us that it was Arafat who guaranteed peace and that when he was no longer there, the situation would descend into chaos, misjudged the situation. The people of Palestine were much more astute than some of the European analysts of the situation thought they would be, and that is why there are such great hopes riding on what is happening there now. There is something I would ask both Mr Solana and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner to raise in their talks. According to press reports, Mr Sharon told our High Representative that withdrawal from Gaza had been agreed on in talks with the authorities of the Palestinian Autonomous Territories; if that is indeed the case and it proves possible to hand it over in an orderly manner, then we, and the UNHCR, should give some thought to using that as an opportunity to convert the refugee camps into permanent dwellings. Our working party on the United Nations was joined this morning by Mr Hansen, from the UNHCR. He described how, after the destruction of the camp in Jenin, the decision was taken to build proper houses, so that the people would at last, after 50 years, no longer be refugees. I see Gaza as offering a second opportunity to get the refugees out of their camps and into permanent settlements, once the handover has been properly accomplished. I therefore ask that this idea be considered in talks with UNRWA and with the authorities concerned, in order that this situation may come to an end and a new era may begin.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following on from Mr Battilocchio’s evocation of the ‘rose revolution’ in Georgia a year ago, let me say that visitors to Tbilisi will find in the cabinet chamber, on the streets and in the President’s office, the European flag hanging alongside its Georgian counterpart, as if the country were a Member State of the European Union, and, if you stand on Freedom Square in Kiev, you will see there the Georgian flag and the European flag, for all these countries aspire to make their way to Europe. Not all of our neighbours, though, can accede to the European Union. As early as when we take our decision in December, we will have to consider the European Union’s capacity for accepting new members, and so we need to come to some clearer conclusions about our European neighbourhood policy, and that very soon. In her hearing before the committee, the Commissioner was pretty clear about how that was one of her priorities. If that is the case, though, if there is the expectation of coming to Europe, and if we are ready for it, then our response over the last few weeks was inadequate. That the High Representative was willing to go to Kiev only when this House insisted on it was a mistake on his part. He should have been there before the elections, showing that Europe has an interest in fair elections, and if it is indeed the case – as our fellow-Members tell us – that the Commission had to be asked whether it might not send a larger delegation, whether it was not willing to be more involved in these elections, then that too revealed an oversight, and one that is now a source of great pain to us. Whilst we understand that massive staffs, lots of money and large numbers of personnel are going into the preparations for the Palestinian elections on 9 January, we could have shown the same commitment to one of our immediate neighbours, with its 50 million inhabitants, which wants to be part of Europe. I therefore think that our European neighbourhood policy, with the report that we will be starting to consider in a few weeks’ time, needs to have new life breathed into it. Participation in the internal market, participation in European programmes – we need to be sending out signals now about the many things we can offer. This is not about thinking in terms of spheres of influence, nor is it anti-Russian, for a democratic Ukraine too will need to maintain good relations with Russia, and we Europeans need to support it in this.

 Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, you have said that this was your last speech in this House, and I think that many of us feel – as I myself do despite our many differences of opinion – that you were one of the most important and outstanding personalities in this Commission, who gave foreign policy a quite special edge, for which I would like to thank you most warmly on behalf of our group. (Applause)
 The occasion for today’s debate is, as is invariable in the case of matters of topical and urgent importance, an escalation of violence. Rarely do we have good news to announce about the Middle East; on the contrary, the situation is often a very grave one. Hamas rockets landing on Israeli towns, excessive military actions and then the attack in Taba, in Taba of all places, a place associated with so many peace agreements, peace negotiations and concepts of peace. In Israel’s neighbour, Egypt, a new dimension of terror waged against innocent civilians, Europeans, Egyptians and Israelis, brings home to us the whole tragedy of the situation, and so I agree with what Mr Solana has had to say here today, that the road map is still the only way ahead. Mr Sharon, the Prime Minister, spoke about this on Monday in the Knesset, and I believe that we Europeans should also insist on that; it is this position that unites the Council, the Commission and Parliament. And the road map means a two-state solution, ultimately a Palestinian state and an Israeli state. What must now happen in the coming weeks? I am very grateful to Mr Solana for having, today, reminded us in very clear terms of Arafat’s responsibility; for reminding us that the Prime Minister must now be able to function independently; that the security forces, too, must be taken out of Mr Arafat’s control and made subject to an independent police authority, with all the powers needed to combat terrorism. You then had something to say about money and economic cooperation. In recent years, we have gained the impression that the more the situation escalated, the more money Europe gave, in order to try and bring about social stability. It would be a good thing, though, for the police forces to be reformed and for Europe to then provide more funds for reconstruction, so that it becomes clear to the people on the ground that where peace is, there is also aid from Europe, but that it is not unconditional and not at any cost. For that reason, our group endorses the courses of action you have outlined, and we wish you much success in carrying them out.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, Mrs Flautre just said that the primary issue had to be the nature of Russian information policy, what was manipulative about it, how it was that journalists were kept away from the scene, and so on. There, Mrs Flautre, I have to tell you that you are wrong. That is not the first question that must be raised, but what is, is our compassion for the victims, and so it was a mistake on the part of the Dutch Presidency of the Council to start by demanding reports from the scene on information policy and everything else, rather than making it an absolute priority to express concern at the dimensions terror was taking on. On that I really do want to contradict you in the strongest terms. My second point is that, if you analyse what is going on there now, we have every reason to criticise Putin’s policy on Chechnya in recent years, but the underlying character of this attack has nothing to do with Chechnya. These are not ordinary Chechens ... (Interruption)
 It is not ordinary Chechens who blow a school sky-high and kill children in this way, for to say that denies the Chechens their moral character. Let me tell you, Mr Cohn-Bendit, that those who commit these deeds are Ossetians, Ingushetians, and international terrorists, and that is why one has to make a very clear distinction between this and what is going on in Chechnya. We need other solutions for a policy on Chechnya, but we cannot equate these bandits and criminals, who band together and have Islamic connections throughout the world, with the people of Chechnya, and so this is where we need more subtle answers, rather than Chancellor Schroeder or President Chirac to approve these fake elections. What we need instead is ... (Interruption)
 What we need instead, my dear Mr Cohn-Bendit, in the face of such a web of international terrorism, is clear answers, for this terrorism menaces the whole of the free world, it menaces us and it menaces the United States too.

 Madam President, Commissioner, in recent years you have seen how sensitive a product wine is. Here today we are mainly putting the case for the liberalisation of the wine market regulations. You talk about opening up to the world market. I sometimes wonder, who is guiding whom here? Traditionally our wine-making has evolved in Europe. Our traditions and our regional identity are what characterises our wine, and that should also guide us in the deliberations we are now having on the wine market regulations. I was struck by the fact that here things have been incorporated into the wine market regulations through Committee, things which we have not debated at all in Parliament! The question, Commissioner, is what national and regional regulation options still exist? What restrictions or bans can Member States impose for their regions involved in making the lowest grade of wine? That is what this is about, we are not talking about wines of origin and home wines, but about the lowest grade of wines. For example, would the ban on blending red and white wine be a regional or national ban? Would that be possible in future for these low-grade wines? Or a ban on the indication of grape variety and vintage: this also causes us problems, as we want to be able to differentiate our wines, the lower wines from those described as home wines or wines of origin. So French Rosé or German Riesling, those are names which need a clear, unambiguous regulation. They are linked to our traditional producers and we set great store by this for the future. Therefore, we ask for your support.

 Mr President, the Member States are clearly responsible for legislation in the field of healthcare. Europe has laid down minimum standards for maternity leave. We have varied legislation in the Member States, which cannot be compared. In certain countries, maternity leave is paid out of tax revenue. In others, as is the case in Germany, it is paid through health insurance companies, and enterprises bear the main share of the costs. Both the length of, and the financial support for, maternity leave vary. In all cases, however, the mother is assured protection in case of illness, even after the maternity leave has ended. You are confusing two issues here: maternity leave and parental leave are two different things – as you pointed out, Commissioner Špidla. What I would like to know is whether, in Germany, for example, the combined total of maternity leave and parental leave would meet the requirements of the new directive? The extension of maternity leave, which focuses on the health of the mother, is not always an advantage for women. Companies will employ fewer women, as men do not take maternity leave. Moreover, stricter legal protection against dismissal does not help in the search for a new job. We also have to ensure that women are able to find employment and work on equal terms. In this respect, companies are called on to help to ensure a family-friendly working environment.

) The Regulation concerning statistics on plant protection products is part of the review of European plant protection products policy, of which the Approval Regulation and the Directive on the sustainable use of pesticides, which were successfully adopted at the beginning of the year, also form part. The objective is to reduce the negative effects of plant protection products as much as possible by reducing the risks. In order to measure this we need indicators and in order to develop these indicators we need reliable data, determined by statistics, which ensure comparability between Member States. That is why I voted in favour of the report. However, we must not forget that only those who market the products in accordance with the regulations will provide data. Up-to-date reports on the Europe-wide illegal trade in pesticides indicate that this needs to be brought more firmly into our sights. The same applies to the importing of products from third countries. We need to step up our controls in this regard. Our stringent European approval procedure guarantees the comprehensive protection of people and the environment. Anyone who sells or uses plant protection products without approval and anyone who does not adequately check residue limits not only creates avoidable risks, but also brings the manufacturer of the product and the agricultural industry into disrepute. Existing law provides a sufficient level of protection in this regard. However, it must be complied with and monitored.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are aiming to work together to attain the best conditions for the provision of health care in Europe. Especially in rural areas of the European Union close to national borders – such as my home in the greater cross-border region between Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and France – the advancement of patient mobility, which we were just debating, is a particularly important building block for improving the provision of health care and making it more efficient. In everything we do, however, we must adhere to and retain the ethical standards of the Member States. This applies to DNA analysis just as it does to artificial insemination, and it also applies to rare diseases, the subject of Mr Trakatellis’s report. Rare diseases need a stronger political framework in order to improve research and treatment, as companies prefer to invest in large markets. In fighting for people’s health we must not seek to eradicate rare diseases by, for example, selecting embryos. The matter at hand here, after all, is healing people. This one element represents a complete wrong turn for a report that otherwise takes a sound approach, and it is a turn that is morally perilous. In Amendment 15, it is not healing that is the focus, but selection. Who is to decide which life is worth living? Do we believe that prevention means preventing life? I do not think so. In my own country, and many other Member States besides, pre-implantation diagnosis is prohibited, and for good reason. That official European documents can use terms such as eradication and the selection of healthy embryos unabashedly is something that I find shocking and contrary to our stated goal of the acknowledgement and integration of those with disabilities and diseases into our society. I ask you all to vote against Amendment 15 as a matter of imperative importance so that what is otherwise such a sound report by Mr Trakatellis will also be able to obtain a good majority.

I voted in favour of the directive on patient rights in cross-border healthcare, because it provides patients with greater legal security. Especially in areas of the European Union close to borders, such as my home town in the large region of Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and France, or in rural regions with a shortage of medical services, the promotion of patient mobility is an important component in improving and increasing the efficiency of health services. The German health services sector will profit from cross-border patient mobility, if patients from other EU Member States make greater use of our high standard of medical services, for example in rehabilitation. However, the sovereignty of the Member States must be retained. The Member States themselves are responsible for providing medical care and for organising their health systems. In keeping with the principle of subsidiarity, the directive should only regulate areas which concern the cross-border mobility of patients. Our high quality and safety standards in Germany must not be compromised. Ethical standards, which the Member States comply with for good reason, such as, for example, in artificial insemination, DNA analysis or assisted suicide, must not be called into question.

 Madam President, Commissioner Fischer Boel, ladies and gentlemen, for 22 years the programme of food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community has contributed to the implementation of extremely important aims of the common agricultural policy. This is about, on the one hand, stabilising the markets by reducing the intervention stocks, while on the other supporting the poorest levels of the population in the Community with food. In 2006 alone, 13 million people from 15 Member States benefitted from aid measures within this programme – valuable help that should be retained. Now, however, there are justified concerns about the Commission’s proposal, which deviates from the old principles and does not want to use food from the intervention stocks alone for the programme, but also food bought on the free market. Here, Commissioner, it is definitely a matter of social policy and not agricultural policy. The argument that it is only with the additional purchase of food that the range of food offered will be able to provide a balanced diet, in my opinion, goes beyond the remit. The rapporteur, Mr Siekierski, is now proposing the removal of co-financing. However, this just emphasises once again the aspect of socio-political responsibility, which is why I would advocate co-financing. The European Union must be clearly focussed on the well-being of the people. There must be no hunger or want: that is something that all of the speakers this morning have once again clearly emphasised. However, we must ensure a clear allocation of responsibilities. It is not the case that agricultural policy wants to obstruct the aid and support for the poor. However, with a fair and correct allocation of tasks and aid, the prospects for coordination and optimisation are also good. European agricultural policy is currently facing, and will in future face, great challenges. Changes to the content must always be seen in the overall context. I would therefore ask the Commission and the Council for appropriate decisions and coordination in terms of social and agricultural policy.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted against the report by Mrs Batzeli. In my opinion, it calls into question some of the essential cornerstones of our economic system, such as free competition and the basic principles of the social market economy. It is clear that appropriate measures to stabilise food prices need to be found in order to ensure sustainable agricultural production. Practices which distort competition must be stopped. However, an EU-wide database containing reference prices for products and inputs would bring more bureaucracy and reporting obligations, the costs of which would be passed on by the trade to producers or consumers. The result would be higher end and consumer prices and lower prices for producers. Complete transparency of all business cost factors such as pay, energy costs, purchase and sale prices and the profit margins would lead to monitoring and dirigisme. These are not the aims of a social and free Europe. The position of farmers in the food supply chain can only be strengthened by cooperation and the inclusion of shared responsibility.

 Mr President, Commissioner Dimas, ladies and gentlemen, we can be proud of the fact that we have achieved such high health and hygiene standards in the European Union. The use of biocides has made a significant contribution to these achievements. When used as disinfectants and pesticides, they protect us from dangerous diseases, or as the case may be, from their carriers. Biocides are indispensable. They have to be harmless to humans and to the environment, and that is why we now need a review of all biocidal agents. Safety requires time, and the review is now taking longer than initially planned. We cannot run the risk of losing important products because their registration has not been completed. That is why I welcome the fact that Parliament, the Council and the Commission have, at the first reading, agreed to a quick extension of the deadlines for the Biocides Directive, until – I think, Commissioner, – 2014. However, why has this proposal appeared so late? The danger that substances might fall by the wayside due to expired deadlines, was something we could see coming for a long time, and our discussions in Parliament now have to take place under greater time pressure. Commissioner, we have been waiting for some time now for a proposal from the Commission on the revision of the Biocides Directive. Important areas now have to be urgently harmonised and regulated. Examples include the definition of the approval criteria, the length of the approval and, most importantly, data protection. Manufacturers need clear regulations and certainty. Regulations are also needed when it comes to the use and handling of the products. The testing of an active agent costs several thousand euros, and this investment can only be recovered if the results, at least for a certain period of time, are not accessible to other applicants. No-one wants us to lose our high hygiene standards. We must keep them in order to meet new challenges. I hope, that the Commission will present a clear and well-founded report that meets all of these requirements and I hope that it does so as soon as possible.

 Mr President, Commissioner Dimas, ladies and gentlemen, it is a clear goal of this directive to simplify the current legal provisions in the area of industrial emissions and to incorporate them into a single directive, thereby cutting bureaucracy. However, as far as I can tell, there is little to be seen of this in the Commission’s specific proposal. For me, cutting bureaucracy does not mean the creation of new reporting obligations and complicated procedures but rather, above all, the avoidance of duplicated regulation and unnecessary burdens. For agriculture, in particular, the Commission proposal will bring about a flood of new bureaucracy. Expanding the applicability would mean that animal husbandry and breeding businesses that are, in no way, comparable to the industrial plants that this directive is actually aimed at will also be included. What is more, the Commission proposes rules that are already contained in a nitrate directive or the water framework directive or the groundwater directive. I ask for your support for our amendments in order to prevent such duplicated regulation. The calculation of the upper limits for animal husbandry must also be reasonable and comprehensible in relation to poultry. Please vote with me against the division into chickens for fattening, laying hens and turkeys for fattening. In Germany, we call this kind of nitpicking ‘counting peas’. There must also be no attempt to use this directive to re-introduce the subject of soil protection by the back door. Soil protection is important. There must be efficient national laws to deal with it. I would like to say to the rapporteur that I, personally, along with other members of my group, very much welcome the concept of a European safety network. It represents a good compromise. By setting emissions limits that the Member States must adhere to as an absolute upper limit when granting permits to large industrial plants, we will be putting a stop to the inflationary use of derogations that has thus far taken place in certain Member States. In that way, we will be guaranteeing a uniform high level of safety. Member States will then no longer be able to gain a competitive advantage at the expense of the environment.

 Madam President, Commissioner Vassiliou, Commissioner Dimas, ladies and gentlemen, today we have the result of many discussions and negotiations, which were, at times, conducted with great emotion, and we will have the opportunity to vote on this tomorrow. We have not made it easy for ourselves. We have struggled to find the right solutions in our negotiations with the Council and with the Commission. We have established that science does not always point us in the right direction with clear findings. Further scientific support will be necessary in order to analyse the effects of this new legislation. First of all, therefore, sincere thanks to all those who contributed to this positive result with constructive proposals, my fellow members here in Parliament, the European Commission, the French Presidency of the Council – it is a pity that the Czech Presidency of the Council is not here this evening – but thanks also to the staff. With the current Directive on the Sustainable Use of Plant Protection Products we are taking a giant step towards more commonality in European environmental and consumer protection. Sustainability as the overall concept for European agriculture will guarantee healthy food and a healthy environment. For the first time, the handling of plant protection products will be harmonised at European level. The basic principle ‘as much as necessary, as little as possible’ assumes comprehensive, sound knowledge. Plant protection products are, in fact, medicine for plants. They must be used correctly in order to be effective – the right product and the right dosage at the right time. This also includes the consideration as to whether chemical plant protection is necessary or whether mechanical measures would be better. The selection of the best technology and tested application equipment will protect the environment and the user and contribute to the success of the operation through good harvests. The Member States will establish measures in their national action plans to reduce the use of plant protection products. Risk reduction is the primary objective. The use of the general basic principles of integrated plant protection will become mandatory for the entire European Union from 2014. Compliance with the stipulations of the Water Framework Directive is top priority. The Member States will establish buffer zones adjacent to bodies of water, which must be adapted to the conditions of the soil properties and geographical circumstances. The use of plant protection products by local authorities and in protected areas will be minimised or stopped, if necessary. There are regulations for checking equipment and regular maintenance intervals will be set. Risk reduction means that professional users must obtain sound and ongoing training in the use of plant protection products. Private users, who have no specific training and can cause damage in private gardens through incorrect usage, must be informed by well-trained salespersons on the use and risks when purchasing plant protection products. This directive will mean that previously differing regulations in the individual Member States will be adjusted to a high, common level. The proposed measures will benefit the environment, consumers and users. Identical conditions throughout the European Union will guarantee identical safety standards and identical production conditions. Substances that are proven to be detrimental to health will not be licensed, on that we are in agreement. However, a ban must be based on scientifically sound findings and not on political dogmas. Exposure must also be taken into consideration because with pesticides, like many things in life, it is the dosage that creates the poison hazard. A headache tablet is a blessing, but if you take 20 it becomes dangerous, even life-threatening. We have reached a good compromise. It will harmonise the environment and economic policy and I hope that we can emphasise our requirements in a unanimous vote tomorrow. I will allow myself just one more technical point, which is to say that an error has crept into Article 14 Paragraph 4. Reference is made to the Internet portal mentioned in Article 4 Paragraph 3; but there is no Paragraph 3 in Article 4. This should be rectified.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is now possible to identify a sugar cube in Lake Constance using state-of-the-art analysis. However, we must also ask ourselves how we deal with these new discoveries, what we do with them. We now need objective risk assessments to find a balance between the justified health and environmental requirements and the justified concerns of business and food safety, including within a worldwide comparison. The questions, which colleagues have asked, have not been adequately answered by the Commission, in my opinion. It is not enough to say that four substances no longer apply or two substances no longer apply and there are only 25 substances in total. No, we wish to have an accurate economic assessment, an assessment that not only fulfils economic criteria but also health criteria. We still need an evaluation. The Commission must now thoroughly analyse the effects of this new legislation so that we know what effect it will have at the end of the day. We must continue to monitor this, as scientific discoveries will always continue. The compromise which has been reached brings a new direction in European plant protection policy. It brings more common action Europe-wide and it requires targeted measures from Member States, which guarantee the sustainable use of plant protection products. As rapporteur, I thank you for your support. We have managed to find a good compromise from different starting positions. I would like more positive thinking for the New Year. One thing that can be said is that I did not have enough positive thinking: plant protection products will ensure healthy and sufficient food and a healthy cultural landscape for us in Europe!

 Madam President, Commissioner, I have only voted in favour of the Commission proposal to integrate the wine CMO into the single CMO with all the other agricultural products because the Commission assured us in yesterday's debate that, as soon as the Council's proposal is accepted, it will include the functionality in the EUR-Lex search engine to allow users of the individual CMOs, for example for wine, milk or fruit and vegetables, to access only the articles related to their specific product. In addition, the Commission has also guaranteed that future changes will only be made to individual products and other products will not be arbitrarily changed at the same time. The discussion has made it clear that, in future, although there will only be one document instead of 21, this one document will be just as extensive as the 21 individual documents. However, the administration of the resulting highly complex document for the single CMO must be made as simple as possible.

 Mr President, I have voted in favour of the Capoulas Santos report and of Amendment 186, which recommends a franchise of EUR 10 000 for the modulation. This concerns small-scale agriculture in Europe. The modulation process must be applied in moderation. Small farms in Europe need the support of the EU, so that they can continue to exist within the EU’s wage structure. We want healthy food to be produced in Europe and to be available at reasonable prices. We also want the countryside to be managed. If we really do want all of this, then we must give our farmers support, so that we can continue to produce healthy food in future in Europe, which is an area with one of the most favourable climates in the world. This is why I have voted in favour of the Capoulas Santos report.

 Madam President, Commissioner, I must say that I am disappointed by your remarks because we have entered into discussions with the Commission on the basis of what Neil Parish has said. I had hoped for something more concrete than simply the constant repetition of the fact that it will become simpler. It will not become simpler. A common market organisation for wine will be the 21st 
market organisation in an extensive series. The objective of making things simpler by reducing bureaucracy is not something that I or the wine growers of Europe are able to recognise. In future, everyone who wants to find out something about the wine sector must search through a long regulation, the common market organisation for all the agricultural products, which previously consisted of 204 articles and an appendix that is twice as long, to find all the points which refer to wine, across 98 articles with 21 headings and the 10 accompanying appendices. This is not a reduction in bureaucracy, Commissioner. This is bureaucracy in its purest form. I call on the Commission to at least simplify the technical applications, because it is possible to do so. Younger colleagues of mine, such as Anja Weisgerber, tell me that it must be possible. Please could the Commission consider this? A technical simplification would include, for example, a search tool on the Commission's website which would allow people to download and print only those parts of the common market organisation which are relevant for their particular agricultural products. Neither wine growers nor milk producers are interested in the special regulations on fruit and vegetables or hemp, and vice versa. We must make use of these technical possibilities in order to make things simpler. In future, whenever a change is made in one agricultural area, there is the possibility that changes will be made in another area. This means that when an amendment is made in the milk sector and the single CMO is modified, all farmers and wine growers must make sure that a change has not been quickly pushed through in their area. I would like to ask two specific questions, Madam President. Commissioner, in future who will be the monitor? ... (The President cut off the speaker.)

 Madam President, you have just switched off my microphone and therefore I am taking the opportunity of using the ‘catch-the-eye’ procedure to reformulate my questions. I wanted to ask the Commission specifically, who in future will be monitoring existing legislation when the common market organisation is amended and who will be making sure that nothing is pushed through in other areas, for example in the area of wine when we are talking about milk? My second specific question is as follows: Can the Commission put in place the technical requirements to simplify management of the system, on the internet or in a portal, to allow users to access each market area separately, such as wine, milk, fruit and vegetables? Those were my questions. Thank you, Madam President.

Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, we are being bombarded with headlines. We are told that we are obese, our children are obese, we are eating the wrong foods and we eat too little fresh fruit and too few vegetables. Five portions per day, or around 400 g of fruit and vegetables, is the recommended daily allowance for a healthy and balanced diet. It is not always easy to keep to this. Food needs to be healthy, last a long time, taste good and cost as little as possible. However, the fast pace of life today means that it is often difficult for us to balance the demands of family and work, so that we sometimes do not have enough time to cook and instead choose semi-prepared or fully prepared products. There is nothing wrong with this, provided we are aware of the importance of fresh fruit and vegetables. People who learn to eat a diet rich in fruit and vegetables at an early stage will also maintain a healthy diet later in life. I therefore expressly support the Commission’s proposal to introduce a school fruit scheme funded to the tune of EUR 90 million. What a wonderful idea, Commissioner! However, as you have recognised in your provisions, Member States must be allowed to organise the scheme according to their own national requirements. It must be possible to provide the relevant regional and seasonal produce. Member States must also develop a strategy to define the best way in which to implement a school fruit scheme and integrate it into the curriculum. Healthy eating is part of general education. Children must learn, for example, that, as well as a hot vegetable, carrots can also be enjoyed in the form of soup, salad, cakes or in baked dishes. They need to know what a potato tastes like if it is not made into crisps or chips. They need to have their interest stimulated in the many ways of preparing regional produce. Information is the only way to lay the foundations for a healthy diet. Knowledge is the key to a healthy lifestyle. The school fruit scheme can make a valuable contribution in this context.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the EU-India Summit marks a new stage in the deepening of relations between the European Union and India. We want to promote economic development in India. However, we are also monitoring very closely what is happening in the context of human rights and dignity in India's regions. Almost all the previous speakers have talked about the persecution of Christians which has recently been taking place. These are issues which must be discussed at the Summit as well. The murder of a spiritual leader and member of the World Hindu Council on 23 August this year triggered this new conflict. This is not the first attack on Christians, which is why some 60 000 Christians in the state of Orissa alone have now fled their homes. Christians are being subjected to a campaign of persecution, humiliation, abuse and murder. Homes, churches and monasteries in Christian communities are being ransacked and destroyed. The Indian Government must guarantee the right to life and liberty of the Christians who live there. Economic prosperity and stability can only be achieved through freedom for the people.

 Mr President, overweight and obesity are a major problem for our society. We know that we cannot change consumer behaviour with legislation. Rather, changed behaviour throughout society has an impact on the individual: after all, who wants to be an outsider? Our health behaviour and diet are influenced by our social environment. There have been complaints that meat consumption is on the increase. However, it is on the increase because more people in society can afford to eat meat, not because per capita meat consumption itself is rising. A healthy relationship with food and drink is particularly important. An obsession with being thin is as bad for health as compulsive eating. Eating habits cannot be regulated by law. People's dietary needs vary, and there is no 'one size fits all' requirement in terms of people's calorific or fat intake. People are different, and their individual energy needs differ too, depending on age, gender, occupation, and activity levels. Bans are a poor substitute for common sense. We do not need new legislation: what we need are information campaigns to impart knowledge. We need freedom, not nannying. Freedom also implies responsibility. Our citizens are intelligent adults who can think for themselves. Traffic-light labelling is not representative as it only shows certain aspects in isolation, so it confuses consumers. What should I choose if a product label shows that a specific food has red, yellow and green nutritional elements? The food industry will pass the costs of the new labelling on to the consumer, driving up prices even further. I am against a 'nannying' approach and mandatory front-of-pack nutritional labelling using colour coding, and I would therefore ask my fellow Members to vote against paragraph 37 of the report. If necessary, we can deal with this later in a different context, when we look at the issue of labelling. Let us take the White Paper on nutrition, overweight and obesity-related health issues as an opinion-forming tool which provides food for thought for society, not as an opportunity to impose even more conditions and create new legislation!

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after yesterday’s Sunday service in my home town, our Indian priest reported on the atrocities being committed in his home country. For the last week, Christians in the state of Orissa in East India have been subjected to a campaign of persecution, humiliation, abuse and murder. By the end of last week, this had left 26 people dead, with 41 churches destroyed, four monasteries in flames and many Christian homes in ruins. People are taking refuge in the forests, praying for safety from the Hindu fanatics. This is not the first attack on Christians, which is why some 60 000 Christians in Orissa have now fled their homes. The present conflict was triggered by the murder of a spiritual leader and member of the World Hindu Council on 23 August. Father Saji from my village has asked our parish to pray for the victims, but we can do more than that. I utterly condemn these crimes against humanity. The European Parliament must urge the Indian Government to guarantee the right to life and liberty of Christians in Orissa.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, ‘Water is life’ or ‘Water – valuable as diamonds’: those were the headlines and the motivation when we launched the Water Framework Directive in the year 2000. The directive on environmental quality standards in the field of water policy is now the last major daughter instrument to the Water Framework Directive. Its purpose is to set environmental quality standards for priority substances and priority hazardous substances so as to ensure that our water, the source of life, receives a high level of protection from risks, by which I mean the highest possible level of protection – the protection that is necessary and possible on the basis of the latest scientific knowledge. In my view, however, this also means that the protection of water is a permanent task. We shall have to keep a constant political eye on scientific studies and findings with a view to assimilating new discoveries and guaranteeing the protection of water at all times and in all circumstances in accordance with the latest science and technology. It must never happen again that – as in the present case – the Commission does not fulfil its mandate and allows time to elapse without acting. The list of priority hazardous substances must be constantly reviewed and checked without delay. The Commission’s failure to act prompted us in Parliament to take action and propose a second list – a list containing substances that require checking on the basis of the latest findings. This list must not pre-classify or prejudge substances. It should also provide an opportunity to clear substances of suspicion. Substances must not, of course, be included in such a list on a mere whim. The PPE-DE Group has called for a faster and more prioritised treatment of the substances on which data are already available that indicate high risk levels. Six months will suffice, in our view. I do very much hope, Commissioner, that full use will not be made of the 24-month period which is currently prescribed, for it must always be possible to act on safety findings without delay. We shall support en bloc 
the compromise worked out by Mrs Laperrouze.

 Mr President, Commissioner, we are not talking about whether we want more hygiene or less hygiene. We are talking about easing burdens and cutting red tape for small and medium-sized enterprises. The question which we need to address once again, then, is this: is HACCP appropriate and necessary in every case and in every company, large or small, and regardless of who is responsible? In the case of companies which are engaged predominantly in the direct sale of food to the final consumer – such as bakeries, butchers, food stores and market stalls, and indeed, farmers' coffee shops, wine bars and the seasonal wine taverns run by the vineyards, where the owner or manager is known to the customer and is generally available in person – we must undoubtedly apply different criteria from those applicable to a major corporation. This is about the dismantling of bureaucracy and it is about accountability. I think we should certainly harness the principle of subsidiarity here, but not by demanding the opportunity to introduce significantly different requirements in individual Member States. We must have a level playing field in terms of competition. I therefore support the Commission's proposal and Mr Schnellhardt's report.

What questions do young people nowadays ask themselves when deciding on a career? Do they ask about the nature of the occupation, the prospects it offers for the future, or making a fast buck? The answer to all these questions is often negative when farming is one of the options. Only 7% of farmers are under the age of 35, with the result that this occupation is an alarming state of decline. There are many young people who would enjoy farming: working in the open air and close to nature, surrounded by plants and animals. That is a given. So what deters young people? Is it the lack of prospects, or the general insecurity surrounding the profession? Once, inheriting the family farm provided a very good and very secure living, but today, the heirs are often at a disadvantage due to the many burdens and conditions imposed on them. We know that only well-trained and highly motivated farmers can guarantee our high standards of healthy food and a healthy natural environment here in Europe. However, we must also be aware of the challenges facing young farmers today. We must involve young farmers in political discussions and decision-making to a greater extent. They are the bearers of Europe's hopes! They are the ones who are facing up to the numerous economic and ecological challenges and ensuring a good and well-balanced social environment in the rural regions. They therefore need reliable policies to support them.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, ‘Women in rural areas of the EU’ – under this title we in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality have together been compiling facts and proposals for solutions. I would like to thank my fellow Members for their cooperation and the Secretariat for its support. We have a term in Germany: country girl. In the past more so than today everyone had their own idea of what this was. Some say these are creative, dependable women, highly principled and deeply religious. Others say they are women who are behind the times, know little or nothing and are therefore ignorant, perhaps even naïve as well. Neither of these descriptions gets to the heart of the matter. Rural areas provide precisely the best conditions for a fulfilled life, for families involved in village communities, integrated into nature and the environment. Today we are very well aware that women’s life models vary enormously. They also have to be adaptable, however, not tied down or restricted by their living conditions. Women today want to be active in the workforce and they also want families. Today they want and can have both. Politics and society must create the framework conditions for this. Life in the countryside offers opportunities and, of course, generates risks. It is a personal decision that prompts women, after considering the facts, to move into urban areas or stay in the villages. The statistical data prove that well-educated women are the first to leave the villages. They leave behind empty nurseries and schools and ultimately ageing and empty villages. Women’s decisions therefore also have a demographic dimension. According to the Commission’s estimates, the rural regions generate 45% of the gross value added and 53% of those with jobs live here. Rural areas therefore also have an economic dimension. The entire development potential must therefore be used and upgraded. It is no longer sufficient to discuss the future of women in the countryside only within the framework of the common agricultural policy. Women still work as farmers, but they are also employees and salaried staff and are very often active as assisting spouses in small- and medium-sized enterprises or even as independent entrepreneurs themselves. Large gaps still need to be filled here. The position of women and assisting spouses in small- and medium-sized enterprises needs to be stabilised in the social sector in order to provide for sickness and old age. 	 Women are particularly affected by the lack of infrastructure in rural areas. Women combine family and work, which means driving their children between school and leisure activities, caring for the older generation and not quite losing sight of their own interests. The fact that rural areas have a deficient infrastructure – a shortage of roads, post offices, medical services, fire services and emergency doctors – has been well known for a long time. The fact that additional problems are now emerging, however, for example in broadband supply, is not acceptable. Women, too, need fast access via DSL to be able to participate in their many areas of activity. Women’s participation in public life – on local councils, in initiatives and associations – can bring about changes. In rural areas, too, special efforts are needed to achieve equal participation by women. I would therefore like to conclude with one further request: include women in the decision-making bodies! They know best what needs to be changed because they are always there on the spot and they are up against both work and family, whereas men do either one or the other.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your contributions to the discussion. We had a really good discussion here in this round. Commissioner, thank you, too, for your statement that the review of Directive 86/613/EEC on the principle of equal treatment is still taking place this year, in 2008. We have sent a reminder on this and we think it is time to review it. We are unable this evening to adopt any European regulation for improving the situation of women in rural areas. Mrs Doyle, I know that the situation of women is not the same everywhere. It would also be dull and we do not want that at all. However, women in rural regions do, of course, have the same conditions and they have to struggle with the same disadvantages as women living in towns and cities. We have pointed this out here. We are initiating the discussion process and we are asking the Commission and the Member States to ultimately bring about changes as well. The report should raise awareness of this. There are good examples in Europe and according to the principle of best practice we also want to highlight these examples for emulation. We can also introduce a lot that is good here. We want to broaden the view. Women in rural areas are not only farmers; women in rural areas are also on their way to becoming employed, and they have to combine family and work. In the end, being personally affected is the best testimony. We need the contribution of women in our organisations. Mrs McGuinness has just been speaking about contented mothers who are also able to bestow contentment on their children. We shall also have contented women when we do something towards their equal treatment, towards their fair participation. Our concern here is that young people will also then stay in the villages again. It would be exciting, Commissioner, to have a list of all the many opportunities that ultimately present themselves for women in the European Union. We are constantly asserting that these are concealed in many cases under the cover of other programmes. Perhaps we could manage to say just once that women are involved in one programme or another, in this way or that. This constantly creates problems, even when it should be sorted out locally. Perhaps we should schedule this as a start in order to be able eventually to say to those responsible in the regions: we can achieve improvements for women here.

Madam President, Commissioner, plant protection products are being tested and the statistics are part of a package that also contains the Regulation on authorisation of pesticides and the Directive on the sustainable use of pesticides. The aim of the entire package is to keep the effects of plant protection products on both human health and the environment to a minimum. The pressure of competition on the internal market and the cross-border environmental aspects require a common approach here. The access to our markets by foodstuffs from across the world, however, also makes it clear that obligations have to be appropriate in order to be effective. It is of no help to anybody if our fruit, vegetables and meat come only from third countries, because obligations render production too difficult here. We in Europe have no influence on foodstuffs from third countries. The only possibility is to determine the maximum residual quantities and we are not yet properly set up to do this, let alone ready for a pesticide passport. It is right to keep records and statistics on the sale of pesticides for monitoring the flows and developments of plant protection. The professed aim in doing so is to reduce the risk of pests. Data collection must guarantee comparability and obligations to submit a report must be kept to a minimum. The recording of substance flows clearly overshoots the mark here, since it is not yet certain whether a plant protection product, a biocide or perhaps even a drug is produced from a given substance. Biocides must be considered separately and here we await the Commission’s proposal on the authorisation and use of biocides. Only then will it be possible to consider the statistics that are still needed. The illegal use of plant protection products must be more heavily scrutinised. To do this, we need increased monitoring of the existing law. In my opinion statistics do not help. Any party that violates the law, Mr Staes, is not recorded in the statistics either.

In the common organisation of the wine market, the Commission seeks to take account of the special characteristics of wine-producing regions by delegating more responsibility and creating more scope for initiative. Today the European Parliament has set down these very aims on paper. We have absolute confidence in our proposals, which were adopted by all Members of Parliament from all Member States. Viniculture in Europe is part of our heritage. The cradle of global wine production is here in Europe. Viniculture means business, income and jobs. It is not the task of the Commission to seek market balance by limiting our production or by changing the rules to make production impossible. It is, however, the Commission’s task to safeguard our share of global markets and to ensure that our products enjoy the international prestige they merit. The aim must not be to restrict the market but to open up new markets. Why should we alter winemaking methods for wines that are selling well? Our winemaking methods are rooted in ancient cultures and traditions. Today the European Parliament has clearly reaffirmed its support for more market measures, national budgets and scope for regional initiative, for socially sensitive phasing-out of intervention measures and for the preservation of existing oenological practices, in other words the addition of sucrose and rectified concentrated must (RCM), with these additives being placed on an equal footing by means of additional RCM subsidies. I hope that our proposals will be incorporated into the new common organisation of the market in wine.

Soil is a vital asset. As a non-renewable resource, it is of the utmost importance in sustaining biodiversity, as a source of raw materials and also as a storage and filter medium for nutrients and water. Soil, however, is not something that crosses borders, nor can it be shifted by the European Union. Protecting our soils is in the best interests of those who own land and therefore falls within the responsibility of the Member States. This application of the subsidiarity principle must remain intact. There is no justification for ignoring all the existing European legal provisions and the dedication of farmers right down to the present day and to enact new provisions running parallel to the European directives, national statutes and cross-compliance rules that directly or indirectly affect the protection of soil. Among the numerous soil-related directives and regulations enacted by the EU are such instruments as the Nitrates Directive, the Water Framework Directive, the Emissions Trading Directive and the Plant Protection Products Directive. The bureaucratic commitments that could hit the Member States and the farming community is in stark contrast to the common efforts to eliminate red tape. In addition, the precautionary measures envisaged in the draft directive impinge on every aspect of the law as it relates to agriculture. I consider a European soil protection directive to be superfluous and inexpedient, and I have voted against this proposal.

Mr President, I would like to thank my fellow Members for the result of the vote. This is based on the result of the report on the sustainable use of pesticides. We have voted out the top levels here. We have, however, focussed on training and information for users and salespeople alike. Only the expert and skilled handling of pesticides can ensure sustainability. The latest technology and the most up-to-date knowledge are being applied here, of course. We support Integrated Pest Management. The Commission is calling for Integrated Pest Management to be made compulsory for agriculture as a whole by 2014. We need general standards for this. We cannot squeeze Integrated Pest Management into fixed criteria, certainly not throughout Europe. Integrated Pest Management must always be developed flexibly. It requires the incitements of good technical practice and it needs drive – and that drive needs to be maintained. We must therefore discuss this once again here before second reading. We still have the opportunity, together with the Council and the Commission, to bring this to a good conclusion so that we in the European Union can continue to make pest management actually possible.

Mr President, Commissioners Dimas and Kyprianos, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the Commission’s proposal for a framework for Community action to achieve sustainable use of pesticides, and my remarks here today will be confined to that part of the overall package. This is a vast field, in which a great deal of adjustment is still needed throughout Europe for the sake of consumers and users and particularly for the sake of the environment. Differing rules in the European Union not only create divergent safety standards but are also confusing and distort competition. The possibility of pests destroying a whole year’s harvests is, thankfully, a thing of the past in Europe. Today, however, we face new major challenges, to which we must respond with a sound policy on plant protection. The global population is growing, and food is becoming scarcer worldwide. Climate change has altered the conditions in which farming takes place: new pests are appearing, and natural disasters decimate harvests. It is still essential today, therefore, to safeguard harvests, and the use of plant protection agents helps to do that. With plant protection, as with many other things in life, it is the dose that makes the poison. Whilst a sleeping tablet is a boon, many sleeping tablets can be fatal. Care must be taken to ensure that plant protection products are used properly and professionally, because improper use is dangerous. That is true not only on farmland but also in public spaces such as parks, playgrounds, sports fields, pathways and railway tracks. Information, education and knowledge of the implications of pesticide use, of its benefits but also of its risks, are at the heart of this directive. Sellers and users of plant protection agents must be trained and informed. By means of national action plans, the Member States must ensure that plant protection products are used sustainably. In so doing, they must strive for consistency with other Community provisions. Well-tested and safe application machinery will ensure targeted plant protection, the aim being to minimise any risk. An arbitrary percentage reduction across the entire range of plant protection agents runs counter to the aims of good agricultural practice and integrated pest management. We need both these factors, Commissioner Dimas, and we shall continue to need good farming practice and integrated pest management, because we need dynamism. The stringent regulation on authorisation, moreover, has been reduced to absurdity. Products with harmful effects must not be authorised at all; it is not enough to cut their use by half. If, however, plant protection agents have come through a stringent approval process, reducing their use by a certain percentage across the board would be illogical. Moreover, no one has yet been able to explain to me precisely how such a reduction is supposed to be managed and quantified. The same applies to protection of the aquatic environment. The arbitrary establishment of standard buffer strips next to water bodies serves no purpose. A differentiated approach remains necessary here. Buffer strips must be right for the geographical situation, the soil properties and the plants that require protection. This kind of approach has already been adopted in the instructions for use that come with the various plant protection products. You mentioned crop spraying from the air, Commissioner. For the steeply sloping vineyards along the banks beside the Moselle in my home area or indeed for the rice plantations in southern Europe, there is no alternative. In those places crop spraying from the air is indispensable. The use of crop spraying helicopters, however, must be regulated. Particular care is needed in sensitive areas, such as parks and public or school playgrounds. The use of pesticides there must be kept to an absolute minimum, and non-chemical alternatives should take precedence. In my opinion, that could even mean sending out an entire school class to weed the school grounds. Banning plant protection altogether in areas that are home to particular species of flora and fauna would be inconsistent with the aims of habitat conservation. Pesticides are actually essential if these habitats are to be preserved. Plant protection products are expensive, and no farmer will apply more than is absolutely necessary. Additional taxes distort competition in the world market. They would result in the purchase of cheaper products from outside the EU, which would ill serve the cause of sustainability. We want the same protection and the same standard throughout the EU. In many countries the proposed measures have typified good practice for some time. For this reason, harmonisation of the rules governing the use of plant protection agents is imperative, which is why the Commission’s approach is the right one. It is up to all of us now – and we can take this as an invitation – to initiate a directive that keeps red tape to a minimum while matching our aspirations. I ask for your support.

Mr President, may I say to Mrs Isler Béguin that there was no unanimous vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, that we definitely took the opposite view and that most of my group opposed the position to which she refers.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, European need not, may not and cannot regulate everything. Member State subsidiarity and less bureaucracy are the slogans of the moment, which we keep repeating when we speak with members of the public. The European Union’s competence is constantly being questioned, but Europe should and indeed must be the motive force for development. The Commission’s right of initiative is a documented right. Where no legislative instrument exists, it uses that right of initiative to focus on a thorny subject, draw Member States’ attention to abuses and call for action. That is the legal basis of this Commission proposal, and we must use it. We must curb the adverse effects on health of risky and excessive alcohol consumption and its social and economic consequences. A European strategy is to be formulated in order to support the Member States in their endeavour to reduce and prevent alcohol-related damage. That includes research into its root causes, as has just been said. It also includes, however, informing, instructing and raising awareness among the public; that is the crux of the matter, those are the key points. Every individual is free to decide. But individuals can use that freedom only if they are informed about the consequences and effects of their actions. Upbringing and education are the key factors. Upbringing within the family lays the foundations for a well-ordered and solid way of life, and we should put the focus on that, followed by schooling and advice. The same applies to alcohol awareness. I support Parliament’s report, which improves the Commission document in many areas. I am, however, resolutely opposed to the calls for health warnings. There are clear rules on the labelling of alcohol. The labels indicate the alcohol content. Transposing and understanding what it says on the labels is the basic way to pass on information. That, ladies and gentlemen, is general knowledge! Everybody must be in a position to use that information for themselves in a responsible manner. The same applies to most things in life: to eating and drinking just as to exercise, sport and fitness.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission proposal aimed to bring about simplification, to combine the two previous regulations into one: and it has done so. The second aspect – adapting the regulations to new technical requirements and to the requirements of the WTO and of TRIPS – will also be a success. The third objective – the continued validity of existing geographical indications, which can continue to be supplemented in future by additional designations – will also be achieved. With some give and take on the part of the individual Member States, that, too, will provide clarity in future. I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Schnellhardt, for the effort he has put into the many difficult negotiations. In the dispute over ‘Jägertee’ or ‘Jagertee’, Germany has compromised and accepted the term ‘Hüttentee’ as the German designation. All parties must be prepared to take a step closer to one other. A great deal of tradition is involved, but mutual tolerance is required. By way of explanation, the term ‘Champagne’ refers to the designation of origin – that is, the regional origin – and has less to do with the ingredients. In Germany, we order a ‘Klarer’. By this we mean a spirit made from agricultural produce: fruit, grain or potatoes. We have taken steps towards ensuring the clear nature of this product, and towards maintaining the economic base of the traditional, often small, distilleries. I believe that this, too, will succeed. The addition of sweeteners must be regulated, and must be clearly visible on the label. For centuries, our distilleries have been producing top-quality spirits without adding flavourings or sugar. Labelling constitutes consumer information and ensures a level competitive playing field. This also goes for the raw material. We made very heavy weather of the definition of ‘vodka’. The solution – labelling everything that is not produced from potatoes or grain – is a workable compromise and provides clear information, and I ask you to support this compromise.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I rejoice that we are now at last deliberating on the last foundational piece of legislation needed for a comprehensive European policy on water provision and also for the implementation of the Water Framework Directive. It is better to provide in the first place than to make up for deficiencies afterwards, and that is particularly true in the case of water, which we need for our own survival. The Water Framework Directive stipulates that the priority list of substances is to be revised regularly and updated in line with current scientific knowledge, and so the list we are drawing up is not static or final, but part of a dynamic process that has to make it possible to include new knowledge and new substances, substances that are developed and then used, as is demonstrated by the many examples adduced by Members today. We cannot always list and take into account all the effects of a substance; for example, when the contraceptive pill came onto the market in the 1960s, it was at first hailed as a revolutionary triumph, and it was only later that it turned out that the hormonal substances were enriching themselves in our waters, so it follows that ongoing observation is necessary, and that is our understanding of the list of substances in Annex II, in which, by way of a compromise, the rapporteur has compiled the substances that Members regarded as actually or potentially hazardous. It is now for the Commission to examine what is to be done with these substances and then to put proposals to that end before Parliament. This list is to be seen as no more than a list of substances that have to be examined; it neither categorises them nor pre-assesses them, nor does it claim to be exhaustive. All the substances must be assessed scientifically, and, if it emerges that they are to be categorised as dangerous, they should be classified as such at once. Any good European water policy must, if it is to act to protect people, take account of the latest knowledge and assessments.

 When it comes to us in floods, water is a force of nature, endangering our health, the environment, infrastructure and our property. Water takes no account of borders. It is important that the EU should use this proposal for a ‘directive on the assessment and management of flood risks’ to promote more cooperation across borders, which must be founded on the existing plans and designs held by the Member States, which themselves ought to draw on the best available data, procedures and technologies in the field of flood risk management. I am glad that agreement has been reached on the last outstanding issues, so that the new directive can rapidly come into effect. Flooding is a constant risk for people who live in river valleys; they can, to some degree, make their properties proof against it. My neighbouring village in the Moselle valley found its salvation in the building of a protective flood dam, but preventive measures that involve all members of the public are much better and more effective. In the report, we make reference to the principle of solidarity, which comes into play in villages when the floods come, with everyone helping everyone else, and the volunteers from the fire brigade showing admirable dedication in setting out. It is this solidarity principle that must be developed and supported, not only in the villages affected by flooding, but across every border too.

 Madam President, Commissioner Fischer Boel, ladies and gentlemen, as our Council President, Angela Merkel, said in her speech in this House on 17 January, ‘what distinguishes Europe, that which constitutes its soul, is the way we handle our diversity’ and ‘Europe’s soul is tolerance’. In recent weeks and months, we have held many discussions on the proposals for reforming the market in wine. North and south, the individual wine-growing regions – a wide variety of opinions and interests have been represented. Each of us believes that, if we could have written the Batzeli report ourselves, we would have done it differently, made it more specific, more succinct. Nevertheless, we have managed to moderate all interests so that everyone can support them. It is a compromise, then, which not only tolerates but also respects the diversity of the European wine sector, and develops it further – albeit in small steps. The Commissioner has taken the trouble to visit many wine-producing regions in recent months, and for that I am obliged to her. She has seen how different the regions are. In the field of wine, in particular, we need more scope to determine things at national and regional level. We also need national budgets under the first pillar, on the basis of which the appropriate measures can be selected from an EU catalogue of measures for wine in the regions and subsequently implemented. We agree that we do not want to give up, we do not want to grub up 400 000 hectares. We want to fight for market shares, for our jobs, our cultural landscape, the European lifestyle. Wine is part of Europe and we must maintain its traditions and thus also long-established oenological practices. Our competitors around the world are waiting in the wings to supply what we no longer produce. There is one thing the discussion has made clear, and that is that Rome was not built in a day: we need staying power. Our policies need to be reliable. In the long term, however, our measures must be adapted in response to the market.

 Everything that we try to do on the environment and health fronts is aimed at protecting health. Responsibility for this rests with the Member States, and that is where it must remain. The idea of prevention is becoming ever more prominent. The Ries report describes the health risks involved in obesity, excess weight and chronic illness. Why is it that our children are overweight? What are the causes? These issues need to be discussed in order to raise awareness, particularly in families. The ability to keep our bodies healthy on a day-to-day basis is something that must be communicated through school and general education. Preventing these illnesses will, of necessity, involve social changes, but that will be accomplished not merely through bans on advertising, providing information relating to health and giving children sports bags when they start primary school. We live in a fast-living society; when both parents work, time for the family, for bringing up children and for cooking is often lacking. This makes it ever more important that society should take preventive action, and schools and educational facilities must be entrusted with the communication of day-to-day life skills. Even so, we must not stop reminding families of those tasks and duties that are inherently their own, and empower them to perform and fulfil them. Not even the EU can make people be slim and enjoy life and health. The Member States must produce action plans and measures, but people have to put them into practice themselves.

 Madam President, Commissioner, Members of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the environment is a broad field; all human life on our continent is dependent on both air and water, and groundwater is among the most important and most vulnerable resources that we humans possess. It recovers lost quantity only very slowly, and regains its original state only very slowly after pollution; cleaning polluted groundwater can be done, if at all, only at enormous expense and with recourse to enormous technical resources. Our experience with air is currently teaching us that all the measures we have taken over the past decade have proved insufficient to prevent climate change and all its deleterious side-effects. Where air is concerned, we in Europe can accomplish relatively little unless other industrial states around the world lend a hand. Where groundwater is concerned, here in Europe, we alone have the power to secure this precious good for future generations, and in that the precautions we take and the protection of the groundwater ecosystem are of the utmost importance. This has been my core concern, the thing for which I, as rapporteur, have fought, and I am grateful to all those who have supported me in this, by which I mean primarily you, the Members of this House, for, without your convincing votes at first and second reading, we would not have been able to achieve the result that we did in the conciliation negotiations with the Council, even though we had the Commission’s support. I would like to thank the Council and the representatives of the Commission for their constructive cooperation and for their support in the quest for compromises. What, then, have we achieved? The protection of the groundwater ecosystem and the precautionary approach have been explicitly included, the latter of which meaning, with regard to groundwater, that water that is still clean must be kept in good or very good condition. It means not leaving action until the conditions defined by the limit and threshold values as ‘poor’ have already come about. The reversal of trends and deterioration are regulated in such a way that not only the transition from good to poor conditions, but also ongoing increases in values within a category are considered and have to trigger action. When laying down the threshold values for the materials described in part B of Annex 2, the Member States shall be required to take account of knowledge concerning toxicity to humans and the environment as well as of hydrological conditions, in other words, of background levels, in order to be able to take better account of the differing conditions from one European region to another. For the purpose of reviewing the effectiveness of these measures, the introduction of a review clause was especially important. The observation on the Nitrate Directive in Annex 1 was deleted and the reference to it in Annex 4 has been expanded. The targets for protection and repair laid down by the Nitrate Directive and the Water Framework Directive in conjunction with this Groundwater Directive, which is derived from them, are comparatively stringent, and the new Article 11, on evaluation, is important in this regard. The Commission’s reports on groundwater must include an assessment of this directive in its relation to other relevant environmental legislation – such as the Nitrate Directive – and of the degree to which it is in harmony with it. The wording of the directive has now been made clearer and less ambiguous, with concepts such as ‘background concentration’, ‘starting point’, or ‘significant upward trend’ being defined, and requirements that are unclear or open to reinterpretation being deleted. Where its implementation is concerned, the Member States are allowed more scope for devising their own solutions, with the possibility left open of contractual agreements between, for example, farmers, water treatment companies, and local authorities, and, when the directive is adapted in future, this House will be allowed more scope for its own input, since the new comitology procedure enables it to raise objections when the lists of pollutants, indicators and limit values are altered, and its consent is required before specific substances can be deleted from the list. The rural development regulation makes it possible for agriculturalists to be compensated for losses of income sustained by them in consequence of constraints imposed on their management of their land in order to protect groundwater. We sought compromises, and we have managed to find them. I am firmly convinced that we will be able to sustain and defend all this. There are some irregularities remaining in the various language versions, and I ask the language service to iron them out. The new groundwater directive will be an effective aid in protecting our groundwater, and so I ask all of you to vote to accept that which has emerged from the Conciliation Committee.

 Following the Council’s offer to the Member States of the option of voluntarily modulating 20 per cent of the agricultural direct payments from the first to the second pillar, this was incorporated into the Commission’s proposal and will, without doubt, have cuts in agricultural subsidies as a consequence. The Council, Parliament and the Commission had, in the Financial Perspective, agreed to review the EU’s expenditure on – among other things – the common agricultural policy, but not before 2013. Our farmers need the security to plan ahead if they are to remain competitive, and so it is now that we must ensure that the money set aside for the agricultural budget until 2013 remains unchanged, and that those funds will indeed be spent on agricultural activity. It is unacceptable that farming families should, through compensation payments, get better financial support in one Member State than in another. The object of European agricultural policy is to secure European farmers comparable economic conditions in a single market. Since the Commission’s proposal was not preceded by an impact assessment that might have brought to light any unequal treatment, it is impossible for Parliament to endorse it. I voted ‘no’ in the hope of making the farmers’ demands felt.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, everything that humans do to animals comes back to them: Pythagoras realised this as much as two-and-a-half-thousand years ago. Looking at the interaction between animal protection, animal health, sustainability, and environmental and food safety, I can see that this is still true today. Thankfully, animal protection now plays a major part in our society. The public’s desire for ethically and socially sound products is increasing, and recently we have been increasingly dealing with sensitive issues such as animal protection relating to breeding, transport and slaughter. I welcome the Action Plan for the Protection and Welfare of Animals, and I congratulate Mrs Jeggle on her report, in which she specifies unequivocally what is needed. We need measures to keep the public better informed about modern animal-protection methods and applied animal protection. We must improve marketing, and also labelling and communication strategies, to inform consumers and thus assist them in their purchasing decisions. A simple, precise ‘EU label’ for animal protection could help us harmonise the currently diverging systems of animal-protection labelling and lay down minimum standards for animal protection applicable throughout the EU – and, I hope, beyond our borders, too, in the near future. We must not forget to involve animal breeders and keepers and also public opinion in this animal-protection policy, however. Why is it that Community animal-protection policy has been restricted to farmed animals up to now? Are cats and dogs not worth protecting just because we do not eat them? This appears to be a legitimate question, as does the one as to whether pets are always kept in conditions appropriate to their species. We hear of all sorts of things taking place, for example birds being kept in cages, and snakes and other reptiles in urban flats. That is why this view has a rightful place in the report. We have been advocating a reduction in the use of animals in research, science and product approval. Animal testing should be carried out only in the absence of any alternatives.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our greatest asset is indisputably our health – physical, but also mental. All too often, health policy in the past and present has focused exclusively on considerations of physical health. This is tangible, often even visible, and is often easier to treat. In addition, even maintaining physical health is very cost intensive and, unfortunately, it is often the case that not all the available possibilities are still affordable today. Our healthcare network, from prevention to aftercare, is bankrupting the public coffers. It is not the intention of this report, on which I should like to congratulate Mr Bowis, that the EU play an active part in the health field. That is the responsibility of the Member States and should remain so. Nevertheless, we are in favour of the issuing of this Commission Green Paper to stimulate discussion of the importance of mental health in the EU, of the necessity of having a strategy, and of any priorities. We now know that good mental health is also a precondition for good economic performance. We need to ask ourselves questions and seek answers, however. To begin with: who are we referring to when we speak of those with ‘mental ill health’? Why are 13% of Europeans seeking professional help in this field? Why do so many people in the EU commit suicide? We have heard the figures; at the hearing a figure of 58 000 each year was mentioned. Why is society so ill? What are the causes? Are the demands of our society perhaps too great in general? Then there is the big question: what happens to these disadvantaged members of society? These issues need to be discussed in order to raise awareness. One thing is certain: social changes are also needed in order to prevent these illnesses. As we know, it is difficult to tackle the harshness and competitiveness of people’s working lives. Many things are easier to bear, however, if people have a haven, or a chance to withdraw. I am thinking here mainly of the family, which gives people the opportunity to rest and recharge their batteries. Nevertheless, families need help and support in order to fulfil all their important social functions. One thing is certain: it is not possible to control human beings by law, but it is possible and indeed necessary to create the conditions in which they and their health can grow – mind, body and soul. Let us support the family, therefore, and if that is one of the intentions of the report, that is a step in the right direction.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although wine is a product originating from specific regions, it is bought and sold throughout the world, and it is for that reason that an international framework is required to lay down oenological practices and ensure international competitiveness. We all know about the special way of enriching wines in Barriques; it is an old tradition, but one justified by the fact that storage in wooden barrels has a positive effect on the wine’s maturation process. However, the techniques used for storing wine are not static. As we strive to use the best practices in developing wines in line with consumers’ expectations, new knowledge and new possibilities become available to us, and these are being used in countries outside the European Union. It is at this point that I ask myself the question as to how we value tradition on the one hand and modern practices on the other. None of us would want, in this day and age, to still be travelling around by horse and cart. I do not think that the one should exclude the other, but we are losing our certainties. Mr Castiglione’s question about the practical legal aspects of allowing the use of wood chips and of labelling is the right one to ask. I think we need to take care that our wine labels do not end up being turned into the sort of leaflets that we get with medicines. What consumers want is bottles that look nice, with the most important information clearly visible. The labelling issue is a tricky one, one that I think is best dealt with at the national or regional level, as it should be. It cannot be the European Union’s function to regulate everything right down to the tiniest detail, or we will end up with the sort of thing with which we are familiar in the context of the labelling of allergenic substances, with demands being made for labelling in every conceivable language. It must also be clear to us that it is not possible to monitor what is done with barriques or wood chips. Where its maturation in barriques or with the addition of wood chips is concerned, wine is a regional product, and the question of objections on health grounds does not arise here. Wine has been matured in wood for many generations, and its effects on health are still not a matter of dispute.

) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. You, Commissioner, have told us many things and listed them for us, and we could actually even say that we have already achieved a great deal to address the concerns discussed and presented here. It was on 17 January 2006 that we adopted Mrs Prets’ report on ‘Strategies to prevent the trafficking of women and children who are vulnerable to sexual exploitation’; in March 2006 we adopted an oral question with a resolution on forced prostitution during international sporting events, and furthermore, on 8 March of this year, we organised the ‘red card to forced prostitution’ campaign in this House. However, we still just keep on going. All these projects contain very practical proposals for combating forced prostitution. At the moment the football World Cup is taking place in Germany. We know that during such events there is a spectacular increase in the demand for sexual services, and that before and during them there is an increase in the incidence of criminal activities such as human trafficking and forced prostitution. As early as March I asked, in this House, that, on the one hand, information be provided on the ground, in the countries from which most women are taken, with, on the other, in the country in which the event takes place, good information and public relations work, raising awareness among potential clients, a 24-hour multilingual telephone hotline and the guarantee that those who call it will subsequently be offered care and support by the police, emergency services and women’s refuges. While, on the one hand, the football World Cup has now begun, there was also an ice hockey World Cup – perhaps a slightly smaller event, but certainly with the same problems. Today we need to ask – and I want to thank Mrs Záborská for having formulated this question for us – in what ways this offer is being accepted. That is what we now have to focus on. The World Cup is now on, and the free telephone hotline - after initial teething problems – will now be in place until 31 July. However, we must draw conclusions from these projects that can be applied to future big events. We have to learn from any problems and find the right approach. I want to ask all of us and you too, Commissioner, to make this happen.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, just as we cannot live without air, we cannot live without water either. Water is literally a very profound substance, and we must take care lest we perish in its depths. I was reminded of this by the discussion about the common position on the groundwater directive over the past few days. The report from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety contains 43 amendments as a recommendation for second reading in Parliament. It was adopted by 50 votes to none with one abstention. Only four additional amendments have been submitted. I take this convincing vote as an unequivocal mandate for negotiations between Parliament and the Council. I hope that today’s debate will help to confirm this vote, so that the European Parliament can enter into the conciliation procedure with a strong platform and a clear mandate. For this reason, as your rapporteur, I propose that we vote on a package. I am opposed to all the amendments that were tabled with 37 signatures. They do not reflect the views of my own group. Sadly, the Council has not proved flexible enough to pave the way for an agreement with Parliament at this second reading. The conciliation procedure will now give us the opportunity to make further improvements to the common position that has been set before us. Improvements are desperately needed in some areas. The wording of the legal provisions must be formulated more precisely wherever it is still vague and open to interpretation. In addition, concepts referred to in the text must be defined. Inherent geogenically determined levels of pollutants must be taken into account when the status of groundwater is assessed. This will create the necessary flexibility to allow for differing circumstances in the Member States. The deterioration of groundwater caused by new pollutant discharges must be prevented by means of clear criteria for the reversal of adverse trends. The national threshold values must be set on the basis of toxicological and ecotoxicological criteria. These are the only criteria we have, and a study conducted by the European Commission has confirmed that this approach is actually feasible. A revision clause must be inserted in order to ensure that the effectiveness of the directive can be verified and that its provisions can be improved if need be. It is particularly important to me as your rapporteur that greater emphasis should be placed on preventive protection of groundwater. We have been campaigning for this for many years here, for prevention is better than cure. This truth is nowhere more evident than in respect of groundwater. It can take years and even decades before discharged pollutants are identifiable in groundwater after seeping through the soil. It takes just as long before enacted measures or the self-purifying properties of groundwater can eliminate damage once it has occurred. If the purification of groundwater is at all possible, it is an enormously expensive process, a point that is rightly emphasised by many of my honourable colleagues, especially those from the United Kingdom. In Austria and in my own country of Germany, between 80 and 100% of drinking water is obtained from groundwater. As we have just read, this is even the case in parts of Britain. This is precisely the reason why we must ensure that our groundwater which is still pure remains so for future generations. The groundwater ecosystem as such must be protected. Many telephone calls from fellow Members and numerous opinions from associations, as well as some motions for separate votes, all testify to a high degree of uncertainty. Given the difficult and highly technical subject matter and the scope of the regulatory provisions of the Water Framework Directive, this is hardly surprising really. The fact remains, however, that we need not entirely reinvent the wheel. This groundwater directive is a daughter to the Water Framework Directive of 2000, which already regulates many pertinent matters. Nevertheless, we must make its message clear and unequivocal. For this reason I eagerly await the message you will convey, Commissioner Dimas, on the comment about the Nitrates Directive and the reference to the latter. These provisions are extremely important to the European farmers who are affected by them. ‘Water instead of diamonds’ was the heading of an article that appeared last week in the financial section of a major daily newspaper in Germany. Slowly but surely, clean water is becoming a scarce and valuable commodity, as rare as diamonds. The demand for clean water will continue to rise in the coming decades. The last hundred years have already seen per capita 
consumption increase twice as fast as the population and as the real value of economic output. Investments in water-management enterprises are recommended. Today and in tomorrow’s vote we should pave the way for our groundwater to remain an elixir of life and a precious diamond for future generations.

Mr President, I should like to put a supplementary question to the Commissioner. Did I hear correctly just now that the Commission can accept Amendments 36 and 43? That is precisely what we have been discussing from such diametrically opposed positions here. Perhaps the translation has confused the issue somewhat. Could you explain what you said, Commissioner? I should be delighted if you could accept these amendments too, because they relate, of course, to the mutual compatibility of the directives. What I heard seemed to be open to interpretation, and a few explanatory words would be welcome.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it has been a case of ‘water, water everywhere’ this evening, with no end in sight! I welcome the call for international coordination of flood-risk management measures, and I thank my honourable colleague Mr Seeber for his balanced report. Water knows no boundaries, not only groundwater but also, and especially, the water carried by rivers, and for many of these rivers there are already cross-border plans and, as a result, cross-border measures too. Anyone who looks at the Rhine and the Moselle, which flows through my native region, as international European rivers will be aware that flood problems can only be tackled through the joint action of all the riparian states. If you observed people’s responses to flooding in our area, you might think that the inhabitants of the Moselle area had mastered flood management, that they had, as it were, become well practised in the art. However, anyone whose family has ever had to clear out their cellar, barn or indeed their entire dwelling on hearing an announcement from Trier that the water level is set to rise within the next hour by a certain number of centimetres, knowing that this will bring it into the hallway of their home – and thank God we can obtain such accurate information these days – will know what it means to be on constant standby whenever there is heavy or prolonged rainfall and will know all about the physical effort, the cost and the time involved in coping with these trials and tribulations. No region ever gets used to floods. Now we have been struggling with these problems for many years and during that time have found cross-border allies too. There have been rewarding experiences upon which we can build. Prevention and management in areas prone to flooding must be the task of the competent local bodies operating on the basis of internationally harmonised rules. In line with the aim of cutting red tape, the obligations of all authorities and tiers of government to the Commission must be kept to a minimum.

 Despite long debates and a great deal of effort at persuasion, we have not managed to regain our grip on reality. What is crucial is not the composition of a particular food, but the whole picture involving the interplay of healthy and balanced diet suitable for people when considered in terms of their specific situation as regards activity, age and gender. Any profile ought to take all these things into account, but, as these factors are constantly changing, we have to realise that there are no such things as nutrient profiles and that, instead, the only way open to us is that of education and upbringing, what rural German women call ‘learning to handle everyday life’, and which is best communicated through the family and school and general education. I also hope that the ‘traffic light’-style labelling to which consideration is still being given is no more than a witless joke. Who knows, though, what can occur to ‘such clever people’? One example of this approach’s divorce from reality is that no such information may appear on drinks, such as wine, with an alcohol content in excess of 1.2% by volume. On the one hand, then, scientific profiles are demanded, while on the other, the dissemination of scientific knowledge is prohibited. Wine is also governed by existing EU regulations, and that must also apply in this case. Our debates may well have been lengthy, but it is evident from the compromise that they did not go on long enough. I supported the amendments in the hope that they might make this squalid compromise tolerable.

 Madam President, Commissioner Verheugen, ladies and gentlemen, ‘better regulation’ has already become a catchword that no longer needs translating. It is important to review acts, regulations and directives on an ongoing basis, and it is right to then incorporate into the legislative text any amendments that new findings render necessary and possible. Consequently, I, too, welcome the Commission’s proposal to amend EC Regulation No 999/2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. I am obliged to the rapporteur, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, for her report. The improvements it introduces reveal a great deal of knowledge of practical necessities and possibilities, and we hope that the Council and the Commission will follow our recommendations. When we set this regulation in motion in 2001 – with inner uncertainty and without sufficient scientific evidence, and prompted by contemporary events – it was a good measure that pointed the way ahead. In the present day, we can see that there has been a change – indeed an improvement – in our sensitivity in dealing with animals, animal husbandry and feeding animals, at least. We support an internationally agreed system of measures to tackle bovine and transmissible spongiform encephalopathies at the level of the World Organisation for Animal Health. This will also make it possible to gather more information from countries that, unfortunately, do not yet have any data available. As Konrad Adenauer once said, there is no law against becoming cleverer. Our knowledge is now much greater as a result of the increased efforts in the field of research, too. Yet we have also been confirmed in our old knowledge of nature. Our measuring procedures have become so refined that it is possible to detect a sugar cube in Lake Constance. Zero tolerances can be measured, but they naturally entail problems – which some Members have just described – because zero tolerance does not exist in nature. That is why we need a tolerance for natural contamination of feed with animal protein, a practicable limit, which we should like to fix at 0.5% today. I think that this is a compromise that all parties can support, and for that reason I would also ask the Council and the Commission to support Amendment 57. Finally, I should like to remind the Commission that a loophole has emerged as regards the recycling of swill. The deadlines are about to expire. We are anxiously awaiting a proposal from the Commission on this, with a view to optimum, safe use and recycling of these materials, which are not waste products but recoverable materials that, if properly processed, can also be properly used.

 In a world of globalisation, standardisation and universal access to food, awareness of our origin, our tradition and ultimately also of our culture is a good and firm foundation on which we can build and further develop. European tradition and European origin are a unity in diversity. And that diversity distinguishes Europe, its regions and especially its people. The people have adapted to their regional conditions, which differ greatly. They have given rise to traditional ways of life and traditional products. We associate quite particular ideas and expectations with traditional and geographical labels. Today our products are traded all over the world. However, that makes it necessary to regulate these products, which go out into the world rather as ‘ambassadors’ for a town or region. We must ensure that whatever is behind a good name continues to be good. And we must ensure that there continues to be a link between the name of a product and its origin in a particular region. All this must be regulated as simply as possible, but effectively. This report serves that objective in every respect.

 The Commission announced the creation of the European Institute on Gender Equality even before Parliament had delivered its report on the subject. Procedurally speaking, that is the wrong way to go about it. We are voting on it today, and Parliament’s voice carries weight in this matter. The intention is that an Institute should be created, with a budget of EUR 54.5 million, with the specific function of monitoring men’s and women’s equality of opportunity by producing statistics and reports. This House has, however, for practical and financial reasons, and as recently as last year, recommended that the Institute for Gender Equality should form part of the European Human Rights Agency. More action and more resources are needed to address equality issues in an effective way, but no provision is as yet being made for them. It follows that the original idea of combining the two agencies in one single Agency for Fundamental Rights deserves support. It is for that reason that I have tabled Amendment 73. Rejecting the creation of an independent institute on Gender Equality is not in any way to be seen as an expression of hostility to policy on women’s issues. The money available to us should be invested in women’s education. That would be the first step towards equality. The current debate on the reduction of bureaucracy is another reason why an additional agency does not make sense and would not be something readily explicable to the public. It is for that reason that I have not voted in favour of this report.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a friend of my 20-year-old daughter recently told me, jumping for joy, that she had got herself a job as a hostess at the World Cup. When I asked her how this had come about, she – a sporty lass – told me that she had got the job by applying to the German Sports Association.  In this instance, I am sure that this is a proper job offer, but imagine that you live in poverty and your daughter announces that she has the chance, this summer, to travel to Germany, where a super job is waiting for her. Of course, as a mother or father, you rejoice at every opportunity your child gets, but who actually considers the risks involved or investigates whether the offer is genuine? That is just one of the many possible ways in which these things can happen. Providing information where people are is where we must start – the Commissioner has referred to the many surveys that have been conducted – but we must make people, whether parents or children, aware of the dangers inherent in every such questionable offer. We know that there is a spectacular increase in the demand for sexual services during major events like this, and, of course, in the incidence of criminal activities such as people-trafficking and forced prostitution. Only a very few women and children work without being in a brothel or managed by a pimp. Thousands are brought here from Central and Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America, attracted by false information and driven by poverty at home and by the need to feed their families. They come here and are broken, and exploited, in the most brutal fashion, so that they end up losing their dignity and their self-respect. Quite apart from providing information on the ground, there are things we have to do in the country in which the events are being held, things such as public relations work and a 24-hour multilingual telephone hotline – all these things are under consideration, and that is why we support these actions. Now in particular, at a time when the World Cup is being played for, we need to show the red card. Let us talk about how to do that.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is a lot to be done if we want to achieve the Lisbon objectives, and one thing must be clear: we will only get there with women. There is still an unreasonably wide pay gap between men and women in many Member States. There is still discrimination over promotion. The family still has to fit in with the job. Jobs ought to be geared to the needs of families, however. All areas certainly need to be thought through with an eye to gender mainstreaming, but they must also be thought through with an eye to family mainstreaming. New approaches need to be found here. We agree and do not like saying all that, but women still need greater support to develop their entrepreneurial spirit. Women make a contribution to Europe’s economic efficiency and competitiveness. Education and lifelong learning are the keywords. The greatest potential of Europe’s citizens is and remains their knowledge and that must continue to be promoted on a basis of equality. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Estrela, for going into the many issues thoroughly in her report. Mrs Thomsen has referred to the area of ‘women and research’, and I would like to highlight another field, namely domestic employment in the private sphere. There is basically no sensible reason at all for treating a job in the household differently from a job in industry or commerce. If a husband and wife go out to work and someone is engaged to do the housekeeping, that is a job, not a private pleasure. On the other hand, if our families were provided with competent domestic services – both in caring for and raising children and young people and in looking after and nursing the elderly – large areas of social work would be effectively covered and valuable jobs created at the same time. A recognised, insurable employment also brings in contributions to social security systems and opens the way for many women to leave moonlighting for legal work with social provision for old age and sickness. I think these are also reasons why such work is unpopular. Something that costs nothing is not accorded equal status and is not recognised as being worth anything and nobody wants that. We must create awareness in this area instead of further devaluing it with subsistence wages. The Member States must raise prospects: financially and fiscally as well as in the mind. Because a family-friendly society in Europe is the only way we will achieve the Lisbon objectives. The Lisbon Strategy is an opportunity for us to focus on these important areas. We must do this to crank up the process and keep it moving.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have travelled a long road, with many ground-breaking discussions along the way, and today we are meeting for the finale, so to speak. There are only a few of us left now, this being the third reading. I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Sjöstedt – our ‘pacesetter’ – who, with expert knowledge and a great deal of energy, managed to maintain the momentum of the negotiations all the way to the Conciliation Committee. Mr Sjöstedt succeeded in never losing sight of the goal, whilst clearly recognising when the time had come for closure and ultimately also for final compromises. I am much obliged to him for this. The directive on the management of waste from the extractive industries is, therefore, a success for the environment, for enterprises in the mining industry, and thus also for human beings. Environmentally sustainable activity does not just consist in doing nothing and making unspoilt nature the measure of all things, so to speak. Instead, we human beings have been set the – even biblical – task of subduing the earth. Europe is not characterised by primeval forest and unspoilt landscapes, but rather is known worldwide for its cultivated landscapes, developed over centuries. These should be used by people for people according to the principle of sustainability. Yet all intervention in nature also has concomitant effects; it would not be correct to say that mining has no impact on nature and the environment. Therefore, when assessing all intervention, return must be weighed up against expenditure, benefit against burden. As a result of the positive developments, technical possibilities and heightened environmental sensitivity of today, the yardsticks we use now are different from those we used just 50 years ago. We must put these achievements to good use in the interests of human safety and of preserving the health of our environment. We must also continue to stay on the ball at all times so that we can make use of the new possibilities that will undoubtedly present themselves in 5, 10 or even 20 years’ time. It was the serious accidents in the metal ore mining sector in Spain and Romania in the last 10 years that induced Parliament to call for this directive. Now that we have it, I think that we are on the right track towards achieving something positive for the environment and for human beings. (Applause)

 The object of the amendment of Regulation 1408/71/EEC is to carry out an annual update in order to improve EU citizens’ standard of living and the conditions under which they work. I voted in favour of it. We must not, however, forget to consider the substantive amendments that are so urgently needed. It is, then, to give one example, contrary to the spirit of the Regulation for German employers to be required to grapple with an intolerable amount of red tape in order to remit to Poland social security contributions totalling 47.85% (20.64% from the employer, 27.27% from the employee) of the earnings of Polish seasonal workers, particularly when, under German law, no such contributions were payable in respect of their work prior to the accession of Poland to the EU. For the businesses that employed them, the outcome has been dramatic increases in costs, liable to put the businesses’ continued existence at risk, and which they cannot offset by increasing prices. For their part, the seasonal workers will be unwilling to work for net wages reduced by 27%. The consequence is that few of them are recruited, and that has a negative financial impact on the development of the new Member States. Experience has shown that the demand for seasonal labour cannot be met on the German labour market, and so people are losing out on every side. The simplification that is so urgently needed could, with the Commission’s help, be accomplished either directly, by means of bilateral agreements, or by a derogation completely removing such traditional seasonal work as helping with the harvest from the scope of Regulation 1408/71 or its successor, Regulation 883/2004/EC, and that of the implementing regulation that is yet to be adopted.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the purpose of the revision of the two directives is to align them with the legislation in force. In particular, scientific developments and technical progress have to be taken into account. New substances are being authorised and, very importantly, the positive list of permitted additives needs to be revised. We have discovered that what is really needed is a fundamental revision of food additives. Unfortunately, that is not possible at the present time, however, and so we have to make corrections. It is, of course, a healthy exercise to strive to market foodstuffs that are as pure as possible, free from additives. Yet modern society is very demanding when it comes to foodstuffs: they have to be good, look fresh, taste good, and retain these characteristics for as long as possible. We are seeing increasing consumer take-up of the semi-prepared and prepared products on offer. There are many reasons why the modern housewife can no longer get by without these convenience products; chief among these being lack of time for housekeeping and lack of knowledge of cooking and nutrition. Who still knows nowadays how to make a stew, potato dumplings or mashed potato? The foodstuffs industry fills these gaps. It has to use the auxiliary substances needed to meet the demands of consumers. We have come a long way in this regard: long shelf lives and instant products enable a wide variety of fast, time-saving meals. Consumers also make demands as regards food safety, however. That is why we are standing here today, on behalf of the consumer, demanding safety by means of equivalent standards and lists for the whole of the EU. I support the report by my colleague Mrs Drčar Murko and thank her for her careful treatment of the issue. Nevertheless, I should like to make a plea, late in the day, for consumers to visit a farm once more – in spite of all the modern achievements – to buy and sample food in its original form, as it were. Let us give our children the chance to learn cooking and housekeeping, then they can decide for themselves.

 Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for her statement on this issue. Our group has two points of view on this subject, and I do not propose to mince my words in setting them out. The fact is that the Commission has acted – to say the least – shamelessly and unacceptably in making these concessions in the EU-US Wine Agreement, and that I say, as a Member for one of the oldest vine-growing regions in Germany, also on behalf of the vine-growers of the Moselle. You yourself stressed the obvious need for a trade agreement with unambiguous rules, and the negotiations have also been going on too long already, but what we need is an agreement with fair conditions for both parties. This document, with its long and vague deadlines and, worst of all, the concession of unconditional mutual recognition of oenological processes in wine-making, is a slap in the face for all the efforts the European Union and its Members have put in to legislation on vine products. The Commissioner said that there is a need for further discussions, yet we have negotiated for so long that I have to ask why we are putting off such important decisions. The production and manufacturing of wine in Europe is subject to clearly defined conditions. Adding water to it is something we see is unthinkable and which the consumer would not stand for. Are we now to accept that the Americans may add water to wine up to 7%? Modern methods involving the breaking-down of wine into its individual components are a workable proposition these days, but are we, by way of mutual recognition, to accept that it can be put together industrially and any old how? We have no need of synthetic wine! Wine is diverse, its diversity a manifestation of nature itself, owing its character to climate and vintage. Is the Commission not aware of the likely effect of such a concession, which affects future agreements, on negotiations within the WTO? The ‘most favoured nation’ principle laid down by the WTO means that, later on, the same concessions will have to be made to other states. The International Wine Institute is endeavouring to find a globally valid definition of wine, and this is being taken ad absurdum
. Commissioner Fischer Boel also mentioned another organisation. The USA has left the OIV. Does that mean that the OIV has in some sense gone bust? Yet what we insist we need – the protection of geographical indications of origin without the specification of a date – is simply being put off for ever and a day. Champagne comes from Champagne, Rhine wine is grown on the Rhine, and Moselle on the Moselle – not somewhere in America. If we want fair trade, then such descriptions must be banned now rather than at some unspecified date. Even maintaining the current status quo strikes me as going too far. What I want the Commission to tell me is in what sense the negotiations around this agreement can be described as a success; as I see it, all we have done is to make concessions, and too many of them at that. I feel – and let me say on behalf of the many winemaking families at present bringing their harvest home from the vineyards, we feel – that a deal has been done to sell us down the river.

 My concern is with the manufacture of gelatine and bio-gelatine. Both types of gelatine are manufactured using the same production process. The only difference is in the collection and monitoring of the raw materials, those for the manufacture of bio-gelatine being derived only from pigs reared under monitored ecological conditions, with all the regulations applicable to ecological rearing observed and complied with. Annex 6, part C of this Regulation includes a derogation for raw materials for the production of conventional gelatine, as non-organically produced agricultural products may, up to a certain percentage, be included in the manufacture of organic products. That is only right, since the current demand for gelatine still far exceeds the supply of bio-gelatine. There are, in Germany, many businesses engaged in the manufacture of bio-gelatine. In order that the production of such bio-gelatine may continue to be permissible, Annex 6, part B of the Regulation must include the following processing aids:

 Mr President, Commissioner, in this Common Position, many of the amendments adopted by this House at first reading have been taken on board. Improvements include the definition of waste, which has been made clearer, and a more precise description of the financial securities and the inventory of closed sites, along with the rules applicable to them. I can also go along wholeheartedly with what Mr Sjöstedt has just said; good work has been done, with a good cooperative approach, but there is one point, and a crucial one, on which we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats take a different view, and that is where the differential weighting of waste is concerned. We have to take account of the fact that mining waste has a different potential risk, and, as the Common Position does just that, it is right that the Member States should be able to distinguish between hazardous and non-hazardous waste and reduce – or annul – the conditions placed upon non-hazardous, non-inert waste other than that very precisely defined as hazardous and included in Category A. There is a wide spectrum of mining waste, extending from such harmless materials as playsand, salt and topsoil at one end to the toxic cyanide derived from ore mining at the other. We cannot apply one single measure to everything. Particularly where non-hazardous, non-inert waste is involved, the imposition of excessive burdens on small and medium-sized businesses in the quarrying and earth-moving sector is indefensible. As you, Commissioner, pointed out, a quarry, or a sand or gravel pit cannot be regarded in the same light as a landfill for hazardous waste; all they are doing is meeting the demand for building materials. I ask that the amendment to Article 3 be adopted. It is intended to extend the scope of this directive to the burning of chalk. People are willing to buy and use the waste products resulting from this, of which chalk dust is one; they are not hazardous and the Landfill Directive is not meant to apply to them. This would avoid unnecessary costs associated with landfill. In all that we do, we must not lose sight of our objective, which is to keep people and the environment safe with the minimum of red tape and expense. This is intended to achieve that end.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I too welcome the Commission’s proposal for simplifying the funding and administration of the existing environmental programmes and, in LIFE +, combining them into one single financial instrument. I, too, am all in favour of protecting the environment and of making whatever financial provision is necessary for it, and I would be happy if we were able today to make generous financial arrangements for the protection of nature. I do believe, though that the failure of our financial planning for 2007-2013 means that it would be unrealistic to make specific financial demands today, and an illusion to believe that we can. Right now, we do not know how much the overall European budget will add up to. We all know that the whole house, the financial framework, must be standing before we can furnish the rooms. We have given a very full description of the way in which the Structural Funds and rural development, on the one hand, compete against LIFE + on the other. As things stand at present, we have to ask ourselves which measures it makes sense to promote through LIFE +, and which tasks should continue to be entrusted to the Member States. Should not, for example, the protection of forests remain a responsibility and task for the Member States? Why, for that matter, should the acquisition of land be funded by LIFE + money? The assumption is being made here that the mere acquisition of a plot of land by an environmental organisation itself protects the environment, but what is at issue is not to whom the land belongs, but how it is managed; to put it another way, its management as a FFH area, a habitat for flora and fauna, has to be ensured and promoted, with the resultant tasks and costs being covered by LIFE +. Proper management of areas of land is what protection of the environment is all about, and it ends up being much better value for money too. I am strongly opposed to the institutional support of non-governmental organisations; LIFE + must not be used to underwrite such bodies’ administrative costs, but to fund projects that are of practical benefit to the environment.

 Mr President, having voted against the Isler Béguin report, I wish to make clear that I am in favour of protecting the environment and also of the financial settlement, which is absolutely necessary. I also favour keeping to the position we arrived at on the financial perspectives, as laid down in the Böge Report. I am, however, opposed to the institutions giving support to environmental associations or non-governmental organisations, and against the European Union taking upon itself any more functions. Even in protecting the environment, subsidiarity must be the order of the day. Primary responsibility for it lies with the Member States. That applies to forestry policy, and also to the buying-up of land for nature conservation. When money is tight, we have to concentrate on what is essential, that being support for the environmentally-responsible management of land.

 It is because there is more to agriculture than the production of food that its maintenance in all the Member States is an important task for the European Union. Economic and rural development benefit from it, and a healthy natural and cultural landscape is guaranteed. Farmers must continue to be guaranteed financial support through the common agricultural policy, and the EU’s long-term financial planning must reflect this. The accession of Bulgaria and Romania, which is scheduled for 2007, will make the financial situation more acute. No provision is as yet being made for more funding to be allocated to the CAP in order to take account of this enlargement; on the contrary, the draft envisages a reduction in, or capping of, resources. The accession would further reduce the funds set aside for farmers in the existing Member States, and so, should the CAP’s financial resources prove insufficient to meet the need, contributions would have to be sought from the individual Member States, which would be obliged to find the shortfall for their own farmers. Far from adding up to the renationalisation of agricultural policy, this would mean that its funding would be secure in the long term. If the benefits of the common agricultural policy are to be retained, it may in future be necessary to ask the Member States to bear their share of the costs, for it is not acceptable that farmers should foot the bill for the European Union’s enlargement, and that funds for other policies should be quarried from the agricultural budget.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the market in fruit and vegetables has been subject to wide fluctuations in price since time began; it is something to which producers have – more or less – grown accustomed. In the past, intervention by way of market withdrawals failed to improve the sector’s stability, and so, in 1996, the reform of the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables introduced a new instrument in the shape of what was termed the operational funds, thus transferring resources from intervention to a modern and forward-looking instrument. It is now for us to come up with progressive instruments for the fruit and vegetables sector. We cannot work on the basis of a ‘return to old-style intervention’, still less to developing and extending it, or of a crisis management system existing to deal only with crises in the market. As I understand it, a modern crisis management system should also bear the brunt of crises brought on by the weather, for example, by supporting multi-risk insurance. This is something we should think about. It is not enough, where processed products are concerned, simply to plead the cause of production thresholds, which are antiquated and obsolete, and of processing aid. Why do we not also give thought to decoupling aid in the fruit and vegetable processing sector? Now that decoupling characterises the whole of the reform of the common agricultural policy, it ought also, for the sake of consistency, to apply here. The Commission has decided to proceed with the simplification of the common organisation of the market in fresh fruit and vegetables and with the revision of the COM in processed fruit and vegetables, both in 2006. As regards fresh fruit and vegetables, the requirements of a modern market organisation are, today, largely met. I am persuaded that the common organisation of the market in processed fruit and vegetables is in need of fundamental reform. More good approaches are required. Here in Europe, there is a need for a fundamental debate on this, and a market-oriented sector needs indications as to the way it should go in future.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was with the 1976 Bathing Water Directive that uniform minimum standards for bathing water in the European Community were first laid down. While the 1976 Directive specified 19 physical, chemical and microbiological parameters for the assessment of water quality, the present Common Position from the Council reduces the test criteria to a mere two microbiological pathogens, to which it adds the visual checking and measurement of the pH value of fresh water. In general terms, the Commission proposal for a new bathing water directive forms part of the European Union’s comprehensive policy on water, being based on more recent scientific discoveries, and on WHO studies in particular. Whereas, in 1976, values described as ‘adequate’, still put between 7% and 9% of bathers at risk, the WHO now stipulates values permitting a maximum risk of 5% incidences of illness among bathers. In its Common Position, the Council has introduced a new parameter of ‘sufficient’, which does not, however constitute an improvement over the 1976 standard. This is where opinions differ. You said, Commissioner, that the main argument is that the costs would be too high, yet many of the alleged additional costs arise from compliance with the standards of the Water Framework Directive, the Nitrates Directive and the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive. The minimal costs that actually are incurred by reason of compliance with higher quality standards are now, though, covered by the reduction in social costs, quite simply because, at the end of the day, fewer people become ill. I, personally, would argue in favour of the introduction, with immediate effect, of the higher quality standards proposed by the WHO and the Commission. Although preventive healthcare is not something that can be put off to another day, Mr Seeber has joined with Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines and Mrs Ayuso González in tabling a compromise amendment on behalf of the group. It provides for a transitional period of eight years, which will be sufficient to achieve the quality standards. There are those countries that believe that the new quality standards impose particularly heavy burdens on them, and the amendment is intended to allow them more time to prepare themselves for their greater rigour and to deal with any problems they may have. I ask the House to support this compromise amendment.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, water is life, and groundwater is our main source of fresh water and hence also of drinking water, providing as it does 60% of the latter. Groundwater is, though, not just a vital resource for the extraction of our drinking water; it is also essential to agriculture, industry and our eco-system. However hard we try to keep our water – and our groundwater in particular – clean, and to restore its purity where it is already polluted, we must, not least at European level, strike a sensible balance between the requirements of the water industry, the needs of agriculture, the eco-systems and the resources available for maintaining and restoring the purity of water in the Member States. As the re-purification of polluted groundwater is very difficult, very time-consuming and, in particular, very costly, prevention and the protection of the groundwater eco-system are particularly important. On the European continent, at any rate, groundwater bodies, like rivers, know no borders. It is for that reason, and also because differing requirements in the Member States inevitably lead to distortions of competition for industry and agriculture, that the protection of groundwater is a task for Europe. Fortunately, though, we are not starting from nothing. This proposal from the Commission is derived from the Water Framework Directive, which has been in force since the year 2000, and was meant to be transposed in all the Member States from the end of December 2003. The primary task imposed on the Member States by the Water Framework Directive was the inventarisation of all waters by 22 March 2005. If all the Member States have met that deadline – and perhaps Commissioner Dimas can tell us whether or not they have – then every one of them ought, by now at the latest, to know in what condition its waters and groundwater are. The Water Framework Directive lays down quality and quantity targets for all Community waters, including groundwater, and specifies the means whereby they are to be achieved. This daughter directive is intended to deal with two points that remain outstanding, firstly the criteria by reference to which groundwater is to be categorised as ‘good’ or ‘poor’ and, secondly, the point in time at which action must be taken if deterioration is established. We must also determine whether there is a need to enact rules on the indirect introduction of pollutants from point sources and diffuse sources. We must consider in their context all the relevant directives: the Water Framework Directive, the Priority Substances Directive, the Nitrates Directive and the Plant Protection Products Directive. The costs incurred in administering and implementing them, and in monitoring their implementation, must be tolerable, without making it less likely that groundwater will be maintained in a good chemical status in all 25 EU Member States, for that is our objective. We would, though, risk missing this target if we were to adopt the so-called compromise amendment 94 to Article 6, which has been tabled jointly by the PSE, the Liberals, the Greens and the GUE/NGL Group, and which would alter the fundamental direction not only of my report, but also of the Commission proposal and of the Water Framework Directive. It seeks to overburden the Member States by drawing up new lists of what it describes as hazardous substances and by imposing tasks to be regulated by the chemicals policy now in REACH. It proposes a new category of groundwater bodies mandated with the certification of safety zones with the chemical status of ‘very good’, and calls for an array of new examination, reporting and supervision requirements, the additional costs of which would be borne by the Member States and by municipalities. The amendment is also couched in very vague and repetitious terms. It goes as far as to do away with all the derogations from Article 6(2) that water experts regard as necessary and that are also contained in the 1980 Groundwater Directive. We must not accept this amendment; the laboriously-achieved compromise in the Water Framework Directive must not be altered by a daughter directive on groundwater. There are two other amendments proposing uniform European standards on the quality of groundwater for important indicators and pollutants. I think it very important, if we are to avoid distortions of competition and have a comparable standard of groundwater protection throughout our Member States, that we in this House should call for uniform European categories of this kind for the evaluation of groundwater as ‘good’ or ‘poor’, and so, with this in mind, I ask you to support Amendments 111 and 112. We also have to draw a clear distinction between pollutants and indicators. I have tried to separate them completely, for sulphate, chloride and aluminium are not in fact pollutants, but rather important indicators of the chemical status of the groundwater and of the possible presence of certain impurities and pollutants. It is ultimately impossible to constantly monitor every conceivable pollutant, for there are hundreds or even thousands of them. Let me conclude by asking the House to support Amendments 89 and 90, which divide the list into indicators and pollutants. I ask you all to ensure today that our waters will, in future, be well protected by a Europe that acts together. (Applause)

 We reaffirm our belief that Bulgaria and Romania should become members of the EU. Before this takes place, though, they must meet certain criteria, which must continue to apply. The Commission’s latest progress reports confirm that both countries have a great deal of ground to cover before they meet the accession criteria, in particular with regard to the fight against corruption and the establishment of a judiciary operating under the rule of law. It is for this reason that we particularly welcome the efforts undertaken by the new Romanian Government, which is resolutely pushing ahead with reforms in order to overcome the delays caused by its predecessor. It would be premature to take a decision on the matter at this time, in view of the fact that both countries are still a remarkably long way from meeting the accession criteria. In our opinion, it would have been more appropriate to delay the decision on accession until the Commission has presented its next progress report. The fact that we are still 20 months away from the envisaged date of accession would have been further justification for such a delay. We regret that we do not feel able to vote in favour of accession at this time.

 On this World Women’s Day 2005, I would like to focus attention on all women who go about performing their duties in a perfectly normal way. I would like to make their primary concerns – provision for families, for children, and also for older people – matters of political interest. We talk a lot about gender mainstreaming; I would ask that we also give thought to family mainstreaming when taking policy decisions that affect society. In future, when taking policy decisions, we have to examine the effect they will have on families; state programmes for encouraging women to return to work, in particular, must in future be guided by the principle of family mainstreaming. Work and society must fit the family rather than the other way round. Agricultural statistics, for example, still take insufficient account of the work done by farmers’ wives. On commercial farms, women work for around 63 hours a week. Agricultural statistics first deduct around 50% under the heading of provision for the family. Farmers’ wives do unpaid work at home, on the farm and for the family in exactly the same way as all women work in addition to the time they spend doing a job, but statistics take no account of what they do; it is still not taken seriously by society, and is not recognised as an economic factor. Generally speaking, the services performed by women must be fully taken into account in calculating the gross national product.

 Protection of our natural environment can be achieved only by a real partnership between nature protection agencies and farmers, and so the Commission’s financial proposal must not jeopardise cooperation between them. It is farmers, across the length and breadth of Europe, who both ensure that nature is accessible to all and produce healthy food. Our farmers are in no doubt about what is required of them; they farm in accordance with best practice. It is for that reason that there must be certainty about the additional requirements prescribed for FFH areas by the European Union, also being adequately funded by it: ‘he who places the order pays the bill!’ It is not acceptable that the funding of Natura 2000 should be to the detriment of other agricultural and environmental measures or of other rural development programmes. Many issues have yet to be resolved. Precisely what actions are ultimately to be taken in the certified areas is to be decided at regional level in the first instance. It is important that funding for these actions should be in place. Those resources intended only for the management and organisation of the Natura 2000 areas must be kept to a minimum. We have to take care that there is no build-up of additional bureaucracy. Rather than putting money into management, bureaucracy and administration, the projects that are funded must be efficient, must help the environment and achieve tangible results.

 Mr President, Commissioner, in Germany we have a rule that is no less clear for being unwritten, namely that he who places an order foots the bill, and indeed it is a well-known fact that very little happens in this EU of ours without money. The European Union ordered, or rather instigated, the establishment of the Natura 2000 network throughout Europe. Yet the EU has still not provided a precise definition of what kind of measures must be taken, what kind of regulations must be adopted or what kind of arrangements must be made with regard to the sites that have been designated, and indeed this fact was pointed out a short time ago by Commissioner Dimas. The annual cost of Natura 2000 has now been estimated by the Commission to be EUR 6.1 billion. This is a great deal of money, yet at the same time it is very little for all 25 Member States, depending on the final scope of the programme. At present management plans for SACs have to be drawn up on a national and regional basis, and it is not hard to see that each area will have varying requirements when it comes to a field as complex as environmental protection, and that different measures will therefore need to be put in place. Questions still remain, such as the instances in which greater expenditure will become necessary, and whether there should be changes to land use, given that this would mean a shortfall in income and financial losses for agricultural undertakings. The Commission is now proposing that money spent on these commitments should come from existing EU funds. This is a source of some concern to me, and it would mean that a struggle for funding of the kind referred to by Mr Florenz would be inevitable. A separate financial instrument must be created that allows compensation to be granted in every instance where restrictions have been imposed as a result of Natura 2000 sites being designated. That, Mrs Haug, is what the farmers are calling for. It is intolerable that an increase in funding for SAC compensation should occur at the expense of agricultural and environmental measures or of other rural development programmes. Sufficient funding must be provided by the European Union for any additional tasks and costly obligations it imposes. This would then safeguard the substance of Natura 2000.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what we are aiming at includes less bureaucracy and greater simplicity; this single Regulation is meant to replace four basic directives on pesticide residues. This is not just about food safety and health, but also about equal opportunities in competing in the internal market and – let us not forget – on the global market. Producers and processors must operate under identical conditions, and all consumers are entitled to safe food. The European Food Safety Authority has great responsibility where risk management is concerned. It is no use whatever to consumers to get, week in and week out, one new warning after another, sometimes petering out into such generalisations as the statement that, for example, apples from a particular Member State are exceeding the maximum permitted levels, when such announcements are helpful only if they include the name of the company whose products contain excessive residues of pesticides. We are setting very high standards right across the EU, particularly where health is concerned, and quite rightly too. Equally, though, we have to look more closely at imports into the European Union. There is no room for double standards here, and what that means – as I see it – is tighter controls on imported goods. We cannot intervene in their production processes in the way we can with the food produced here, and that makes it all the more important that the end market be checked and monitored. I am glad that the committee was able to come up with a compromise on the definition of ‘good agricultural practice’. Europe’s farmers produce in accordance with the most stringent legal requirements, as is best known in the case of the rules on cross-compliance. Those who farm in accordance with the law must also be certain that their products pose no health hazard. I am grateful to Mr Sturdy for the work he has done over many months, and for the good compromise that we have been able to reach.

 Mr President, you have just made a statement about the Bureau’s decision, explaining why the  ‘catch-the-eye’ debate system has been changed. In this regard, I would like to make a formal protest against this change. This procedure was introduced in order to invigorate our debates, to generate dialogue with the Commission and to strengthen the debating culture. What the Bureau has now decided is completely counter-productive and I would like to ask you, please, to bring this matter up at the Conference of Presidents and to answer this protest.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Bowles report includes an examination of the problem of VAT fraud – and rightly so, for it runs to EUR 20 billion a year. I support the proposals on this matter. It is important to point out, however, that we need a change of system – structural reform – in this area. What we have been hearing from the Commission in this context has never been more than a statement of intent to step up intergovernmental cooperation in this matter and to engage in evaluation, research and so on. Given the volume of fraud that is taking place, it is high time the Commission abandoned its passive stance and supported the reformist Member States that actually intend to introduce this reverse-charge procedure. This is also a call to Mr Kovács to have an overdue rethink on this issue. I hope that we shall receive an appropriate proposal before this parliamentary term is over and that the proposals from the Austrian and German Governments will be endorsed.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the light of this debate it can be said that the ECB is a kind of rock in the waves. That is to be welcomed. Obviously price stability is the top priority in the economy, If that continues to be so in the future, that can only be positive. We have noted that the average inflation rate in the euro zone is 4%. In some euro zone countries it is even higher, for instance 5.8% in Belgium and 5.1% in Spain. That is bad news. Therefore the signal – the European Central Bank decision – sent out this week is important. We just have to note, here in Parliament too, that the ECB obviously cannot do anything to combat inflationary oil prices. However, the secondary effects that will be felt in the euro zone, for instance higher wages, which the unions are demanding, and at the same time higher prices, which then affect businesses, hold a risk and ultimately lead to a vicious circle. I should like to make two further comments on the politicisation of the European Central Bank. We are constantly coming across that in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and it has also been made clear in this debate. For instance, the question of transparency of the decision-making process is a signal in that direction, an attempt to find out more and more, and also to step up influence on the decision-making process. Greater transparency – I am wary of that. I think the Bank has to decide for itself and, of course, in consultation with Parliament and euro zone representatives. Justification of decisions, though – that is going too far. We should – and this will undoubtedly play a part in the next round – reconsider very carefully when extending the euro zone whether we can continue with this policy. Slovakia was a warning sign for me. We should be less concerned with politics in the future and pay more attention to the criteria.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to make a very few remarks on this report, one aspect of which, as you know, is that it contributes to the process of deregulation and the reduction of red tape. The report provides for an obligation on the Commission to report annually to Parliament, informing us how this process of cutting red tape and deregulating is proceeding and, we hope, how well it is succeeding. We in Parliament, however, can play a far more prominent role in this process. It is therefore my hope and wish that, in addition to this reporting obligation on the part of the Commission, we ourselves can be far more actively involved in this process, for example through our work in committee. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in particular can take the lead in these matters, which includes engagement in dialogue with Commissioner Verheugen and the Stoiber group. Accordingly, we in Parliament still have work to do on this dossier, and I would like to take this opportunity to emphasise that point.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am against the common position on including aviation activities in emission allowance trading for all kinds of reasons. Aviation accounts for less than 5% of the total emissions in the transport sector and in this respect we are to some extent playing token politics here. Besides, we have not been able, as Europeans, to find a global approach to this issue, which means that our measures will put European airlines and airports too at an unfair disadvantage. What is more, we have basically failed – as would have been made clear – to carry out a proper cost-benefit analysis. This means that the measures we have agreed on today are neither sensible nor necessary and we have created here a situation that is not convenient and that basically runs counter to the Lisbon Strategy. We have not in fact strengthened Europe’s position; we have handicapped it and we have done it one-sidedly, which is why I am against the common position. We would have done better to put more into our infrastructure and create a common European airspace. This could have produced cost savings that would have been much more beneficial than the measures we have now set in motion here today.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this revision of the Design Directive revolves around the question of whether or not the protection that is rightly afforded to the design of car bodies should be extended to matching visible spare parts, such as wing mirrors and headlights. The consequence of extending – in my opinion overextending – the protection of designs would be to give vehicle manufacturers a monopoly in a market valued at EUR 13 billion. Design protection for spare parts would exempt about 25% of the entire market in spare parts from the scope of the Motor Vehicle Block Exemption Regulation. The repair clause proposed by the European Commission ensures that the Block Exemption Regulation, which is the basic law governing the motor vehicle sector, will apply to the entire spare parts and repair market, as is the case at the present time in only Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. The transitional period of five years proposed by the PPE-DE Group for the entry into force of the directive is adequate and, in my opinion, more than generous. Let me sound a warning, however, against further delays, including any that might be caused by the Council, because consumers have been waiting quite a long time now for lower repair bills and cheaper insurance premiums while these lengthy discussions have been taking place here in the House and among the Member States. Moreover, we should not leave it to the European Court of Justice to determine the inevitable consequence of further inaction but should be creative in our role as legislators. On the basis of the standards we set tomorrow, the Council should endeavour to reach a decision too.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as regards the purpose of the report, which is to include European aviation activities in the scheme for emission allowance trading, a number of questions arise. What is beyond question, however, is that we have clear indications that this is not a particularly successful scheme, and although the Commission has data showing that it is not successful, we are now about to include aviation in the scheme as well. That is my main point of criticism and it prompted me not to vote for the report. By including European aviation in the scheme, we are approaching this as an isolated solution. However, that is the very point which ultimately jeopardises the competitiveness of European airline companies and, alongside these companies, the competitiveness of European airports as well. To my mind, this is not acceptable and we must do all we can to identify global solutions which include other airlines and other airports too. That is the only way to achieve a solution which is good for the environment but is also good for competition in the European Union.

 Madam President, I voted against the Davies report because, in my view, we have taken what is, in essence, an unacceptable and unrealistic decision by envisaging uniform CO2
 efficiency categories for cars. There should have been a sliding scale based on size and weight, primarily to level the playing field for manufacturers in the European Union. Let me give you an example: it makes a difference whether I heat a house or just one room. That is why it also makes a difference whether I drive a large car or a small car. That is why there needs to be segmentation and a sliding scale based on weight. We have missed that opportunity, which I think is regrettable, and with this decision – which I did not support – we have also missed the opportunity to establish a measure of balance between the interests of the environment and those of industry.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, of course we all know that smoking is bad for our health. Nevertheless, I voted against the report on a smoke-free Europe as a matter of principle, for it is true to say that nowhere else has the state asserted itself quite so successfully as in the fight against smoking in public. Countries in the EU – and that includes us – are intervening on an unprecedented scale, with their smoking bans, in citizens’ private habits. We are experiencing a state-sponsored prohibition policy across the board, designed to train people to change their behaviour. The report itself makes this clear. Unanimity – or, as we have it today – virtual unanimity is no guarantee of freedom. The opposite is true. In essence – and this is something we should recognise – freedom thrives on the opportunity to deviate from the norm. Concerned citizens are on the march, we have the nanny state, and all those who have anything to do with this and support it think that it has nothing to do with liberty. They are quite wrong!

 Madam President, I did not vote for the resolution on Turkey because I am greatly concerned that the Turkish Parliament has agreed a military strike against Iraq. This could not be taken into account in the report, but is a very topical issue. Taking measures against a terrorist group is rather different from voting to invade a neighbouring country. It is not in the EU’s interests to see any destabilisation of Iraq. We should be reminding Turkey that, as a candidate country, it should be considering EU interests within the framework of common interests. This shows that full membership for Turkey – which I do not support, incidentally – with its shared borders with Iran and Iraq would mean a complete redrawing of the political map within the EU. In my view, we should spare ourselves the associated risks.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, REACH is in fact an example of how not to do it. It is not an example of better lawmaking in the EU, and it is for that reason that I have not voted in favour of our new legislation on chemicals. Much will now be dependent on the management of the new Chemicals Agency, but, whatever happens, things look set to get bureaucratic, with over 5 000 pages of rules and regulations putting Europe’s small and medium-sized businesses in particular at a disadvantage. REACH is no answer to the demand – repeated paternoster fashion in the EU – for better, in other words simpler, legislation. It is dubious whether it actually does anything to protect the consumer, but certain that it will impose additional burdens on European businesses. This is a fundamental problem, and we would be well advised to steer clear of this sort of legislative project in future.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have just heard that mechanical engineering is a crucially important sector of the European economy. Although this is the case throughout the European Union, there can be no question that it holds particularly true in my home country. An interesting point that should therefore be stressed in this connection is that this Directive was drafted, inter alia
, in response to calls from industry, which went to a great deal of effort to get this Directive on the table, with the slogan of ‘one product, one regulation for the internal market’. It goes without saying that this is a positive development, given that one of the advantages of this legislation is that the same type of machinery, with the same design, can be put into circulation anywhere in the internal market. Additional tests in the various EU Member States would of course be unnecessary. On the occasion of this second reading, and with the debate on the Services Directive in mind, I should like to make the following comment. If we were always to take this approach as our starting point for debates on the Services Directive, we would doubtless also make progress with that dossier. In this connection, I cannot help but mention that mechanical engineering in Europe is in fact particularly dependent on the Services Directive, because services as well as products are sold with machinery. While on the subject, I should like to make a second comment of a political nature. It has been reiterated during today’s debate that this Directive was a very long time – five years, to be precise – in the making. For most of this time, the European Union had only 15 Member States. As we are all aware, the EU is now operating with 25 Member States. In view of this fact, and also in view of the planned reduction in the number of regulations, it should be noted that it will probably take a great deal longer to reach agreement on similar regulations in the future, and both industry and the political bodies responsible for such matters should be aware of this fact. The principle of ‘less is sometimes more’ also applies in this instance. If I may, therefore, I should like to emphasise once again how much I welcome this Directive.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have just voted on the Bersani report, which I, as shadow rapporteur, had a part in guiding through this House. The report represents a good compromise between those who want the European Union to have more powers in fiscal affairs, and those who do not, be it in relation to the tax base for businesses or to the rate at which businesses are taxed. Even while we were voting, though, I was informed that the European Court of Justice has handed down a ruling in the case of Marks [amp] Spencer. The situation now is that this company, in the United Kingdom, can, by way of consolidation, consolidate gains and losses from Europe, and the United Kingdom will have to pay the firm tens of millions. I do not wish to discuss the case’s merits, but only to make it plain that what we want is a single system of law, with laws made, as they are now, by this Parliament and by us as its members. Here we have, yet again, a case of law made by judges, the fundamentals of which need to be debated. I do not believe that this is what the future of the European Union should be like.
 Christoph Konrad,

(DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will start by thanking Mr Bersani for his cooperation in drawing up the report. What has come into being really is a compromise, and that is something I want to emphasise, since there are of course other opinions represented in our group, and I can tell the Commissioner that resistance to this policy at European level comes not only from the Member States but also from among the ranks of our group, that of the European People’s Party. There is resistance not only to the single tax base for businesses, but also to the idea of a single corporation tax in Europe, which keeps on resurfacing in this particular debate. So where do I, speaking as the shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, think there will be particular problems? I believe that if you start by talking about the tax base, it is virtually inevitable that you will end up next discussing the Member States’ tax rates, and that is something we will have nothing to do with. If we are to harmonise the tax base, we must be aware of the fact that we are, by so doing, obliged to make a deep incursion into the nation states’ tax-raising competences, and we want nothing to do with that either. If a tax base for European enterprises is to be created, it has to be borne in mind that businesses – DAX companies, for example – are even now operating in accordance with international accounting standards, and that is something that we have to accept. If, Commissioner, we are to make tax policy at the European level, we have to be aware of the fact that that is not far removed from competence in tax policy as described in the European Communities Treaty. That is something that needs to be borne in mind. Finally, the fact that the European Court of Justice is due, tomorrow, to hand down a judgment in the case of Marks [amp] Spencer, cannot do other than emphasise the obvious truth that the case law of the Court of Justice in Luxembourg is now extending ever wider the influence of Brussels. That is something else of which this debate should take account, and I want to stress that we would be mistaken to allow the European Union’s common system of law to become a community founded on laws made by judges – something that I, for one, would regard as unacceptable.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is important to emphasise that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, too, is in favour of alternative energy, and of such energy not only being promoted, but also made competitive. It is unacceptable that it should remain subsidised indefinitely. We must put alternative energy on the path towards competitiveness. Listening to the debate in this House, I note that here, too, many Members place great trust in the state. Members are urging state intervention, basically forgetting that, after all, the oil price in a competitive economy still follows the market. It is first and foremost a market price; we have to accept this. Yet we are all aware that, ultimately, part of the problem is refinery capacity. This is insufficient at the moment, but the situation will change again somewhat. When, though, over 70% of fuel prices at the pump in EU Member States such as Germany is accounted for by tax, we Members of the European Parliament must appeal to the national governments to take ad hoc action on this, in order to give the public in high-tax countries, in particular, something back and thus ensure continued mobility in these work-oriented societies. This is another demand that is primarily of a political nature. One cannot rail against the markets whilst being responsible for 70% of the price oneself; this would be attributing responsibility in the wrong quarters. We would therefore be well advised to make it clear that the state should support alternative energy – in moderation – but that we should also invest in new technologies. There is a wide range of such options to choose from, for example hybrid-drive systems, amongst others. The emphasis here should be on moderation and good sense, however, rather than ideology.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Constitutional Treaty represents significant progress in the process of bringing Europe together, and that is why I voted in favour of it. At the same time, there are aspects of it that give me cause for concern, one of them being the open coordination method as cooperation – with non-binding legal status – between Member States in the fields of social and employment policy, research policy, health policy and industrial policy. The Commission is now, in these areas, empowered to take the initiative in enacting guidelines and action plans. What this means in practice is that policy initiatives – new ones – are taken first, and then the related powers and responsibilities may be created. The open coordination method represents the incipient transfer to the European level of what were formerly national areas of activity and blurs the demarcation of powers and responsibilities between Europe and the Member States. Competition between the Member States is necessary, but this process is likely, to say the least, to shut it down.

The European Union, founded in Rome in 1957, has always defined itself in Christian and democratic terms, based on Greek philosophy, Roman law and Christian faith. As a result of today's profoundly misguided decision by the European Parliament, we are abandoning this spirit of Rome.

That is where it saw the light of day, so to speak. Above all, we gave it our strong backing and it of course bears the hallmark not only of the commissioner but also of Mrs Hieronymi, whom all of us on the Committee on Culture and Education were glad to support. We have learned a great deal from the Erasmus Mundus project, which opened the door for our students wishing to go to third countries and vice versa. In the context of globalisation, this is actually necessary, and MEDIA Mundus goes in the same direction with regard to film-makers. It is a wonderful example of how one can organise an intercultural dialogue in this field, which has a commercial aspect of course, but which is also, and above all, a cultural dialogue. MEDIA Mundus will also support and implement the UNESCO Convention promoting cultural diversity in Europe and across the globe, establishing dialogue and striking a balance between economic and economical interests. With MEDIA Mundus we of course strengthen the mobility of our films, film-makers and students and, in the end, what Wim Wenders keeps reminding us to do happens, namely we give Europe a new face, we turn the European dream into reality. The American dream has been conveyed to us through films for decades, and this is still the case today. If we eventually go so far as to bring the European dream to the world in cooperation with third countries, through images, we will have done much more to stabilise the European Union than we could have done in many other ways. If we work together in today’s globalised world, we will be able to drive the Americans back on the world market to some extent and portray our dream a little better. I am sure we will be supported by third countries, perhaps South Korea or countries of South America, which we in fact want to help by making their small-scale productions become more visible on the European market. All in all, this is a project that helps all sides. It helps the third countries and the European film industry. It was high time this happened. MEDIA Mundus is, in my view, the appropriate response to global technical and socio-economic challenges. I should like to end by saying: ‘What helps our diversity will strengthen our identity’.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the autumn of last year, we gave up all hope that, following the so-called Prud Agreement between the representatives of the three main parties in Bosnia and Herzegovina on joint political steps in numerous political fields, something really would change in political life. Where are we today? For the most part they were empty promises which, on closer inspection, evaporated into thin air. The ethnic division in Bosnia and Herzegovina has deepened. The lack of trust has increased. People are being manipulated through irresponsible policies based on purely ethnic criteria, instead of the real problems being tackled. Everyone in Bosnia and Herzegovina needs the chance of a good education, everyone needs a good judicial system, they need jobs; in short they need the hope of a better future. The EU has been helping this country for years with a great deal of money and with manpower, but they obviously also need state administration structures which can take up and use these. I would like to mention three important points. The question of state ownership must be resolved. Constitutional reform must be tackled on the basis of a broad political and social consensus. Only the entire state of Bosnia and Herzegovina can accede to the European Union. The road map for visa liberalisation must be completed. The citizens, like their politicians, want to be able to travel freely. So the politicians should ensure that the green light is given at the end of this year. Every citizen needs a functioning judicial system, not one that dispenses one sort of justice in one case and another in another. Frustration is spreading everywhere. Civil society urgently needs to have a stronger voice in all areas, in order to remind the politicians of their job. However, it is difficult to come out of cover, because the party political network extends over the entire country. The few jobs which may be on offer depend on the goodwill of the parties. We wish the High Representative the best of luck in untying the Gordian knot of the politicians’ passivity, laissez-faire
 and laissez-aller
, so that peace and stability can finally return and the people’s future becomes rosier than it is at present.

 Madam President, Commissioner, we are meeting at an unusual time, but still, the oral question that we put today was born in the ‘A Soul for Europe’ intergroup. We believe that we will find this soul in our oldest units – the regions – where people communicate with one another with their particular accent, a specific dialect or even a regional language, where the local cuisine has its own specific taste, where truly local fruit and vegetables are sold at markets, where particular folk songs still reside, where particular tales and myths originate: in short, where people feel they belong, where they feel at home. The march of globalisation threatens to standardise so much, and many unique features will disappear. Only Europe’s wonderful regions can safeguard that specialness and they must be able to rely on the protection of the European Union. The richness and variety of the regions of Europe – they were often enemies, they were occupied, they were divided up, they were destroyed by war and re-united – must be retained. The regions are like our stem cells. The European Union has maintained something like a culture of the small and is bound by human rights in this area, too. Our brief debate today and the resolution should spur the Commission into finding ways to make the cultural richness of the regions even more visible and into finding ways for the EU to contribute to its preservation and continued development. Europe’s cultural potential must be used strategically. In 2009, the year of creativity and innovation, the possibilities of integrating ideas and initiatives from the public and civil service sector at the local and regional level should be exploited in a meaningful way. I would like to say to the Members of the Committee on Regional Development that we have absolutely no intention of curtailing existing regional policy – we merely wish to add to its cultural dimension. We implore the Commission to do its part, too.

Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, Croatia is the first country for whose accession to the European Union, following experience from the last two enlargements with Romania and Bulgaria, the bar has rightly been set very high, which is why the benchmarks and progress made by Croatia are especially praiseworthy. The remaining reforms in the judiciary referred to are being tackled. Full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague, the call for which was reiterated, is on the right path. With Slovenia, there is the question of bilateral border disputes. Commissioner, you suddenly referred to ‘European border disputes’. Before 2004, they were not European border disputes; they were border disputes which were not acknowledged. Nor, at that time, did anyone apply to the UN in order to settle this dispute; now they have done so. So, if Slovenia stopped obstructing the opening of the necessary negotiation chapter on the grounds of these bilateral border disputes, which were not an obstacle to its accession to the European Union, accession negotiations between Croatia and the EU could be concluded by the end of this year. The candidate country Macedonia has also made huge progress. If the elections to be held at the end of March meet international standards, the EU would finally have to set a date for the opening of accession negotiations. The purely bilateral dispute over names between Macedonia and Greece should not encourage Greece to enter a veto. All that remains is to hope that the two EU Member States of Greece and Slovenia remember their own situation before their accession to the EU and conclude that they should act fairly and in a European manner towards their neighbouring states. If, with the help of their neighbours, Croatia and Macedonia achieve the objectives I have described this year, that would send out a positive signal to the rest of the Western Balkan states that the EU is serious about the promise given in Thessaloniki about the accession of all the Western Balkan states, by which the CDU also stands Mrs Beer.

Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur, because I believe that together we have produced a very good resolution. This resolution calls on the Council and the Commission to ensure that joint action is taken in Kosovo, that EULEX acts together with the High Representative of the EU and that synergies are created in the interest of the economic and social life of Kosovo which is in need of improvement. The EULEX mission must also ensure that the court cases which have been going on there for years are finally addressed and brought to an end. There are still many atrocities which have not yet been exposed and brought before a court. Combating corruption in Kosovo is also important, as there are still many criminals at large who remain unpunished. In addition to what we have already heard, the European Union should consider not only taking action on a large scale, but also focusing more closely on the daily life of the people there and the opportunities for local projects involving local people. This work is very important. We must call on the government of Kosovo finally to begin the practical implementation of its constitution, which includes the Martti Ahtisaari plan. The people of Kosovo must become aware in their everyday lives that they all live together. In addition, Serbs, Albanians and all the other minorities in Kosovo must be regarded as citizens with equal rights. The government of Kosovo must also push ahead with its decentralisation programme. I am, of course, very much in favour of establishing a multi-ethnic European college, which would be another joint institution alongside the University of Priština and the University of Mitrovica that focuses on a shared future. In addition, I would like Serbia to realise at last that the Serbs in Kosovo do not want to be encouraged not to take part in the government. They must be allowed to take part in the government, in parliamentary work and in civilian life. This is the only way in which Kosovo will flourish.

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner. War, concentration camps, genocide – never again! After the horrors of the Second World War, no one in Europe could imagine that this could ever happen again. Yet it could: in the mid-1990s, six years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, whilst Western and Central Europe were growing together in peace, it happened again in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The mistakes of the international community – many years of looking the other way, of almost carefree dealings with the thugs there, of friendly handshakes with criminals such as Ratko Mladić – have strengthened acceptance of him and his accomplices: they got off scot-free when they followed the years of ethnic expulsions, of ethnic cleansing, with a massacre. To this day, Ratko Mladić has not had to answer to the courts. Who is hiding him? Who is helping him and thus placing themselves and him under an even greater burden of guilt? Many of the other perpetrators are also still at large, and some are even still living in Bosnia-Herzegovina among the bereaved families of the victims. Therefore, we must insist that not only the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague, but also the local war-crimes tribunals in Bosnia-Herzegovina, be able to do their jobs properly. The commemorative day we have proclaimed is intended as a shake-up, as a signal not to forget, and as a demonstration to the bereaved families that we mourn with them. Indeed, perhaps this day can serve to arouse awareness of these terrible crimes even in those who still do not believe that it happened, as even video recordings prove, and then the foundations for the necessary reconciliation can be laid. Without recognition of the direct and indirect responsibility for this massacre, there can be no peace. We owe this at least, and the conviction of the perpetrators, to the victims and their families.

 Mr President, I have an oral amendment to paragraph 22, which I have agreed with other fellow Members. We must correct the text because it does not exactly represent the truth. After the Missing Persons Institute and following the semi-colon, we should change the sentence. I will read the change out in English now:  –

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I read recently that Bosnia is a well-meaning state, but a state that is not working. This country has to live with the Dayton Agreement which, thank God, ended the war in 1995, but which contains too little for the state as a whole to function and too much for it to perish. The country has a political class which is as good as useless when it comes to taking responsibility. Two politicians in the country dominate the political scene and affect each other like interconnecting pipes. One wants to return to the pre-1999 days; in other words, he wants the break-up of the two entities. The other wants to make his entity into a state within a state. However, the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina can only function if everyone faces the facts and realises that constitutional reform is only possible with the agreement of all three ethnic groups. Both entities must strengthen the state as a whole. Therefore, Bosnian politicians themselves all need to set about constitutional reform through the competent institutions, especially parliament, and ensure that they involve civil society in the process. The Muslim-Croat Federation could set an example. The unworkable configuration of communities, ten cantons and a federal government was not its fault, but it is a nonsense. Decision-making levels must be reduced to the absolute minimum and brought as close to the citizens as possible, if the requirements of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and for accession to the EU are to be met. Around 167 ministers and all that entails are the biggest drain on the state. The rivalry between the two aforementioned politicians and their hangers-on is having fatal consequences. They are setting the ethnic groups against each other in the tried and tested manner by fomenting anxiety and mistrust. The ethnic divide has become wider rather than narrower. Instead of going all out to tackle a common energy supply, create a functioning common market, improve the general education system and attract investors to the country with credible policies, party political bickering and boundless mistrust rule current politics. Does Sarajevo still need the High Representative? He has not used his wide powers for a long time. No one any longer fears his command, even if it were to come; we can therefore ask ourselves if there is any reason why the EU Special Representative should not take over his position and take care of the EU conditions, so that Bosnian politics can finally start on the most important reforms needed to push the country forward. The politicians could not be more inactive than they are now, even after his departure. It only remains to hope that perhaps then they will wake up and take their fate into their own hands. The EU has been trying for years, with funding and know-how, to release the country from its agony, but the results are not overwhelming. The people who want to return are unable to do so and, as a result, the ethnic divide is becoming more and more entrenched. Obscure privatisations and corruption, the lack of freedom of the press in parts of the country, the intimidation of NGOs: all this is making people lose heart and turn their back on the country. The endless discussion about political reform ruled the political scene for over three years, until agreement was reached on a highly insubstantial bill. Nonetheless, the EU clutched at this straw and signed the agreement, so that other important political projects in the country could finally be pushed ahead. We here in Parliament also support this step and are waiting for the politicians to take advantage of this opportunity. I should like to emphasise once again that only the overall state of Bosnia and Herzegovina can become a member of the EU. Anyone who undermines its ability to function does not want to achieve this objective, whatever they may say. I can therefore only appeal to all members of parliament in the region to come to their senses once and for all and predicate their policies on the welfare of their citizens.

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I should like to say to our fellow Member, who is no longer here, and perhaps also to Mr Belder, that we should be cautious here: we should not localise the terrorist threat to Bosnia and Herzegovina. One can also go over the top, but this exaggeration only plays into the hands of the extremists and nationalists. I remember that it was precisely this sort of exaggeration that Mr Milosevic took in the same direction as he took everything else. We need to bear that in mind. The path to the EU requires, among other things, a decisive fight against corruption, against organised crime, for transparency during privatisation and the creation of a common market, including an energy market. Only politicians who really want this and act accordingly deserve the trust of their citizens and the trust of the European Union. We should give the others a red card now and then. That is the only thing they understand there. I sometimes see with horror that Bosnia and Herzegovina are choosing, at the crossroads described by Commissioner Rehn, to take the path towards isolation. The countries neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina – as Hannes Swoboda said – will most probably reach the target more quickly, which is why it is our job to keep helping Bosnia and Herzegovina to find the right path and to then join the European Union once the conditions have been met. The stability of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which lies in the middle of the European Union, is also our stability. I sometimes wish that the politicians in Bosnia and Herzegovina had as many sleepless nights as I do when they think of their country. Perhaps then they would do a better job.

Concentration in the media is a widespread evil and must be combated. First of all, however, there are several countries in the EU where concentration in the media is a problem, and it is therefore unacceptable to mention only one country. Secondly, in several places the report calls on the European Commission to act in an area of activity that is covered by the subsidiarity principle. Had that been amended, or had I been able to vote for such an amendment, I would have approved the Mikko report.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I do hope the fact that we are once again meeting in camera
 this evening does not imply anything about our basic attitude to education. The Bologna Process is truly the most radical reform of higher education in recent years. The flow of knowledge should surely not stop at national boundaries any more in this day and age. This is why it is also essentially gratifying that the Member States and the universities are prepared to work together on this matter, regardless of the subsidiarity principle they always prize so highly. I welcome that, but I also note that all the parliaments have been bypassed in this matter. The European Parliament was not contacted, nor were any of the 46 national parliaments. The galling thing is that we Members of Parliament are constantly being asked out there about this Bologna Process. If anything goes wrong, the finger is pointed at us, yet we have nothing at all to do with it; not even the Commission has had anything to do with it. I am glad to say that the Commission is now on board and is helping to get this Bologna Process off the ground in the framework of our educational programmes with which you will be familiar. In short, the labour pains were difficult, and they are not yet over. It would have been wise to involve the parliaments. By 2010 we want to create a European area of higher education. That goes without saying. Students must have a broad spectrum of choice, a wide range of high-quality courses. To this end, the Bologna Process envisages three priority areas for action: the introduction of the three-cycle system of bachelor’s degrees, master’s degrees and doctorates, quality assurance and recognition of qualifications and periods of study. Student mobility and high-quality education are supposed to be among the top priorities of the Bologna Process, but the process itself, and particularly the rushed introduction of bachelor’s courses, has resulted – as we have learned from our hearings – that fewer students dare to spend any study time abroad during their bachelor’s courses because these courses have been overladen with far too much learning material. Five years of university study cannot suddenly be packed into a three-year bachelor’s degree course. That is what has been done in some cases. Then it emerges that students cannot get away at all, that studying abroad is out of the question. That is a pity. Erasmus is such a great programme, and the opportunities it offers, plus all other opportunities to go abroad, ought to be taken. In fact, a course involving mobility really ought to be made compulsory. In my view, the credit system is not working. It is not right that three credits should be awarded for a particular module in one country while another country awards only one. There must be a European framework within which everyone is treated equally. This is an area where more work is needed. I believe the theory is good, but it is not being applied particularly well. We should also ensure that universities do everything in their power to take advantage of funding opportunities in order to make it easier for students to exercise their mobility if they wish to do so. For many universities, this will mean coming out of their ivory towers and linking up with the business community. How many large companies would consider it an honour to sponsor a doctorate or master’s course? If it meant that a master’s course had to bear the name of Mercedes or Sony or some other corporate brand, so be it! The point is that the sponsorship money would help students. It is not a matter of selling anyone the right to stipulate the content of the curriculum but of locating sources of funding that really do enable anyone who is interested to study abroad. If we make progress towards the achievement of these goals with the aid of the Commission, we shall all be well content.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, The European Union cannot perform its function as a reliable and stable global partner unless it remains able to act and pursues a refined strategy that responds to the specific needs of different countries. We cannot admit all our neighbours as members and are therefore obliged, if only in their own interests, to offer them an appealing and worthwhile alternative. We must devise an efficient neighbourhood policy worthy of the name. The opening of our education, culture and youth programmes and the establishment of a special economic area are examples of such an approach. The options enumerated in Mr Brok’s excellent report must therefore be fully developed and fleshed out as quickly as possible. This is the only way to promote stability, peace, respect for human rights and economic reforms in the countries that are our neighbours. The situation is different, however, in the countries of the Western Balkans, which have had a clear prospect of accession for some time. A glance at the map will suffice to see clearly that they are in the heartland of the European Union, by which I mean that they are surrounded by Member States. Our policy there is based on logical steps. One country is already negotiating its accession to the EU, while others have signed stabilisation and association agreements with the EU – all of them except Kosovo, in fact. Our political action there is the litmus test of our credibility in the field of foreign policy and the guarantor of lasting peace and stability in the EU. I do not like it when Turkey and Croatia are invariably mentioned in the same breath. The conditions and backgrounds are entirely different, and everyone should be aware of that. Croatia is the first of the Western Balkan countries whose accession negotiations could be completed in 2009. The EU should expedite Croatia’s accession, thereby signalling to Macedonia, Albania, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Kosovo that the essential and often painful social, judicial and economic reforms are worth the effort. Responsibility for the future accession of these countries, however, will then lie primarily in the hands of their own politicians, who are accountable to the electorate in their respective countries.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Mavrommatis on his good report and his excellent cooperation with all our fellow Members who were interested in this issue, and there were many of them. Sport plays a more important role than had previously been recognised in the Commission and Council. In my view, this White Paper and the report are a good basis for developing all future activities and policies in the field of sport, especially since the Treaty of Lisbon finally gives sport the legal basis that it deserves. The White Paper and this report endeavour to strike a balance between competing interests, different types of sport, amateur and professional sport, between the specific characteristics of sport and the requirements of EU legislation, between social and cultural, economic and financial interests, and between profit and voluntary participation in these fields. I believe, therefore, that this endeavour deserves our genuine recognition. It opens up the opportunity to promote and cultivate the European model of sport. It thus maintains the specific characteristics of our sports organisations, which, after all, largely work on an autonomous basis and wish to continue doing so, especially as they tend to be highly reliant on volunteers' input. Secondly, we must try to support and promote the implementation of self-regulatory mechanisms at national and European level. May I recall paragraph 16 here, which I believe is extremely important. Thirdly, the report offers greater legal certainty with regard to the application of EU legislation to sport. Fourthly, the role of sport in education is an issue which has been mentioned frequently, and I would remind you of my report on this topic which dates back to 2004. Fifthly, the report discusses economic aspects, including the requisite financial commitment, particularly through lotteries, which has not been ruled out for the various sports here. Ten years ago, in my report on the role of the European Union in the field of sport, we called for a White Paper, and I am pleased that we are able to vote on it today.

Madam President, Mr Swoboda’s report is encouraging, realistic and balanced. I congratulate him on it. It shows the progress Croatia has made, such as its exemplary legislation on minorities, its constructive cooperation with the Hague Tribunal, its increased commitment to fighting corruption, and above all the agreement of Parliament and government regarding the fishing zone, which has been particularly difficult to achieve. Croatia and the European Commission now have to bring all their resources to bear to negotiate the forthcoming chapters quickly and satisfactorily. An international arbitrator should have the opportunity at long last to resolve the border issues between Slovenia and Croatia. Croatia has a key role to play in the region and should be admitted to the European Union soon. Bilateral issues must not be an obstacle. With regard to Macedonia, I can tell you that I was at a conference there at the weekend and the mood is really very agitated following the rejection by NATO. People feel they have been unfairly treated. Mr Meijer’s report shows the stony path the country has already successfully trodden. There is certainly a great deal still to do, but when the naming issue continually hangs over everything like the Sword of Damocles it is difficult to move on in other areas of policy. I have been monitoring the situation there since 1992 and would like Macedonia and Greece to find a solution at long last to the dispute regarding the name, particularly for the young generation. Both sides have made concessions in recent weeks and both must take another step closer to each other. I would find it incompatible with our European values and actually irresponsible if a veto were once again to provide the opportunity to bar the country from joining the European Union. This must not happen!

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, Kosovo’s independence has been declared; Kosovo is a state. Anyone who experienced the situation in Kosovo between 1989 and 1999 must have known that this independence was inevitable. The long-time pacifist president and winner of our Sakharov Prize, the late Ibrahim Rugova, would be very pleased to hear of it. Unfortunately, it was not possible to negotiate a solution. I am sure that every one of us would have dearly loved to be part of one. The current solution brings to mind a modified version of Churchill’s aphorism: this is the worst option, except for all the others. On Sunday I watched – half joyful, half tearful – as events unfolded in Priština. Half joyful because I believe this was the only way out of the stalemate; half tearful because I am certain that we have created problems for ourselves that will not be easy to solve. Nevertheless, the EU has been firm, even though the press has frequently painted a picture of disunity. The EULEX mission was launched unanimously. It is not an attack on Serbia; rather, it is necessary, including for the Serbs in Kosovo, because it will keep a close eye on implementation of the Ahtisaari Plan, which this Parliament passed by a two-thirds majority in spring 2007. This plan guarantees extremely generous minority rights for the Serbs, respect for the borders and the rule of law, and therefore also the protection of other minorities. Politicians in Kosovo must now create their state with sound judgment and determination. The battle against unemployment can be won only by a functioning constitutional state. Radical measures to deal with crime are an equally high priority. The EU mission will support them in this, where possible. Kosovo has a large number of well-educated young people who will be delighted to help establish the new state. Kosovo is not a test case. It is unique. Its development into a state is the final stage in the downfall of Yugoslavia, initiated by Milošević in Kosovo in 1989. I therefore regret the fact that Milošević did not live to see it, but his democratic successors must take on this onerous inheritance. We wish the Serbian politicians composure, and hope that they will now devote all their energy to taking Serbia along the path to EU membership. (Applause from the right)

Mr President, Commissioner, the title of the Commission’s communication and action plan on adult learning, ‘It is never too late to learn’, and its German title, Man lernt nie aus 
(‘You live and learn’), are both universally familiar sayings, but when you read between the lines in the present context, they actually imply an acknowledgement of past omissions in the field of European education policy. None the less, we are pleased that the Commission, with this communication and this action plan, is entering an age marked by growing awareness of the need for lifelong learning, an age in which new demographic challenges must be faced. Economic and social changes in the EU require significant adjustments to vocational skills and qualifications. The challenges of the labour market must be met, by which I mean that the employability of individuals must be one of the foremost aims of adult education. Education, however, and especially adult education, is also a factor in people’s personal development, in their self-esteem, their civic involvement, their social inclusion and their engagement in intercultural dialogue. Several sets of research findings have shown that learning has important non-economic benefits such as promoting good health, fostering participation in the life of society among all age groups and, of course, reducing crime rates. It is therefore my political priority to increase people’s motivation to engage in lifelong learning. Media campaigns, information and advice centres and adapted forms of communication for disadvantaged groups are very important. Special phone numbers and websites have also proved highly successful in some countries. In this context, great importance also attaches to efforts to reconcile work, family life and lifelong learning. Let me list in shorthand just a few means to this end: adaptation of working hours, flexitime, distance-learning programmes and informal learning paths. The use of new technology must be constantly perfected, especially through the creation of wider Internet access to encourage recourse to such new learning methods. There must be continued growth in the number of public and private day nurseries and company crèches. Another important factor, in my view, is solidarity between generations and between cultures. Adults and senior citizens who pass on knowledge and technical know-how to younger people, particularly expertise in a trade or in business practice, can play an effective supporting role. They can provide practical guidance, and there must also be scope to form networks for this purpose. In this way, I believe, each can learn from the other. There is also, however, a family-based approach to learning. Parents are motivated to start learning again in order to help their children at school. In addition, adult education also depends on voluntary helpers, who enrich it by lending their experience and providing skilled instruction. The special needs of migrants must also be taken into account, which brings me to the subject of language courses. We need these language courses to enable migrants to learn the language of their host country, but we also need language courses to enable adults to learn the language of a neighbouring country or another foreign language, which is something we have always advocated. Access to institutions of higher education must also be made easier for adults with practical vocational experience. One very important message is that the quality of existing adult-education centres and the education they offer should be improved. There is a need for well-qualified trainers in adult education as well as specific programmes of courses in adult education. I can only speak for Germany, where there is a university course that leads to a degree in adult education. I believe we must all remind course providers that they can obtain funding for their proposed courses from the European Social Fund, for example, or from any of the structural funds. I naturally expect the Commission to offer the present Lifelong Learning programme in both the Grundvig and Leonardo programmes in order to ensure that we too can do our bit to launch the action plan. I believe there many ways of performing good work in this field, and we should waste no time in doing so. Let me stress one final point: performance in adult education must be made measurable, otherwise no one will know who is doing what. There are very many players in this field, and they must all be taken into account, be they private, university-based or public educational establishments. There is, in short, a great deal to be done, and I suggest we get down to work.

Mr President, first of all may I thank everyone involved for the flowers they have presented to me. I would be happy to give a few blooms from this bouquet to Jan Figeľ. After having campaigned for adult education since 1993 and having seen the first fruits of these efforts, I am gratified that we have now achieved the great breakthrough in that the importance of adult education is recognised in every sphere of political activity. I am particularly keen that every possible incentive be created to motivate adults to re-enter the education process. Many have never had the opportunity, and many need to be motivated. There is also a need to overcome these people’s inhibitions and remove barriers. This is why I also believe that the numerous adult-education centres, foundations and charitable organisations which, as we know, are already doing outstanding work in this field should be supported and that these providers’ high standards – and I see no reason why they cannot become even higher – should be maintained. As I said before, we must ensure that the quality of adult education is further improved. I was delighted to hear that a working group had already been formed in your area of the Commission, Mr Figeľ. I am pleased that it can perhaps be linked with Grundvig too so that we can light the fuse, as it were, for the national governments. Let us therefore make a start. The many fine words really must now give way to deeds, and our task is simply to disprove the venerable saying ‘You can’t teach an old dog new tricks’. In the context of adult education that is as wrong as anything can be, which is why I hope that we can now try, by dint of our own efforts and with your help, to hoist the national governments into the saddle so that they can start trotting, for it will take a while before they are ready to gallop.

Mr President, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I naturally welcome the progress which Montenegro has made since declaring its independence and which has very quickly led to the conclusion of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement. The Montenegrins, of course, should not sit back and relax now but should fully implement the agreement they have signed. They should follow the guidelines they have set themselves and enable their administration to apply enacted legislation. They should ensure that the judicial system is brought up to scratch and that action is taken to combat corruption, especially in the administration and the judiciary. I am well aware that the particular situation which prevailed in the region in the 1990s allowed corruption to take hold and that it is very difficult to eradicate it today, but it does nothing for Montenegro’s reputation among the countries of the European Union when its name keeps cropping up in connection with smuggling, corruption and money laundering. Montenegrin politicians must do everything in their power to alter that image. After all, at some stage the people of the European Union are supposed to welcome Montenegro into the fold. For this reason it is imperative that the development of democracy and a market economy in Montenegro should take place in a truly transparent framework. I do not intend to discuss every point that has been raised today or is still to be raised, nor will I refer to everything that is contained in our resolution. I would like to stress, however, that the Montenegrin landscape is a jewel, and special measures are needed to conserve its unique characteristics. This means, as Marcello Vernola said, that the clause in the new Constitution declaring Montenegro to be an environmental state must not amount to an empty promise. The coastline and hinterland must be protected, and megalithic investment projects must be prevented. Natural features and sites of cultural and historic interest must be conserved in order to ensure that Montenegro does not squander its unique tourist appeal. There are enough cautionary examples of such desecration in western Europe. A sell-out of the coastline and hinterland must be prevented, and judicious development of tourism and cautious land-use are the order of the day. There is an urgent need to prevent overdevelopment of the coastline, and land and property speculation must be curbed. I am pleased to note that there now seems to be a land-use plan for that area. I welcome the cooperation with ICTY, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, and hope that it might result in the arrest of Mr Karadžić at some point. It is also my earnest wish to see Montenegro finally create the national agency that will let the country enable its students and trainees to take part in the Erasmus and Leonardo education programmes. We will be meeting a delegation of our counterparts from the Montenegrin Parliament next week, and we will encourage them to support their government in its efforts to pursue the path of convergence with the European Union and to combat all the abuses to which we have been referring.

 Mr President, the compromise which Ruth Hieronymi – of course with help from her colleagues – has devised here is one which I can wholeheartedly support. I really would like to thank her very warmly; this was a very difficult piece of work and she has done a marvellous job. In my view, the compromise covers most of what we wanted to achieve at first reading. As we know, the rapid pace of technological development had rendered the old Directive obsolete. I myself worked on this first Directive. We now have something new: new transmission opportunities, new services ‘on demand’ alongside traditional TV, so we need this new directive. For me, it was important in this context to uphold the country of origin principle and maintain short-term reporting. More flexible regulations on advertising have been introduced, but I believe that maintaining a maximum of 12 minutes per hour is the right thing to do. As before, cinematographic works and news programmes will not be interrupted. One sticking point, as you know, Commissioner, was product placement. Many of us voted for the present compromise with a heavy heart. What is positive, however, is that the ban comes first, followed by the exemptions which have already been mentioned here. I think that if these are correctly applied, we will not have any American-style conditions. The restriction on advertising in children’s programmes is also something which I welcome. This compromise enables the audiovisual sector to face up to the major changes taking place and adapt to technological and market conditions. The compromise helps the audiovisual sector to become more competitive in future. This compromise is, at the moment, the best balance between media pluralism and cultural diversity, and offers the opportunity to develop a more competitive European audiovisual industry. Once again, may I express my warm thanks to the Commissioner but especially our colleague Ruth Hieronymi.

Mr President, I wanted to say a word on this amendment. We had to make a correction there, and I ask Mr Schöpflin and other Members to vote in favour, because there was a mistake in the original text. 1992 is the wrong year. We would keep that mistake in the recommendation if we did not vote for Mr Kacin’s amendment. Let us please vote for this amendment.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Kacin has presented a report which has attracted very broad support in the House. A number of us contributed to that effort. I therefore do not intend to discuss the finer points of detail, but would simply like to make various comments in a personal capacity. Serbia’s democratic forces were too late in making the radical break with the Milošević era, much too late. As a result, cooperation with the Hague Tribunal was not addressed seriously and credibly, which was why cooperation within the Stabilisation and Association Agreement was also delayed, then suspended, then resumed, and now we are waiting again. In other words, Serbia’s path to the EU is already mapped out and Serbia has the capacity, but it does need to make efforts of its own. The unresolved Kosovo issue hangs like a dark cloud over Serbian politics and is having a paralysing effect. Who is suffering as a result? That is easy to answer: the young generation. After the embargo and the NATO bombing – and the Serbs have Mr Milošević to thank for both of them, not the democratic forces which are in government today – young people now face another intractable problem, namely Kosovo. This is impeding efficient political work as well, which plays straight into the hands of the radicals and their cronies at the top. Thankfully, visa facilitation will finally create some breathing space, and this is something which we in Parliament have long been campaigning for. We want to see young Serbs participating very soon in our education and youth programmes which we opened up with effect from 2007. I would also like to pay tribute to the very positive work being undertaken by the Vojvodina regional parliament in relation to tolerance and youth cooperation, which is having a major impact. A great many young people have come together in the Danube region this year, and this is a marvellous example of a commitment to tolerance and peaceful social relations. There is a great longing for normality in Serbia. Politicians should be doing more for the present and the future and should leave the past behind. They should also be doing much more to improve the daily lives of ordinary people, to ensure that they do not lose popular support.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we had really hoped that by now Kosovo would no longer be an international issue, and that the politicians would have been able to take over responsibility themselves. Unfortunately President Milošević's legacy lives on after his death and is putting a great strain on the democratic government in Serbia. In 1996, I demonstrated against Milošević in Belgrade together with the members of the current government, and I could wish for nothing better than for this government to be the one to bring Serbia into the European Union. I also experienced the apartheid
 imposed in Kosovo by Milošević from 1989 until the NATO intervention. It saddens me that far too much nationalism still creeps into discussions in Serbia. If Belgrade were truly concerned about the quality of life for Serbs living in Kosovo and not about the loss of territory, then Belgrade would approve Mr Ahtisaari's plan. It gives the Serbs in Kosovo a degree of self-determination that other minorities in Serbia and the Balkans can only dream of. If UNMIK leaves now and we cannot fill the vacuum created by the absence of a Security Council resolution, we will be faced with a hopeless situation. Commissioner, you have not provided any answers on this head. As so often in the past, it seems that Europe is not actually willing to take the necessary action in the Balkans. This indecisiveness is a major problem and will create huge difficulties. It is not in our interest to keep on putting off the Kosovo issue to another day. The collateral damage of our failure to act will be immense. Like many other states, Russia was part of the Contact Group. So Russia is fully aware that there have been no talks between Belgrade and Priština. It is unrealistic to call for negotiations now, after rejecting Mr Ahtisaari's proposal and refusing to adopt a Security Council resolution. So I urge this House to follow the Commissioner's lead and do everything possible to accommodate Russia's interests, which have nothing to do with Kosovo or Serbia, so that this issue can be resolved.

 Madam President, Macedonia has already come a long way towards joining the EU It is now an accession candidate. It has signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, but that is the easy part. There is still a lot for the Macedonian politicians to do. Translating the Agreement into practical legislation will be tough, but it has to be tackled with dynamism, in the field of justice, for example, in the administration, the economy, in finance policy and particularly in the area of combating crime and corruption. This is the most pressing task facing the government and the parliament. Macedonia has successfully ended a bloody conflict with the help of the international community, and now urgently needs to implement the Ohrid Agreement. The Badinter Commission is a useful instrument for issues relating to ethnic Albanians. However, it must not be allowed to prevent the necessary legislation being put in place, and should not be seen as a guide to how to form a government. It is a pity that Macedonia's relationship with its neighbour, Greece, which, as we have just heard, invests a great deal in Macedonia, is still clouded by the name dispute. Nationalist talk on both sides is not helpful. This troubled relationship has gone so far as to result in Greece issuing two visas for Macedonians. Of course this unresolved bilateral issue will not prevent Macedonia joining the EU, but an early resolution would benefit all sides and should be possible with the assistance of the UN mediator. The ambiguous status of neighbouring Kosovo has prompted a former Albanian rebel fighter who is currently a Macedonian MP to offer to take 10,000 Albanian fighters from Macedonia to fight for Kosovan independence. I urge the Albanian population to concentrate on their own affairs in Macedonia and to leave the issue of Kosovo to the appropriate elected representatives.

 Mr President, Commissioner, this report from Mrs Gibault sets the same priorities that Parliament set on the basis of my report 15 years ago and of Mrs Vaz da Silva’s report eight years ago. One really has to ask how often Parliament must restate these same demands before anyone actually responds. I was pleased to hear just now that the Commissioner might indeed take a small step in the direction we proposed 15 years ago. Some things do take a long time! This report says that a review of the social status of artists must be undertaken. The difficulties and obstacles in the sphere of visa policy that impair the mobility of artists must be clearly defined. I know that Parliament is currently working on the visa rules, and I hope that artists will also benefit from this new regime. That has long been our cherished wish, and I believe this improvement is now well under way. The social status of artists is about their social security and about unemployment and pensions. Back in the 1992 report we were demanding a status for artists. Just imagine – 1992! Where was Slovakia then, Commissioner? Back then we were already trying to make suggestions regarding the fiscal treatment of works of art and to achieve harmonisation for the works of artists, particularly as regards value-added tax. We tried to create a fund. We tried to create an identity card for artists. All that back in 1992! All of these things are now being called for once again. I learned as a teacher that everything must be repeated so that the lesson sinks in. In the present case, however, everything has sunk in so deep that it no longer resurfaces. Allow us, therefore, to whisper a word in your ear, Commissioner, and not in your ear alone, for this is actually a matter for the Member States. That is why today, just as in the past, we are again calling on the Member States to look for ways in which they can provide special support. My report in those days was much bolder than the one we venture to present today, because we are afraid that some provisions might not be implemented and because we have become far more cautious now. We must measure our democracies by how much we do for the arts, by how much scope we give them. Claire Gibault has identified ways in which the measures we ought to take can be implemented by the Commission and the Member States. I wish her the best of luck in pursuit of that goal.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, congratulations to Mr Lagendijk! There is actually no need for me to speak at all, as I could simply endorse what you said, as Mr Swoboda and Mrs Kallenbach have done. Nevertheless I will make a few comments. I should like to give advance warning that after a debate of this kind we may very quickly be suspected by the outside world, and above all by the region itself, of being anti-Serbian or pro-Albanian. I should like to protest against this. We have been trying really for years to help the people in Serbia and Kosovo to have a peaceful and prosperous future. Creating the prerequisites for this is difficult and the proposed solution put forward by Mr Ahtisaari makes it possible for the people finally to put Milošević’s poisoned past behind them. Whether that can be just, my dear Mr Tabajdi, I do not know. Just solutions are very difficult to achieve. However, I know of no other possibility than the one that has now been proposed. Proper negotiations have of course never been held between Serbs and Albanians. The extreme views were so far apart that they were never brought to the negotiating table. Heaven forbid that we should therefore lengthen the procedure any more. I also understand that no Serbian Government will ever sanction the loss of Kosovo. However, if the Serbian politicians are honest – and of course some of them are when you talk to them – then they also know that with Kosovo in their national territory a peaceful future will not be possible, and it is this peaceful future that the people in Serbia and Kosovo, in particular the young people, deserve. The politicians ought to ask themselves who in Serbia actually wants to bear the consequences of Kosovo’s remaining in Serbia, both the financial and all of the political consequences. The Albanians must enable those Serbs who wish to live in their homeland in Kosovo to do so, and to return if they so wish. The Ahtisaari plan is in my view the only basis for a peaceful coexistence. Unfortunately, discussions often disregard the years of the apartheid regime from 1989 to 1998, as has happened again today. I noticed this in Mr Pflüger’s comments, for example. I do not think that the NATO attack marked the beginning, but that it all started with the revocation of Kosovo’s autonomous status. The Security Council would really be well advised finally to cut the Gordian knot quickly, so that we can continue working and help both Serbia and Albania on their peaceful path into the European Union.

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Rehn, none of us have forgotten the failed constitutional reform last year, the strident and often nationalistic election slogans, the result that emerged from those elections, or the plan to close down the office of the High Representative, all of which prompted us, in December of last year, to put together a report on Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since the beginning of this year, though, a number of things have changed more rapidly than we had dared hope, for there is a functioning government for the whole country, its parliament has got down to work; the EU has decided to reduce the number of EUFOR troops; the issue of what is to become of the High Representative and of the ‘Bonn powers’ is again being discussed; and it is to be hoped that a way will soon be found to implement police reform, to which the Republika Srpska was, until very recently, resistant. We are therefore putting all recriminations to one side and joining with the country’s rational elements in looking forward to improvements and to political breakthroughs. The stridency of the election campaign and the threats of a referendum have faded away, and it is evident that they meant something other than what we thought they did. In our report, we try to be specific about what the problems actually are, and one of them is the fact that constitutional revision – which is indispensable as a means of reinforcing the powers of the State – is long overdue. The prevailing zero-sum mentality according to which ‘what is good for others is bad for me’ is intolerable, and will never make achievement of a common policy possible. That the Dayton constitution is an impracticable monster is not the fault of the politicians, but of those others who, after the war, divided Bosnia-Herzegovina into two entities, seeing that as the only way to find peace. Today, though, that division is justified only if both parts are really able to support the state as a whole and do not hamper its functioning, and so what I want to say is that constitutional reform is indispensable if Bosnia and Herzegovina are to find their way into the EU. It is also clear, though, that this constitutional reform is not a job for us or for some other so-called ‘internationals’, but a responsibility that the elected politicians of all three nationalities must shoulder. While the Venice Commission, or American or Canadian experts, can give help, it is the parliament – and on this the newly elected prime minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina agrees – that must be the platform on which this happens. The agenda of the constitutional reform process must set out definite steps and goals. There is also a blatant discrepancy between the functionality of Republika Srpska, which is one of the entities, and that of the other, the Federation, and this must be remedied in the interests of the State as a whole. This House takes a great deal of interest in the development of Bosnia-Herzegovina; we want it to become a properly functioning integral state, able to look after its own citizens and creating the legal and economic framework conditions on which its young people, in particular, rely as the only foundation on which they – and, I might add, those expellees who are willing to return – can build a future for themselves. I appeal in strong terms to the Republika Srpska to join with the Croatian Government in seeking viable ways of facilitating the return of its former inhabitants to Posavina, in the north of Bosnia, which is still uninhabited and ravaged by war. The report does not address the current tensions in Srebrenica, and I should like to do so now; it is to be hoped, though, that the end result of them will not be efforts at secession, and I appeal to all to seek ways of reconciliation in order to secure coexistence without hatred, not least for the younger generation, for separation and isolation help nobody. Successful reconciliation is also, however, dependent on the extradition of the war criminal Radovan Karadzic to the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague, and this has not yet been done. It is past high time that this chapter was closed, and I have to say that I had hoped that ESFOR, and later EUFOR, would have played a really major part in this – more so, in fact, than they have actually done. I would remind the House that Bosnia-Herzegovina is surrounded by the EU, and that its fate is closely tied up with our own and with that of its neighbours; it is for that reason that our policy in respect of this country and its neighbours must be central to our endeavours. The prospect of EU membership is the incentive for the people there to delay no longer in taking many difficult decisions. I would like to conclude my speech with a few words addressed to all those in positions of responsibility in Bosnia and Herzegovina, reminding them that our educational programmes are now open to young Bosnians, and that their government must now, therefore, do everything possible to get the necessary administration organised, with a national agency to manage the programmes, for the sooner that is set up, the sooner their young people will be able to participate in ERASMUS, LEONARDO and COMENIUS. We are all very keen that Bosnia and Herzegovina should, over the next couple of months, get their hands on the tiller, in other words, should set to work on the reforms that they need. I want to thank my colleagues for their support.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I am actually glad that the debate on information policy follows immediately after that on the European Ombudsman, for the Ombudsman was, this morning, often referred to in terms of his relations with the public. I find it problematic – and we in the Committee have found this too – that the Commission, where its relations with the public are concerned, often lags behind what the Ombudsman actually wants to achieve. The Commission’s responses to the many requests made of it by members of the public or those running projects in the European Union are often unsympathetic or even brash, and that is quite simply not on. It is precisely those interested citizens who are responding to demands for the submission of proposals who are often on the receiving end of such unfriendly treatment that they lose interest in working any more on European projects. What, then, is going to happen in the case of those members of the public who have other interests and are not committed in the first place? That is no way to get our message across to people, and I have to say that, if what we are trying to do is to get people more involved, then the Commission’s new communications strategy is not going to achieve that. We need people where they are, and that is where we have to communicate with them; it cannot be done from Brussels. The Commissioner means well; she really does want to communicate, but the problem is that the public have no desire whatever for what the Commissioner is serving up to them, since they take the line that the Commission is going to be all in favour of it anyway and that they do not have any faith in it. What you need, then, is elected citizens on their home patch; you need the Members of this House, of the German Bundestag
, and of the regional parliaments, with whom you can talk about matters of European interest. We have the great problem, though, that they do see themselves as responsible. We must try to communicate more on the public's own terms, reinforcing the infopoints in cities and establishing more of them, for it is these infopoints in town halls that get the message across to the citizens. We must, of course, make use of the programmes that the European Union already has in the educational field; educational programmes like Comenius, Erasmus, and Leonardo make for the best communications strategy, so let us use them, and then we will find the citizens that we need in order to continue the European project.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the new ‘lifelong learning’ programme was intended to be a sufficient response, within the framework of the Lisbon process, to the challenges of the present day, for education – as we all, together with everyone else, constantly affirm – is the be-all and end-all of our countries' joint efforts at coming out top in globalised competition. The Council’s cuts in the general budget have also had the unfortunate effect of cutting this multi-annual programme back. The Commissioner has had no hand in these cutbacks. He was on our side, fighting for more. It is regrettable that the Member States did not want that. The final figure we arrived at was EUR 14.37 billion over seven years, but, following negotiations, we have been left with no more and no less than EUR 6.97 billion in the Financial Perspective. Even so, I want to thank all those Members who fought successfully and made it possible for us, together, to achieve a EUR 800 million increase in the funds originally allocated to this programme in the Financial Perspective. So much for the lofty goals and the bumpy return to earth. The ‘lifelong learning’ programme is founded on the two programmes ‘Socrates’ and ‘Leonardo’, develops them further and enables working in synergy. We have learned from the latest programmes; our countries’ various national agencies have acquainted us with the problems that they had with the programmes, and their views have all, in fact, been taken into account. The ‘lifelong learning’ programme includes the ‘Comenius’ programme for schools, its university counterpart ‘Erasmus’, the ‘Leonardo’ programme for vocational education and the ‘Grundvigh’ for adults, the ‘Jean Monnet’ schemes for promoting European integration and horizontal measures. I have pushed for more funds than originally planned by the Commission to be allocated to the Comenius programme on the grounds that it is, in my view, the basis for all the other educational programmes, and I have also emphasised the need for more cooperation in the border regions through a new ‘Comenius Regio’. The programme puts new emphasis on student mobility between the ages of 11 and 16, with the invaluable experience of a school year spent at a school elsewhere in the EU. We have also taken account in it of the needs of the children of migratory workers. The Leonardo programme promotes workers’ mobility and partnerships in ways that were formerly possible only through Erasmus. Grants payable under Erasmus to university students are being increased to EUR 200 per month, since the former grant was scarcely enough to live on; we had originally proposed EUR 300, but that could have been sustained only by a drastic reduction in the number of participants, and so we had to abandon the idea. Erasmus also covers preparatory language courses and travel grants. Better financial provision than before has been made for the Grundvigh programme, under which individual exchanges are now available. The programme is conceived as a response to the current state of the labour market and to population trends. Whilst continuing to make grants to the College of Europe in Bruges, the European University Institute in Florence, the European Institute of Public Administration in Maastricht and the European Law Academy in Trier, Parliament has also made provision for special grants to the European Agency for Development in Special Needs Education, Middelfart, and the Centre Internationale de la Formation Européenne
 in Nice. I am absolutely delighted that participation in these programmes is still open to all members of the EEA and to Switzerland and Turkey, and that the countries of the Western Balkans have recently been invited to join in; that leads me to highlight the fact that it is now high time, to say the least, that the easier visa arrangement for South-Eastern Europe took tangible form. I would like to sum up by saying that the ‘lifelong learning’ programme will help improve the EU’s educational and training programmes, make people more mobile, support partnerships and cooperative efforts between regions, structure the sharing of best practice and encourage the learning of foreign languages. This is a programme that will help people gain a better understanding of the European Union, make it easier for them to live together in it and practice intercultural dialogue and tolerance; it is, in fact the best communications strategy in the EU.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I am always glad when we discuss educational policy, for we are then all thinking along the same lines and trying to make progress. We very rarely disagree about culture and education, and that is terrific; the only thing is that we have no money, and that is a problem that we all have to deal with, so I am glad that we have been able to roll out the mobility charter as part of the new lifelong learning programme and are, today, discussing the key competences, which – since this is an area in which we have no power – can be seen only as recommendations. What we can do, though, is make suggestions. A week ago, I was in Sarajevo at a major conference on lifelong learning, at which we discussed key competences – a concept that everyone is taking on board. I think it sends out a wonderful signal when we make such suggestions and countries that are not yet in the European Union act on them. Striking a positive note, I would like to observe that this will provide a frame of reference for key competences, which make it possible for people to adapt themselves to a changing labour market in a knowledge-based society. I would also like to say how glad I am that this proposal advances the development of national strategies for lifelong learning and thus also curriculum reforms, while also, of course, promoting the standardisation of adult and continuing education in the Member States. I also welcome the recommendation relating to the inclusion of people with special needs, about which much has been said, and about how to bring the European dimension into civic competences, which means how to impart knowledge of our European history and foster awareness of our European cultural identity. I would suggest that you buy a copy of the Franco-German history books that have been on the market for the past three months, and which are wonderful in the way they show what European identity means. Finally, I would like to urge that we should not, on the basis of this recommendation, indulge in excessively utopian fantasies of what 2010 is going to be like; superlatives are not, in essence, of any use to us. Let us instead build on it a realistic possibility for all members of the public to acquire basic skills and develop them.

Mr President, Commission President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to underline what my fellow Members, Mr Swoboda and Mr Lagendijk, have said. They have actually covered all the issues already but I would like to go into certain points in further detail. There are four different representations in Kosovo. Firstly, the European Agency for Reconstruction which has done sterling work. We have the so-called fourth pillar within the UN framework where we are essentially responsible for economic matters as well as privatisation. The European Parliament has a delegation there and finally, we also have Council representation. All this in the small region that is Kosovo. The question must already be asked how all this is organised, how all these bodies are able to communicate with one another at all. We now have this EU planning team, something we were able to establish when we were over there, which is responsible for ensuring the rule of law, but I find this all very restrictive. The tasks facing us are much more extensive. It will not do justice to the scale and importance of what we have planned for next year if we approach all of this in such a restricted manner. We must endeavour to create capacities. We must help build up the civil administration. We must ensure that human rights and the rights of minorities are observed. How do we manage this when there are so many players of our calibre, including the OSCE, the European Ombudsman and others? The UN, which is also represented there in all of our names, has certainly done a lot of good through UNMIK over recent years, although it has also made a lot of mistakes. It is probable that no other course of action was possible in rebuilding the civil and local administrations. Would we do any better? Do we have any men and women at all who want, and are able, to commit to working there, who are able to establish trust, who bring with them an adequate level of commitment to actually accomplish what we need on site? To what extent can we, as the European Union, influence the police forces in Kosovo? We know that it is their intention to create a military organisation. To what extent are we maintaining more than just superficial contact with government bodies? What role may European troops soon play in Kosovo? I am aware that these are all questions to which we are awaiting a reply and which you are not yet in a position to answer, but I would like to say to you that I am personally afraid that we are not adequately prepared. When we shift our attention to the neighbouring state of Bosnia Herzegovina, we see the difficulties facing us there and the multitude of problems that we still have to deal with. We have a single representative there who was, and actually still is, all-powerful, and who could do anything which can actually only be achieved in a democracy using democratic legislation as a basis. The problem is that we now have a situation there which is not up to the new challenges because people were not accustomed to taking responsibility themselves. What we need in Kosovo is assistance to allow the Kosovars to help themselves. By ‘Kosovars’, I do not just mean Albanians, but also Serbs who live there and who we should actually expect to engage in the institutions. The only thing lacking as far as I am concerned is pressure on the Serbian Government in Belgrade to allow Serbs in Kosovo to participate. This is the real problem. If we listen to Mr Oliver Ivanovic in Serbia, we know what he would like to do were he allowed to. I believe that all that is lacking is pressure on the Serbian Government to give Serbs there the opportunity to build towards their future. This must certainly happen at some point or other because Serbia is no longer responsible for them. I am underlining what my fellow Member, Mr Swoboda, said. With its neighbours, this region will become part of the European Union. We must therefore see to it that it is in a position to resolve these tasks, that it heeds human rights and the rights of minorities, that, with our help, it develops all the administrative capabilities required to also adopt and transpose our legislation, and to then find a seamless path into the European Union in conjunction with its neighbours, Serbia and Montenegro. I very much hope that we are able to offer this assistance. I venture, however, to express a degree of doubt on this issue.

 Madam President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Ilves, your report, Mr Ilves, shows a very great deal of empathy with, and understanding of, the young democracy of Albania, but also the rigorous approach that is required when considering it; it is a very good report, and I am grateful to you for it. Many of you will be aware that I have, for fourteen years, been observing Albania as it has emerged from a long period of dictatorship and moved closer to the European Community. It is for that reason that I am particularly pleased that we are able, today, to vote to approve this stabilisation and association agreement, something I welcome as an important step towards a relationship of trust between Albania and the EU, which will help Albania and its politicians to give the country the political, economic and institutional stability that it needs. It will be very difficult to make progress down this road; to do so, it will be necessary to achieve the standards required, as laid down in the agreement, and for this Parliament, and our committee on relations with it in particular, to monitor this progress continuously and with the utmost precision. We too, as good friends, will do as we have done for many years and highlight any deficiencies, including those yet to be discovered. Although I think it much to be welcomed that war has been declared on corruption in Albania, I do also think that all the political forces must treat this campaign with the same seriousness, for it will not meet with real and lasting success unless they do. Over recent months, a number of criminal gangs have been unmasked and arrested; this is a very good result and an incentive to further action of the same kind aimed at taking passport-forgers, drug-dealers and the like out of circulation and bringing them to justice. The government is doing a splendid job in the educational field and thereby giving the many young Albanians a bit more of a future; I very much hope that it will do everything necessary to enable them to participate in the European Union’s new educational programmes after 2007. It is also a good thing that the government is making the effort to attract the investment that the country needs, although that will of course be conditional on the reforms in administration and the justice system that are so urgently needed. Our resolution also highlights the need for the practice of the bloodfeud, still prevalent in many parts of Albania, to be stamped out; our call for this is founded on our European values, which, we hope, will soon guide the thoughts and actions of all Albanians. I have no wish to conceal the fact that I found much of what happened over the summer months highly disagreeable, but, without going into unpleasant details, I would like to stress that what is urgently needed is political dialogue, and that political maturity is demonstrated by democratic behaviour and nothing else. The political forces on all sides should also, and once and for all, stop constantly crying out for an international mediator to sort their problems out. Albanian politicians are elected to resolve problems in a democratic manner and to perform in a constructive manner the role allotted to them, whether it involves exercising governmental responsibility or serving in the opposition. Recent years have shown the futility of boycotts, and they would not be worth the effort now either; the Albanian people have had enough of that sort of stunt, and what they want is serious politicians with a serious interest in sorting problems out. It is for this reason that it is so heartening that the political forces have come to an agreement on the tiresome subject of electoral rolls. The European Union has for years been paying a great deal of money to get these lists at last drawn up properly, and it is still proving extremely difficult. Local elections are due to be held shortly, and if the results are to be acceptable, they must be based on largely secure data. The ongoing dispute between the government and a private television station can, I believe, be properly resolved only by full compliance with the law. I would like, by way of conclusion, to remind the House that we have for a long time been arguing the case for easier visa arrangements for Albania and for the other countries of South-Eastern Europe, and so we very much welcome the return agreements reached by Albania and the EU. Albania is among the few countries that have done this, and one of the things we are calling for by means of our resolution is prompt action on the part of European governments to make it easier for students, academics and businessmen to get visas, with, of course, a more relaxed visa regime for all citizens following on as soon as possible. Criminals either acquire visas by dubious means or have no need of them, being, as they are, familiar with other ways of getting across borders, but the success of efforts in Albania to combat crime may perhaps make it possible for European governments to at last work miracles where the allocation of visas is concerned.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the countries of South-Eastern Europe, as they move towards the European Union, must reform themselves; they must adopt standards and work together on a regional basis, which means, in practical terms, that they must be reconciled with one another. They know that, and they are doing it, some of them faster than others, yet, despite all their efforts, they are denied unhindered access to the European Community, something that the Yugoslavs, at any rate, always enjoyed. The ministers of internal affairs, and the national politicians too, ought, for a moment, to visualise themselves or their families having only some EUR 200 to live on and having to fork out practically all of that to get a visa, a Schengen visa, and a transit visa, and, in order to hand over the money, having to queue, sometimes for days or even weeks. Even our counterparts in the national parliaments of South-Eastern Europe have to apply for a visa every time they want to attend meetings of the Council of Europe. Over 70% of the young people in Serbia, Bosnia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Kosovo or Albania have never ventured outside their own region or their own country. We, in the European Union, are currently opening up our educational programmes; how are they supposed to work if the visa rules are so onerous? How are businesses supposed to move in if local workers cannot travel to the company headquarters – in France or England, say – except subject to very difficult conditions? In Bosnia and Herzegovina, for example, the crime rate is less than the average across the European Union, so why, despite that, do we not make it easier for the people who live there to come to us? Where the conditions for the issuing of visas are concerned, Russia gets better treatment than these countries do, and one wonders why. These countries are in the midst of the EU, and we ourselves have a real interest in their well-being and in their growth and development. This is a matter of our own self-interest. It was with the help of our European Union that Bosnia and Herzegovina managed to secure its borders, and the neighbouring countries are doing the same, so let us take off our blinkers and help to do away with these unnecessary and humiliating barriers.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank my honourable colleague, Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges, for her outstanding work. Without wishing to cause offence to the Commissioner, I would like to say that she has very much enlivened what was originally a rather administrative proposal. But the Commission’s proposals always do leave room for improvement. The European Parliament is a democratic forum in which political debate relates to the lives, everyday existence and concerns of the people. The geographical area of the European Union has not only seen the construction of cathedrals but was also the scene of the French Revolution and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen as well as the birthplace of the rule of law and of the welfare state. The EU has a common cultural heritage and respects cultural diversity. That is why I wish to stress most emphatically that interreligious dialogue must be a major part of intercultural dialogue. If we want to promote intercultural dialogue, as we should, but fail to mention interreligious dialogue, then we are betraying it. We should see it not as a hindrance, but as a challenge, or even an opportunity to better our mutual understanding and to live together in harmony. Given the current grappling with Islam, now is not the time for us to be ignorant of our roots, to deny and to disown them. We have our backs to the wall in this respect. We should speak confidently; only then can we enter into dialogue. Education must also play an essential part in the action, on the European level as well as nationally and regionally. Civic education and initiatives designed to promote understanding of others in their diversity are a contribution to constructive and effective dialogue. Educational institutions in particular must play a role in this European Year. The European Year of Intercultural Dialogue also presents the opportunity to distribute teaching and learning materials on the various cultures. Intercultural dialogue is extremely important politically; it is, however, only meaningful once it includes interreligious dialogue and education. Only then can it bear fruit, and only there lies the soul of such dialogue.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am much obliged to Mr Takkula for the work he has done, and I am also pleased that it really had the support of the whole committee. This programme represents the only opportunity for most citizens of participating in the body of European thought, and becoming involved, as active members of our civil society. In effect, the referendums in France and the Netherlands have made it necessary for us to explain things better, to explain enlargement, to explain the Constitutional Treaty, to dispel people’s fears about globalisation. This programme makes all of this possible, with the help of intermediaries, who receive money from this programme. I am pleased that the Commission named some of these, therefore. Indeed, there is no need to reinvent the wheel; there are institutions that have been working on European citizenship for a long time already. To Mr Allister – he is not here any more, unfortunately – who said earlier that he does not want to be a European, I can only say that I am a citizen of Saarland – a small German Land
 – I am a German, and I am a European. It is like a Russian doll; it is possible to be all of these, none of them are ruled out. Collectively, we are all committed to European values, however. I deplore the fact that we have thrown ourselves too much into the issue of Nazi and Stalinist memorial sites. In this connection, I should like to say to Mr Sifunakis – who has also already left, unfortunately – that he actually exceeded his powers. His motion regarding these memorial sites was defeated in committee. The committee decided against it. Mr Sifunakis then proceeded to write to all the members of the committee as its chairman, requesting that they kindly follow him this time. As far as I am aware, that is something that has never happened in this House in my 16 years here. I hope that my fellow Members will not follow him. I should like to make one final point – one already touched upon by Mr Battilocchio: we need town-twinning activities, which do a wonderful job. This is another area in which it is possible to achieve more with a little more money than a great deal of other things that could have been devised. I would ask the Commissioner to include the three additional organisations we want to involve. These have done a wonderful job, and he can rely on them.

 Mr President, even though everything has really been said already, I should like to add something, as it is a matter of great concern to me that the European Capital of Culture really become what we have believed it should be all along, namely an advertising medium for European culture. This cooperation, which was previously intergovernmental – it was actually a government action – has now developed into an interinstitutional matter. This means that we enjoy excellent cooperation, and also, as Mrs Prets has already said, our voice has been heard. For years, we have been appealing for something substantial for the panel to evaluate and select, for the cities to make an effort to reveal European added value and not just what they already have. This action, in particular, makes us aware of the importance of European culture. The cities are the culture bearers and cultural mediators of the EU. This competition gives them the opportunity to bring a very great deal of elements together; there can be cross-border cooperation between regional cultures. I could not agree more about the importance of also holding a competition to this end. Taking Germany as an example, I can say that the competition to find the 2010 European Capital of Culture was a wonderful event, with 10 cities aspiring to be the best. The initiatives they took did not peter out, but are being passed on. They set up a network with the Hungarian cities, and I believe that the Commission should set great store by that. The website is a potential tool for passing on such things, too. I am pleased that the Commission has now overcome its administrative hurdles and a prize has been established – which is not really a prize, of course, but rather the money owing to a city, and means that the city finally has this money at its disposal as it begins its work. All in all, this action is a very good thing, which, in both this context and that of our previous debate on citizenship, helps the public to see Europe’s great cultural diversity.

 Mr President, Commissioner Rehn has described how things stand, so let us now discuss the Brok report, which has to do with enlargement, before we move on to doing everything else when Mrs Plassnik has got here. I urge you to do it this way, or else we will be unfair to the Commissioner and the debate will not be in the proper order.
 Doris Pack (PPE-DE
). 
 – (DE) 
Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, speaking as chairperson of the delegation for South-Eastern Europe, let me say that I wholeheartedly endorse what Mr Brok’s report has to say about each individual country and what it demands of them. Each of them has its own particular problems and needs to be judged on the basis of its own achievements, and so it would be highly desirable for consideration to be given to Croatia’s accession at an early date. To do so would send an important message of stabilisation to the entire region, since Croatia's achievements in both the political and economic spheres are in no respect inferior to those of the next two accession countries. Now, though, that we are coming to the close of the debate, I want to address an idea – one that is concealed in the Brok report, but more prominent in the public media. I refer to the allusions to changes in the enlargement strategy. The question is asked as to where the borders of the EU are, but nobody is answering it. Commissioner Rehn himself said earlier on that this is a question that has to be answered, and it is precisely this that has the public worried. My personal view is that the accessions of Bulgaria, Romania and the countries of the Western Balkans will mean that the EU will have reached its limits. For all the other countries, we have devised the new instrument of the Neighbourhood Policy and must get to grips with it. The rushed negotiations with Turkey have done what remained to be done to make our citizens insecure and disoriented. For ten years we have been saying that there must be no enlargement without institutional reform of the EU, but the Council did not begin to do justice to that until after the last enlargement, and for that we were all punished by the results of the referendums in France and the Netherlands. But it would be fatal if we were, on that basis, to draw the conclusion that no further accessions must be allowed. We must waste no time in laying hold of the necessary instruments, for which, of course, the Constitutional Treaty makes provision, and use them to restore our capacity to welcome new members. If we do not want to jeopardise what has been up to now our great commitment to the Balkans, we must remain consistent and purposeful in continuing to bring these countries closer to the EU. I very much welcome what both Commissioner Rehn and Mrs Plassnik have had to say on this subject. All these states were rightly promised accession to the EU subject to their fulfilling the criteria. That was and remains an important motor for change in the aftermath of the terrible conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and of Ever Hoxha’s dictatorship in Albania. It is apparent to any rational person who even casts a glance at a map that this region is in the middle of the EU. If it enjoys stability, then so do we. The 1990s saw us all experiencing and suffering the opposite of that, but I do fear – and I can tell the President-in-Office of the Council that the vagueness and imprecision of what was said in Salzburg gives me reason to – that certain Europeans are intent on leaving the South-East European states in the lurch a second time, and that is what we cannot allow to happen.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, over ten years on from Dayton, it is in particular the Bosnian politicians who have to ask themselves whether they have done everything they possibly can to ensure a good future for their country’s children, so please exercise your mandate responsibly. That having been said, I would like to follow the President-in-Office in stressing just how considerable their achievement has been. They now have a home affairs minister and a minister of defence; they have a single system for Value Added Tax and have – on paper at any rate – embarked on the reform of the police. Contrary to what is widely believed by our own countrymen, Bosnia-Herzegovina is not a hotbed of criminality. The country’s clear-up rate for crimes is higher than would be expected in the EU, and the incidence of ordinary crime is lower there than it is in our own countries. We have not just cooked that up; it is evident from the statistics, and it is something for which I think Bosnia-Herzegovina deserves all credit. The new High Representative, Mr Schwarz-Schilling, has intimate knowledge of Bosnia-Herzegovina and will, I am sure, be pro-active and very understanding in supporting local politicians, and will not have recourse to coercive methods, in the shape of his ‘Bonn powers’. The President-in-Office spoke of acceptance of responsibility, and that will be increasingly in evidence. I have to say, though – and I am addressing the Commissioner when I say this – that he will need support from the Commission, particularly involving it helping with the creation of jobs, setting in motion the real agriculture policy that the region has long been waiting for, and real attention on its part to the development of rural areas, for a free trade zone is of no use to the country unless it can produce its own food. That will also entail refugees being at last permitted to return to regions such as Posavina in order to repopulate them and make the fertile soil reusable again. The Bosnian politicians, too, must at last get started on the institutional reforms that will make ethnic division a thing of the past and build a functioning state for which accession to the EU will be a real possibility. Their cooperation with the tribunal in The Hague is an indispensable requirement; there has indeed been progress, but I cannot imagine there being real and complete reconciliation unless Karadžić appears before it. Negotiations on the stabilisation and association agreement are progressing well, and in that we rejoice; a delegation from the European Parliament will be travelling to Banja Luka this summer to discuss progress with our opposite numbers there. We wish the Council Presidency and the Commissioner every success in supporting Bosnia and Herzegovina.

 Mr President, Commissioner, in principle the Commission’s proposals are a welcome development, and its enlargement strategy for the Western Balkans is exactly right. The fact that the Commission has now formally confirmed that EU membership is a medium-term prospect for the Western Balkan states is also good news. This is enormously important for the future development of this region, since in the long term it is the only thing that will bring peace to this part of Europe, which has had such a difficult past. At the same time, however, the European People’s Party (European Democrats) would urge the Commission to assess the fitness of each candidate country in the Western Balkans to join the EU on an individual and point-by-point basis before binding dates are set for the opening of accession negotiations, and before timetables are drawn up for accession. The Commission must not make the same mistake with the countries known as the Western Balkan states that it did in the case of Romania and Bulgaria, and particularly in the case of Turkey, when it named a date prematurely, before the criteria had been met in full. The European public’s reaction to such a move would be even greater opposition to other countries joining the EU, while at the same time excessive demands would be made of the Balkan states in terms of their capacity for reform. This is the last thing we can afford in this highly unstable region, parts of which were ravaged by civil war until recently. As the Commissioner himself said, it is apparent that significant progress has been made with reforms. The Commission is right to maintain that Croatia and Macedonia have made the most progress, and have therefore already been recognised as candidate countries, or soon will be, as in the case of Macedonia. This should also act as an incentive for neighbouring countries that are lagging behind on the road towards EU membership for many different reasons. Each of these countries has its own lot with which it must contend. Albania must recover from the decades it spent under the communism of Enver Hoxha, when the country resembled a high-security prison. Bosnia and Herzegovina must come to terms with the nightmare years of displacement, murder and war, and shoulder the burden of the Dayton Agreement, which was a monstrosity that ended the war but failed to establish a platform for good governance and cooperation. Serbia took a long time to free itself of its dictator, and it is currently unclear how long its state union with Montenegro will last. Finally, the status of Kosovo must be determined without delay, by means of an agreement between Belgrade and Pristina mediated by the international community. I was pleased to hear the Commissioner say that the Commission would present an initiative and a strategy on this matter. The Western Balkans and our enlargement strategy for this region are a litmus test for our European policies.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad that the programme exists in its present form, having been influenced by all the experience we have had with the Socrates programme over the past ten years, and with the attempt having been made to avoid the old mistakes and go down new paths. Even so, as there are, proverbially, many roads that lead to Rome, this House has included even more new approaches, and we should try to take a good look at all of them at least once. Let me explain, for the sake of completeness, what sub-programmes we are dealing with here: the programme has to do, overall, with general and vocational education, and it is a good thing that vocational education is now included. The programme enables everyone to take part in educational programmes virtually from the cradle to the grave. The first programme open to all is ‘Comenius’. It is aimed at those who have to attend school in any case; to those for whom school attendance is mandatory, it gives the opportunity to discover at an early age what is meant by cultural differences, or a common approach, to particular issues in different countries. Next comes the Erasmus programme, which gives these pupils the opportunity, once they have become students, to spend part of their course in another European country and to take their achievements there back home with them. Running in parallel to that is the Leonardo programme, which enables apprentices and trainees to complete part of their training in the form of a work placement in another European country. The fourth programme, ‘Grundtvig’, deals with the education of adults, and the fifth, named after Jean Monnet, provides support. This involves the celebrated institutions to which you referred, and to which we want to add two more. I hope that Parliament will agree to this. We do, however, want to continue to support the Jean Monnet chairs and all those things for which your programme already makes provision. There are also the horizontal programmes in support of these activities, which overlap with the sectoral programmes that have already been mentioned, particularly in the development of material for language learning, e-
learning and the dissemination of best practice in general and vocational education at national, regional and local level. We have made further improvements to your proposals and have, in particular, emphasised that the Comenius partnerships should enable one pupil in fifteen, rather than one in twenty, to spend a school year abroad, which would add up to a total of 6 million pupils in junior secondary school having the possibility of spending a year as guest students at a school in another EU country. Together with my fellow-members of the Committee for Culture and Education, I have also ensured that teachers’ European awareness can be enhanced through the new Comenius Regio programme. We have also proposed that the Erasmus programme’s mobility grant, which has remained unchanged since 1993, should be increased, for EUR 150 is an insufficient sum of money with which to go and live and study in another country, and makes support from parents, grandparents and relatives indispensable. We should, however, be enabling all students to take part in an exchange of this kind, and so we suggest that the monthly grant should be increased by rather more than the Commission has suggested. It is of course as important to me as it is to the Commission that there should be a decent reduction in the amount of red tape involved. Administrative and financial constraints on the award and payment of grants must be commensurate with the amount paid out. Let me briefly consider the issue of finance. Only indicative figures have been given for the financial resources we are talking about today. Nobody knows how much we will have at our disposal after 2007; that is why the figures – the Commission’s, the Böge Committee’s and our own Committee’s – are no more than indications. We have to wait and see what we will get from the next Presidency of the Council, and so the Culture Committee has taken the liberty of going beyond the figures proposed by the Commission, and also a bit beyond those agreed by the Böge Committee. We should put down a marker; education and training are a vital part of the Lisbon process. We need them, and in order to have them we need more money than the national governments in the European Union are prepared to make available. Many thanks, Commissioner, for the work your staff have done! (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this programme represents a challenge to what we call European cultural policy, for the absence of a real cultural policy puts at risk the idea that the European Union should unite not merely states but also peoples, particularly at a time when the European Union cannot be other than seriously concerned about its own future. Such a European cultural policy could well help to bring together the needs of the cultural world and those of the public, thereby addressing the soul of Europe as nothing else can, and with it, people’s hearts, for it is with their hearts, more than with their minds, that people will be prepared to vote ‘yes’ in a referendum. We take the view – although I note that the Commission does not – that the cultural actions should be biased towards the starting-up of small and medium-sized projects, for it is these that can help to make visible the cultural riches of the European Union’s individual regions and promote real public awareness of them. I hope that I will, for a change, find more sympathy for this idea from the Council than from the Commission. While ministers of culture, and even the President of the Commission, are wont to make pious utterances stressing the significance of culture, and to sing its praises as an agent of integration, cohesion and citizenship, they should also ensure that sufficient funding is available for it. Even with what we propose to add to it, the programme really is not adequately fitted out. I very much hope that pious sentiments will be backed up by actions!

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Portas deserves a great deal of gratitude for his report, which addresses the vitally important subject of the integration of immigrants, a process accomplished particularly and primarily through language. Schools and language acquisition have an important part to play in successful integration, and it is, in this respect, important to recall the role played by schools and language-learning in the lives of people generally, and in the lives of children in particular. They have a significant effect on a person’s intellectual development, on their development of an understanding of themselves and others, and on their success in becoming members of the community. This applies particularly in the case of people of immigrant background, who have, so to speak, a dual social and cultural identity – that of their country of origin and mother tongue, and the culture and language – or languages, in the case of Belgium – of the new home to which they have come. Mr Portas’s report has struck a happy medium in that, on the one hand, it stresses the right of every person and every child to general education, which of course has to include the learning of the host country’s language. On the other hand, though, it also emphasises these children’s right to learn their own mother tongue, and in doing so it is in line with the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which stipulates both the right to education and training and the right to one’s own cultural, religious and linguistic identity. We must promote the various educational methods that guarantee language acquisition, and the Commissioner did indeed make reference to some of the things that have already, and laudably, been done. The EU can make this possible. It can deploy political and administrative resources and funding to foster such things as the evaluation of experience derived from language teaching, the exchange of experience and the formation of networks for schools in which the use of multilingualism as an aid to integration is a matter of day-to-day practice. With those things in mind and also in my capacity as rapporteur for lifelong learning – to which reference has been made over and over again today – I give the report my backing. I, too, regard school education and language acquisition as my political priorities – and they are, indeed, given priority by the Comenius programme in particular. Our shared objective must be to overcome barriers and to foster the gaining of experience in the learning of languages.

 Mr President, we are about to discuss something wonderful – the circus. I hope we can enjoy it a bit, too; I certainly got a lot of fun out of the time I spent dealing with this issue, gaining many friends in the circus world, and I can only say that grappling with the circus as a subject was worthwhile. I did not, however, do this because I found it enjoyable, but because I was challenged by the problems that circuses face in the European Union and elsewhere. One object of this report is that the circus should be recognised, as a matter of course, as part of European culture. In only very few countries in the European Union is it seen as a cultural asset, and the nation states need to address this problem and recognise it as an important part of culture. This will make it possible to remedy the problems that circuses still face. The second aspect I want to address is that of schooling and vocational training. The Commission should introduce mechanisms for the cooperation of the Member States in order to guarantee and promote an adequate education for the children of travelling communities – and by that I mean not just circus children, but all travelling communities – regardless of the Member State in which they happen to be. It would be very much to be desired that the Council should prepare a new resolution guaranteeing high-quality school education and vocational training for children, young people and adults in travelling communities and recognising and supporting the vocational training offered by circus schools. The third problem has to do with what are termed temporary structures. The Commission could, following consultations with the European circus association, which is based here in Brussels, mandate the European Committee for Standardisation to prepare a comprehensive set of standards relevant to mobile circus facilities. For example, in the various countries of the European Union, different standards apply as regards such things as safety and the materials from which tents are made. That is not a joke; it is an unfortunate fact set in stone, and this is where changes need to be made. Fire safety, the rules on which even differ from one locality to another, is one of those simple things that present every travelling circus with real problems, and we really do need to get a grip on them without putting the safety of the public at risk. We also have to consider circus workers, mobility, and the employment of third country nationals. The Commission needs to carry out an analysis of the current visa and work permit issuing systems, and use that as the basis for drawing up a European regulation in this area, which would take into account the difficulties currently involved in getting visas or work permits issued. The existing requirements for performers with short-term work contracts are difficult to comply with and must also be done away with – I am thinking here of the requirement that there must be evidence of a lack of equally qualified persons within the EU. Can you explain to me how I am meant to demonstrate that when I want to bring in a star performer from Ukraine or China to perform in a circus in Europe? I would have to demonstrate that there are no performers in Europe with equivalent qualifications, but that really is nonsensical. No opera house would put up with that sort of nonsense; La Scala can employ singers from the European Union and from third countries too, but that option is not open to a circus, and that is what makes it important that the circus be recognised as something of cultural value. That will make things easier for the performers. In drafting the report, we compromised and agreed not to say anything about the keeping of animals, because the keeping of animals by circuses is seen by some countries as a really major issue that they are keen to regulate at the national level. Nevertheless, we do take the view that animals are a part of the traditional circus and that it must be possible to adopt directives that enable circuses to keep them. Legislation of this sort exists in Germany and in England, for example; all we have to do is allow ourselves to be guided by it. It follows that what we have set down in this report is perfectly reasonable. We would ask the Commission not only to take note of it, but also to actually do what we have demanded of it, by getting the Committee for Standardisation on the case and making it clear to the members of the national governments that the circus is a vital cultural asset, and one that we are still keen to pass on to our children and grandchildren.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we are talking about the situation of national minorities in Vojvodina here today, it is because we are concerned that the exemplary multi-ethnic coexistence in this part of Serbia could be lost. When we were in Vojvodina at the start of this year we spoke with politicians and other people affected and also put forward proposals for how such regrettable events might be prevented and healed. My written enquiries to government offices in Belgrade six months after our visit produced only evasive answers. Something needs to be done both in the educational system and about the composition of the police and judiciary, however, if the situation is to improve. One factor in the increasing incidence of atrocities may be large-scale immigration of Serbs from Kosovo and Croatian Krajina into parts of Vojvodina formerly dominated by national minorities. All politicians in Vojvodina and Belgrade should therefore be anxious to condemn this, to urge their offices to show the utmost vigilance and to use the forthcoming talks with Serbia and Montenegro to ensure European funding is used to help the national minorities in particular to get their rights. To this end, the European Parliament has increased resources for Serbia and Montenegro by EUR 8 million. I would like to point out, however, Mr President, Commissioner, that the Hungarian Government also has a definite obligation to join with its neighbours, Serbia and Montenegro, in addressing these problems. Let me say once again that I want to revive this Vojvodina, which is a model for the coexistence of national minorities; that is in Serbia’s interests and it is in the interests of the European Union.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after 1945, the promise was made that there would be no more mass murder, Srebrenica is a byword for its having been broken. Ten years on from Srebrenica, the Western governments have to ask themselves why they did not intervene in good time to prevent expulsions, murder and war. At the beginning of the 1990s, they looked the other way and let Milošević, Karadžić and Mladić have a free hand to expel people from their homes, to rape them and, eventually to put them to a gruesome death, which is what happened at Srebrenica, where, in a cowardly manner, Serbian criminals slaughtered thousands of Muslims before the eyes of UN troops acting under an inadequate mandate. As we commemorate this massacre today, we call on everyone to endeavour to get Karadžić and Mladić, who bear responsibility for it and are now on the run like the cowards they are, handed over to the Tribunal. There is no hope of reconciliation in Bosnia and Herzegovina if they are not. Good though it is that high-ranking Serb politicians will be attending the commemorations at Srebrenica, they should also prevent certain Serbian politicians from naming in the same breath the Serb victims of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the victims of Srebrenica, as if they were talking about one and the same thing. The failure of the Serbian parliament and of the parliament of Republika Srpska to condemn these massacres testifies to their lack of either maturity or penitence. How are the Serbs to show either if those who represent them do not first give a good example? Today is an opportunity to remind the Serbs in particular that reconciliation is possible only when one acknowledges one’s own guilt, and, as a German, I know what I am talking about. It took a relatively short time after the war for our relations with the rest of the world to be restored, and that was because we admitted our responsibility for the heinous crimes committed in Germany’s name. By no means are all Serbs guilty today, any more than all Germans were guilty then, and so those holding political power or religious authority, and the media, should do everything in their power to make reconciliation possible. At the same time, though, the EU must neither stint in its efforts nor shirk its responsibility in helping the countries in the region to put their tragic past behind them and set their sights on a better future. The young people in the region have gained the right not to be left high and dry by us, but it is their politicians, their parents and grandparents upon whom the obligation rests of preparing for the day when they will be able to name the events at Srebrenica as the crimes they were and to reach out the hand of reconciliation.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last week I read in a major German monthly magazine a marvellous report on three Turkish businesswomen. Reading the report we are considering today, one can appreciate how great the gender gap in Turkey is. Our main concern is to help human rights, specifically, in this instance, the rights of women, to gain acceptance. Violence against women, including domestic violence, the so-called honour killings, forced marriage, the high incidence of illiteracy among women – all these things are alarming. Many hundreds of thousands of girls are not allowed to go to school, either because their parents are backward or because the facilities are absent. Kurdish women are particularly affected by these things. As the Commissioner said, laws get passed, but we have yet to see them put into effect. I very much hope that the Commission will insist on that being done. Honour killings and forced marriages, though, are problems that particularly affect Turkish women who have come to live among us, and, hence affect our society too. The political parties should also take appropriate action to address the under-representation of Turkish women in legislatures, but forcing Turkey to adopt quotas and a ‘zipper’ system of placement on the election lists is, to put it mildly, humbug if we do not first try to do that sort of thing in our own countries. I hope that the resolution that will be adopted with support from all of us will help women’s associations in Turkey to tell it like it is to their political representatives in that country. The changes are needed, for these breaches of the law are infringements of human rights, and – quite apart from any desire for membership of the European Union – the need for them to be outlawed ought to be self-evident. I hope that this will also, slowly but surely, dawn on politicians in Turkey.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the maintenance and promotion of cultural diversity is an important task both within and outside the European Union, one to which this House has always given political priority. This issue touches upon the most important democratic values – freedom of opinion, tolerance and dialogue between cultures among others – values deserving of protection. The convention under discussion is an important instrument of international cooperation in safeguarding these cultural values. In order to hold our own on the international stage, we need a mandate, and we need our position to be beyond any doubt. Globalisation is a threat to cultural diversity and media pluralism. To the national governments, too, this convention gives a legal framework for taking measures necessary to the protection – and, where necessary, also the promotion – of cultural diversity. Contrary to what we are often told, it is not a protectionist instrument; nor is it a blank cheque. It does, however, improve the international exchange of cultural goods, and fosters diversity. This is not about us going on a crusade against the WTO or – to put it bluntly – against America. We simply want the convention and the WTO and GATS negotiations to complement each other. What we have at the moment is something like the battle between David and Goliath. This is about strengthening David so that he may prevail in this battle, which is being fought in the interests of the cultural diversity that we have to protect, and it is for that reason that we need to agree on a common approach within UNESCO, so that we may prevail in the GATS and WTO negotiations. I want to underline what Mrs Hieronymi and Mrs Trüpel said: within the European Union, too, we have to ensure that the services directive does not apply to audiovisual materials.

 I believe that Bulgaria and Romania should become members of the EU. Before this takes place, though, they must meet certain criteria. As MEPs, we must ensure that the two countries comply with these criteria. Our constituents expect nothing less. The Commission’s latest progress reports confirm that both countries have a great deal of ground to cover before they meet the accession criteria, in particular with regard to the fight against corruption and the establishment of a judiciary operating under the rule of law. It is for this reason that we particularly welcome the efforts undertaken by the new Romanian Government, which is resolutely pushing ahead with reforms in order to overcome the delays caused by its predecessor. It would be premature to take a decision on the matter at this time, given that both countries are still a remarkably long way from meeting the accession criteria. In my opinion, it would have been more appropriate to delay the decision on accession until the Commission has presented its next progress report. The fact that we are still 20 months away from the envisaged date of accession would have been further justification for such a delay. Much to my regret, I therefore feel obliged to vote against accession. This is not due to any failings on the part of this House.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, EU foreign policy ought to focus on South East Europe, and the EU ought to take consistent measures to finish what it started in the mid-1990s. To date, however, such measures have been thin on the ground. The aim behind this report was to allow us to exert a certain amount of pressure on the Council and the Commission, and today we have learnt that this course of action has proved successful, at least at this stage of the game. I was glad to hear the Commissioner say a few moments ago that the Commission now, at long last, plans to present a communication on Kosovo, and Mr Schmit also said that the Council would try to ensure that the increased interest in this region would be backed up by action. At the same time, however, we must ask ourselves what action the countries themselves are taking. The two previous speakers have already referred to the need for Albania to ensure at long last that the forthcoming elections are conducted properly and that the results are not manipulated in any way. The Albanian Government must also take the business of governance seriously once and for all, by combating corruption and implementing legislation. We are all aware that Macedonia must press on with the Aarhus process in order to enable its Albanians, who make up 25% of the population as a whole, to feel as though they are on an equal footing with other citizens. Until this happens, it will be impossible for Macedonia to act as a stabilising force in the region. The Commission and the Council have for some considerable time needed to bring pressure to bear on local politicians in Bosnia and Herzegovina to amend the Dayton Agreement in such a way that a functioning community can be established. The country will never be able to join the European Union in its current state. There is still too little cooperation with the Hague Tribunal, and not enough refugees have yet returned to Republika Srpska
. Turning to Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo, the confederation between Serbia and Montenegro is still far from robust, and a decision should be taken in the near future as to whether it should remain in existence or be dissolved. Belgrade and Pristina must work together under the auspices of the UN and the EU to find a solution to the Kosovo issue as quickly as possible, and there is no reason why such a solution should not be found, given that all the countries concerned wish to join the European Union. I hope that Croatia will be able to persuade the monitoring mission that it is cooperating fully. All the above-mentioned countries are facing enormous problems with regard to their judicial systems and the fight against corruption, and they also lack administrative capacity. We must take steps to help them in this respect, and indeed we should help all these countries in a more committed and coherent fashion. We should provide them with access to pre-accession instruments so that they develop functioning national economies and functioning democracies. If this happens, everyone will benefit, especially the young people in the countries in question.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we would not be having to discuss the European Capital of Culture at all today if back in 1999 the Council of Ministers had not totally – and quite outrageously – ignored the expected new Member States right up to 2019. Only ministers can come up with such ideas: the Members of this House were already wiser back then. We therefore have to put matters right today, and we are ready to support that. In future we will have two cities, one from the 15 old Member States and one from the new Member States. I totally support that, as it will also mean cooperation between two cultural capitals. In 2010, for example, that will involve a German city and a Hungarian one. Mrs Prets is of course quite right in saying that the financial resources will not be adequate for this. Once you have made a mistake, the punishment is that much more severe. In short, we will need more money for the cultural capitals in future, and that should also be provided under the financial framework. I believe, unlike Mrs Prets, that each country should submit at least two cities to the European jury for selection. Taking Germany as an example, I would like to remind you just how much excitement and creativity has been generated in the German cultural world over the last few years because ten cities have been competing to become the European Capital of Culture. We have witnessed enormous inventiveness, with the full range of cultural and economic players taking part in seminars and symposia. I simply believe that this amazing level of activity will only come about if there is competition between cities. Germany will now be presenting two or more cities to the jury, of which only one can be selected. But all the others that applied have stirred up an incredible amount of excitement in their city, in their Land
 and in the surrounding area. That is why I believe this is the right way to go. I would simply ask that in future the jury should pay more attention to what might be called the beacon effect of these cities. Europe’s cities are the beacons of our history and of our cultural diversity. Each cultural capital should particularly highlight this by arranging many and diverse events, not only to support national traditions and tourism, but also to truly highlight cultural diversity. I hope that the Commissioner will take account of these points in his new proposals, including those on the selection procedure.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am actually very glad to have been able to hear Mr Barroso speak today, but I did not, unfortunately, get the same feeling of euphoria that I did from his speech in Berlin. There was not much evidence today of the desire to ‘give Europe a soul’. When you reported on your work programme, words like ‘culture’, ‘education’ and ‘schooling’ occurred less frequently than any of us in the Committee on Culture and Education would have wished, particularly as we are all well aware that these areas have a very great part to play in the process of integration and in the Lisbon process. I think it really is time for all these speeches and symposia to be backed up by actions that the public will sit up and notice, actions that they will welcome as adding value to Europe. You did admittedly say earlier that investment in education is important, in that it promotes growth and employment, but what you say must, of course, be reflected in what you do. I would add to that the need for the Commission to create more incentives to learn languages, for learning languages is important. Learning your neighbour’s language matters, because it builds another bridge between you and them, and our young people’s mobility in the internal market depends on it. It truly would be great if you, Mr President of the Commission, were really to take up the cause of the new ‘Lifelong Learning’ programme, and if the money that I, on behalf of my fellow Members, have been demanding for it, were actually to be forthcoming. That would be in line with what you are seeking through the Lisbon strategy. The preamble to the new Constitution speaks of the need to strengthen Europe’s ‘unity in diversity’, but if that is to happen, the Member States have to come round to accepting that there is such a thing as a European cultural area and have to enjoy its advantages. The culture industry creates an enormous number of jobs. Like education and schooling, it is compatible with the Lisbon strategy. It is quite simply ridiculous, and shameful, that only 0.03% of the total budget is allocated to culture. I therefore ask you, Mr President, and all your fellow Commissioners, to invest in education and culture; by so doing, you will really help Europe to gain a soul. (Applause)

Mr President, Commissioner, may I express my thanks to Mrs Novak and her predecessor, Mrs Zissener. The Europass is a European record of achievement with which, I am glad to say, we have been able to take a small but important step forward after all the fine words about taking government to the people. First of all, it creates transparency throughout Europe for all periods of education and training, for skills acquired in all walks of life. Secondly, it creates credibility through the certification and recognition of occupational and extra-vocational experience, including voluntary work in the realms of social welfare, culture and sport as well as the acquisition of various linguistic skills. Thirdly, it creates efficiency, because it fosters understanding and recognition of qualifications and skills for an ever-increasing number of young and not-so-young people. More than ever before, we need to take government closer to the people, and we need fewer eulogies to a technocratic and bureaucratic virtual Europe. We need tangible instruments, of which the Europass is a prime example. It is a resource for people’s everyday lives. It lets people experience Europe at first hand on a daily basis, wherever they are. All measures in the field of education policy, such as Comenius, Erasmus, Grundtvig, e-learning, the mutual recognition of diplomas and now the Europass, add value to Europe by lending it a human dimension. This injection of soul into Europe, which puts individuals at the heart of the debate and makes them the focus of decisions affecting their everyday lives, is important. The Europass is a key element, not only in terms of the comparability and recognition of professional achievements but more especially because it includes voluntary social and civic involvement in the catalogue of acquired skills. I should like to congratulate the Commission and all of us here for having created this really good mechanism in such a short time – less than a year – and I very much hope that, along with the other improvements envisaged by Commissioner Figeľ, we shall have a good platform from which to launch the Europass next year. I wish him, and hence our young people too, every success.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have just a few comments to make on the central issue. The first is that, as Chairman of the Delegation for relations with Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Serbia and Montenegro (including Kosovo), I am delighted that the military mission – which is still necessary – is now in European hands and backing up the EU’s great financial and civilian commitment under the leadership of Commissioner Patten. The second is that this changeover from SFOR to EUFOR is being welcomed in Bosnia and Herzegovina too. It does indeed highlight how closely intertwined are Bosnia and Herzegovina’s destiny and our own. The success of our mission – political, economic and military – is the litmus test for our foreign and security policy. Thirdly, EUFOR’s tasks should be clearly set out. It should not involve itself unnecessarily in states’ prosecution of their own criminals. In these countries, the police and the justice systems have now become capable of pursuing ordinary criminals and imprisoning them. Apprehending war criminals such as Mladic and Karadzic should also still be a matter for the remaining NATO contingent, and, in particular, for the Serbs of Republika Srpska. Even though neither has so far demonstrated any enthusiasm for doing this, and Republika Srpska has even obstructed it, EUFOR should have other tasks to perform. Fourthly, how will cooperation between the police mission and EUFOR be organised? My fifth point has to do with an issue that has started to worry me in recent years, and that is whether the EUFOR troops have been advised about the problems with trafficking in women and forced prostitution. Is there an ethical context, and where, when and by whom are offences to be punished? Bosnia-Herzegovina is not just a transit country, but also – not least because of the international presence – a destination. The sixth thing I want to say is that EUFOR is the right name. Why, then, call it ALTHEA, after a mythological woman associated with blood, retaliation and vengeance, and who ends up taking her own life? What did the person who thought up this name have in mind? They could have done with a bit of sensitivity. One might have expected something else in an area where we are working to counteract revenge and the settling of scores. Moreover, EUFOR is the name by which the mission is already being welcomed on great big posters in Sarajevo, so let us leave it at that and chuck ALTHEA out with the junk where it belongs!

 Mr President-in-Office of the Council, not only did I make a speech, I also asked two questions. I asked you in what way soldiers have been prepared for this difficult task, particularly with regard to trafficking in women and forced prostitution, and I asked you how and where soldiers are sentenced or called to account, should the need arise. Secondly, I asked you whether you are considering phasing out the name ALTHEA, which is a terrible word and has caused problems in the region. These were two important questions, and I should like to receive an answer.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Animal Testing Directive is based on the 3Rs principle. Our objective is the replacement, reduction and refinement of animal testing. In order to achieve this, we need to develop and promote alternative methods. Thirdly, we must find a compromise between animal welfare and research, while placing the emphasis on human health. Commissioner, you have also emphasised that we need to have the same standards in all Member States. The current legislative proposal is based on the Community Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals and on the animal health strategy. We want to ensure a high level of protection and high standards in the European Union and throughout the world. However, the complete abolition of animal testing without other methods being available as an adequate replacement would make the majority of the research based on animal experimentation in the European Union almost impossible. Research projects would move abroad, we would lose the huge amount of knowledge that we currently have and we would make ourselves completely dependent on other countries. Therefore, it is important to find a compromise and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has presented a good compromise. Admittedly it is not an easy balancing act, but for people who are ill it may be a matter of survival. The result of the vote in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on 31 March meets these requirements. We must support this compromise which was accepted by 72% of the committee. Therefore, I call on all Members of this House to reject all the more far-reaching amendments that have been submitted and to vote in favour of the amendments from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament. My warm thanks go not only to the rapporteur, but also to many of my fellow Members throughout Parliament.

The report by the Committee on Transport and Tourism does not take sufficient account of the real interest of rail transport as a whole in better use being made of the capacity available. Infrastructure operators are to be obliged to retain capacity reserves for occasional traffic in their annual network timetable. This preliminary requirement leaves infrastructure operators no flexibility to take decisions on such measures in real time. The Commission’s original proposal has even been tightened up, as capacity reserves must guarantee adequate quality for international facilitated freight traffic paths. The extent to which requests for paths by railway companies are actually used cannot be approximately estimated for planning purposes. These capacities are removed in advance from the timetabling process, with the result that other, later path requests cannot be satisfied. If the already marginal network capacities are not used by freight companies, they will ultimately be eradicated to the disadvantage of all users. This regulation would achieve precisely the opposite of the actual objective, which is better use of available capacities. In order to limit the negative impact on passenger traffic and freight traffic requested in the short term, a regulation is needed which allows the infrastructure operators to decide if such a measure is suitable, taking account of the demands of passenger rail traffic or how better account can be taken of the needs of freight rail traffic.

The explicit call in Amendment 15 for rare diseases to be eliminated through genetic counselling of carrier parents and for healthy embryos to be selected through pre-implantation diagnostics (PID) is not merely contrary to current laws in Germany. In light in particular of German history, it would appear to be unacceptable and intolerable as a matter of principle to demand or recommend the eradication and selection of disabled persons, even if they have not yet been born. Alarmingly, these proposals and wordings reveal a total lack of respect for the value of every human life, regardless of whether we are talking about sick or healthy people. The addendum tabled replaces the call for therapeutic treatment of rare diseases with the objective of preventing the birth of sick people. This is not compatible with the spirit and letter of European and international declarations of human rights. The actual objective of convincing European policy should be to help people affected or at risk of disease, not their early selection on the basis of quality criteria. The report and individual amendments, especially Amendment 15, are not in keeping with my Christian values. That is why I voted against the report.

 Mr President, Commissioner, let me start by giving my very sincere thanks to our rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf. Not only in this report but also over many years in the past, he has always followed a clear line, which aims to achieve what we have achieved today: creating clarity for farmers and setting out clear requirements in the field of placing feed on the market and the use thereof. Today, we are discussing the second step, and this, in particular, has become clear time and again. Commissioner, yesterday evening, last night, we discussed the first step: production. I should like to return to this. The type of production and the type of controls on production are the most important prerequisites for this report, to ensure that ultimately, we have healthy, safe feed from which to produce healthy, safe food. I should like to reiterate my conviction that businesses that also process food to make feed should be subject to better scrutiny, that the HACCP concept should be required as a basis for authorisation – possibly for authorisation throughout Europe – as that has also been a problem in both yesterday’s and today’s debates. We need the same controls for the same risks throughout the European Union. Although we can never rule out abuses, this report and also yesterday’s debate have laid good foundations for safety without going over the top. This is another point made in today’s report, of course: that we have learned from developments following the BSE crisis, and that we now know that quite a few things can – and must – be done differently. I wish to reiterate my thanks to our rapporteur, who has produced a good report today out of all the negotiations here. I hope that he receives one hundred per cent support from this House.

 Madam President, Commissioner, we are, tonight, discussing the use of PCB waste oils in an Irish food recycling plant. Tomorrow, we will be debating the placing on the market and use of feed for animals. Tomorrow, we will observe that we have, together, already achieved a series of important and expedient measures in this sector. Yet there are still problems in this area. That is why the five questions posed by Mrs McGuinness in her oral question must be taken seriously and must be given a serious answer. Commissioner, you, yourself, talked of gaps that are still to be closed in the implementation of our legislation in a number of Member States. It is true that the feed sector overall has thoroughly proven its reliability in recent years, but certain businesses are either unaware of the risks or do not wish to see them. It would seem, furthermore, that there is still much room for improvement in many Member States in terms of inspection on the appropriate risk basis. All of us – Parliament, the decreasing number of farmers and also consumers – expect the proper application of EU legislation with inspections to that effect. For that reason, I believe that general food law, food and feed hygiene and the licensing conditions for food recycling plants needs to be looked into. Yes, we do want to make use of surplus foodstuffs. I, personally, at least, would like this to happen and for the surplus foodstuffs in question not to be destroyed. Traceability, however, must be ensured. Unwanted substances and products must be excluded in a secure and controlled manner. When feed companies are licensed, the professional competence of their staff in the area of food and feed safety must be ensured. Feedingstuffs are the basis of food safety and there must be certainty on the part of farmers so that consumers can be ensured of safe and sound food.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is another subject on which the discussion very quickly reveals that strong emotions are involved, on the one hand, but also stark realities on the other. I should like to express my particular thanks to the Chairman of our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr Parish, for this question. It is an important one – not in order to convey emotions, but to ask the Commission the following quite specific questions. What has happened? How can these developments be verified? Do you have any proof, and if so, what? What figures do you have? You mentioned a couple of figures, Commissioner, but I firmly believe that discrepancies exist between Member States that go way beyond the fact that some Member States have submitted reports and others have not. What is the situation with regard to implementation? How are the long journeys monitored? How are they monitored in the individual Member States? Another major problem area requiring urgent discussion is the problems that have arisen as a result of our defining agriculture as merely an economic field and equating things we should possibly be regarding as different. For example, what additional professional training in transport matters should trained farmers be undergoing? How should this be organised, and who would provide such training? Where must farmers show this in order to obtain their qualifications? To reiterate: farmers are trained to deal with animals, whereas hauliers employ drivers who have possibly never dealt with animals in their whole lives. These are two things that cannot be equated, but to an extent we have been doing so. The second circumstance that causes major problems is the following. When farmers transport their own calves, they can do so for up to 50 km. Permit me to say at this point that we must indeed give further consideration, as a matter of urgency, to how we can help smaller abattoirs operate economically and thus reduce the need for further journeys. So, then, farmers are permitted to transport their own animals for 50 km but face problems if they take a neighbour’s animal along. That, too, requires some thought. Is the limit set correctly at 50 km, or should we perhaps be seeking the cause of these developments in the abattoirs, too? If farmers transport a horse for leisure purposes, there is no problem, and this Regulation does not apply, but if they transport it to market, the Regulation does apply, and they must meet the requirements. These questions should be discussed and answered in further debates.

 In today’s vote on the health check for the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), I voted against the report on the milk sector. I am of the opinion that there should be no further increases in the quota without a market analysis. I believe that Parliament’s demand to raise the quota by 1% in five stages, as proposed by the Commission, will send out completely the wrong signal. However, I very much welcome the fact that Parliament has spoken out once again in favour of the milk fund. The funds which will be saved from the agricultural budget and, in particular, in the milk sector, will be an efficient way of relieving the burden on this sector and of restructuring it. In addition, I support the call to the Commission, Parliament and the Council to produce a report on the milk market by 31 December 2010 which will form the basis for the discussion on further measures for controlling milk quotas. I also welcome the fact that the franchise for the modulation has been raised from EUR 5 000 to EUR 10 000 per year. This means that Parliament is in favour of giving further support to small farms, the majority of which can be found in our areas of Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, I want to keep my contribution brief and would like to focus on the fact that we are responsible first and foremost for 500 million consumers in the European Union and then for the farmers in the European Union, who produce food for these consumers. We are equally responsible for both large and small farms. We are responsible for farms in disadvantaged areas, in grassland regions, and particularly in all areas relating to dairy and meat production. Commissioner, I wish to thank you for your positive consideration of the milk fund, something I have been demanding for two years, namely since the debate on the mini milk package and the abolition of support measures in this area. I am convinced that this mechanism will enable us to provide help if we do not first withdraw the money from other farmers, but rather use the resources that have been freed up by the abolition of the market support measures.

As he said, that regulation takes us a big step forward towards reducing red tape. Three existing Regulations have been put together into a legislative text that is easy to understand. Thanks to this common position, existing EU legislation on air services has been brought in line with current practice. In addition to the licensing of airlines, the regulation covers technical questions and price transparency, which is the subject I want to address in particular on behalf of my group. From the outset we urged putting an end at last to the misleading adverts offering absurdly low air fares. We want to introduce substantial simplifications for the consumer, which are long overdue. This EU regulation will bring an end to the advertising tricks and inducements that often confuse the consumer. Airlines may no longer con consumers by advertising flights – especially on the Internet – at ridiculous fares of, for instance, EUR 9.99, and then face them with large extras in the form of taxes and charges. In future air fares are to be set out in a comprehensible and transparent way. The consumer must be able to identify what proportion of the price goes to the state and how much goes into the pockets of the airline and airport. That applies above all to Internet offers. That is why we have also called for price transparency. We will be happy to vote for the report tomorrow.

I very warmly welcome the initiative of the European Parliament to deliver a detailed opinion on the Commission’s Animal Health Strategy for the period from 2007 to 2013. Clear expectations are important in the context of both human and animal health. The motto of the Animal Health Strategy is ‘Prevention is better than cure’, and preventive inoculation is the best contribution to animal welfare. For this reason we strongly urge that sufficient provision be made in future for protective vaccination and for adequate inspections when outbreaks of disease occur. In order to guarantee the prevention of animal diseases, care must be taken to ensure that research, science and innovation receive support and that new findings are disseminated. The Animal Health Strategy must extend to all animals in the EU. For this reason, we need a common legal framework that is less complex, clearer and more transparent than the existing legislation. Lastly, biosecurity is an important subject in the context of the Animal Health Strategy; the need for biosecurity begins at the external borders of the EU and concerns all stakeholders. The risk of spreading pathogens by importing or bringing animals from other countries into the European Union must be minimised. Importers, holidaymakers and consumers must all be aware of their responsibility in this respect. The EU has the important task of conducting the requisite inspections so as to ensure that the risk to animal health, and hence to human health as well, is kept as low as possible.

Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, as already stated, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has unanimously rejected the Commission’s proposal to increase the quotas for the coming milk year by 2%. This would amount to 2.8 million tonnes. We consider this proposal to be too rigid, too inflexible, and it is the wrong signal in the current situation, particularly for the markets. Based on the rulings of 2003, there will be a 0.5% increase in quotas for 11 Member States anyway on 1 April this year – the equivalent of 700 000 tonnes more milk in the European Union. The intensive debates with my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture have shown that there will be no panacea, nor any comfortable way to conduct further debates. There are widely differing opinions and all positions, from the general and fundamental rejection of any increase in quotas up to and including a 5% increase, were represented. We nevertheless managed to find a compromise that took account of the positions of all the groups, and this was unanimously accepted with no dissenting votes or abstentions. My heartfelt thanks go to all my fellow Members for their constructive cooperation. The agreed compromise has two focal points. Commissioner, you have said as much. I have a different opinion on this. Firstly, the establishment of a European balancing mechanism, by which under- or over-shooting of the existing national quotas can be compensated at EU level. This would not be very bureaucratic and would result in producers who exceed their quotas being penalised only after balancing. Secondly, as from 1 April, the Member States can decide to raise national quotas voluntarily for the 2008/2009 quota year. We want flexibility, not rigidity! This compromise means that the quotas that already exist will be used more efficiently. For Member States with greater potential, there is also the opportunity to use this European quota framework along the lines of a common European internal market system. Commissioner, you always stress that the existing milk quota will expire in this system in 2015. A linear increase in quotas alone will not, however, create the soft landing you promise. Just think back, if you will, to the old milk lakes! The Committee on Agriculture has therefore unequivocally been arguing, as it has done already in the mini milk package, in favour of setting up a milk fund in order to achieve savings in costs resulting from the reforms explicitly for the milk sector. In our view such forward-looking promotion and preservation of the entire sector can be made possible only in this way. In particular this instrument should be used for dairy farmers in disadvantaged areas and in areas completely given over to grazing land and pasture. I would therefore ask you, Commissioner, to include this request by the European Parliament in tangible terms in your legislative health check proposal. In our view the application of Article 69 is insufficient because it is not clearly defined in terms of practical measures, particularly for the sector already mentioned. It is also pure cynicism when a high-ranking Commission official announces to a gathering of farmers that they should not be complaining about producer prices already effectively falling again, since they had already been making do with 27 cents per litre of milk. This is contempt for the legitimate interests of an entire profession, which I, as a Member of a Parliament, having taken up the cause of democracy at the highest level, do not accept!

Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, we have heard a wide range of opinions. We were also able to detect that, for everyone here today, this is a serious issue not to be trifled with, that everyone has many concerns and that we are all, of course, accountable at home – to consumers on the one hand and to milk producers on the other. To come back to the markets once again: whether I ought to believe in the Chinese market, I do not know. We see a great deal in this European Union and on this market today. However, we have an internal market here and this internal market helps us to be strong, even in the face of globalisation and general liberalisation. Let us therefore make a European internal market out of this milk quota. We used to be able to do this. The agricultural markets can face up to the challenges and particularly the routine fluctuations of the world market only from a strong, stable and organised internal market. For sustainable management, the economy, ecology and social aspects must be in harmony. All three components must be equally to the fore of any action we take. The European agricultural model represents sustainability and consumer safety – and that still applies! Farmers do both very well. They look after the landscape and therefore form the basis of tourism, contribute to energy security, produce top-quality food and maintain the economic basis for rural areas by providing employment. The social benefits are offset less and less for farmers by what are referred to as compensatory payments. Foodstuffs must increasingly have their fair price! Our overall political responsibility is greater than merely treading the path of liberalisation with open markets!

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too want to begin by thanking the rapporteur Mr Özdemir and all the shadow rapporteurs who worked on this report. With this strategy for Central Asia and this first broad debate in the European Parliament, we are actively taking the appropriate steps to promote dialogue and to meet all the challenges that still await us and which the Commissioner addressed. This strategy will involve small steps down a long road. I am glad that we will have closer cooperation and that this will not be a one-way street but an exchange of views based on mutual trust. Today’s debate shows us that we have to do a balancing act when we talk about Central Asia. The various Central Asian republics present very different features. We have very different requirements to make. We want to import energy but on a secure basis, and we want to export democracy and human rights. We want to combine the two, which is not easy. Since 1999 I have been a member of the delegation for relations with the Central Asian countries; I know those countries. I have learned from the people there and I know they too have a face and that they do not want to lose it. We must, therefore, proceed very carefully and sometimes pragmatically. That brings me to Uzbekistan. Uzbekistan is currently taking big steps that we should strongly welcome. The death penalty was abolished on 1 January. I thank the rapporteur for his oral amendment. Moreover, the habeas corpus principle was introduced, i.e. the principle that the court ascertains whether detention is lawful. In May this year we will be holding the second human rights dialogue with the Commission. I am confident it will take place. That is another good step that continues what we have begun. May I say here that I will support the amendments tabled by the UEN Group because I agree with them, because I regard them as a step towards dialogue and because we must seek dialogue and partnership.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have had a long and sometimes contentious debate on this subject. Let me express my thanks to the rapporteur. He has earned a great deal of respect for his work, which he performed in a focused manner, cooperating well with all his fellow committee members. Yes, the common organisation of the wine market must be reformed. It must be adapted to take account of present circumstances and future markets. At the same time, Commissioner, this proposal raises the question as to whether the Commission ought to interfere in the small things that help to create a regional identity, in the methods that have been practised in particular regions for centuries and underlie the culture of those regions? Such interference certainly does not help ordinary people. People sometimes do not understand what is going on. It is incomprehensible that we should prohibit sucrose while at the same time be signing agreements to import wine produced with sucrose from countries outside the European Union. Commissioner, as the third institution alongside the Council and Parliament, the Commission should concentrate on its own specific task, namely making proposals which foster the continuing development of the Community, which promote that whole development process. The common organisation of the market in wine is part of that process. Let me say on this point that the compromises we reached in committee, for which we grappled and, in some cases, are still grappling, are good for the whole House. I endorse them on behalf of the PPE-DE Group: we all support the compromises. We shall reject any amendments that run counter to them.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a democratic institution, we cannot allow human rights to be trampled on anywhere in the world. However, we find it equally unacceptable if, within this very House, diplomatic relationships and interparliamentary cooperation between the EU and Uzbekistan are risked without giving it a thought. When I look at the motions for resolutions presented by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the left-wing groups, it is tantamount to a diplomatic demolition derby. In Parliament’s last resolution, dated October 2006, we committed ourselves to a constructive, dialogue-oriented solution. Today, however, we are not seeking dialogue but slamming a door shut. My group cannot answer for this, so I ask you to reject the motions for resolutions by the PSE Group, the ALDE Group and the left. The motion for a resolution presented by our group together with the Union for Europe of the Nations Group has the following in its favour. The political situation in Uzbekistan is by no means satisfactory. The human rights situation continues to be alarming in many respects. Yet some progress is being made in spite of everything. For example, the first round of the human rights dialogue between the European Union and Uzbekistan took place in Tashkent on 8 and 9 May of this year. Any resolution by the European Parliament must illuminate the current situation, and the present resolution can only be based on this.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, everyone is talking about the good and stable market situation for milk and milk products at the moment and the resulting rise in milk prices. The rise in milk prices urgently needed by farmers is providing new fuel for the much-disputed question of quotas. Today I want to discuss the mini milk package and begin by taking the opportunity to thank the Commissioner and her colleagues for the good cooperation. They have presented three good and well-thought through proposals and Parliament is, therefore, not tabling many amendments. I do believe, however, that our draft amendments provide some food for thought and I hope the Commission and the Council will endorse them in the same way as the Committee on Agriculture. The first report submitted by the Commission contains amendments to the Council directive relating to certain partly or wholly dehydrated preserved milk for human consumption. In this report, the Commission proposes standardising the protein content at a minimum of 34%, expressed in fat-free dry matter. That standardisation will make it possible for European manufacturers to compete with manufacturers in third countries under the same conditions. This simplification of international trade is welcome and is one reason why the Committee on Agriculture adopted this report without amendments and with only one vote against. Such standardisation saves money, which is why in the second report I proposed a milk fund programme to ensure that the milk sector could retain any saved money. The Commission proposal amending the regulation on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products provides for several important technical adjustments, which will clearly also lead to improvements. Firstly, it will reduce the intervention price for skimmed milk powder by an average of 2.8%. By removing the intervention trigger for butter, abolishing national quality classes for butter, introducing a standard quality definition, removing disposal aid for military forces and abandoning the compulsory use of import licences, we are reducing the red tape. I am, however, quite definitely against abolishing private storage for cream and skimmed milk powder. It represents a safety net and I believe we should discuss this in the context of the Health Check and not of the mini milk package. Aside from that, the proposal to introduce a single rate of aid for school milk is no doubt right. Given the nutritional importance of school milk, however, the aid for products falling within that regulation should be increased substantially, from EUR 16.11 per 100 kg to EUR 18.15 per 100 kg. It is also urgently necessary to broaden the range of products. Some fantastic new milk, quark and yoghurt products are now available, which can cater for everyone’s tastes and likes, and if we introduced innovative school programmes we could whet children’s curiosity about those products while also doing something for nutrition. The potential EUR 117.3 million in savings resulting from the standardisation of protein for the period 2008-2013, or possible further savings within the milk market organisation, should be used to accompany and support milk sector reform. I would be quite prepared to discuss that too in the context of the Health Check debate. This measure is intended to facilitate our proposed milk fund programme. The resources could be used, in the context of promoting milk sector sales, for better nutritional information and also for further accompanying measures such as modernising milk production, in areas where conditions are more difficult and in mountainous regions. The committee unanimously adopted this second report. The third report concerns drinking milk. It proposes increased flexibility in the definition of drinking milk. The current regulation recognises three categories of drinking milk that can be produced and marketed in the Community. These are skimmed milk (maximum 0.5% fat), semi-skimmed milk (1.5% to 1.8% fat) and whole milk (at least 3.5% fat). The Commission’s proposal to allow the production and marketing of drinking milk that does not comply with those three categories, as long as a clear and easily readable indication of the fat content is given on the label, is right. This liberalisation measure will not only mean that transitional national derogations can be removed but also broadens the consumers’ options, which could certainly help revive intra-Community trade. To avoid any uncertainty, the fat content percentage of the milk should be clearly visible on the packaging and directly linked to the product description. Yet I think it is unnecessary to set a tolerance margin of +/-0.2% when indicating the fat content, since that would not improve clarity but be more likely to hinder implementation. These two draft amendments, like this third report, were also adopted unanimously in committee. Given the clear position taken by the Committee on Agriculture, I am confident that the entire mini milk package will be endorsed by a clear majority during tomorrow’s plenary vote too. I cannot, however, accept the ALDE Group’s three draft amendments. They do not substantially improve the report. The third draft amendment refers only to school milk, which would go against what we want, namely to improve supply of the entire range of products. That is why I must, unfortunately, reject that draft amendment too. I extend warm thanks to all colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture and in the Group. I thank them for their trust and for the good working relationship.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. Mr Cramer, you already know that I have not always been enthused by your report in all respects – we do not need to discuss this fact today. The report lacks balance and practical relevance. For example, it contains many provisions unrelated to the implementation of the first railway package in terms of content. Therefore, we – our coordinator Mr Jarzembowski and I – have tabled 20 amendments, only 11 of which involve the deletion of whole paragraphs. I was pleased with the outcome of the vote in the Committee on Transport and Tourism. The important points are, firstly, the call for the Commission to take action, without delay, against Member States who have not implemented the first and second railway packages by the specified date. Secondly, we consider it important, with regard to the financing of the further development of the European transport routes, that support be given in particular to the 30 priority trans-European network projects. Unfortunately, the complete deletion of the paragraph headed ‘Regulation of the separation between network and operation’ could not be pushed through. I reject out of hand a limitation of the choice between the various organisational models. We need solid evidence. We need to know the advantages and disadvantages of such a separation. We still need flexibility for railway undertakings. That is why we have requested a split vote. I should also like to say a few brief words about the problem of ‘gigaliners’: that is, ultra-long lorries of 60 tonnes and upwards. We cannot support Mr Cramer’s amendment concerning these in tomorrow’s vote on this report – which, after all, concerns the railway package. I do fully agree that goods belong on the railways, and thus my position may appear contradictory, but an amendment on gigaliners has no place in this report. We shall discuss this within the framework of the Ayala Sender report – when we shall also have time for the debate.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by extending the warmest of thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Degutis, and all the Members involved, for their cooperation. I firmly believe that, since the vote in committee, we have a balanced, practical report on the operation of air transport services. The original Commission proposal was well thought-out and goal oriented in this case, so I am much obliged to the Commission, too. Since I am basically satisfied with the outcome of the vote in committee, I should like to discuss only the transparency requirements with regard to the listing of air fares. From the outset, I have stood up for the creation of transparency without additional bureaucracy, and for the equal, fair involvement of everyone concerned. The air fare advertised should show clearly what charges, duties and taxes this includes and what they are used for. Air-ticket prices should be easy for consumers to understand and transparent. This is particularly applicable to the advertising of air fares on websites. Nevertheless, there is still disagreement over the means, and the precise extent of this. Amendment 48 lays down that duties and charges must be listed and summarised in four categories: firstly, taxes and other State charges and duties; secondly, air traffic control charges; thirdly, charges, duties, fees and other costs for the benefit of the airlines; and, fourthly, fees, levies, charges and other costs for the benefit of the airport operators. The problem is that air traffic control charges cannot be clearly stated in advance. Tomorrow, then, on behalf of my group, I shall be requesting the deletion of this second category, air traffic control charges, by means of split voting. Despite this amendment, the compromise reached fully meets the transparency requirement, whilst taking into account the interests of passengers and also airlines, and so I and my group cannot support the rapporteur’s new amendments, Amendments 54 and 55.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by emphasising once more that what we are discussing here is an own-initiative report that represents the response of the European Parliament to the Commission Communication regarding the reform of the common organisation of the market in wine. In my capacity as rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I can say that the Commission is right to regard strengthening the innovative capacity and competitiveness of the wine sector in Europe and worldwide as the primary objective of this reform. Promotional and information campaigns to encourage responsible consumption of wine form part of this. We consider it indispensable for the intensive pursuit of these objectives that the entire funding of the wine sector remain under the first pillar. In this connection, we warmly welcome the fact that the new rules will be applied according to the principle of subsidiarity by transposing them into national programmes approved by the Commission. Grubbing-up and permanent abandonment of vineyards may form part of this reform, but they must not be the central part. Likewise, before assigning new planting rights, the situation in the individual wine-growing regions with regard to illegal plantings should be examined. If we are to achieve an ambitious, forward-looking trade policy for wines, we must take a tailored approach in thinking about the present funding. The present distillation, representing EUR 600 million out of a total of EUR 1.4 billion, is certainly not an option for the future. Nevertheless, we believe that support for the distillation of wine by-products and potable-alcohol distillation should be retained. The compromise on the wine-growing traditions of the individual Member States consists in respect for the various traditions – and enrichment with sucrose also ranks among traditional oenological practices. In addition to its economic value, wine-growing forms part of the cultural heritage of the various regions of the EU. The new challenges necessitate rules that enable sustainability and also sustainable competitiveness. We should make these things our objective.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to extend a warm welcome to Mrs Roth as President-in-Office of the Council. As the rapporteur and also the Commissioner have already explained, the European licence for train drivers on which we are to vote tomorrow represents an important step towards the opening-up of rail transport throughout Europe. The licence for train drivers forms part of the third railway package, which also includes two other legislative procedures we consider important, namely the one on passenger compensation and the one on the opening-up of cross-border passenger transport from 2010. These three legislative procedures create the essential preconditions for successfully implementing the full liberalisation of rail transport in the EU. The European licence for train drivers takes on particular importance in the light of the EU-wide opening of freight-transport markets that entered into force at the start of this year. It will save time and money. At present, each of the 27 Member States of the EU has different requirements for which members of train crew require certification and for the means of certification. Up to now, the recognition of the various licences for train drivers has involved a great deal of bureaucracy, but it is to be hoped that the EU-wide standardisation in question will eliminate these problems. A further advantage of this European licence for train drivers is that it will significantly improve the free movement of railway workers and also improve railway safety. However, this licence will only be a real success if, in the final reckoning, it also reduces bureaucracy – and we have set the course for this as well. For example, we have been able to avoid bringing in certification for the whole crew, as some had wanted. We shall now have certification of train drivers as a first step, and of crew members performing safety-related tasks as a second – which the Commissioner had not considered a good solution. The European Railway Agency is to decide what form this second step should take on the basis of the experience acquired up to that date. This is our position. We have also managed to move the date of introduction forward to the end of this year, as prompt introduction will save railway undertakings money. We have had to accept a compromise on the Annexes dealing with the technical aspects – but it is one that makes perfect sense, and so it has our support. I find this very satisfactory. I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Savary, for his constructive cooperation. We shall be supporting this report tomorrow in plenary.

 Commissioner, today, on the basis of a ruling by the European Court of Justice, we are discussing the correction of Directive 2002/2/EC regarding the circulation of compound feedingstuffs, or the compound feedingstuffs declaration. The aim of this Directive is not the protection of health; in this respect, the ruling by the European Court of Justice was acceptable. However, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development held a broad debate followed by the presentation of amendments calling for provisions on giving feedingstuff ingredients by weight and detailing these in percentages. I should like to express my particular thanks to the rapporteur. I also support the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, particularly my amendment – which has been adopted – calling for no further-reaching amendments to be made to the legal act from now on, to enable swift action. The Commission has announced its intention to draw up proposals by mid-2007 to overhaul feed legislation, and it should do so. That would be a good time to discuss the proposals, which should take into account not only consumer issues, but also the interests of farmers in being provided with precise, detailed information on the feed materials contained in feedingstuffs, and the interest of the industry in ensuring that business secrets are adequately protected. It could also be a suitable time to reconsider the possibility, in future, of using high-quality animal proteins or protein components, which was of course banned following BSE and is still not accepted now. As we all know, only feedingstuffs containing the best, high-quality ingredients guarantee animal welfare, optimum performance and high-quality foodstuffs.

 Mr President, Commissioner, many thanks to you for what you have said, but I also want to extend warm thanks to my colleague Mr Freitas for taking the initiative and putting this oral question. As you have already, and repeatedly, pointed out, Commissioner, the current state of affairs – that is to say, the decision to retain the quota until 31 March 2015 – and the question as to what will succeed it, is a cause of vigorous debate, particularly in certain regions that are, or believe themselves to be, dependent on milk and on the quotas. It is good to hear a clear statement from you – as we indeed just have done – in which you give us the facts – namely, that the quota has been agreed on up to this point – and also tell us that we should have a debate in good time on what we propose to do about the situation. If we want to carry on having a quota, then the farmers must be aware of that and supportive of it, exactly in the same way as they have to be of the decision to abandon the system, as is in fact currently being envisaged. The question then arises as to what instruments might be feasible in the current financial situation as a means of preparing for its abandonment; it may well be, for example, that an increase in the milk quota is under discussion, but I would venture to express doubt as to whether this is the right way of going about it. How are we dealing with the option for young farmers who need the security to plan ahead and who very probably ought not to be investing a great deal more money in quotas, but rather in restructuring for the sake of their own competitiveness? How, too, are we to deal with areas that are nothing more than green spaces and need dairy farming if they are to be maintained as such? These are, in the main, areas with very beautiful and very interesting landscape, in which there are, as a rule, very few other ways available of earning a living, and so we must support them in this way.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is important that this House, rather than averting its eyes from violations of human rights anywhere in the world, should take action in response to them, and the dreadful things that happened in Andijan in Uzbekistan in May 2005 were another case in point; we are a democratic institution and, as such, must not allow human rights to be trampled underfoot anywhere in the world. Nor, too, however, must we allow cooperation between this House and other parliaments to put diplomatic relations at risk. When considering the present state of affairs in Uzbekistan, what has gone on there in the past must also be taken into account, and it is on that alone that this resolution must be founded. Last month, the delegation for relations with the countries of Central Asia – of which I am a member – planned to travel to Uzbekistan. That nothing came of this plan was not down to any lack of cooperation on the part of the Uzbek authorities, but rather to the lack of interest in any such trip on the part of sufficient Members of this House. One consequence of this is that we have not been able to form our own impressions of the current state of play in Uzbekistan as regards human rights, democratisation and the establishment of an independent judiciary, and we have been obliged, instead, to rely on information from third parties. Do not misunderstand me: I, too, take the view that human rights and attempts at democratisation often suffer repression in Uzbekistan, and that serious thought must therefore be given to keeping sanctions in place, particularly the embargo on weaponry, but I do not think that extending the sanctions to include such things as the denial of an EU visa to the President of Uzbekistan, Islam Karimov, would do anything to get us closer to what we want. To do such things would amount to breaking off diplomatic relations, and that cannot be what we have in mind. Nothing happening at the present time would justify such a forceful political response, and so I must ask you, as a matter of the greatest urgency, to endorse the amendment I have tabled and vote for its adoption. Should I fail in this attempt at a compromise, I will end up having to vote against the resolution.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on 23 January 2006, the Commission presented its Communication on a Community Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals 2006–2010. The report I drew up on this Communication as rapporteur for this House was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on 12 September. The objective of the Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals is to bring together Community activities previously spread across different Commission services, councils and policy areas and to structure them in accordance with uniform guidelines. Animal protection is an emotional, extremely politically sensitive issue. Such protection – appropriate to the specific needs and requirements of the respective animals – should be a matter of course in our civil society. On this basis, it is important to me as rapporteur that we establish a uniform level of animal protection in the EU. The Commission has emphasised time and again that the EU’s animal-protection standards, which are already high and are set to be improved still further, are an example to the world. A large majority in the committee supported my emphasis on the need for precise impact assessments in the case of all legislative measures on animal protection. In addition, it is only consistent to demand these high animal-protection standards in negotiations with the WTO and in bilateral agreements. Genuine animal protection cannot be restricted to farmed animals and animals used in experiments, but must cover all animals. In addition, the progress that has been made must be taken into account. Many of my fellow Members, and many people who have written to me, are particularly concerned about animals used in experiments. The scientific research sector has significantly stepped up its efforts to protect animals in recent years, however. A large number of alternatives to animal testing have been developed in order to translate the 3Rs principle into practice. Even though there is still a long way to go on this, I do think that we are moving in the right direction. The report supports endeavours to replace animal testing with alternative methods on the basis of further research. For this reason, we are making consistent calls for resources to be made available under the Seventh Research Framework Programme, too. Precise scientifically based animal-protection indicators are the most reliable basis for the further development of viable animal protection. This baseline report for the 2006–2010 period is not intended to detail any specific individual measures. We do not support any amendments calling for the non-binding application of voluntary animal-protection standards at national level. The report makes an emphatic call for proper application and enforcement of the existing rules on animal protection, for example in the field of animal transport. We welcome the proposed ban on imports of cat and dog fur and call for decisive action to restrict the trade in seal products. The need for accession countries to adapt their legislation as a matter of urgency has been emphasised. In addition, we strongly support a simple, compulsory ‘EU label’ for animal protection. There are 14 amendments. We support Amendments 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12 and 14 but cannot support Amendments 1, 9, 10 or 13. We have requested split voting on paragraphs 5, 7a, 29, 54 and 71. To the Commissioner I would say that Commissioner Kyprianou is currently in Brazil, where I am sure he will praise European animal-protection standards. I hope that he will also speak about the deficiencies in agricultural products imported into the EU from Brazil that have been detected once again by the EU Food and Veterinary Office. European agriculture and European consumers suffer as a result of distortions of competition. The European animal protection standards that are being called for must also have a positive impact on our competitiveness. I am much obliged to the Commissioner, and I am obliged to all my fellow Members for their constructive cooperation.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, even ten years after the outbreak of BSE, prevention, control and eradication of certain spongiform encephalopathies are still necessary and still under discussion. The regulation on this, which we are also discussing today, is intended to bring EU law into line with international requirements and the standards of the World Organisation for Animal Health, particularly important among which are all the precautions. Food safety and consumer protection are both priorities, but it is equally important to take a measured approach. Wherever possible, action should be based exclusively on scientific evidence. As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I endorse the results and compromises achieved so far. I should like to express my particular thanks to all members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety who have been working on this issue for their constructive cooperation and their practical handling of this important issue. It has proved possible to push through pragmatic simplifications that reduce bureaucracy. Three aspects are important in this regard. The first is that we really want to see three instead of five risk categories. This will make it possible to take nationally coordinated action against BSE, and will bring greater safety overall. The list of specified risk materials also forms part of this. Secondly, a point on which we are undoubtedly in agreement is that animal proteins should not be fed to ruminants now or in the future. However, it is right to allow young calves – and by this I mean very young calves – to be fed fishmeal in some cases, subject to appropriate controls. Young calves do not yet have fully developed ruminant stomachs, and they need animal protein. The third point is that there should really be a tolerance of up to 0.5% for animal protein accidentally present in feed; be it a mouse, bird, small animal or bone in the field. Zero per cent tolerance is rarely achievable in this world. One of the most important points as far as the Committee on Agriculture is concerned is that the EC regulation significantly restricts comitology powers. Together with the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee, Parliament decisively influenced risk management in the legislation in the first version of the regulation. Since then, Parliament has been bypassed and numerous amendments made through comitology. This does not seem very democratic and often impedes cooperation and acceptance. Let us take an approach to the beginning of the end that is characterised by moderation and responsibility. I should like to express my particular thanks to Mrs Roth-Behrendt for her good work. I send her my sincere good wishes and hope, for her sake and ours, that she is soon back among us.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by offering my sincere thanks to our rapporteur, Mr Parish, who has done a very good job in producing this own-initiative report. In view of current events, mixtures of all energy sources and the share of total energy demand accounted for by renewable energy are the most topical issues of the day. We must seize this opportunity in the interests of the widespread use of non-food crops. Following the agricultural reforms, farmers can cultivate energy crops on set-aside land, but alongside food production, which remains a priority. This initial step must be followed up, however, which means that we need to strengthen research and development, extending to modern economic biotechnology. What are important are market-integration aids and concentration on competitiveness, which means that it is important to give the promotion of bioenergy from non-food crops, which makes sense from an ecological point of view, a basis that is economically viable in the long term. We still need more jobs in rural areas.

 Mr President, Commissioner, allow me, too, to express my gratitude to the rapporteur, Mr Kindermann, for his excellent report and to endorse all of his demands. In these times of empty coffers, some people are pulling their hair out when they hear about the new things that the EU is doing and spending money on. However, the EU forestry strategy and the drafting of an EU action plan for sustainable forest management are not new activities and expenditure. Forestry policy is not a Community matter, although it cannot be denied it, and forest management too, are increasingly influenced by policy in other areas such as the environment and agriculture. Ever increasing social demands and environmental standards are also pushing the forest and timber industry to the very edge of profitability. If they are pushed over this edge, the managers will withdraw from the fray. We see the EU action plan as an opportunity to improve the framework conditions for forest management in the enlarged European Union. I think there are two key aspects to this: first, improving communication and coordination structures at EU level, and secondly appointing a structural unit within the Commission to take primary responsibility for implementing forestry action plans and strategies. There are three things that we do not need: firstly, European regulation of the timber market, secondly, more bureaucracy, and thirdly, particularly in the current financial situation, I reject EU aid for communal or state forests. Forestry in Central Europe is characterised by multifunctionality. We hope that social, ecological and economic sustainability will continue to be exemplary in the European context, and that European forestry will remain competitive.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to start with very warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Berman, for the work he has done. Some 5 billion broiler chickens are slaughtered in the European Union every year, and the great challenge presented by this report is that of finding a balance between the protection of animals, which is necessary, and the protection of jobs in the commercial production of broiler chickens. There is no doubt – not least in the minds of those who breed and keep chickens for fattening – about the rightness of our making a joint proposal for the improvement and harmonisation of the conditions under which they are kept in the EU. I, too, endorse the report, but the producers operate, even today, with the tightest of profit margins. If standards are raised within the Community, they will in particular face the problem of imports from third states, where standards in production are far inferior to our own. I therefore call for the introduction of binding rules on labelling, founded upon compliance with standards of protection, which will be effective, binding and harmonised right across Europe. Secondly, I call for certain standards in the keeping and production of broiler chickens and other agricultural products to be demanded in future WTO negotiations. The EU’s high standard in food production should become an advantage for producers in the EU. While we want our animals to be protected, we cannot, at the same time, allow our producers to be put in a disadvantaged position. The current threat of bird flu is another reminder to us of how important it is that broiler chickens should be produced safely, in adequate quantities and on a sound economic basis.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the achievement of smoothly running cross-border rail-freight and passenger services requires not only harmonisation of technical standards, but also harmonisation and standardisation of professional, linguistic and medical requirements. This could be accomplished by means of the standardisation of competence mentioned in our proposal. We would thus achieve better interoperability of train crews in addition to improved rail-transport safety. This model would only be a real success, however, if, in the final reckoning, it were to mean less tape. I am very much obliged to the rapporteur, Mr Savary, for his constructive cooperation and also the compromises that have been reached. Firstly, we have managed to achieve a consensus in Committee even on critical points such as the extension that had been called for in the scope of the directive from train drivers to other train crew. We have agreed on a two-stage process, whereby the Railway Agency shall decide on the necessity of certification for other on-board staff at a later date. Secondly, we have managed to reduce the original subdivision into three categories of driving licence to two, which will lead to administrative simplification and streamlining. Thirdly, as regards regular monitoring of train drivers, we should like this to apply to only those aspects that concern the driving ability of the train driver. Fourthly, we wish the date on which the directive is introduced to coincide with the opening-up of the markets. Fifthly, on the issue of whether certification should relate only to train drivers on cross-border services or also include those on domestic services, we propose a gradual process of certification of all train drivers. All in all, these are pragmatic, unbureaucratic solutions that will have a simplifying and streamlining effect. This has been, and continues to be, the aim of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in this House. For this reason, and also because of the compromises that have been reached, the PPE-DE Group rejects Amendments 46 and 50. By way of conclusion, I should like to say a few words about the report on passengers’ rights: more particularly Amendment 138. This aims to put in place an entitlement under EU law to transport bicycles on all trains, and such an obsession with regulation, down to the last detail, is a further example of why much of the public is sceptical towards Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, let us give out the right signals.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by warmly thanking our rapporteur, Mrs Schierhuber. She has done a great piece of work with this report, which seeks to strike a balance between many different interests, all of which have something to be said for them. Sixty per cent of the population and 90% of the territory of the EU. These two figures really do bring home the importance of rural development as the second pillar of the European Union’s agricultural policy. The EU population can be content only if the rural population is content. In the light of recent political developments and the failed referendum, we must not only be more aware of the need for acceptance of European policy, it must quite definitely be to the fore everywhere. In view of the empty coffers and the fighting over distribution, I must also point out that, historically, the EU budget was an agricultural budget. The policy areas that were added later must not be allowed to overshadow this historic core of Europe. That is why there are also calls for rural development funds, which are part of agricultural funding, to remain primarily with farmers in projects related to farming. I therefore expressly support Mrs Schierhuber’s proposed financial appropriations for all three main axes. It is very important that the support available for very small enterprises should also be extended to medium-sized undertakings in rural areas. We must also join the rapporteur in calling for Natura 2000, financing for which has still not been settled, not to be funded out of second pillar resources but out of additional money. At this point I would like once again to extend my sincere thanks to Mrs Schierhuber and to everyone else who has worked so hard on this important report. In the light of the above points, this report has earned our support.

 Mr President, a long-standing dream of this Parliament, and one shared by many of Europe’s citizens, is becoming reality. We have worked long and hard for this Constitution, but we can be proud of what has now been achieved, and I should like to take this opportunity today to thank Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Corbett. As shadow rapporteur for my group in the Committee on Agriculture, I can say that we are in favour of this draft Constitution, which undoubtedly represents a gain for the committee. When the common agricultural policy was established in 1958, this House was merely a consultative body, and it was only with the Treaty of Amsterdam that we were given the right of codecision in the fields of the environment, consumer protection and food safety. The democracy deficit, having persisted in spite of everything, will now be overcome by means of an extension of the codecision procedure to include all decisions of principle on agricultural policy. There are however also negative sides to the Constitution. In future the Council will be able to take autonomous decisions on the setting of quotas, prices and quantitative restrictions, as the draft Constitution takes no account of the new goals of the common agricultural policy following the EU agricultural reform. This is a step backwards from the current situation, and it will mean much work for us in the future. As a representative of the German Federal Land 
of Baden-Württemberg, too, I believe that a number of extremely important goals have been achieved; the national constitutions have been strengthened, regions and local authorities have been accorded greater significance, and the principle of subsidiarity has been adhered to. The draft Constitution lays the foundations for common economic activities, and we will gain a common basis of values shared by all of us, something I see as particularly important. We have before us a document which places an obligation on all those who bear responsibility for Europe.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the adoption of the Community Code on Visas will mean that, in future, Schengen visas – visas for stays of up to three months – will be issued according to established uniform criteria in the Schengen area. This step is urgently needed in a European Union with open borders. At the same time, Member States’ responsibility for processing visa applications is clarified. As a rule, applicants must contact the Member State in which their main destination is located. My group welcomes the fact that the requirement and the procedure for issuing entry visas will speed up entry for large numbers of people. This way, business travellers entering the EU will be treated fairly and, moreover, holidaymakers from all round the world – by far the largest group of travellers to the EU – will benefit. Thus we have not only made it possible to process visa applications quickly but also ensured that security screening prevents abuses. With its balance between security and facilitating entry, the Visa Information System affords Member States instant, direct access to all the relevant data in connection with the issuing of visas. Thus the examination of applications is being simplified while, at the same time, the issuing of visas will provide greater security in future thanks to the use of biometric identifiers; that is, photograph and fingerprints. The compromise struck between rapporteur Mr Lax and the Council takes account of Parliament’s original position and also has the support of the broad majority of my group. I should like to take this opportunity to reiterate my sincere thanks to Mr Lax for his commitment and his excellent cooperation over the last three years on this very complex dossier, which puts European visa policy on a new footing.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in order to fulfil the European Union’s claim to be an area of freedom, security and justice, our task is to control the allocation of entry visas for people travelling to the EU from outside Europe. The newly created rules require EU embassies and representations to take fingerprints and photos of applicants in future. This meets four objectives. Firstly, it will simplify the process of combating fraud and abuse, as biometric identifiers make forging visas more difficult. Secondly, it will prevent so-called visa shopping. Thirdly, the process of applying for a visa will be speeded up. Fourthly, at the same time border controls will be made easier, because biometric identifiers will allow border staff to determine quickly whether the person in front of them is the person for whom the visa was issued. We would have been happy to support the Commission proposal to take the fingerprints of children from the age of six years upwards, in order to prevent the risk of people trafficking. Unfortunately there was not a majority in favour of this in the House. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports with a broad majority the compromise that a Member State which is responsible for accepting and processing applications must also be able as a last resort to work with external service providers. A decisive factor in our agreement to cooperation of this kind is that the Member States remain responsible for data protection and data security in these cases. This means that the electronic data sent by the external service providers to the authorities of the relevant Member State must always be fully encrypted. I would like to thank the rapporteur and my fellow Members from the other groups, who have worked as shadow rapporteurs on this project for three years.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission proposal to amend the Common Consular Instructions is urgently necessary in an EU of open borders. My group strongly supports Sarah Ludford’s report. I thank the rapporteur for the good cooperation, thanks to which the European Parliament’s Groups managed largely to agree on a joint text. The Common Consular Instructions need to be redefined and adapted to the situation today. In future applicants for visas will be identified beyond any doubt by the collection of biometric data such as photographs and fingerprints. It became clear in the past that some Member States, among them Germany, were interpreting and applying the existing rules differently and therefore not uniformly. In 2000, for example, German consulates and embassies were instructed to be less bureaucratic in issuing visas and when in doubt to decide to grant a visa. As a result of the generosity with which the German Embassy in Kiev tended to grant visas, the number of visas issued to Ukrainian nationals rose from about 150 000 in 1999 to about 300 000 in 2001, which led to a considerable rise in illegal immigrants in the Schengen area. It is therefore urgently necessary to ensure that all Member States apply the rules on issuing Schengen visas in a uniform manner. My Group is in favour of seeking a compromise between the Council and the European Parliament, as Commissioner Barrot just suggested. Our Group endorses nearly every point in Baroness Ludford’s report. The only points we cannot endorse concern the age limit for children and fingerprinting. We support the Commission’s proposal to set the age limit for children at six years. My Group considers it most important to keep to that age limit in order to prevent child trafficking in the European Union.

 As the rapporteur, I welcome the European Parliament's overwhelming endorsement of the resolution on missing persons in Cyprus. It is the right of every relative of the missing persons to know their fate through the exhumation and identification of the remains. Locating the remains of their relatives, who have been missing for decades, and giving them a decent burial is the only way for Greek and Turkish Cypriots to close this painful chapter in their lives, for it finally gives them certain knowledge of the fate of their loved ones. I am convinced that this can make an important contribution to the positive moves towards the reunification of Cyprus. Through the provision of funding, the EU is already actively supporting the work of the Committee on Missing Persons (CMP) at the exhumation sites, in the anthropological laboratories and with the families concerned. It is important, in this context, that the Committee on Missing Persons should carry out all the necessary investigations and analyses while there are still eyewitnesses available who can provide information about this humanitarian problem of missing persons. I therefore consider it essential to provide for an additional amount of EUR 2 million in the general budget of the European Union for 2009, and would urge the Council and the European Commission to reach agreement on this extra financial support.

 Madam President, we have been calling for an overall plan for all aspects of migration for years, and the Returns Directive quite clearly forms part of this package. Legal immigration into the European Union can be regulated sensibly only if we do not continue to accommodate millions of illegal immigrants and put this situation on a par with legal immigration. When Mrs Roure points to the ‘right’ of illegal immigrants to escape poverty, I must remind her that there are 922 million people on the continent of Africa alone, most of whom live in poverty, and that there are 1.1 billion people in India, many of whom would like to come and join us in Europe. That is the wrong way of regulating things. Therefore, support this Returns Directive to open the way for us to have really good regulations for legal immigration at last so that we can truly help people.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the legal basis for the visa-information system on which we are to vote tomorrow is one of those dossiers that has been finally brought to a successful conclusion after intense wrangling on all sides and lengthy negotiations. It is therefore to be hoped that an important European instrument for the acceleration and supervision of the visa-issuing process will be on its way to the statute book before the summer recess. Exchanges of data on visa applicants from non-Schengen countries between the asylum and immigration authorities and between the border and security authorities will considerably speed up the processing and checking of visas. That will help those bona fide 
travellers without criminal records who enter the European Union, including those who travel frequently to and from the Union, because they will now obtain a visa more quickly and with fewer formalities, whether they are travelling as tourists or on business. At the same time, it will facilitate surveillance, which is indispensable in a European Union with open internal borders. All of the political groups can be satisfied with the outcome. On the one hand, the European Union seeks to ensure that visas are dealt with speedily and hospitably. On the other hand, it seeks to protect its citizens by preventing illegal entry and the associated forms of organised crime. My thanks go the rapporteurs and to all of my honourable colleagues who have worked constructively to find solutions. Let me also say a special word of thanks to the German Presidency, which won acceptance in the Council for many of our wishes.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ever since 1999, this House has been debating legislative proposals relating to migration without any figures on which to base its decisions, while the scope of immigration policy has become considerably wider. What we need, then, is more and better information if we are to be able to effectively plan, implement, evaluate and monitor political measures. Led by Commissioner Frattini, the Commission has responded to pressure from this House and has submitted a draft regulation on the statistical monitoring of migratory movements, something that is made necessary by the Member States’ failure to supply all the relevant statistical material, or indeed any at all, on the previously voluntary basis. Data are also collected in different ways, with the consequence that they have, hitherto, not been comparable. This regulation obliges our Member States to provide any and all figures that may be required; it also brings about harmonisation and makes it possible to compare the figures. It was relatively difficult to get the Council to come round to this, whilst all the parties in this House agreed in principle on the need for the regulation. The general agreement prevailing among the groups meant that this House was able to get its position accepted through the comitology procedure, and the outstanding cooperation of all the shadow rapporteurs, to whom I would like to take this opportunity of expressing my thanks, played a considerable part in enabling us to bring this dossier to a satisfactory conclusion, so thank you all, once more, for that.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, after a year of hearings and questioning, we are bringing the work of the committee of inquiry into the CIA to a close. What will be crucial, from the point of view of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, is whether we will, today, vote on this report on the basis of facts and proof, or whether suspicions and insinuations will prevail. It is for this reason that we in the Group of the European People’s Party will be unable to vote for the report’s adoption if it continues to make reference to matters that we have not been mandated to consider; if, as well as taking an unbalanced view of individual Member States, it also indulges in baseless suppositions concerning the presence of secret prisons on EU soil, contains unsubstantiated assertions, generalisations and tendentious insinuations and demands disproportionate action against certain Member States, including, for example, the suspension of the right of one of them to vote in the Council, and, finally, if it depicts the activities of the intelligence services as criminal in nature. There is one thing I would like to make clear, and it is that Mr Fava’s original report is one we can largely live with. If today’s vote gets us back to that; if Mr Fava accepts the amendments we have tabled in the interests of objectivity and clarification, then we in this House will be able today, by a broad majority, to produce a balanced result, something that contains a clear vote for our understanding of the rule of law and for the defence of our fundamental rights and freedoms, while also showing that we have faced up to our responsibility to conduct an objective investigation. I would, though, like to make it no less clear that we will not be able to endorse the report if the rapporteur ignores our key amendments.

 Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, only recently, some elements in this House celebrated the ruling of the European Court of Justice to the effect that the agreement between the EU and the United States on US access to airline passenger data was invalid on formal grounds. The interim agreement that has now been concluded leaves the nature and scope of the information largely unchanged, however. Admittedly, the United States no longer has automatic access to the data, instead having to request them from the airlines. This represents a successful negotiation outcome, one for which I should like to express my particular thanks to Commissioner Frattini. Nevertheless, the agreement that the European Court of Justice declared invalid clearly stipulated that the customs and border protection authorities were permitted to pass on these data only in exceptional cases. Now, airline passenger data may be passed on, as required, to all the American authorities responsible for combating terrorism. Passengers probably do not feel that this compromises their security – the opposite is more likely to be the case – but my group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, has a strong sense that, by referring the case to the Court of Justice, certain Members of this House have done us all a disservice, for one thing that must be recognised today is that the new agreement affords no greater data protection than the old one. For this reason, I would plead that we continue to work to safeguard the high standards of data protection in Europe, including in the case of the transfer of airline passenger data. While Parliament and the Commission should exert their influence on future negotiations to this end, we must also recognise that a sovereign state such as the United States will continue to exercise the right to lay down rules on who can enter its territory and on what conditions.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the management of migratory flows, and hence the control of immigration into the EU, is among the most pressing problems with which we have to deal, and it goes without saying that doing so involves looking beyond our narrow national horizons, but that does not mean that we can limit ourselves to a European analysis or to European approaches either. Cooperation with transit countries and countries of origin, and support given to them, are part of the solution, but what is also needed is an integrated approach, for immigration needs to be regulated, and that cannot be a matter for internal policy alone; solutions can be found only by joint efforts across various policy areas. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has for a long time been calling for immigration policy that takes account of the needs and rights of other Member States. For example, one cannot go ahead with a mass legalisation without informing or consulting others, only to seek help from the EU once that action begins to suck other migrants in. It is fundamental that national immigration policy must bear in mind its effects on other Member States. It has to be said, though, that making a policy area – in this case, that of immigration – part of Community policy-making, which involves making it subject to codecision, is not a panacea. There are certainly many problems that affect us all, but at least an equal number that are specifically national, regional or even local in character. For many, one of the attractions of a Community policy on economic migration is that it not only extends their own powers, but could also help with the enforcement of an immigration policy for which there was no majority support at national level, but that motivation takes no account of the Member States’ right to adequate solutions; no policy can succeed unless the citizens of our Member States have a hand in framing it.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the defence of human rights, the maintenance of the fundamental freedoms that protect citizens and respect for our European legal systems are among the principles underpinning the European Union; accordingly, it was and is the function of the CIA Committee to examine whether the Member States had misapplied Community law. It is unfortunate that its interim report, which we now have before us, is as yet neither even-handed nor complete. I can live with the fact that the groups in this House attach different values to the statements made to the committee, but it is a fundamental requirement of any balanced report that it should include all statements, including those that do not tally with the committee's preconceived ideas. Completeness demands, then, that the statements by Mr Solana and Mr de Fries at their respective hearings to the effect that they were not aware of any breach of the law on the part of any Member State, be included in the report along with the fact that no evidence has been provided, to this day, of the existence of so-called secret prisons in the European Union. This report must also include the statement made by John Bellinger on behalf of the American administration; after all, the members of the committee had travelled specially to Washington to ask him the questions he answered. None of the things I have mentioned have as yet been included in the report, for the reason that the majority on the committee found them disagreeable; I dare say that that is hardly commensurate with their task of seeking out facts and establishing the truth. The justified interest in the investigation of the accusations that have been made must not result in a one-sided approach to the assessment and evaluation of the facts. If this committee and this House are to have any credibility, then this interim report must reflect objectively all the information available to us; then – and only then – can we adopt this report by a large majority.

Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Lehtomäki, SWIFT, the Society for Worldwide International Financial Telecommunication, has stated that it, acting upon a request from the American Department of Finance, passed on to the American authorities a limited amount of information concerning international money transfers. This information can be found on the company’s website. According to the statement by the Belgian data company, moreover, cooperation with the authorities is intended to prevent misuse of the international financial system. The Belgian Government – according to press reports, at any rate – is already investigating whether the US administration’s research activities were in breach of national law, and this is something to which Commissioner Frattini has just referred. The Belgian minister for justice has also set in motion investigations into this matter, and her department is, in the initial stages at any rate, the right one to be investigating this sort of thing, for, according to current law, it is the Belgian legal system that must take action and make inquiries. Considering carefully what the Commissioner has just again said, and thinking about how much we know about this at the present time, I have to come to the conclusion that we know nothing for certain, and have not yet reached the stage at which we would be obliged to investigate. We know that there are EU-wide rules on the protection of civilian data, and the planned European legislation on the handling of private data in connection with the prosecution of crime and the war on terror – at least as far as I am aware – is, as things stand, going to contain only rules on how state authorities should handle sensitive data, and so I think we should, as a matter of urgency, aim to use European legislation, once it has been adopted, to intervene and take action at an early opportunity.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, being one of the world’s safest regions, and with one of the strongest economies, the European Union is under pressure from the large number of people who want to migrate to it, and managing this flow will be one of the tasks for the Europe of the future. Our European migration policy must aim to manage legal migration while also preventing the illegal variety, for space for legal migrants is made available only if the illegal ones are kept at bay. In an EU whose internal borders are largely open, migration can – and may – be regulated only with reference to the other Member States and on the basis of joint responsibility, something that Mr Gaubert made quite clear in his report. Mr Lambrinidis’ report shows how support for efforts at integrating immigrants is another important component of a rational and coherent migration policy, but it appears from the Commission’s document – which I have to say is excellent – that all the European Union can do is lay down the framework conditions for this. What is beyond doubt is that failure to integrate not only frustrates the immigrants, but also makes it considerably less likely that the host society will accept immigration. While a well thought-out immigration policy is certainly worth working towards, Europe’s border regions need help; they need it now, and they need it at once. We should all care about the things we see happening in Malta, the Canary Islands, Lampedusa, Ceuta and Melilla; all the Member States, the Commission and this House, should help the countries concerned right now, without delay and without bureaucracy. Medium-term solutions can be found only through joint effort across various policy areas, such as internal and external policy and development cooperation. Cooperation with, and support for, transit countries and countries of origin, are part of the solution. We, whose concern is with the framing of internal policy, are prepared to play our part in bringing them about.

We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats condemn racially motivated attacks, assaults and discrimination in every shape and form and firmly repudiate racist tendencies; that was stated in the motion for a resolution on homophobia that was adopted in January, and we have also spelled it out in our latest draft motion for a resolution. We call on the EU institution, the Member States and all political parties in the EU to do likewise. The joint motion for a resolution tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is not a document we can endorse, on the grounds that it arbitrarily pillories individual Member States and puts a motion for a resolution – a parliamentary instrument – in the service of false statements and insinuations. To name but two of these: Paragraph 2 includes reference to: “the brutal assault on a German citizen of Ethiopian origin ... in particular because of its racial motive.” The German Attorney-General, whose remit includes major crimes jeopardising the peace within Germany, sent this case back to the relevant court on the grounds that it was not primarily racially motivated. The draft motion for a resolution contains generalised presuppositions concerning the Member States’ police forces: ... “Member States should consider whether their police forces and judicial systems suffer from ‘institutional racism’....” These people put their lives and limbs at risk, day in and day out, for the safety of all of us, and I refuse to lump them all together in this way and denounce them as racists.

 Mr President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, what is termed local border traffic is a single stone in the big mosaic picture of the protection of the external borders. On the one hand, we are securing the external borders against illegal crossings and the phenomena often occurring at them, such as the smuggling of drugs, the trafficking of human beings, prostitution and other forms of organised crime. We can also, on the other hand, make daily life easier for those who live on opposite sides of the external borders, but do so nonetheless as good neighbours. It is only reasonable to secure our borders against the entry of unwelcome persons in so far as possible, but it is equally reasonable to want to make it easier for the people at the borders to live together, for – as many Members have already said – we do not want Europe to be a fortress, but rather a community that coexists amicably with its neighbours. It is for that reason that I believe the rapporteur is right to suggest that the Commission proposal be amended so as not to introduce new arrangements for existing borders within Europe. We are, after all, working on the assumption that the Member States will by then have transposed the Schengen acquis
, that SIS II will be successfully up and running, and so Europe will no longer need additional internal rules of this kind. This report by Mr Brejc is a good example of successful cooperation between Members of this House across party boundaries, and a model to follow as regards successful cooperation with the Council under our codecision arrangements. All of us, together, have managed to put together well thought-out and practical solutions for the day-to-day coexistence of our fellow citizens and their neighbours, and for that I would like most warmly to thank the rapporteur and his shadow opposite numbers as well. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Vice-President, what has to be said, quite simply and bluntly, about the opinion of the European Parliament on the Commission's report on Citizenship of the Union that Mr Catania has presented is that it misses the point. It does so by doing no more than demanding that EU citizenship be extended to include those who are resident in the EU but not citizens of it, so that, for example, foreigners and stateless persons would be given the right to vote and the right to stand for election. Third-country nationals would acquire the rights of EU citizens while retaining their rights in their home countries. To take one example, one could envisage a situation where, if Mr Catania had his way, an American who had lived in the EU for five years would be able to vote in the elections for the European Parliament, and indeed himself be elected to it, while at the same time being able to take part in elections in the United States. The effect of that would be to accord people who are not EU citizens more rights than those who actually are. The question at issue was, however, whether EU citizens actually enjoy, to the degree originally envisaged, the rights that they are accorded by law. Specifically, how do things stand with the rights of EU citizens as guaranteed by the Treaty on the European Communities? Can our citizens really, for example, settle in other EU Member States without getting too tangled up in red tape? What are the obstacles that make it more difficult to take up a job in another EU country? If someone does that, how do things stand as regard the transferability of social security and health insurance, or the changeover to another system? Are the controls on citizens at the internal borders unnecessarily rigorous? Mr Catania, unfortunately – and I say ‘unfortunately’ in view of the fact that these are issues with which every citizen of the EU has to deal in everyday life – does nothing to answer these questions, not to mention others besides. Rational answers to them enhance the credibility of the European Union in people’s eyes. Improving the realities of day-to-day life and the cultural exchange between the European peoples makes Europe more readily acceptable. It is because the opportunity to do that has been missed that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will be voting to reject this report. Perhaps I might be permitted to explain to the chair why it is that all the speakers are leaving the Chamber as soon as they have finished their speeches. As of 7 o’clock, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs has been sitting, and all of us are required to go straight there. I would just like to clarify that for fear that it might be seen as discourteous.

 Mr President, Mr Clarke, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, we will, tomorrow, be passing an important European instrument for the combating of terrorism and the most serious forms of criminality. This House having rejected the original framework decision as having been founded on the wrong legal basis, the Commission’s draft directive now provides for this House to possess the power of codecision. Just like the Member States in the Council, we started out with very diverse views and a different understanding, but sustainable compromises emerged from our discussions. From the very outset, with quick and efficient work in mind, we negotiated with the Council on an informal basis, as is the customary procedure. What is also customary in arriving at democratic decisions is the seeking of majorities for a position and the negotiating of compromises, and those produced by the two major groups enjoy the support of a broad majority in this House. The rapporteur, Mr Alvaro, may well find this way of going about things to be in bad taste, but it was not possible to reach any agreement with him, as he was not in Brussels during the final stage of the negotiations, but the UK Presidency was informed as soon as the two major groups had reached informal agreement on a position, and it was on this basis that agreement in the Council was made possible. This House can claim to have achieved various successes, in that we were able to substantially reduce the number of types of data over against what the Commission had proposed. Where the criminal offences were concerned, opinions ranged from ‘applicable to all offences’ to ‘terrorism only’, and we agreed on: ‘serious crimes as defined by national law, by reference to the European Arrest Warrant’. One of our great achievements has been to incorporate data protection into the directive wherever possible, striking a happy medium between the protection of the public against serious crime and terrorism on the one hand and the safeguarding of the private domain on the other.

 Madam President, I would like to make it plain, for Mrs in 't Veld’s benefit, and in order to nip in the bud any potential legends on the subject, that the rapporteur was in Israel until the evening of the Wednesday prior to the crucial meeting of the Council. It was on Wednesday that I had recourse to the telecommunications facilities and informed Mr Alvaro of our proposals by email. As far as I know, Mrs Roure did likewise. Mrs Kaufmann and Mrs Buitenweg were of the opinion that a deal had been done behind the backs of the smaller groups, but I would like to remind them that the European United Left and the Greens had already rejected the Committee’s compromise, and it is hardly productive to initiate negotiations with groups that are categorically opposed to a proposal; after all, they, as a matter of principle, will negotiate on all other matters with any group other than the Group of the European People’s Party. So let them stop talking about ‘deals’ and accept the democratic majority opinion in this House.

 Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, although I have the floor, what we are really talking about here is the Green Paper on economic migration. Today’s plenary debate and tomorrow’s vote signify the beginning of a new chapter. We are creating the framework conditions for economic migration in Europe. The EU is one of the safest, economically strongest regions in the world. For this reason, we are subject to considerable pressure from migration flows; as, indeed, we shall continue to be in future. Managing these inflows is one of Europe’s challenges for the future, and to meet it we should not just react to reality, but act to shape the future. In a European Union with largely open internal borders, immigration can and should only be regulated in a way that makes allowances for and shows a sense of responsibility towards other Member States. That means that, within the EU, we need harmonised European regulations on migration. It should also be made clear, however, that ultimate responsibility for access to the labour market lies with the Member States. The Commission has compiled fundamental questions on the regulation of economic migration in a Green Paper in order to obtain an overview of opinion that is as comprehensive and reliable as possible as a basis for drafting subsequent proposals for regulations. Parliament gave advice on this questionnaire in the form of a resolution as an own-initiative report. In order to do justice to the state of affairs now, in the early stages of the regulatory framework, my report summarises fundamental guidelines on economic migration. Parliament has the task of working out the framework for our action in the coming years. Detailed issues are to be resolved at a later date, at the advisory stage for particular Commission drafts. The objective of a European immigration policy must be to manage legal, that is to say desirable, migration whilst preventing illegal, unwanted migration. Only by stemming the abuse of existing regulations can we create scope for legal, managed migration. We need a European migration policy in the form of a comprehensive, coordinated framework, within which migration regulations are to be drawn up according to reasons for moving. There must of course be continuing respect for human rights and human dignity. Economic migration differs from the granting of asylum, however, in that the main emphasis is on the economic needs of the receiving countries. This explains why mass legalisation is not a viable immigration-policy measure, because there can neither be selection of migrants nor analysis of the labour market to determine actual labour requirements. Mass legalisation is an attempt to somehow give an untenable situation a better administrative form. In a way, it means politicians capitulating to reality. Even the idea of attempting to solve Europe’s demographic problem by means of migration is inadequate. Studies have shown that the birth rate in integrated immigrants falls to EU levels as early as the second generation. In addition, we would need so many immigrants in the near future that their integration would be impossible. I think that we should also reject the calls to follow the example of the United States and introduce a green card system. Apart from the fact that there are far better ways of regulating immigration, this would mean considerable intrusion on the competences of the Member States. The same applies to the calls for Europe-wide regulation of the right to vote for third-country nationals. This is one of the original prerogatives of the Member States, and does not belong within the competence of the European institutions. In recent weeks, the issue of immigration has once more become the focus of public attention. The images and reports from Lampedusa, Ceuta and Melilla, Malta and Cyprus have shaken many people. Behind these images lie individual destinies by which we are touched. Firstly we are shocked at what is happening on the southern borders of Europe, and secondly we ask ourselves how we can change the present situations and prevent such things happening in future. Let us not fool ourselves, though. We are here to speak about all the external borders of the EU. The only reason that the problems of securing the other external borders of the EU are not the focus of public attention is that the images are not so concentrated in the media and thus do not make such a powerful impression. Politicians are called upon to rectify the situation as quickly as possible or, even better, to prevent a certain state of affairs from arising in the first place. Tackling only the symptoms cannot be the solution; we must also confront the causes. To put it in plain language, letting the people currently waiting on the Moroccan side of the fence travel into the EU would seem to be a humane act. In reality, however, to do so would be excessively simplistic and ultimately inhumane. It is not sufficient to let people into the EU, because what is to happen then? Where and how are these people supposed to live and work? What prospects do we have to offer them? Much worse, this act would have a pull effect. Unfortunately, Ceuta and Melilla are living proof that mass legalisation has an immense pull effect. What was originally meant to be a measure to end illegal residence and undeclared work has become an incentive for illegal immigration. To summarise, it should be emphasised that we need clear regulations for all fields of immigration: flight, asylum and economic migration. The people we receive must be offered quality of life. That is one aspect. In this context, we need cooperation and support concepts with regard to countries of origin and transit. That is a further aspect. We need a third aspect too, however: a consistent, rigorous fight against illegal immigration. Readmission agreements, border management, return of illegal immigrants, and tackling the trafficking and smuggling of human beings all form part of this. Approaching and solving this as an overall task is the key to successfully mastering this new chapter in European history. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have seen terrible things happening over recent days in Ceuta and Melilla, but Ceuta and Melilla are no more than the tip of the iceberg. In Mayotte, Malta or Lampedusa, and all over the place, we can see streams of refugees, but the new Member States in the East of the European Union have also recorded constantly increasing numbers of people who have no legal right to be there. The only reason why their problem has not been exposed to public view is that the images are less compressed and pack less of a punch. All these images, though, represent human beings with their individual fates, and they put us on the spot. One of the tasks of politicians is to prevent certain abuses from occurring in the first place, and instead to give help as quickly as possible. What we see at present are the consequences of sins of omission and of action on the basis of false premises. Addressing the symptoms alone is no sort of solution; we also have to face up to the underlying causes. Both now and in the future, we will have a great deal of pressure from migration to cope with; managing the flow of migrants is one of the European Union’s most pressing tasks. Any European immigration policy must have as its objective the management of legal migration, the provision of humanitarian aid in accordance with the Geneva Convention on Refugees and, at the same time, the prevention of illegal migration. It follows that any European immigration rules must guarantee not only the security of our external borders but also the consistent combating of the practice of smuggling and trafficking in people, and a clear returns policy. Carting people off into the desert is inhumane and an admission of defeat in the face of all the things we have not yet dealt with. Nor, though, does it help to let a few hundred or a few thousand illegals in Ceuta and Melilla into the EU in the belief that we have thereby solved the problem. According to the UNHCR, there are 4.6 million refugees in Africa. Non-governmental organisations work on the basis of estimates according which 20 000 people are waiting in Morocco. There is, unfortunately, no single solution to this; what we need is a package of solutions. The EU must lay down unambiguous rules for migration, while, at the same time, giving more aid to the countries from which migrants come and through which they pass, but it must also be equally consistent in ensuring adherence to the rules applicable to the crossing of our external borders. That will involve not only a consistent policy on return but also the conclusion by the EU of readmission agreements with countries of origin and of transit. These are all things that we must resolve together; one cannot always pick out the bits that fit the passing moment and win public approval. This is our task, and we must face up to it! (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, as long as we are among the most secure regions of the world, people who suffer persecution in their own countries will come to us, and it goes without saying that we should try to help them. It is an humanitarian obligation incumbent on us not only as individual states, but also as a European Union, and the fact that that Union’s internal borders are open makes it important that we at least lay down a minimum standard for asylum procedures, with it made clear not only to asylum-seekers but also to the host countries what prior conditions apply, what form the procedures take, and how long they should take. It is also a matter of humanitarian obligation that procedures should be transparent and quick, and that they should treat people with dignity, and this is an obligation that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats takes very seriously, as is evident from the amendments tabled by our shadow rapporteur Mr Coelho – which the Committee accepted – in contrast to the approach taken by the rapporteur, Mr Kreissl-Dörfler, which does nothing to help us meet our humanitarian obligations. The fact is that what matters is not that we should accept as many people as possible, but that we should offer a safe haven to those who are persecuted in their own country and for whom Europe is their only possible place of refuge. At the same time, we must be clear in our own minds about the evident fact that the right of asylum is also misused, and so, in order to make room for people who really are persecuted, we have to deter manifestly unfounded applications. Using a list of safe third countries helps to do this. Practice in Germany has shown this to be a sensible and workable arrangement, although it must be noted that inclusion in the list of safe third countries is conditional upon acceptance and implementation of both the Geneva Convention on Refugees and the European Convention on Human Rights – a high standard that we have set for ourselves. It is this concept of safe third countries and safe countries of origin that the rapporteur rejects, with the consequence that, for example, neither Canada nor Norway nor Switzerland are regarded as safe countries for asylum-seekers. I have to tell him that they should be included in any procedure, and, while our Green and Socialist Members reject Bulgaria and Romania as safe states, they nonetheless want them to accede to the EU in a few months’ time. That is inherently contradictory. Moreover, in the original version of his report, Mr Kreissl-Dörfler went as far as to demand that criminals for whom an arrest warrant had been issued should be granted asylum before they were arrested. He also, citing cultural sensitivities, rejected the fingerprinting of asylum-seekers, even though that is often the only way to positively identify those who have arrived without papers, and that would make it virtually impossible to determine whether a person had applied for asylum in more than one Member State. To Mr Kreissl-Dörfler I have to say that the adoption of his report in its present form would, in my view, be a disservice to many serious applicants for asylum.

 Mr President, Mr Clarke, Vice-President Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, many of our Member States had, and are still having, problems with terrorist attacks. In Germany, we had the Red Army Fraction, Ireland has the IRA, and Spain ETA, all of which tried to pursue their objectives by means of violence. The attacks they carried out were cruel and lacking any justification, but the acts of terrorism we have seen so far were carried out for reasons of history or ideology and limited to one country or one region. The ‘9/11’ events in the United States gave terrorism a wholly new dimension, and it acquired an unequivocally European one with the attacks in Madrid on 11 March and in London on 7 July. The conflict is no longer a merely national one; the Western world faces a massive threat. What the atrocities in London showed was that the perpetrators do not pass through porous borders in order to carry out terrorist acts in Europe. They are people living among us, who have taken our nationalities, attended our schools, people who go out to work and appear to be part of our society. These were not people who were denied opportunities by being on the fringes of our society. To all outward appearance, they were inconspicuous members of it, but they evidently did not feel any attachment to our lifestyles and values. Far from it; these terrorists set out to kill indiscriminately as a means of turning Europe, our values and our lives upside down. Some of them had been living in our midst, as our neighbours, for years or even decades. That does not mean, though, that they were living with us. The attacks on London in particular showed that the idea of the ‘melting-pot society’ has failed. Tolerance, when misconceived as ‘do as you like’, does not result in a colourful and fruitful, tolerant and open, mix of cultures, lifestyles and opinions. What this misconceived tolerance does produce is parallel societies, groups to which we have no access, about whose activities we have scarcely any idea, and which function within our society with the aim of destroying it. That is why there must be a response to this threat by the Member States and the European Union as a whole, using not only legislation but also the machinery of law enforcement. Together and in cooperation with each other, we must protect our citizens. There is a need for rigorous measures at European level, which need to be transposed at national level without delay, thoroughly and purposefully. One of the measures we have already adopted is the European Arrest Warrant, the purpose of which is to extradite criminals from one Member State to another quickly and with relatively little red tape. That can help to put terrorists and those behind them out of action more quickly. In Germany, though, this essentially good European measure has proved a failure. The courts were obliged to set at liberty a German of Syrian origin who was suspected of involvement in the terrorist attack in Madrid. You may well ask why. It was not for lack of any anti-terrorist legislation in Germany. The current red and green Federal Government made such a botched job of implementing the European Arrest Warrant that German law had to give way to the German supreme court, with the result that a terrorist suspect had to be released from custody and the Spanish authorities can no longer prosecute him. What this shows is that mistakes made in one Member State can affect the security of people in all the others. If what happened in Madrid or London is not to be repeated elsewhere, integration into our society has to be taken seriously. The right of permanent residence should be made conditional on a desire to really immigrate and the willingness to adopt a new manner of life, new forms and standards in a new homeland. We have to make it clear that European society offers human rights, democracy, freedom, the equality of men and women, concern for our neighbours, social justice and much more, while, on the other hand, requiring people to adopt our democratic values, our conception of freedom and of its defence. While action in the spheres of policy-making, the law and the criminal justice system are necessary, a European consciousness and sense of European identity must come into being to unite us, not merely economically as an economic and currency union, but as a community of values. We must have something to set against ideologies that tend towards extremism and radicalism and find their ultimate expression in terrorist acts and suicide bombings, and that something is a society whose citizens live together and stand by each other because they live in a society that they share, that is worth living in and worth working for, and in the construction of which they had – and have – a part.

 I am much obliged to the Commissioner for the detailed written reply to the question which has now been provided. As the Commissioner has just said, the German visa decree of 26 October 2004 warrants further clarification, especially on the subjects of false statements by visa applicants and false documents. Since the Commissioner has also stated very clearly that there is no scope for national provisions in the Common Consular Instructions on Visas, I should like to know whether the 2006 revised version will put an end to this once and for all.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the framework decision on certain procedural rights in criminal proceedings within the European Union, which we are discussing today, is – according to the Council – to be limited to cases in which the European Arrest Warrant applies. That was – and still is – the view taken by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. As the rapporteur, right up to the vote in the relevant committee, persisted in maintaining the view that the framework decision – in contrast to what the Council proposed – should also apply to persons charged with terrorist offences, my group voted against the report in committee. Mrs Buitenweg has worked very hard over the past weeks to put together a compromise proposal capable of being endorsed by all the groups. I am very glad that she did so and wish to thank her for her efforts. Speaking as I do on its behalf, I can say that the PPE-DE Group will support Mrs Buitenweg’s report, subject to the condition that the plenary votes to reject the former amendment to recital 8 and instead votes by a majority to endorse the new proposal from the Group of the Greens. What this means is that the provisions proposed will not tend to hamper those special measures included in national legislation, and currently in force, in order to combat certain serious and complex forms of crime, terrorism in particular. To this is added the requirement that the measures to which I refer must be in line with the European Convention on Human Rights and with the Charter of Fundamental Rights. I can tell the Members of the Socialist Group that it follows that these boundaries are not being transgressed, and that the compromise proposal does all that they have required.

 Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, if you ask the citizens of our Member States what is important to them in their daily lives, the need for security is top of their list of priorities. People judge whether the Commission and this Parliament are successful or not on the basis of whether we can offer them security in their own country, in their own homes, and in Europe. On behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party, I therefore very much welcome the proposed strategic guidelines and basic principles, and the priorities that have been set. I would, however, like to take this opportunity to point out that political will and practical implementation are often not the same thing. The improved monitoring and surveillance of our enlarged Europe’s external borders are within the scope of the tasks outlined by the Commission, and in this it has our wholehearted support, but one thing that will be crucial in terms of its success will be whether or not the Council will once and for all resolve the issue of where the Borders Agency is to be based, thereby enabling it to start functioning. When it comes to effective controls, the introduction of European passports and visa documents that are proof against counterfeiting and falsification would be a good starting point, as would the inclusion of biometric data in these documents. Progress must also be made with operational cooperation by police forces in a Europe with open internal borders. What is needed is European machinery rather than national measures; on that, this House agrees with the Commission, but the Council has for over a year been unable to agree on a new head for Europol. Whilst assuring the Commission and its President that we are alongside them in this, I would appeal to the Council to again give its attention to the points I have enumerated.

 Mr President, Commissioner Frattini, members of the Council, over 50 years ago, the thought of peace for the people of a continent wrecked by two world wars was the one thing motivating the founding fathers of this European Union of ours – men such as Schuman, Monnet and Adenauer, and I wish they could be present in this House at this moment today, when Members from 25 Member States remember those liberated 60 years ago from the German Nazi death camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau. Today, we commemorate all the Jews, Roma, homosexuals, Poles and people of other nationalities who were murdered there and in other camps. Speaking here today as a German Member of this House, I am well aware of the deeds committed by Germans in the name of my people over 60 years ago. I face up to the responsibility that devolves upon my people and my generation as a result of them. Our joining together today to remember the suffering, our joining together in calling for remembrance – not only of the concentration and extermination camps, but also of the crimes committed in them – that alone can serve as a warning to future generations that genocide has its roots in contempt for others, in hatred, anti-Semitism, racism and totalitarianism. We, the representatives of the citizens of this united European Union, are united in condemning every kind of intolerance and incitement to racial hatred, particularly all anti-Semitic acts and manifestations and all acts of violence motivated by hatred or intolerance for other religions or races. We likewise condemn attacks on religious sites, places and shrines belonging to Jews, Christians, Muslims or other faith communities, as well as all acts of violence committed against minorities. All of us, then, must work to promote cooperation and dialogue between the various groups in society, boldly and publicly denouncing intolerance, discrimination and racism. Neither today nor in the future must we forget our history or seek to shut the door on it. Our founding fathers faced up to the history that was theirs and is ours. They met together as a small band, with the aim of creating a Europe that would be peaceful, free, democratic and secure. Today it is for us, in greater numbers, to continue the work on this responsible task. Let us show ourselves worthy of it, capable of enabling this continent to grow through the twenty-first century in peace and diversity; for and with those who live now and will live in the future, and remembering those who did not live to see a peaceful Europe.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the short time I have in which to speak, I will limit myself to one important demand in the area of freedom, security and justice, that being for discrimination of every kind to be combated. In his report, Mr Bourlanges is right to demand that the Charter of Fundamental Rights be made the pillar of future policy and, to quote him, that they – that is, the fundamental rights – should be ‘applied everywhere and at all times with the same rigour’. In the case of many Members of this House, however, these lofty principles fail them when it comes to decisions at home. Freedom of opinion? – yes, that is self-evident, but the opinion must accord with the views of the Member in question. If not, then the dissidents can expect, at least, to be banned from any participation in the work of the European Union. They are then left, at best – if I may use our President, Mr Borrell’s words – to look after beetroots. Freedom of religion? – of course; it is one of our fundamental freedoms, but you should, if at all possible, be a Shintoist, a Confucian, a Moslem, a Buddhist or a Wahhabi. If you are a Christian, or a Catholic, then Social Democrats, Liberals, Greens and Communists will declare that such antiquated thinking makes you incapable of implementing the values of the European Union. Anti-discrimination? You are allowed to be incapable, but not to be a Christian. If that is not discrimination, what is? It is a tragic irony that certain members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, while fondly imagining themselves to be a bulwark in defence of fundamental freedoms and rights, are at present treading these rights underfoot. Mr Bourlanges’ fine report should encourage us, for we may demand much, but it is for each of us as individuals to act in accordance with the standards we ourselves set. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports the one-off suspension of the 80% minimum usage rule for the take-off and landing rights at airports granted to airlines for the 2010 summer flight programme and thanks the rapporteur, Mr Costa, for his speedy and effective handling of this dossier. The suspension now makes it possible for airlines to scrap flights in line with falling demand beyond the planned minimum usage without losing their take-off and landing rights for the next season. In my opinion, this is justified as a one-off, for one period, as the Vice-President said, because there has been an unforeseeable collapse in passenger numbers due to the international financial and economic crisis and because airlines cannot yet predict how passenger numbers will develop in the future. The suspension also helps to protect the environment, as airlines might otherwise feel obliged to fly half-empty aircraft just to keep their slots. Mr President, Mr Vice-President, at the outset the PPE-DE Group rejected the regulation also proposed by you of empowering the Commission, without genuine codecision on the part of Parliament, to demand the suspension of the rule simply in the comitology procedure. We believe that, if you intend to make such a proposal for the winter flight plan, Parliament will have to examine it carefully, because we would have to consider the interests of the many different types of airlines as well as the interests of airports and passengers more carefully. It is ‘yes’ to a one-off suspension but ‘no’ to the possibility of extension without the involvement of Parliament. In all honesty, I believe that, with swine flu appearing not to be as virulent as first feared, airlines will ultimately have to be able to anticipate what possible passenger numbers and relations to expect over the coming years. We must expect airlines to submit realistic plans so that airports have the opportunity to offer unused slots to other airlines. It must be in our interests that airports be able to use their capacities in the best interests of their customers, the passengers. I have one other comment on the new, fundamental revision of the Slots Directive. I believe that the slots belong to the public and not to the airports or the airlines, and that is why we must pay particular attention to this in the future. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as this debate, this plenary session and my parliamentary activity draw to a close, allow me to extend my sincerest thanks to my colleagues on the Committee on Transport and Tourism and in the secretariat of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, as well as the chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism and the Vice-President of the Commission and his entire DG TREN team. We have spent the last five years working together in the interests of the citizens of the European Union. I will keep my fingers crossed for you that the next five years will bring more of the same. The Committee on Transport and Tourism is an important committee, and I thank you for your excellent cooperation.

Madam President, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats calls on the Government and the Communist Party of China to conduct the upcoming human rights dialogue in a constructive manner. This would significantly ease relations between the EU and China. We have a genuine interest in improving bilateral relations. However, this dialogue must be conducted honestly. We will therefore have to uphold our legitimate demands on China. In our view, the civil rights campaigner, Hu Jia, must be released immediately. Talks with the Dalai Lama, the religious leader of the Tibetans, must be resumed. The Chinese region of Tibet must be opened up to journalists and UN human rights experts. In my opinion, the People’s Republic of China demonstrated in the run-up to the Olympic Games that it could, for example, grant more press freedom while preserving the stability of the country. Now, it should have the courage to initiate reforms relating to re­education camps, the rights of defendants, the death penalty, religious freedom and freedom of assembly. It should genuinely tackle these human rights and hold talks with us.

Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, the statements of the Council and of the Commission on the preparation of the session of the European Council greatly disappointed those of us who are interested in transport. During the current global economic crisis in particular it is essential to adequately upgrade transport infrastructure – rail, roads, inland navigation, maritime navigation, ports and airports – and develop a forward­looking European transport policy with intelligent transport and logistics systems for the upturn in trade within the European Union and in imports and exports, which will hopefully soon take place. In addition, our citizens expect clear statements from the European Union as to how the volume of transport can be managed in an environmentally friendly way, not with dirigiste
 instruments, but market-based instruments. A good example of this is the introduction of the emissions trading scheme for aviation from 2012, which has just been concluded by the European institutions. However, other rules, for maritime navigation for example, are still lacking. We therefore need an environmentally compatible streamlining of transport policy. This subject is important, President-in-Office of the Council, because it is essential to discuss and agree upon similar solutions to the environmentally compatible streamlining of transport with the most important third states, like the US, Japan, but also Russia, China, India and Brazil. Only in this way can we achieve global environmental improvement. Only in this way can we avoid unilateral rules which distort competition to the cost of the European economy. My Group therefore appeals to the European Council – and I hope that the President-in-Office of the Council will take this up – to discuss and prepare at the next Council balanced approaches for global, environmentally friendly transport policies, ahead of the climate conference in Copenhagen. If we want to be successful in Copenhagen, we must also discuss an environmentally compatible transport policy.

Mr President, Vice-President of the Commission, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports the version of the amending directive, negotiated by the rapporteur with the Council, which introduces sanctions against ship-source pollution. We would like to congratulate him warmly on his work. We would also like to congratulate the Vice-President, because without the help of the Commission it would not have been possible to come to an agreement with the Council at the first reading. It is a big day for us, because we can complete this important dossier at the end of this period. We must always remember that the new regulations became necessary because the Court of Justice of the European Communities in its judgments from 2005 and 2007 has finally made it completely clear that legislation, including criminal law, is permitted on the basis of the first pillar. We need this legislation to protect the seas from ships and from the behaviour of captains, shipowners and others. Until now the civil liability legislation has simply not been dissuasive enough. It is much cheaper to discharge something illegally into the sea. Surely that cannot be right. Therefore, we need effective sanctions. I would like to thank the rapporteur for this three-way agreement, which has been reached between all three institutions. It is clear that serious ship-source pollution must be classified and punished as a criminal offence and minor ship-source pollution can be regarded a regulatory offence, so that there is a distinction between the seriousness of the two types of activity. However – and my third point is very important – repeated minor ship-source pollution should now be regarded as a criminal offence, because it contributes to the overall pollution of the oceans and that is not a trivial matter. We must send out clear signals in this respect and we call on the Member States – and I hope that someone will pass this call on to the Council – to implement and to apply this directive immediately. We can only protect our oceans by means of dissuasive criminal sanctions.

 Mr President, I should like to thank the Council and the Commission for their constructive cooperation with our Parliament’s rapporteur. As Commission Vice-President Tajani himself said, this is a very good example of how a good result can be achieved in a short space of time even on difficult dossiers. However, I cannot hide the fact that we are not overly happy with the cabotage regime. As the President-in-Office of the Council – and you, too, Vice-President – mentioned, it is intrinsically better, on environmental and economic grounds, to avoid unladen journeys in Europe. Therefore, it would be better if the cabotage restriction could be lifted altogether sooner rather than later. As an interim step, we are accepting three cabotage operations in seven days, but we are awaiting your report most eagerly, and hoping it will state that 2014 will mark the end of this restriction. After all, it is a trifling area for the transport sector, but one that wastes money and has adverse effects on the environment. Therefore, I hope that you will present a proper proposal in 2013, as a cabotage restriction is absurd in a European internal market of 27 countries. I should also like to thank the Council and the Commission for supporting us in the end on the reintroduction of the 12-day rule for buses and coaches. This is very important for the bus and coach industry, which, in many countries, consists of small and medium-sized enterprises, as the introduction of two drivers on such trips – which are mostly for senior citizens – has caused problems for SMEs. We are pleased that this expires in six months’ time. It must be understood that there are many people, particularly older people, who do not like flying but would still like to travel as tourists in Europe and perhaps enjoy the sun in places such as Italy or Spain, hence the importance of our reintroducing the 12-day rule for buses and coaches and making it affordable and thus possible for senior citizens to travel. This is a great success for us, for bus and coach companies and for passengers, and so I am much obliged to the Council and the Commission.

 Mr President, Vice-President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, I wish to say to the previous speaker that we have the Greek islands and Greek ferry companies in view at all times: he need have no worries on that score. I can say that my group and I are pleased that, for the first time, we are to have statutory, citizen-focused passenger rights in the event of delays and cancellations also in maritime and inland waterway transport and regional bus and coach transport. We should like to thank the two rapporteurs, Mr Albertini and Mr Teychenné. We enjoyed constructive cooperation in the committees, which produced good results. There are just a few points on which I should like to expand. I think that 25% compensation for maritime passengers for two to three hours’ delay is perfectly appropriate, as is 50% for delays of over three hours – but I would say to Mr Teychenné that 100% compensation for delays in excess of this is simply excessive. If we bear in mind that shipping services are provided not only by colossal undertakings but also, particularly in the case of ferry operators, by small and medium-sized enterprises, we must take a reasonable approach to compensation. As we have already discussed, we must also be careful not to place responsibility with the wrong people or institutions in maritime transport. All of us in this House are engaged in ensuring that both dossiers provide assistance for passengers with reduced mobility, in particular, but shipowners cannot deal with access difficulties at ports; ports themselves must do this. In other words, we must take great care. As regards the rights of bus and coach passengers, I should like to point out that there are real differences between intercity and urban buses that must be taken into account. Therefore, my group is of the opinion that we are right to call for reasonable passenger rights in intercity bus and coach transport, but that urban and suburban buses operate under completely different conditions. These rules are out of place there, and this should be clearly recognised.

Madam President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen and those still in the gallery, especially Mr Lübbering. My group supports the Commission’s fundamental concern of increasing rail freight traffic by creating cross-border traffic corridors and special regulations for the purpose. Mr Vice-President, we thank you not only for the proposal; we also thank you for the fact that you have stayed the course until just before midnight tonight, but we like to work. Thank you. Moreover, and there may have been a slip of the tongue in the announcement of your Commission proposal, our group, together with our good rapporteur, is firmly convinced that there should be no absolute priority for freight trains over all other trains, just easier access for freight traffic, because in almost all the Member States rail networks are used both by freight trains and by international, national, regional and local trains. In cases of operational disruptions in particular, we cannot have some distant office making decisions; competence must remain with the individual infrastructure operators and railway companies, so that normal train traffic can be resumed as quickly and as efficiently as possible. Even within the special regulation for the European freight rail network, the Member States must continue to be responsible for creating and changing freight corridors. Any sort of transfer of competence to the European Commission would not be helpful, on that we should agree. Finally, railway companies, shippers and forwarding agents should be consulted on corridor regulations, because they have practical knowledge and experience about how to make the most effective use of the rail network for competitive freight traffic. My congratulations once again to the rapporteur. He has written an excellent report which was adopted in committee with great satisfaction for the most part. My thanks to the rapporteur.

 Madam President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, we should all be very grateful to Mr Marinescu. In a very short time, he has succeeded in coming to an agreement with the European Council with the support of the Vice-President of the Commission. This second package of legislation will allow us to manage our airspace more efficiently in the years to come. It will also enable the airlines and in the end the consumers to save up to EUR 3 billion and to cut CO2
 emissions by up to 12%. These are important objectives in terms of costs, the consumer and the environment, which are now within our grasp. In the first of the two regulations, the Member States undertake finally to do what they should have done years ago, which is to establish functional airspace blocks within a short time. These blocks of airspace, which are no longer divided up along national boundaries, but instead according to functional flows of air traffic, will allow airspace to be managed more efficiently and more safely and will help to prevent unnecessary holding stacks in the sky. I am very grateful for the Commission’s support and for the rapporteur’s determination to appoint a European coordinator for the functional airspace blocks, because we will have problems in ensuring that the Member States really do establish these new blocks. It is important that a coordinator working on behalf of Parliament and the Commission will be able to press for these new blocks to be created. It is also important that military airspace management is integrated into this system and that we have a genuine master plan for the single European sky, which applies and implements the technological results of the air traffic control research project SESAR. Finally, it is also important for us that the European Aviation Safety Agency is given the task of implementing the standards and management activities for airports, air traffic management and air navigation services. This organisation must be provided with the staff and equipment it needs in good time. We are very much in favour, and I hope that the Commission will support us in this, of the EASA consulting with the relevant areas of industry with regard to practical solutions in all its new activities, so that really effective solutions can be found.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, without a doubt we Christian Democrats recognise the sovereignty of the People’s Republic of China over its territory, including Tibet. However, at the same time we reject China’s view that any statement from the European Union regarding human rights in China constitutes impermissible interference in China’s internal affairs. According to a modern understanding of human rights and international law – which hopefully China will also soon share – the international community is required express concern about human rights in all parts of the world, particularly in very blatant cases. How else could an International Criminal Tribunal take action against the crimes against humanity in the countries of the former Yugoslavia and pass judgment if it did not have the right to intervene for the sake of human rights? The People’s Republic of China and its government should therefore recognise that the discussion of human rights such as the freedom of assembly, the freedom of an independent press, religious freedom and the rights of cultural minorities in Tibet and in other parts of China does not constitute impermissible interference. It must face up to this discussion. Our main concern today, however, is simply the plea – and I cannot therefore understand Mr Ford in this regard, although he has always been more on the side of the Chinese government – for the People’s Republic of China and its government to resume talks with the Dalai Lama as leader of a large proportion of the Tibetan people. To be honest – as my fellow Member has already said –the government did hold these talks last year, but broke them off after the Olympic Games. We are forced to suspect then that these talks were only conducted during the Olympic Games to divert our attention. However, Mr Ford, we will not allow our attention to be diverted. We will place this matter on the agenda time and again and we call on the Chinese Government to enter into real and serious talks with the Dalai Lama, as human rights are still being violated in Tibet and we must ensure that this situation changes.

 Thank you very much, Mr President, thank you very much, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me, first of all, to thank all the rapporteurs on behalf of my group, not only for their work itself, but also for the fact that we have achieved what we set out to do, namely to treat the proposals as a package. By treating them as a package, we forced the Council to move towards us as you know that the Council most definitely did not want to adopt two proposals. Only by standing together did we manage to get the Council to take on these two dossiers, and we succeeded. I share the view of the Vice-President that this package is a great success for the citizens. That is something we should say in the election campaign, too. Looking around, there are not that many Members here for this debate this afternoon, despite the fact that putting this package together was one of the greatest achievements of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. The citizens perhaps do not understand, sometimes, why we sit for so long and why everything takes so long. Here, however, they can see, that this package consists of regulations on monitoring, regulations on classification societies, accident investigations, insurance obligations, liability regulations, on port State control and flag State control. We need to tighten up the requirements for all these different aspects in order, where possible, to prevent accidents and, where accidents do happen, to be able to react quickly. Mr Sterckx, I would like to offer my particular thanks to you once again, as you were the rapporteur in the special committee that I had the honour of chairing, and we met again after the Prestige
 sinking to consider what we still needed to improve. Through Mr Barrot, the Commission essentially adopted our proposals and we actually finalised them through the legislative process. To that extent, we can be really pleased to be able to agree the third maritime package after all these years. Let me make two more points, however. The first is that we should thank Dominique Bussereau who, as a French minister, in the end pushed the package over the final hurdles, enabling it to succeed. We should give him particular credit for that. Mr Vice-President, all eyes are on you, now! You, the Commission, with your fine European Maritime Safety Agency, must now ensure that the Member States also implement and apply this. It is only when what we have decided is actually applied that we will be able to succeed in preventing the recurrence of accidents like those of the Erika
 and the Prestige
. We should be fighting together to achieve that. Thank you very much.

 Mr President, as we close this debate having thanked Vice-Presidents Barrot and Tajani and the French Presidency, and specifically Mr Bussereau, we should also thank those who work on the Conciliation Committee and the Committee on Transport and Tourism who have been working with us on this for a number of years. They have played their part in making possible the success that we have achieved and for that I ask that we thank them.

 Mr President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by saying that the mobility of people and goods is quite simply of key importance to citizens’ quality of life, growth and employment, the social and territorial cohesion of the European Union and for trade with third countries. That is why the European Community quite simply needs an infrastructure that meets its needs and equitable transport rules for all modes of transport. Given that transport also has negative consequences for people and the environment, it must, of course, be further greened, in order, also, to play its role in fighting climate change. However, I have to tell you, Mr Vice-President, that what you put forward to us as a basis document on the greening of transport was a little too sparse. I am sorry to say that there is no consistent overall plan and you leave everything open – everything is palmed off on subsidiarity. If you say that we have to green transport, that must apply throughout the European Union and cannot be made subject to the wishes of the Member States. It must then apply to everything from the railways to marine transport. You cannot just pick out road transport – and, in fact, specifically only goods vehicle traffic – and then say ‘we will leave it up to the Member States to decide whether or not they want to have road tolls.’ If you want a fundamental change, you need to put forward an integrated plan for all means of transport – and that is something we made very clear in the committee. Then, however, you also have to do that with scientifically-based impact assessments that take account of the consequences for competition amongst means of transport, mobility costs and the competitiveness of Europe. The second communication, on the internalisation of external costs, is another example of the compartmentalisation under your system, proposing something and yet not proposing it. As regards the internalisation of external costs, you again set out a great big handbook that provides a multiplicity of ways to perform calculations, but then, in the end, you say ‘we will calculate according to a flat-rate value.’ No one on earth could understand that. You also fail to take account of the contributions already made by the various means of transport, be it in the form of general taxation, petroleum tax or vehicle tax. You know, it is the same story with the Eurovignette. My group agrees with the other groups that exhaust emissions and noise should be taken account of in the external costs and in the charging thereof. Congestion, though? Mr Vice-President, congestion is caused by an insufficient provision of infrastructure by the Member States. To give the Member States money for managing their own shortcomings would be downright madness. What is more, you are very much aware of the fact that companies have long borne the costs of congestion, as it leads to higher wage costs and higher fuel costs. With that in mind, it must be said, Mr El Khadraoui, that it makes no sense to internalise the costs of congestion – quite the opposite, in fact. We must attempt to get rid of this congestion through the prudent upgrading of infrastructure and the deployment of intelligent transport information systems, yet we must not burden businesses, already struggling with rising costs, with additional costs in the form of road tolls. There is no point in that. Mr Vice-President, your communication on noise protection measures on the railways is positive, in principle. As the man on the English-speaking street says, though, ‘Where’s the beef?’
 What are you actually proposing? You say there are many options. No, you are the Commission! You have the right and the duty to put forward proposals that we can then implement. That is why the Committee on Transport and Tourism is calling on you to actually table a proposal for a directive on the introduction of noise-related track access charges so that, by re-investing the money collected by means of such track access charges in the railway companies – including private companies – we will be able to help see new noise-reducing brakes actually installed. All of us in this House have a clear goal and that is that noise pollution by the railways must be eradicated. We want to promote the railways, but then their journey through the serene Rhine valley must also be effected in an environmentally sound manner. So help us do this – propose something really tangible!
 Georg Jarzembowski,  
rapporteur.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me, as we close this debate, to add two comments. The first I address to Mr Evans. My group is in favour of the internalisation of external costs, and specifically exhaust emissions and noise. We believe this is reasonable. Yet, if you always put the polluter pays principle first – I am prepared to discuss this with you – then it is the Member States that cause the congestion by not providing sufficient infrastructure. The goods vehicles drive into congestion, 80% of which is made up of cars. To make businesses pay for congestion caused by the Member States is nonsensical. If you applied the polluter pays principle, Member States would have to give extra money to the goods vehicle owners as it is the States that cause the congestion by failing to provide adequate infrastructure in time. We are in agreement that there does not always have to be additional infrastructure. Another way to prevent congestion is through intelligent traffic systems. There are lots of modern technologies capable of preventing congestion. To say, however, we have congestion, so the goods vehicles must pay for it, gives the Member States no incentive to remove the congestion, as to do so would cost them revenue. That, surely, cannot be right! Mr Vice-President, you were right to say that you did not want to introduce new taxes by means of this proposal and you insisted on ring-fencing. Can we agree, then, Commissioner, Mr Vice-President, that, when the Council of Ministers fails to come out in favour of a clear ring-fencing of the revenue from the Eurovignettes, you will withdraw the proposal? You see, you said you do not want any new taxes. I completely agree with you that if the Eurovignette is to be made more expensive as a result of exhaust emissions and noise, this extra money must also be used to reduce the environmental impact of road transport and not to fill holes in the finance ministers’ budgets. That is not on. With that in mind, I hope that you will stick to your position, in other words, no taxation without ring-fencing and withdrawal of the proposal where that is the case. Thank you very much.

 Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats welcomes the agreement of the Council and Parliament in the trialogue not to extend the new rules for the revision of the general emissions trading scheme (ETS) to air traffic, but to leave it to new, not yet published special rules for air traffic. The special ETS rules for air traffic, which Parliament and the Council agreed on in summer and which will come into effect on 1 January 2012, are the first worldwide rules to include air traffic in an emissions trading scheme and thereby require airlines to limit the effect of air traffic on the environment. That is right. The consequences, namely the costs to airlines, airports and ultimately to passengers, who are in worldwide competition, are just barely tolerable, on the basis of the regulations that we agreed in the summer. More stringent rules via the new general ETS rules would not only be unjustified, but would have brought European airlines into extreme financial difficulties. To that extent, we are grateful to you, Parliament and Council. It is also right because the special ETS rules for air traffic give us opportunities to negotiate absolutely equivalent rules with third countries, and so avoid worldwide conflicts, as such worldwide conflicts could lead to retaliatory measures against European airlines. Quite honestly, global solutions, or at the very least partial solutions, aimed at sensible environmental protection with respect to air traffic in the world are always better than excessively stringent regulations that apply only in the EU. To that extent, we are very satisfied. You are aware that in 2014 the special rules for the ETS for air traffic will be reassessed anyway. I am therefore grateful to the rapporteur, Mrs Doyle, and the French Presidency – were it to listen – that they have excluded air traffic. That was a correct decision that will enable us to move forward. Thank you very much!

Madam President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I think that the previous speaker has simply not understood the dossier. What we are doing here is laying down rules for transparent provisions governing the levying of airport charges, the purpose of the whole exercise being to ensure that airport charges are set objectively and to reduce them for the benefit of users. That is our job. There are in fact two different situations. Some airports are so dominant that airlines basically face a monopoly situation and possibly pay overly high airport charges. At other, possibly small airports, an airline can decide whether or not to use the airport on the basis of how low the airport charges are, which is a totally different situation. I must therefore say that what Mr Stockmann has achieved in his report – and my thanks to him – is a good list of criteria for establishing correct, properly substantiated airport charges, which also have to be borne by passengers, with a national supervisory authority acting as the control body. Mr Vice-President, you will, of course, have to ensure over the next two years that the national supervisory authorities truly are independent. This means that national supervisory authorities must not be linked to airports or married to airlines. We insist that the supervisory authorities strike a fair balance between airlines and airports for the benefit of users. Secondly, using these new criteria, we also want to foster fairer competition between airports. In some cases, there are airports in two different Member States just a few kilometres from the border between them. We want to be sure that there is no unfair competition here. I believe that the new criteria are correct. Allow me to close with a question to you, Mr Vice-President. I believe that nearly two years have passed since the Commission issued guidelines for regional airports. Over the last few months, you have been investigating whether there have been illegal subsidies at some airports, by which I mean state subsidies for specific airports that distort competition. We should all like to know what your conclusions were. We hope that you can promise us today that you will present the investigation on illegal or legal regional aid soon, because there is one overriding issue here: we want fair competition between airports for the benefit of passengers.

 Mr President, Madam Vice-President, I would like to water down, if only slightly, the praise you have received from the House, at least as far as the issue of passenger rights is concerned. We urge the Commission to submit a comprehensive package of proposals for passenger rights throughout the transport sector. It is gratifying that we already have passenger rights in the air transport industry, although these require urgent review, given that a number of airlines are not applying the relevant regulation in the way that we would wish. This year, we have also agreed a package of passenger rights for rail users, to be implemented next year. However, Madam Commissioner, it was announced that passenger rights for people taking long-distance buses would be introduced, and a debate about passenger rights for ferry services has already started. We do not see either of these proposed measures included in the work programme. We need these proposals, as we want to have passenger rights for the entire transport sector, for we agree with the Commission: if we want to put the citizen first, one of the best ways of doing this is to introduce passenger rights that apply right across the transport sector. The second point which I would briefly like to mention is this: we hope that the Commission will implement the planned traffic management systems as envisaged. Specifically, this means SESAR for a s
ingle European sky and ERTMS as the single European Railway Traffic Management System. With these systems, Madam Vice-President, we are not only making transport safer and cheaper, we are also helping to protect the environment. You therefore have our full support for the rapid deployment of these systems.

Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I am pleased to note the common ground – there is actually a great deal – that has emerged in the debate so far. Our French Council representative, our friend, has said he is of the opinion that we shall still be able to reach agreement by the end of the year. Yes indeed, let us reach that agreement! I should also like to thank the Vice-Presidents for the support of the Commission during the discussions between the rapporteurs and the French Council Presidency. President-in-Office, we wish to acknowledge that you and your colleagues have already made great progress in the individual discussions on the six dossiers. We are very much on the right track but – and I also say this to you to support your reluctant colleagues in the Council – there is either one package or no package. I therefore hope that you will make progress in the two dossiers that are still unresolved at the next Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council meeting on 9 November. These are not unimportant dossiers. I do not wish to delve into the details of the civil liability of shipowners, but I do consider it particularly important in the case of the flag States. It is evident, however, that, despite all their professions to have maritime safety and the safety of seafarers, of passengers and of coastal waters in mind at all times, Member States are shying away from ratifying and implementing very specific obligations or even just the IMO resolutions on maritime protection. If we want these flag State obligations to become established, if we – Parliament and the Commission – want to be able to put pressure on the Member States – in court if necessary – to fulfil their obligations under the IMO Convention on maritime protection and the protection of coastal populations, the Member States recoil. Although there are good people who fulfil their flag State obligations, there are some who are very reluctant to comply with the inspection by Parliament and the Commission to ensure they are fulfilling their flag State obligations. This is unacceptable. We had the disasters of the Prestige 
and the Erika
, and my fellow Members have also pointed out the disasters of recent times. We are beholden to people and to the natural environment to ensure that flag States, in particular, fulfil their obligations. It is bizarre. In Mrs Vlasto’s sound report, we talk about port State control, which, in theory, is our way of checking the safety of third-country ships anchoring at our shores. We therefore inspect ships from third countries, but the Member States fear being subjected to the obligation to be checked to ensure they as flag States are fulfilling their duties with regard to ships’ safety. This is unacceptable. In this respect, I should like to encourage the President-in-Office effectively to win the majority over on 9 October. I say ‘majority’, President-in-Office, because it could be, if I am not completely wrong, that majority decisions are possible in the transport dossier. You may perhaps have to break through the esprit de corps
 in the Council – if an individual is reluctant, the others will not push him – because this concerns the safety of the natural environment and people and we shall have to reach a majority decision if need be. I appeal to you to carry on. We are proud of you – you have fought well in the Council to date. Please pass on the following message to the Council: we are behind you, and we are ready and willing to achieve good results together with the French Presidency. However, some do need to budge – including the German Government. Let us all fight together on this!

 Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commission Vice-President, I completely agree with the Vice-President’s statements. We have to differentiate between the straits where there are responsible countries with whom we can cooperate on cracking down on piracy, and the maritime operations where there is no responsible country, for example in Somalia, where we have to do something ourselves. President-in-Office, I thought what you said was, in all honesty, rather too little. Setting up and deploying a crisis unit is always a good thing to do, but it does nothing to help. The crisis unit is here in Brussels or somewhere else. What we need is a concerted maritime operation locally, with the ships from the EU Member States that are already there. We have to appeal to the Member States who do not yet have any ships there to take part in a joint marine operation. We cannot allow a situation where two pirate mother ships sail happily along on these waters attacking our fishing and merchant vessels and we are for ever having to run round after them and watch to see how we can bring this under control. I am waiting to hear what my general has to say, who will be here in a short while, but we need a clear strategic and tactical assessment of the situation here, and we need enough manpower capable of controlling piracy, as appeals simply do nothing to help. We have to hunt down the pirates, we have to catch them, otherwise it will not work. Ninety per cent of Europe’s imports, on which we depend, arrive via maritime routes. We have a high level of responsibility for seafarers, for fishermen fishing off foreign coasts, in accordance with jointly agreed treaties, and we have to protect these fishermen and seafarers, and also tourists. Unfortunately, in areas where there is no governmental authority, this only works if we develop our own European activities on the basis of UN resolutions. In this respect, President-in-Office, it is good to set up a crisis unit, but we are expecting to see a well-defined operations base and well-defined operations during the next stage.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what Mr Simpson has just said is really quite abstruse; indeed, he turns the whole matter on its head. There are certain industries which attempt to block legislation in the interests of their companies. May I say this: with this code of conduct, our intention is to improve consumers' rights. We need to strengthen consumer rights so that we get fair offers from the computerised systems. We vigorously reject these delaying tactics on the part of the Socialists, who are attempting to wreck the compromise with the French Government and bring about its collapse during this legislative term. I would urge you to reject the referral back to committee.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Kirkhope, most sincerely. He has presented a very balanced report and has worked very closely with the shadow rapporteurs. His version, which he has negotiated with the French Presidency, affords consumers better protection against dubious flight and rail offers based on clear regulations on transparency and at the same time ensures fair competition between rail companies and airlines. Incidentally, the recast version documents the fact that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats as the first group had rightly stopped the Commission’s attempt in 2005 to abolish this regulation as obsolete. We need it – and we shall prove it by the way we vote – to protect consumers. Even if more and more travellers do in fact reserve their tickets directly with the airlines or on the Internet, the majority of consumers will continue to rely on their travel agencies, which for their part must be able to rely on non-discriminatory, genuine bargain offers in the computerised reservation system. The prices indicated must in future include all taxes and charges so that the travel agencies can pass genuinely transparent and comparable offers on to the consumer. The parent companies should also be subject to tighter regulations on transparency and competition in future in order that the systems are prevented from making preferential offers to the disadvantage of other airlines and to the disadvantage of consumers. I must come back here to the rapporteur and appeal to my fellow Members. I believe the version we have agreed with the French Presidency in relation to parent companies offers adequate protection against positive discrimination in favour of certain airlines. Any change made by the famous amendment to Amendment 48 is therefore totally superfluous and if this goes through tomorrow, it would delay the adoption of the whole thing or even call it into question. I appeal to you to take a clear, final decision tomorrow in order to protect consumers.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my group supports the own-initiative report by the Committee on Transport and Tourism with its multifaceted proposals for freight transport in Europe. The framework conditions for environmentally friendly freight transport tailored to suit market needs are crucial for growth and employment in the European Union. I must also say, however, that the European Union and the Member States are being called upon to increase their efforts considerably in developing and upgrading efficient transport structures. We shall be reminding the Commission of this when we carry out the mid-term review of finances. Making grand speeches does not help if the money is not made available to upgrade the trans-European networks. Upgrading the transport infrastructures applies in particular to rail transport. The priority here is to upgrade the most heavily used rail corridors and equip them with the ERTMS cross-border European rail traffic control system so that we quickly shift freight transport from road to rail. However, to tell you the truth, Commissioner, when you compiled the list of proposals for freight services – I still remember that Neil Kinnock had already had the idea of separate rail networks for freight transport – you were once again acting on the Commission’s proposal ‘Towards a rail network giving priority to freight’. Since that time nobody at the Commission has been talking about this because you and we know that there is not enough money to provide a second rail network alongside a normal, sensibly developed system tailored to suit market needs. As the Commission you should therefore be telling the truth: the idea of separate freight networks is dead. Let us develop sensible, dual-use networks: primarily passenger trains by day and primarily freight trains by night. We then have to resolve the problem of noise because in cities in Germany and elsewhere, and along the Rhine, the noise at night really gets on citizens’ nerves and stops them sleeping. Therefore, let us talk about practical sound-proofing measures on the railways, on the trans-European networks and on the dual use of the rail network. It is even more important, however, that we take sensible action on the logistics. That, Mr Cramer, is mentioned all too little in the report. It is important that the Member States and the EU work more effectively together with industry and the service enterprises in order to make better use of the freight logistics. The use of logistics is, of course, a primary task of the enterprises. They know best how logistics are used. However, the European Union and the Member States can help by lifting unnecessary national restrictions and – this I fully concede to Mr Cramer – by providing standard customs documents, for example, in order that better use can be made of the logistics. Let us therefore upgrade the infrastructure nationally and let us cooperate with the industry in determining the best use of transport logistics.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not believe that Mr Landsbergis has actually read the resolution that we have adopted with a two-thirds majority. If he had, he would know that we mention the insupportable situation in Tibet four times and call on the Chinese Government to respect human rights and cultural rights in Tibet. Mr Landsbergis, do not tell untruths. The vast majority of us – that is, the majority of this Parliament – have spoken up for human rights and for the cultural autonomy of Tibet.

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, my Group wishes to refer first of all to the resolution on the natural disaster in China and on the situation in Tibet that the European Parliament adopted by a large majority on 22 May of this year. The PPE-DE Group hails the dedicated commitment of the Chinese Government to the reconstruction of the areas hit by the earthquake. At the same time, however, we expect the Chinese Government to ensure that the new houses and other new buildings are built to withstand earth tremors, for we must remember the sad fact that structural defects led to the collapse of many schools and that many pupils lost their lives. We expect this matter to be investigated and those responsible to be called to account. Die PPE-DE Group notes with grave concern that the Chinese Government has not yet taken the opportunity offered by the organisation of the Olympic Games to improve respect for universal human rights in China. On the country, intimidation of Chinese citizens and restrictions on representatives of the media appear to be even more prevalent in the run-up to the Olympics. For this reason we call on the Chinese Government to establish universal civil rights, particularly freedom of the press, in time for the Olympic Games and to continue to guarantee them thereafter. (Applause)
 Lastly, the PPE-DE Group calls on the Chinese Government to show goodwill in the current talks with the Dalai Lama and to bring them to a positive conclusion, which should include provision for the cultural autonomy of Tibet. We would deem it unacceptable if the Chinese Government were to use these talks to tide itself over the period of the Olympic Games, only to have them break down afterwards. We expect an outcome that boosts cultural autonomy and human rights in Tibet. (Applause)

 Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Liese, most sincerely for what has been achieved. There are two aspects to this: firstly there is the well-balanced and successful outcome of the negotiations between Parliament and the Council, but secondly we also have a balanced result as far as the environmental lobby and the interests of the transport industry and commercial sector are concerned, and we can see that this is a very complex set of issues. I am particularly pleased that we have agreed on 2012 as the date for introducing the scheme. This gives us an opportunity to make progress in our negotiations with third countries. I would at this point make an appeal to you, Commissioner: we cannot simply take the position that we are right and everyone else should follow us, for then we shall have other countries taking retaliatory measures against our airlines. This is not on. We should not be sacrificing the airlines, and the European airports too because of the translocation effect, to a one-sided environment policy. I would also call on you to take seriously the task that the Council and Parliament have been set and to act quickly in the negotiations over the next few years. I admit that with America you can leave things until 2010, but with the other countries – such as Russia and China – we need to talk things through so that our non-integrated solution does not endanger our airlines and our airports with their many thousands and millions of employees. I am also pleased that things have been kept in balance, for we are in fact going back to the years 2004 to 2006 as the reference date for the allocation of certificates, but we have been very reasonable in setting the cap at 97% and 95% and by initially allocating 85% of the certificates free of charge, with only 15% to be put to auction. We thereby hope to achieve the intended effect of reducing the environmental burden imposed by the aviation industry. At the same time we shall be able to keep airline costs and passenger charges within reasonable bounds. Given the dramatic increase in the price of jet fuel we have to ensure that we balance the interests of our citizens between the environment on one hand and their transport and mobility needs on the other. For this reason I would once again congratulate the rapporteur on his achievement.

Madam President, Commissioner – and former colleague of mine – ladies and gentlemen, we could in fact almost have met in the committee room, but it is so nice to be with you all here. Let me begin by offering the rapporteur very warm thanks on behalf of my Group. Over the past weeks he has constantly fought about technical details and sought improvements. With the two amending directives that have now been agreed between the Council and Parliament we are improving rail safety and also have a chance to improve interoperability and advance towards our aim of actually shifting more freight from road to rail. I consider it most important that the new certification procedure, the mutual recognition of certification rules, will quite definitely reduce certification costs and, as a result, promote the Europe-wide use of rolling stock. At the same time, however – and that was one of the thorny issues for us and I thank the rapporteur for being so stubborn – we must ensure that the question of responsibility for wagon maintenance is resolved clearly and unambiguously. That is the only way we can expect our citizens to agree that wagons can be used across borders without extra controls and promote interoperability. I am also in favour of the Agency endeavouring to make progress with the ERTMS system and I agree with the rapporteur that the best is the enemy of the good. If we change version too quickly, we will probably find nobody going for it. So we must proceed carefully and cautiously in promoting the ERTMS version. We all love trains, especially historic trains. I am, therefore, glad that we have made it clear here that heritage and museum railways are exempt from all the technically difficult but generally necessary safety provisions. I hope our friends will hear and see us. We fully recognise the interests of museum railways.

Madam President, Commissioner, we all agree that we need to improve child protection during flights. The committee certainly agreed on that, otherwise the question would not have arisen in committee. I am also grateful to the Commission for starting on the preliminary work a long time ago. Therefore, we are now joining a debate that the Commission has already prepared. There are three questions that I hope the Commissioner can answer. He said that the technical data will be available in October. The question is: when will the Commission draw conclusions from that data, during this term or later? There are three very clear questions. The first concerns the best technical device for protecting children. The second question, once we have the answer to the first, is whether the European Union should work on a legislative basis or start by issuing recommendations. It is thus a question of whether to introduce binding European legislation. Then there is the question of whether we can manage to do that during this legislative term or whether we should start with recommendations and then move on to legislation. Then there is a third, thorny question, which is not raised in the oral question but that we and you must answer: who is to pay for it? That is a question that needs answering. Let us assume, as Mrs Lichtenberger suggested, that the rules required every small child to occupy a child seat. If that were so, the child would be taking up an adult’s seat, which raises the question: should we force parents to pay for an extra seat for their small children, or should we charge the safety costs to the community, so that all the other passengers who are not accompanied by children have to contribute to the cost of the child seat? We must, therefore, also answer the question – assuming we are willing to equip planes for the safety of children – of who will pay for that safety protection.

Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my Group endorses the expressions of sorrow and sympathy made to the Chinese people by the Council and the Commission following the horrific earthquake of 12 May. We offer our sincere condolences to all those who have been left bereaved or injured as a result of the earthquake. We also welcome the fact that the Chinese authorities have initiated rapid rescue measures, and we welcome the Chinese Government’s willingness to accept foreign aid. Let me also voice our hope that it will continue to do so in future, enabling aid to be dispensed effectively at the point of need. In addition, we are pleased that in this case the Chinese Government has also allowed the foreign media to report in detail on the earthquake, and we hope that it will permit foreign reporting on the reconstruction effort in the affected areas too. We particularly regret that so many pupils died when buildings in state schools collapsed, and we support the declared intention of the Chinese authorities to investigate the reasons why schools might not have been built to withstand earthquakes and to hold those responsible to account. Above all, we are willing to give the Chinese people the assistance they need. They do not need large sums of money, for they possess the world’s largest currency reserves. What they need is practical help, and we Europeans and our Member States can provide that help, and we thank the Commissioner for the aid measures he has already initiated. We shall support every action designed to help the people in the disaster areas and to assist them in the reconstruction of their villages. Some may have to be resettled in other areas. We shall provide the aid that is required for that purpose. It is truly a great human tragedy, and we empathise with the population of the stricken areas and with the entire Chinese nation.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my group would first of all like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Piecyk. He has been initiating discussions very well for over a year now and has outlined the challenges. Many thanks, Mr Piecyk! We, too, unanimously support the report. However, we regret, Commissioner, that the action plan contains too few practical measures. Mr Piecyk has already pointed out that the entire set of environmental problems remains unresolved. There are no practical measures and it is unclear what contribution the players – ship-owners, for example – are making towards combating climate change and how they can exist in the competition that they have to bear globally. This extends from measures such as the reduction of sulphur and nitrogen oxides at sea to measures in the ports, such as the use of land energy. I am in all honesty a little disappointed. When the Commission says that it will be putting forward proposals on this in the autumn, we shall no longer be able to implement these in this parliamentary term. Perhaps you will be able to add a little more butter to the fish, as the people of Hamburg say, and then have a bit more drive. The second point concerns the issue of marine monitoring. I believe we do not simply need improved cooperation between the national coastguards. We not only need to strengthen FRONTEX – which address illegal immigration – but we also need a European coastguard. This has been one of our concerns for years, that all activities, whether they be fishing activities, customs work or police work, are being centralised in the Member States and a powerful European coastguard is being introduced for this. Mr Commissioner, will the Commission be putting forward a proposal on the coast guard in this parliamentary term or not? One final point, which is new, is the amendments on pirates. We have to provide better protection for our fishing and merchant shipping fleets in international waters and we therefore need European as well as global action. The freedom of the seas should not become the freedom of the pirates.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to congratulate both rapporteurs on behalf of my group: firstly Mrs Ţicău, and secondly my colleague Mr Grosch. They have done very good work: they have attempted to bring together the various conflicting opinions within the Committee on Transport and Tourism. Our group supports in principle the Commission’s proposed new regulations for conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator and for access to the market for coach and bus services and access to the international road haulage market. However, our amendments call for further steps towards harmonisation and liberalisation. May I point out that we are still aiming towards the idea of the European internal market, which was actually supposed to be introduced in 1958. The Council has long been reluctant, but the European Court of Justice said in 1985 that we must also establish the European internal market in the transport market, so we must become a little bolder in this respect. A brief comment on the topic of licence to pursue an occupation. The demand that the Commission develop an integrated register of infringements of road transport legislation by 2010 is very important because Member States must be able to decide on the withdrawal of licences, for example, according to unified criteria. We must consider not only licensing, but also withdrawal of that licence. If we want to eliminate the black sheep, we must decide on the matter of withdrawal of licences according to unified criteria and, in this respect, I hope that the Commission will undertake to produce a unified register by 2010. With regard to access to the market for coach and bus services, I believe that we ought finally to make the internal market a reality, step by step. Therefore, I hope that the Commission will support us in making it no longer necessary to obtain authorisation from another Member State for cross-border regular services not extending more than 50 km beyond the border. This is nothing less than protectionism rearing its head. With regard to access to the international road haulage market, we must stop cabotage at some point. It makes no sense in a common internal market. The point of a common internal market is that every business must be able to offer its services in every part of the Community. For environmental reasons, I would say to Mrs Lichtenberger that if I want pointless return trips to stop, then I must find a sensible way of making it possible for providers to undertake trips within other countries. Do not come to me with conditions! We are talking about doing away with cabotage in 2014. There are still six years to go. If we cannot manage to harmonise the conditions to some extent in six years, then we will never manage it, and you will still be promoting cabotage regulations in the year 3000. I am familiar with these sorts of stories from Hamburg, because we always thought that our neighbours outside of Hamburg would pay incredibly low wages. We must see to it that we create an internal market. My most important point is the issue of the 12-day rule. Here we must simply draw clear lines. We need the 12-day rule for occasional cross-border coach services. It is not helpful when the operators and the unions now say: ‘We are about to reach an agreement.’ We must make a statutory ruling. We must pave the way for revision of driving and rest times. I am more than willing to discuss details of implementation with the unions and operators later but it is for Parliament to legislate the provisions on driving and rest times. We have clear proposals, which were supported by a majority in committee, and I would ask you to vote accordingly tomorrow.

 Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, Mr President of the Council, I appeal to the European Council on behalf of my Group to properly incorporate European transport policy into the integrated guidelines. The reason is that business and employment in the EU cannot thrive without a sustainable European transport policy and the requisite trans-European networks. Without effective transport corridors, without cooperation between transport providers and without intelligent transport systems, neither trade nor tourism can be expanded inside the European Union or with third countries. That is what we need, however, in order to boost employment. Mr President of the Council, when talking to your colleagues in the Council, please bear in mind that it is crucial for the Member States to include transport policy in their national plans for growth and employment. Unfortunately we are seeing Member States devote an ever diminishing amount of funding to the maintenance and expansion of national infrastructure, be it railway networks or road networks. The same goes for the promotion and application of transport systems. Nowadays you can order everything over the Internet, but it can only be delivered by lorry or by rail. You can book any holiday you like, but in order to reach your destination you need a decent airport and decent transport links. If we want growth and employment, therefore, we must have the requisite infrastructure and decent transport systems. These must of course be environmentally friendly. We are therefore of the opinion – for reasons of sustainability – that logistics must be given every support. This is also important for national planning. Although logistics is primarily the task of companies themselves, we, the Member States and the European Union, can nevertheless help promote logistics by cutting red tape, for example customs procedures at ports. We need environmentally-friendly policies. I therefore appeal to you, for the sake of growth and employment, to make transport policy the central plank in your strategy.

Madam President, Mr Vice-President, what you said about having commissioned studies and preparing conferences is very heartening, but let me ask you a simple question. I do not intend to ask whether you are going to present a communication by 10 June 2008, but I will ask whether you are going to present, by 10 June 2008, in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 11 of the current version of the Eurovignette Directive, what that Directive calls – and I quote – ‘a generally applicable, transparent and comprehensible model for the assessment of all external costs’ and for the assignment of these external costs to operators of all modes of transport. So are we going to get a model for the assessment and assignment of external costs, yes or no? My first question is as simple as that. And so to my second question. If I read the situation correctly, in contrast to the requirement to present a model, you are under no obligation at all to present an amendment to the Eurovignette Directive in 2008. That would no doubt be impossible anyway, because the idea, if I understood it correctly, is to develop a model for the distribution of costs and then, at the implementation stage, to apportion external costs to operators of all modes of transport – inland navigation, sea shipping, railways, private cars and so on. What must not happen is that you begin by undertaking an amendment of the Eurovignette Directive and apportioning external costs to hauliers but take no action to ensure that operators of barges, trains, etc. also meet their external costs. This is why I should like to know whether you will be undertaking a revision of the Eurovignette Directive at the same time as you provide for the apportionment of external costs among the other modes of transport too. Two simple questions, and I hope to receive two simple answers.

 Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my Group, I would like to thank both rapporteurs very warmly for their good and constructive cooperation. I think we always succeeded in finding common ground on matters of substance, we were able to reach agreement very quickly and I would like to congratulate the two rapporteurs for the way in which they managed to reach a deal so swiftly with the Council. After all, what benefit would a protracted dispute with the Council have brought? We could have lost a whole year! No, in my view, in spite of everything, we have managed to make progress on this matter at first reading and that is a great triumph for the House, the Commission and the Council. I would just like to focus on two or three points, and I am sure, Commissioner, you will pass this on to the European Railway Agency. We are giving the Agency greater responsibility for the setting of safety standards and interoperability criteria. I hope that the Agency will utilise these opportunities in the interests of our industry, that it will set new standards quickly, and that it will operate in an efficient and practical manner. As a passing comment, I also hope – and here I turn to Mr Costa if only he could hear me, he is on the phone, and phone calls are always more important – I hope that as more tasks are taken on by the European Railway Agency, the less the national agencies will have to get involved, and the less the national agencies have to do, the less bureaucracy there will be. If the bureaucracy works properly at European level, we will not need 25 national authorities. We want to save the European rail industry unnecessary overlap and duplication of work. I have a final comment for the Commissioner and the two rapporteurs: it is very important that we have reached an agreement. If the Member States miss their deadlines to decide on mutual recognition, then they are assumed to have given their authorisation. It is only through this authorisation function that we can exert the kind of pressure on national authorities that is needed to prevent them from constantly dragging their feet. Together, then, let us ensure that we save costs through cross-acceptance of locomotives and rolling stock, thereby increasing availability and giving further impetus to European rail freight in particular.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we in the committees are unanimously of the opinion that the starting date for European airlines and airlines from other countries that fly into our region must be the same, for we must consider the competitiveness of our airlines. Nevertheless, at the ICAO Conference we saw that the other countries opposed this. In this respect, there is no point in having a double deadline. In the Committee on Transport and Tourism, however, we believe that the deadline should be 2012. Commissioner, you quite rightly pointed out that aviation was excluded according under the Kyoto Protocol. In this respect, 2012 is the correct year, because this allows the best chance of convincing third countries to participate after all. It provides enough time for them to join our system or to set up an equivalent system. We cannot accept your leading role and that of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which goes even further and wants to see 2010, because this completely overlooks the global dimension of aviation, the nature of the competition between airlines. We cannot disadvantage our airports, our airlines and employees in this area. Therefore, the best acceptable time would be 2011, but the date must apply to all airlines. Furthermore, we must strike a balance. We want to reduce the effects on the climate of aviation, but we must also keep in mind the competitiveness of our airlines, and consider the airports and passengers – especially those from remote areas – and keep prices affordable for them. We therefore advocate achieving a reference period soon, and having a sensible percentage for the allocation of allowances – the Committee on Transport was in favour of 110, but just under 100 would also be feasible – and a sensible percentage for the auction. There is one thing we must not do: we must not make it too expensive for our passengers in Europe from more remote areas to travel by air – so, please, let us have a gentle introduction to emissions trading.

Madam President, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to reject the points made by Mrs Lichtenberger and Mr Romagnoli in their statements. Of course, there is no total reciprocity of rights, but compared with the previous situation, this is a balanced agreement, which is why we will be voting for it. If you take the view that this is not a balanced agreement, then by all means vote against it, but we agree with the rapporteur that this is a balanced first step and we also agree that a second step must follow. I of course support the rapporteur in his demand – as my colleague Mr Rack has said – that we should proceed to this second stage quickly. We should, quite simply, make use of what has now been agreed. I therefore urge the European airlines to utilise the new opportunities afforded to them by this agreement as regards their ownership and control rights, and to set up licensing operations and engage in branding policy and in part to participate in the US Government's programme. They should not be waiting for the second stage; they should be using the first stage now, so that when we enter the second stage of the negotiations we can benefit from initial experience and identify the areas where there are still deficits as regards our European companies' rights in the US market. We must also call on the Administration and our own Commission to capitalise on the opportunities afforded by this agreement and, for example, agree one-stop security on a more permanent basis. This can be achieved through the Joint Committee and in cooperation with the Administration, and we can show citizens that this agreement is beneficial for them, especially if they do not have to undergo a second security check at airports. My colleagues and I would like to thank the Commission for its good cooperation in this instance, but we must insist on similarly good cooperation in the second stage of the process. I warn the Americans to adopt Mr Oberstar's motion, for if they want to undermine this agreement with all their unilateral amendments, we will react sharply. Therefore, let us say to the Americans that we will gladly continue the talks between Congress and the European Parliament, but that they must not undermine the agreement with their biased interpretation.

 Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, when it comes to the issue of airport capacity, we have to distinguish between two issues. We want to mitigate the negative effects of aviation, which is why we agree on emissions trading for the aviation industry. We may not agree about the methodology or timescales involved, Mrs Lichtenberger, but in principle, we agree that the aviation sector should make its contribution to mitigating environmental impacts. However, we must also have the courage, Mrs Lichtenberger, to say that for economic reasons we need growth in the aviation sector, both internally and in respect of third countries. When it comes to the economy, jobs and citizens' mobility, adequate airport capacity is essential, and it is essential for environmental reasons as well, by the way. If the aircraft did not have to spend so long on the ground waiting for takeoff and did not have to spend so long stacking overhead before landing, just imagine what this would do to help the environment! We have to recognise the fact that we need to develop our airports. Mr Blokland is quite right: we do not want to take responsibility away from the Member States or regions, but in our experience there have been difficulties with airport expansion in many parts of Europe. That is why our approach is right: we are requesting the Commission to put forward a coherent proposal on how we can have a European master plan and how we can introduce best practice so that we can all learn from each other and pursue this expansion effectively. My second point relates to ground handling services. I think we should wait for the new impact analysis. I think that the basic Directive was very successful as the efficiency of ground handling services has been improved in recent years and the costs for passengers have been reduced. As to whether we need further changes, that is an open question. I would not wish to decide conclusively today. I think we should wait for the outcome of the Commission's analysis, which is expected this winter, and only then should we decide whether or not there is a need for revision. We should not rush into any decisions today.

Mr President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, many thanks on behalf of my Group! That is a fantastic idea – promoting mobility while taking measures to avoid disasters and environmental pollution. But you have stressed that you want to observe the principle of subsidiarity. When we read through the paper, you make very practical proposals, on city tolls and other matters for instance. How do you want to ensure that your good proposals and the debate we are all waiting for and which we will be having for a whole year do not lead to us telling cities and regions what to do, but only to an incentive actually to adopt best practice? We are agreed that we have to do something for cities and establish best practice. We are familiar with the accident statistics. In many cities and towns there is a high accident rate, but not in others. This is due to how matters are handled locally. How then do you want to manage the development of collective ideas without the cities and regions getting the feeling they are being patronised by Europe?

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tonight we can all be satisfied with the overall result of the railways package. As rapporteur on the progress of Community legislation on the development of the railways I may not be particularly happy, but when we look at the results we have achieved in regard to passenger rights, in particular compensation payments for train delays and the Europe-wide certification of train drivers, we can on the whole be satisfied. I want to start by discussing my own report. The good news is that as of 1 January 2010 the national rail networks must be opened up for use by all railway undertakings providing international passenger services, without any discrimination, whether the undertakings are public or private. That will finally create a European single market in cross-border passenger transport and open the way to more offers by a wide variety of railway undertakings, to the benefit of the customers. We expect the railway undertakings actually to make use of these new opportunities and to make customer-friendly and competitive offers, in relation particularly to air travel costs. If that proves successful, we have a chance to revitalise cross-border rail transport. And this is where in a sense I am following on from the previous debate, for we will then also have an opportunity to reduce environmental pollution within the European Union. One unsatisfactory result of the conciliation procedure is that because of the strong resistance by the Council it did not prove possible also to open up the national railway networks for national railway services, which means that the European internal market for railway services remains incomplete. To be honest, however, the reason for that lies in the vote we ourselves held in this Parliament on 18 January this year. The majority of Members voted in favour of the opening up of networks for national rail services too, but we did not reach the required qualified majority of 393 votes on that Thursday. Nonetheless, in the conciliation procedure Parliament did manage to ensure that the new directive requires the European Commission to submit a report by 31 December 2012 in which it also proposes measures for further opening up the passenger rail market. For the record, I would ask Vice-President Barrot to repeat his commitment to submit a report by 31 December 2012 and also to take further steps to open up the rail market. Parliament and the Council also reached agreement that we should certainly restrict the opening up of networks for cross-border services if that jeopardised the economic equilibrium of public and regional passenger services. That must not, however, lead to some form of protectionism, to a railway trying to protect itself from competition; restriction is possible only if a national government authority confirms, on the basis of an objective economic analysis, that opening up would jeopardise regional passenger services. Unfortunately a further restriction slipped in during the procedure, which is that Member States may impose a levy for the benefit of public passenger and local services. Parliament did, in fact, succeed in limiting the levy so that revenue from it must not be greater than is really necessary for the performance of the public service. I honestly hope that – aside from one country, and even then I hope that will not be the case – Member States will in fact never make use of the possibility of restricting the opening up of the networks. At any rate, I hope Member States will implement this directive without delay and that we will be able to offer more international passenger services here in Europe and give our citizens a chance to use rail rather than air transport when crossing borders. I would now like to say a few words on behalf of my colleague Elisabeth Jeggle. Unfortunately, she is absent due to illness. First, Mrs Jeggle wanted to thank Mr Savary for the close cooperation between the shadow rapporteurs in relation to the third rail package and say that she is also very pleased with the results as regards the certification of train drivers. We have managed after all to ensure that there will be a uniform European train driver’s licence, for there is no point in opening up the networks if trains have to stop at borders to change drivers. We want a European internal market. We want European freight trains – here the networks have already been opened up – and now also international passenger trains to be able to operate regardless of national borders, because we want efficient rail services. In that regard, the introduction of a European train driver’s licence is of key importance. Here we really can be satisfied with our legislation. I would point out, however, that it is a question not just of train drivers but of all those entrusted with safety in rail transport. As you know, just as a plane cannot take off if there are not enough stewardesses because they are responsible for passenger safety in the event of an emergency, similarly we need conductors and other individuals on trains. We are not talking about the chef in the restaurant car but about railway personnel such as conductors and others who are responsible for passenger safety. Here we and the rapporteur have jointly managed to persuade the Commission to undertake to submit a report, two and a half years after the directive enters into force, on the possibility of introducing uniform European certification of those employees too, to ensure that we do not have any safety deficit in this area of international rail services either. Train drivers and other personnel must be properly trained. We are glad that this train driver’s licence also represents a step towards train drivers’ mobility, for drivers who hold a European licence can also change their place of employment within the European Union as they please. We are being fair, however, which is why we jointly ensured that if a person who was trained in one railway undertaking voluntarily moves to another one, the training undertaking is entitled to compensation for the training costs. I may say, on behalf of Mrs Jeggle, that we are very pleased with the outcome. There was good cooperation and she asks the House to approve the package as a whole.

 Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, let me point out that the Commission itself said that logistics is a matter for the industry itself. I believe that is the right approach. I hope, therefore, that when the Commission presents its action plan, it will divide it up into measures we can take as a Community, measures the Member States can take, and measures it is up to the industry itself to take. Of course we have to reduce the red tape that is still an obstacle to coastal shipping, which has to fill in various forms, while HGVs can simply drive across the European Union. We must indeed cut back government bureaucracy and promote modern transport infrastructure and systems. Let us make no mistake, however. Logistics is a matter for the industry itself and we should not take on a burden we simply cannot afford. On gigaliners – perhaps it would be better to say either 60-tonners or 25m-long HGVs, for there are different categories – at this moment in time my Group is quite definitely against authorising their general use in transport. After all, in most parts of the European Union infrastructure such as bridges, crossings and roundabouts are certainly not suitable for such long or heavy HGVs. The State treasuries are not handing out any money for reinforcing the bridges or converting roundabouts. Given that transport situation, gigaliners produce considerable transport safety problems. Just imagine one of those 25-tonners coming round a bend in a small village, misjudging the bend and then trying to reverse! I think, therefore, we should continue doing what we have done in the past. We should authorise them in Finland and Sweden, which have huge open stretches for the transport of timber. In that regard, the Committee on Transport and Tourism has made a sensible suggestion. It says we should authorise these gigaliners in the Member States, but only subject to very stringent conditions, if we can show the Commission that the necessary transport security exists, that the necessary transport infrastructure exists. That means we should check those conditions in individual cases and for individual countries.

 Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, we have no problems at all with what you have achieved in terms of improving efficiency in airspace, but your reply was quite clear. That reply was to the effect that Member States have not done their homework. Member States have not met the obligation that has existed since 2004 rapidly to create functional airspace blocks. On the one hand that results in the costs you referred to of up to EUR 3 billion, and on the other hand it also leads to environmental pollution. At the moment, we are discussing the introduction of emission trading in air transport, talking about 3% of air transport emissions. If we had sensible, rapid and efficient air transport management we could reduce fuel consumption by up to 12%, which would substantially reduce CO2 emissions. Mr Vice-President, you are a gentleman, but let us get to the crux of the matter: the Member States are not doing their homework. That is why we – you as the Commission and we as Parliament – must all tell the Member States: detention time! You have to catch up quickly now after falling so far behind. Yet that may not be enough. We must also threaten them with changing the bottom-up-, bottom-down approach. If Member States cannot manage to make progress on the truly vital question of air safety, air efficiency, the impact of air transport on the climate, then we expect that in 2008 the Commission will not just present a report saying that the Member States are improving in terms of creating airspace blocks, but that it will threaten the Member States. You can rely on our help. Then we will have to change the system and create the airspace blocks at European level. That is the stick we need in order to persuade Member States rapidly to create efficient, functional airspace blocks. I know how difficult that is, but kind words will get us nowhere. We must slowly begin to wave the big stick.

 Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, that was interesting: Mr Meijer virtually recreating ancient railway history before our eyes. He, too, should have perceived the very idea of laying railway tracks from one village to another for freight transport as being as slow as it is unrealistic. Mr Cramer, nor can I share your simplistic demonising of the lorry. After all, lorry operators pay corporation tax, vehicle tax, petroleum tax and tolls – and so the assertion that lorries drive for free and competition is distorted is simply unrealistic. I fully share your view that it is not right for Poland’s Ministry of Finance to charge excessively high route prices – but that is an issue for the Polish Government, not European legislation, to deal with. We should perhaps remind the Polish Government that route prices are intended to promote rail transport rather than to reform the Polish budget situation – but this has absolutely nothing to do with the lorry. Mr President, I should like to ask you to ensure speedy implementation of the second railway package, too, by all Member States. After all, we pushed through the requirement that networks must have been opened up to the national and cross-border movement of goods by 1 January of this year, and I see this as a great opportunity to help European markets operate across borders. I should like to discuss one of the points the Commissioner raised, and I would ask him to elaborate on this. He said that the Commission is willing to help reduce the noise caused by rail trucks, and announced a communication on this. What I should like to know is when he plans to present this communication. Does he believe that this will put greater focus on European aspects, or will it open up possibilities for the granting of aid at national level? Noise pollution – for example, from trains passing through residential areas at night – is unacceptable in cities, in particular. If the Commissioner is prepared to provide help with this, we would be very grateful.

 Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to refer to three more aspects. In the consolidation of the third aviation package, it is crucial in terms of the transparency of air fares that there be no false bait advertising, and it is also relevant in this regard whether the flat-rate security charges levied on passengers actually match the costs of the security measures. I have the feeling that airports are using some of these security charges to obtain further remuneration for themselves. It is very important in the interests of the transparency of costs that security charges do indeed correspond to the costs incurred by security measures. Secondly, I should like to discuss competition between airports, and to do so from two angles. I should like to ask the Commissioner to give one or two examples without delay to show the extent to which the Commission’s guidelines for permissible (or impermissible) aid for regional airports in the Community are actually being applied. As I see it, there are a great many regional airports that are only being kept afloat by subsidies and will never be able to support themselves economically. In these cases, the Commission guidelines should actually be putting an end to the subsidies. Thirdly, this consolidation of the third aviation package changes the definition of an ‘airport system’ slightly. I would ask that the Commissioner elaborate on this, too, at some stage. It is unacceptable that, by law, an airport system can only exist if it serves the same conurbation, and that airports such as Frankfurt and Frankfurt Hahn can claim that, despite being 120 km apart, they serve the same conurbation and must therefore be recognised as an airport system. The Commissioner should on no account permit such mushrooming of what is recognised as an airport system.

 Mr President, Commissioner, we would agree that precisely because of the scale of EU's trade deficit with China, the European Union needs to be given much better market access opportunities, that the distortions created by Chinese State aids have to be reduced, and the Chinese Government needs to enforce WTO-standard intellectual property rights in the provinces as well. We also need to work together to convince China that we are not just presenting a list of demands, but rather that it is in China's interest to allow fair market access. We have to make China understand that if they want to lick their environment into shape, if they want to create an efficient energy supply – after all, China has plenty of money, there is no problem on that front – then we need to be given access to their public procurement market. Then we will be able to sell our products in China in a sensible trade in goods, and China will be able to purchase modern coal-fired power stations and sewage plants and suchlike and make use of our technologies. China does not need handouts, it has plenty of capital: it has the largest foreign currency reserves in the world. China is currently setting up a fund to invest its money worldwide. Our message to the Chinese Government should be: invest your money in your own country! Do something for environmental protection and energy security, improve safety in the coalmines. If we are successful, we will also be able to improve trade relations in the long term. Of course, as you indicated, these agreements also contain a human rights clause because we have been discussing human rights with China for years; we must stand firm on that point. As a previous speaker said, no one expects China to respect all human rights overnight, but we do need to see significant progress. The People's Republic of China signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights several years ago, but has not ratified it and does not apply it. So we need to turn around and say: you chose to sign it, you said you wanted to uphold human rights, now do it!

 Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, I should like to start by thanking you, Mr Vice-President, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, for the role you have played as mediator, which has been very important in achieving this compromise, but I would also, of course, like to offer very sincere thanks particularly to the rapporteur, Mr Mauro, and to the former chairman, Mr Costa, who is still actively involved in things, not to mention Mr Lewandowski, for bringing this compromise about. At the same time, it has to be said that the Council dragged things out for months on end, and it is the Council that is to blame for our present inability to pay out even now the money for trans-European projects in 2007; there is no doubt that responsibility for this lies with the Council, for it would have been much better for us to have had this Financial Regulation earlier on and been able to take a decision at an earlier juncture. You, Commissioner, have undertaken to keep us fully informed, and I am sure you will communicate not only with the chairmen of committees, but also the committees themselves. I would urge you to be as stringent in examining these things as you have undertaken to be. Let there be no national quotas; the funds should be approved for projects that are of importance to Europe, and not to this or that country. Rather than fund in dribs and drabs, we should support the really important projects; what that means is that not everyone should get something, but the projects that are of real importance to Europe should, following consultation with this House and with the Commission, be comprehensively subsidised. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats appeals to the German Federal Government to clarify by this summer how things stand in respect of two major and cross-border projects in Germany, or else the EU will not be able to take them into account in its financial planning. Firstly, it must produce clear plans for the deepening of the Danube between Straubing and Vilshofen, which is intended finally to make navigation of the Danube from the Black Sea to the North Sea economically viable, and, secondly, Germany and Denmark must come to an agreement on the building and financing of a fixed link over the Fehmarnbelt, a project that can be included in the financial planning only as and when evidence of a bilateral agreement has been produced.

 Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats welcomes the agreement reached with the Council at first reading. This is a good example of excellent cooperation. Naturally, we also thank the rapporteur, Mr Costa, for his extremely committed work. The fact that we are taking a practical step towards reducing the number of traffic-accident fatalities is important, as it is of course insufficient to merely fit new trucks with new lateral blind spot mirrors; in addition, it is of prime importance that the many trucks already in service be retrofitted, as the Vice-President rightly said. It is regrettable, however, Mr State Secretary, that the Council opposed the rapid solution called for by Parliament. We called for 30 June 2008 – entirely rightly, as a matter of fact. As you know, I represent the same country as you, and we must think about how matters can be speeded up within a federal structure. It is unacceptable that the existence of a bicameral system in Germany should render swift action impossible. I have no intention of speaking about the catalogue of fines for violations of rest periods and driving times now, but we have to think of ways to enable rapid response. The measures are undisputed. Naturally, I should have much preferred agreement on the deadline of 30 June 2008. Nevertheless, for practical reasons, we decided to compromise with you on the deadline of 31 March 2009; for, if agreement had not been reached at first reading and the matter had gone to second reading, more time would have been lost. Thus, the compromise is a very practical solution. Finally, I should like to appeal to private enterprise not to exploit the deadline. Private enterprises can retrofit their trucks with the new mirrors early, on time and quickly, as they, too, should have a great interest in preventing accidents – not to mention accidents involving fatalities. Consequently, we hope that a consensus can be reached quickly tomorrow, that all of this is soon on the statute book, and that private enterprise is quicker to act than we have been.

 Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Daldrup, allow me first of all, on behalf of myself and my colleague Mrs Jeggle, to thank all of those involved – the Council, the Commission and Parliament – for reaching this good compromise after seven years. I should particularly like to thank Mr Piecyk, who is unable to be here today but who played an instrumental role in the negotiations. I personally believe that we are creating legal certainty and that we are striking a balanced compromise between the interests of public and private transport services. Cities and regions are at liberty to award contracts to their own companies without issuing calls for tender. On the other hand, however, we make it a condition that as monopolies – possibly with monopoly profits in other fields – they do not compete with private contractors for the contracts in question. For this reason I believe that this is a balanced compromise. Mr Daldrup, this is not only about high-quality passenger transport services; it is also about high-quality transport services at prices that passengers can afford. In recent years, this aspect has been somewhat overlooked in some cities and communes. This new legislation will enable us to take greater account of it. Of the various different points for which we have also won agreement, I should like to refer to just two. You said earlier that in your view ‘the substantial part’ that has to be carried out by the principal contractor in the case of subcontracts was a social dumping issue. If you really have social dumping in your sights then you need to insist that internal operators perform 100% of the services themselves and do not make use of cheaper subcontractors. Be that as it may, my group stands by the compromise that has been negotiated, including the ‘substantial part’. We will see what Parliament decides tomorrow. We will keep our word, however, as otherwise it becomes impossible to enter into compromises with each other. Personally, I also believe that it is particularly important that we have improved the level of legal protection and that companies that believe they have been disadvantaged have quick and effective means of accessing this legal protection. Finally, I should like to make a personal comment to Mr Daldrup in his capacity as representative of the German Presidency. I hope that you will also take the necessary steps in German legislative procedure to incorporate all of the measures that we adopt tomorrow in full into the Law on the Carriage of Persons (Personenbeförderungsgesetz)
 and that you will not try to deviate from it because of pressure from certain public companies. The measures that we have decided on are good and we should transpose them into national law as they stand.

 Mr President, that was a very brief description of the problem. Both my own group and the other take the view that specific rules would offer better protection for passengers on inland vessels, since the present regulations, on which we are to vote, apply to sea-going traffic, and so I would just like to point out that we are doing no less for the passengers’ safety if we table our amendments, and then – it is to be hoped – get a majority to vote for them.

Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, let me begin by warmly thanking the rapporteur for the immense volume of work she has put into this report, and particularly into the resolution, and let me reassure her that she is not an incurable old optimist but a youthful optimist! The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wholeheartedly supports the creation of a broader common air space comprising the European Union, Iceland and Norway from the European Economic Area and the neighbouring countries of south-eastern Europe, since all of these countries, through this multilateral agreement, will gradually incorporate the same code of aviation law and ultimately create a uniform legal area in Europe covering all aspects of aviation, from air-traffic control and airspace management to competition between airlines. In this way we shall also increase the safety and security of aviation and reinforce the rights of air travellers. I am very grateful to the rapporteur for drafting the resolution. I do not seek to apply the eco-friendly label to every activity in any circumstances but would argue for a reasonable level of mobility. This is why we believe that all Member States should involve themselves without delay in practical measures to realise the concept of a single European sky by means of an effective system of airspace management. In this way we can cut CO2 emissions in the European Union by up to 12%. We also support the efforts to introduce a sound European system of emissions-trading for air transport in order to achieve further environmental benefits. The wisdom of emissions-trading, however, is something we shall discuss later in another context. Finally, let me point out that it is also important for us to assist each other in staff training and in the procurement and use of the latest air-traffic control technology, for we need a safe and efficient system to monitor the use of European air space.

 Mr President, Mr Vice-President, my group stands four-square behind the rapporteur. Let us make no bones about this. Our Parliament reminded the Member States back in 2002 that they had to meet their share of the cost of measures for the protection of public safety and order. We asked you to formulate a strategy for resolving the issue of funding the security measures without distorting competition between airports. You then presented a report, but in that report you neither said, 'Here is a way we could resolve the issue without distorting competition', nor did you say there was no point in making a proposal. So we still await a proposal. We told the Council last year that we expected it to acknowledge clearly its financial responsibility. It stated once more that it was not prepared to do so. We are no longer prepared to play these games, which have been going on since 2002, in other words for five long years. There is no real pressure to carry out this revision, because you were able to enact the basic regulations we now have – the measure regarding liquids in hand baggage being the prime example – on the strength of these rules. I am not entirely sure whether this measure will remain in place for long. There is no reason to say that it has to be scrapped now because it is blocking some other security measures. If you want to propose new security measures, bring them before Parliament. We are open to new proposals. What we mean is that, besides the issue of liquids in hand baggage, on which the Committee on Transport and Tourism is to hold a hearing, we must tackle risk analysis as a matter of priority, and I hope we can do that together with you. I have serious doubts as to whether the present Regulation actually enhances security or whether it is too heavy-handed. But let us discuss that openly. Please do not say, ‘The intelligence people have information that they cannot pass on to us’. We have a responsibility to the public to provide straight answers. Your departments, and more particularly those of the Council, must be prepared to lay their cards on the table, for we will no longer tolerate the present tactics.

 Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats essentially supports the excellent reports submitted by Mrs Vincenzi and Mr Savary on flag State requirements and the liability of shipowners respectively. At the same time we would like to thank the rapporteurs for drafting these reports so skilfully. Contrary to the fears of some sections of the shipping industry, neither of the two directives really impose any new substantial requirements on shipping or the Member States, and they therefore do not adversely affect the competitiveness of the European fleet compared with its competitors from third countries either. Rather the two proposals actually only serve to make some long-standing international conventions in maritime law finally binding on all Member States. If we look at the individual proposals for the flag States, then it is high time that all 27 Member States in the European Union complied with their obligations under the international convention in terms of inspecting their own vessels. To do so it is not enough simply to sign and ratify conventions. It also requires the Member States finally to make available the necessary equipment and personnel so as to carry out effective inspections of their own vessels. When it comes to liability for accidents at sea, all that is actually happening here is that all Member States are being obliged by Community law finally to apply the 1996 LLMC Convention. We are also calling for the 1996 HNS Convention and the 2001 Bunker Oil Convention to be applied at long last, which is surely not really an unreasonable demand of either the shipping industry or the Member States. We can therefore justify our position perfectly. In the interests of the environment and the public, we are demanding something that goes completely without saying, and I hope that the Council will finally understand this and be prepared to deal with these two dossiers accordingly.

 Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, I should like to discuss transport policy, the poor relation in this House. Even though, together with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the Committee on Transport and Tourism is the committee responsible for the most legislative acts, transport always comes last. Yet transport is important. Without transport infrastructures geared towards people’s needs, there will be no growth and no employment. It is possible to order everything over the Internet, but not have it delivered via the Internet. Transport infrastructures geared towards people’s needs are a prerequisite for growth in trade, particularly between old and new Member States, and so the Commission’s approach in its strategy paper is the right one. I should like to point out that the most important thing is not to demonise transport. Recently, it has been postulated that, for example, no one should fly any more. The Vice-President of the Commission knows that if she wishes to travel from northern to southern Sweden, the choice is between spending hours on a train and having to fly. It is all right for people to fly, as the exhaust-gas pollution caused by air transport can be reduced considerably by means of sound policies. If we succeeded in ensuring that Member States introduced sound airspace control systems at long last, we could reduce the CO2 emissions from air transport by 8-12%. The Member States must do something about this: we should remind them to do so. Indeed, Vice-President Barrot plans to present a White Paper on urban transport. I am always somewhat doubtful as to whether urban transport is within our remit, but the Vice-President is absolutely right about one thing: urban transport accounts for a large proportion of pollution. Parliament should agree guidelines with the Member States and the regions: that transport is needed for growth and employment, but that this transport should be as efficient and environmentally friendly as possible. This will have to be discussed in greater detail. We are following the same course, therefore, Madam Vice-President – but, without transport, there will be no growth or employment in the Community.

Madam President, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats congratulates Vice-President Barrot, his negotiating team and Mr Calleja Crespo most sincerely on the successful conclusion of this, the first part of the important EU-US air-transport agreement. Let us also join together to thank the US negotiating team and Mr Byerly, however, as it was no easy task for him, either, to bring these negotiations to a successful conclusion. There is no doubt that this agreement brings about a large transatlantic air-transport market at long last, to the benefit of air carriers and passengers. From now on, European air carriers will be able to access the US market from all parts of the EU without national restrictions. At the same time, we are implementing the 2002 judgment of the European Court of Justice. The restrictions at London Heathrow Airport contravening Community law will also have to be lifted. I am sure that the opening of the skies over the Atlantic will also give rise to attractive offers for air passengers. The reason this agreement is balanced is that the Commission has succeeded in opening up access to US markets for European air carriers a little for the first time. We could have seen more than market opening, but all the same. New regulations on ownership and control rights, licensing and branding have been put in place. I believe that these benefits are such as to justify our calling this a balanced agreement. It is even more important, from my point of view, that we have set up a joint committee with the involvement of the business community, as this will be able to prevent, for example, the US or Europe taking unilateral security measures to the detriment of air carriers and passengers in future. The PPE-DE Group urges the German Presidency to lose no time in ensuring support for this compromise in the Council – something that would also have great symbolic value. I am very much obliged to our friend Mr El Khadraoui for his excellent resolution, which – I believe – will be adopted tomorrow by a large majority in the spirit of our discussions.

 Mr President, Mr Vice-President, I would like to set the debate in a different context, namely the context of what we debated this morning, the situation with EU-USA air services. We agreed this morning that there is a large transatlantic market for air services that we want to see further developed. Now the question is: who are the players? In the negotiations we clearly said that we want Europe to be America’s equal. That also means that we must develop the European Aviation Safety Agency into an equal partner of the American Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The situation today is that the FAA decides which aircraft must be repaired and which must be taken out of service, because it has a high level of competence and has tremendous power in world aviation. The debate we are holding today on extending the remit of the EASA must be seen in this context. We must progressively bring the EASA up to the same level as the FAA, so that we – Europe and the US – are also represented as partners in the administrative field. That is why, Commissioner, as planned, in the next few weeks we should discuss quietly in committee the release of the reserves for the EASA. The fundamental question for me however is: what equipment and what staff must the EASA have in order to be recognised both by the national aviation safety authorities – because there are still misgivings about that – and by the FAA? If we continue down this road – a gradual, careful expansion of the EASA’s competences for both equipment and personnel to make it in fact an equal partner to the FAA – then we will have done our best for our airlines and our passengers.

 Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, Madam Secretary of State, speaking as rapporteur for this House, I recommend to it that, tomorrow, the national railway networks should be not only opened up to cross-border passenger trains run by all railway companies, irrespective of their country of origin or of whether they are state-owned or private – which is what the Council envisages – but also that they should be opened up for the purposes of passenger traffic within the country at a later date. This is the line that this House has been taking ever since 2003. We have always taken the view that the European internal market must be made, once and for all, in the railway sector as well, thus making possible, by way of fair competition among railway companies, more and better-value service for railway travellers. By way of a concession, Madam Secretary of State, to the Council – which still has its own misgivings about opening up the networks to private passenger traffic at too early a juncture – the committee is now proposing 2017 as the date for networks to be opened up to domestic traffic. It is also the intention that those states that acceded as recently as 1 May 2004 or later should be able to extend this deadline by another five years in order to give their railway companies more time to prepare themselves for the internal market and for the competition that it brings. We ought really to agree that, for the Member States, ten or fifteen years really ought to be enough to reorganise their railway companies in such a way as to meet demand and the needs of their customers, for the public are entitled to efficient and good-value passenger transport within their own countries as much as anywhere else; after all, without that, the railway sector will be unable to compete against cars and aircraft and thereby have a future. Apart from a few minor amendments, the Committee on Transport and Tourism agrees with the Council and the Commission that the Member States must be allowed not to open up – or to open up only partially – their networks if their being opened up would endanger regional and local passenger traffic; that is where we agree, for regional and local transport are of vital importance to the public, not least for environmental reasons. We do not agree, however, Madam President-in-Office, when it comes to the great big package that the Council has come up with in order to further limit the opening up of networks. The committee proposes that the introduction of the ‘principal purpose’ criterion and the giving of pre-eminence to long-term concessions be rejected. I am very pleased to note from Annex II to the Common Position, that the Portuguese presidency took exactly the same view as Parliament on this, for, if one weighs up the demands of the internal market – which should have become a reality a long time ago – against the special interests of public passenger and regional transport, it becomes apparent that the special rules imposed to secure the latter’s position already do enough to restrict the opening up of networks. The committee did not do as I recommended and do away outright with the mandatory levy on all types of passenger transport to the benefit of public local service providers – which the Council surprised us by inserting – and instead recommended amendments to it. In the conciliation procedure, Parliament and the Council need, together, to consider to what extent such a mandatory levy is actually justified by the facts of the situation and the system’s requirements, or whether, on the other hand, it risks being no more than a pretext for deliberate restrictions on the deregulation of the networks. The committee also recommends the incorporation of the new rules on transit, the acceptance of the derogations for Malta and Cyprus, and the amended wordings for amending Directive 2001/14/EC in the interests of the more effective planning of high-speed routes. Through you, Commissioner and Vice-President Barrot, I appeal to the Commission to endorse the substance of this House’s proposals, since I see the statements made to the committee by your staff, to the effect that they could see no reason for the networks to be opened up to domestic traffic as well, as going against convictions that the Commission has held for many years. I would remind you of the celebrated White Paper on the European single market that the Commission published in 1985. It will be evident to anyone who remembers what is in it that the principle has applied ever since that it is not the completion of the internal market, but resistance to it, that needs to be justified, and no such justification has been forthcoming from you. Finally, let me say that I do not believe that the Presidency of the Council will accept Parliament’s proposals in toto
, and so I appeal to it to set the conciliation procedure in motion without delay, if at all possible, as soon as February, so that we can get this wrapped up before the German presidency ends in the summer. I believe that this third railway package is what the public and European businesses need, let us work together to get it adopted by the summer.

 Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I will be brief. First, I would like to extend my special thanks to Mr Grosch for all he has done. However, we must first make clear to outsiders what he has achieved, because to the public it looks as though all he has done is to make three applications for the comitology procedure and that otherwise the Council has had its way. It was, however, Mr Grosch who, in cooperation with his shadow rapporteurs, spent weeks and months negotiating to get a proper, acceptable Council common position together at all. We must draw express attention to that, or else people will think that all we are doing is approving the common position. No, we thank Mr Grosch and his colleagues for negotiating for weeks on end to get the Council to present a common position that had been agreed with us. Two further brief remarks: I am one of the Members who were against mandatory exchange and against limited validity for licences. We then nevertheless agreed that in the interests of road safety and preventing the forging of licences it is acceptable for citizens to have to exchange their driving licences after 26 years. Many of us will perhaps not have to do that, if we are wise. In that regard, 26 years is probably a good compromise and we can readily accept it. My final remark, Commissioner, is that you were right to say that we hope many Member States will bring all these measures into force earlier. Please see to it that the Member States act on their promise to put into effect quickly the exchange of data on driving licences, for we will be able to prevent driving licence tourism only if Member States exchange the relevant data and know that they must not issue this or that citizen with a driving licence because he is still banned. So let us make sure the Member States build the information network quickly.

 Mr President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats thanks the rapporteur for producing his report promptly, quickly, clearly and precisely, and we are able to support it. I also hope that the Council will, as promised, accept our amendment, so that we can bring this dossier to a conclusion at first reading. Mr Vice-President, you are absolutely right. We must abolish the exemption that still exists regarding the non-use of double-hull tankers. I find the last sentence, which we are taking over from the rapporteur as an amendment, quite classic; it says quite plainly that oil tankers carrying heavy grades of oil, irrespective of their flags – not only Member State flags – will not be allowed to enter ports or offshore terminals or to anchor in areas under the jurisdiction of a Member State unless they are double-hull tankers. That is important; we have already had some very difficult situations in the Baltic, and I hope that what we said in 2003 – namely that heavy-grade oils may only be carried in double-hull tankers – will now at last be enforced. If we are indeed concluding the Commission proposal with the amendment quickly at first reading, then we should remind the Council that next year we have to deal with seven separate proposals in the Erika 3 package. I hope the Council will work with us on them just as quickly so as to improve flag state controls, port state control and liability. I am eager to see whether the Council will pluck up the same courage as the Commission and Parliament next year to take active measures to prevent environmental pollution at sea.

 Mr President, Commissioner, our group is genuinely committed to developing the strategic partnership between the EU and China, but these relations must be based upon complete openness, credibility and responsibility. We must not sacrifice our convictions for the sake of economic or political considerations; rather, we must use plain language when speaking with our Chinese partners. I would like to thank you, Commissioner, for the clear words which you have spoken in your opening speech, and I encourage you to make the same speech at the summit in Helsinki. If we are open and honest with each other, then we have a good chance of further developing the strategic partnership in a sensible way. Please allow me to make three further points. Like the Commission, we must continue to demand from the government of the People’s Republic of China that it implements the basic principles of fair world trade, now that it has joined the WTO. They cannot get away with the excuse that central government does not know what is happening in every province. The protection of intellectual property must be enforced, and if the Chinese Government can enforce its political convictions in every prison, then it must also be able to implement the protection of intellectual property on every factory floor. Secondly, we call upon the National People’s Congress to finally ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. They have signed it, but they are postponing the ratification. They return to this point in the discussions which we are always glad to have with them and they say that it is so difficult and that they have to prepare themselves first. No: they have signed, so they should ratify, and they should implement human rights. Implementation means, in practice: freedom of religion, freedom of the press, and freedom of speech. This must be guaranteed. There must also be cultural autonomy for Tibet. I do not think that Mr Ford has understood things quite rightly: China must make the first move in changing the way it relates to its neighbours. It must also change its relations with its neighbours Japan and Taiwan. Indeed, as far as Taiwan is concerned, of course all of us in the House would like there to be a political dialogue between Peking and Taipei, but this must not occur in the form of threats. It is therefore completely nonsensical of the Socialists to have called – as they did recently – for the lifting of the arms embargo. You should instead get back to showing solidarity with the democrats in this House. As long as there are human rights violations in China, there should be no lifting of the embargo.

 Mr President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, let us just rejoice, for this House’s tenacity and the Commission’s support have made it possible for this dossier to be completed after all. We can look back on five years, on a great deal of work and a great deal of sweat, so let us just rejoice! Secondly, Commissioner, I urge you to take your courage in your hands; what we ask of you is that you re-examine the special arrangements for night express flights. The Council would say it saw that as an excuse for inaction, but be bold, do something, make some proposals! I believe it to be a simple fact that there is a difference between the living circumstances of pilots of passenger aircraft and those of freight aircraft. In conclusion, I would ask of the Vice-President and all Members some understanding for why I am not making full use of my two minutes. In this House, there is agreement all round; on the television, there is something really exciting, and I am sure you will understand when I say that I am going to go for the more exciting option.

Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, some of what my esteemed colleague Mr Bradbourn had to say was his personal view; I can assure the House and the Commissioner that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is – with the exception of one amendment – right behind the Costa report, and I will take this opportunity to reiterate my thanks to the Chairman of the Committee and to the rapporteur for their very constructive cooperation. I just want to say something about two peculiarities in this House’s amendments. The first is that I believe that the costs of all security measures at airports should be split between those who use the airports and the Member States, for the measures put in place at airports are not primarily for the benefit of the individual passenger, but serve to avert dangers to all and sundry; that, traditionally, is one of the functions of the state, and it is the state that should pay for it to be done. By way of comparison – and on this evening it might well be an appropriate one – let me point out that my own country, when football matches are being staged, has hundreds of police officers on duty before, during and after the match, and not one spectator is required to pay even a cent for them. If, then, the cost of protecting people against danger at football matches is borne generally, then the same ought, even if only to some degree, to apply at airports. Secondly, we must make sure, once and for all, that the system of a single security check is brought in on flights not only within the European Union, but also between the European Union and secure third countries. It is surely not acceptable that someone should arrive at Frankfurt airport by air from Israel and be subject to a second security check before he travels on to Hamburg, and the same is true in the case of the USA. It must be possible for people arriving from a safe country to avoid going through additional security checks when they change flights within an EU Member State. This would be a sensible arrangement, and I hope that we, together with the Commission and the Council, will adopt it.

Mr President, Mr Vice-President, I hope that the introduction of the single train system will be quicker and more punctual than the way we are going about things, for we are already – again – running twenty minutes behind time, and I am sure you will not mind if I go pretty soon, as I want to watch another match somewhere. I do not need to repeat what the rapporteur had to say, since all the groups on the committee managed to achieve compromises on essential points, and I also share the view expressed by the Vice-President. There are just two things I would like to point out. The first – and it is for Mr Cramer’s benefit – is that we should not be talking in terms of percentages, for we have as yet no idea as to how much money is in the pot for ERTMS, and, moreover, we do not yet know which projects are actually ready to go ahead. One project – the route from Rotterdam to Genoa – does admittedly appear to be ready apart from the last stretch into Genoa, but funding from the Member States for the other projects has not yet been secured, and so we should not be promising something that the Member States are unwilling to produce, for they, the network operators and the railways must contribute their shares. All we can do is add a topping of money from the TEN budget; if the Member States stonewall, then nothing will happen. Secondly, I hope that those Member States that can get money from the cohesion fund or the regional fund will use it for ERTMS, but, if they use it to build roads and then complain that the railways are not properly organised and too slow, then all I can say is that it is their own fault. With this report, we have sent out the right message, and the Commission, too, is ready to do its bit, but it is now down to the Member States, to the network operators and the railway companies to make use of this co-funding. If they fail to do so, then we will have moved a good idea forward while achieving nothing, and so let us all hope that the Member States may, perhaps tomorrow, read the reports of what we have been saying and decide, after all, to give this project proper support.

 Madam President, Commissioner, since all the sensible groups in this House have expressed their support for the eCall system, I propose, rather than going once more over the same arguments and the ways in which this system benefits mankind, to concentrate on something on which this system will depend, namely the existence of emergency call centres and the need for these to be modern, for I do think that there are still some gaps in the system of emergency call handling centres in the 25 European states. We should even now be taking a look at the two new states, Bulgaria and Romania, for if this system is to be introduced there, the emergency call systems will have to be in place there too, and so I urge the Commissioner to get down to some serious talking with the Member States about the implementation of the joint decisions. I do not want to make threats, but Community law does state that we possess the power to legislate on matters of road safety, and I do not doubt that that includes emergency call centres, which are an essential precondition for road safety being improved. We should therefore ask the Member States to at last get their skates on, for it is no use us leaving road safety matters primarily to them if they do not implement the joint decisions that have been reached on the subject. Let me appeal to you, then, Commissioner, to get down to some serious talking with the Member States and make every possible use of the options available to the Commission, for a system of this kind is of no value unless proper emergency call systems are available everywhere. As Mr Titley said, it is out in the countryside, rather than in the city, that help is needed when an accident happens, but for that to happen, the emergency call system must be available everywhere. You, Commissioner, thanked the rapporteur for the energy he has invested in this; we should be grateful for the energy with which you are following this project’s progress.

 Mr President, I agree with your question, and we ought to discuss in presidium how we can arrive at a sensible procedure while respecting all the constitutional rights of the institutions. It cannot be right for the Council and Commission together to speak for 25 minutes in a debate for which half an hour is allocated. When are they actually to debate with us? If the two institutions want to debate among themselves, surely they can do that in the Council. I want to come back to the heart of the matter, however. Road safety is not the heart of the matter. Thank you for what you have said, Vice-Chancellor, I agree with you. The heart of the matter is the simple question: how can we pay for security measures in aviation? This problem was raised with the Costa report. It is high time we discussed it. May I remind you that we as the European Parliament agreed in 2002 that the aviation security measures occasioned by terrorism should be paid for by the Member States. Counter-terrorism is a public function and paying for it is therefore also a public function. Then, because we were unable to agree, in the legislative process for the basic regulation in 2002 we settled for at least an interinstitutional agreement that the Commission should present a proposal for the public financing of such aviation security measures. Mr Vice-President, you know how much I respect you, but I do not expect you to submit studies, I expect you to present a clear report with clear legislative proposals. After four years you ought to be in a position – you might at least perhaps be kind enough to deal with that – to say when you will be coming forward with a definite proposal. There were rumours it would be in April. Now they are saying the end of the year. After four years that is no longer tolerable. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I also want to have a clear statement from you: if we are agreed that the additional measures after 2001 were counter-terrorism measures, do you also believe that these measures should be financed by the State? Yes or no? We believe they should be.

 Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, it will come as no surprise to Mr Piecyk that I regard the argument with which he urges rejection as false. We, too, would have liked to see a connection made with the monitoring of working times, but, if you had had your way late on the evening of 6 December, we would have ended up with nothing at all. We would have had nothing to show for the two years we had spent in negotiations, and that is something we regard as unacceptable. In line with the majority opinion as expressed this morning, I am all in favour of updating, modernising and simplifying social security regulations for the benefit of all concerned, and that is why we have to bring that about. That is why I am appealing to all Members of this House to support the compromise when we vote at noon today. All this can be summed up under three headings: improved road safety, better working conditions for drivers and, above all else, helping law-abiding haulage companies to be more competitive rather than sitting back and watching those that sit lighter to the law getting away scot-free with forcing their drivers to work longer hours than are permitted, simply because they are not checked up on. Let all, then, vote to endorse the result we have got, which helps everyone – most of all the people who use roads. There are, though, Commissioner, two points that I would like to make. Thank goodness we have now sorted out this issue with the final date for the introduction of the digital tachograph. Following on from what Mr Romagnoli said, 
I beg you to have more serious talks with the Member States and get them to guarantee that the state infrastructure will be in place and the driver cards made available, for the present state of affairs is unacceptable; the digital tachograph was originally meant to be introduced in August 2004, and we deferred it to May of this year on the sensible grounds that that would be more practicable for industry. Now, though, it turns out that some Member States have still not got this organised, so perhaps you might consider hauling them before the courts.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats fully supports the substance of the rapporteur Mr Ferber's opinion on the European Commission's progress report. By means of the opinion presented by the rapporteur, we want to ensure that the Commission uses the measures announced up to 31 December this year to examine closely all the economic, technological, social and geographic aspects of the increasing openness of the postal market and to inform us of its consequences. To date – I would like to remind you of this, Commissioner, and I am keen to hear your response – not all Member States have, to our knowledge and that of the rapporteur, correctly implemented the Postal Directive on time. I think that it is the Commission's duty to monitor the implementation of the measures taken so far very carefully in each Member State, to hold the Member to their obligations and, if necessary, to refer them to the European Court of Justice. Community law must be applied in all Member States. By way of conciliation, though, I will say that, following the generally positive developments in the postal market for the benefit of the consumers so far, in my opinion the Commission should stick to the joint decision to complete the opening up of postal services in 2009. I would also ask you to really go into the issue of universal service in detail once more. If I may summarise, universal service should mean that we can expect high-quality services at affordable prices in all Member States. That is our goal, but we should take a careful look at that. I will give you an example: If even Germany now deviates from the principle that the postage charge for a standard letter should be the same both internally and to all 24 other Member States, then we have to consider what that means. A standard letter in Germany now costs 55 cent, but the same letter to any other EU country costs 70 cent, the first time there has been a difference. If that means that the postage charged depends on the costs – the distance and the type of delivery – then what is the justification for a universal service? What is left to justify the restriction of competition by a regulated reserved sector? We need to examine carefully the question of what the universal area is, what we want it to guarantee, and whether we need a reserved sector to do that. I am therefore awaiting your assessment and your opinion with great interest. Thank you very much, Commissioner.
 Georg Jarzembowski (PPE-DE

rapporteur
. – (DE) 
Mr President, I am much obliged to the Vice-President for the clarity with which he has spoken and for his willingness to engage with this House’s factual arguments. Let me remind the House of the fact that all the arguments for or against a directive on sea ports have been the subject of intensive debate for months, and that there are two things that were determined as long ago as the Committee on Transport and Tourism’s hearing last June. One is that everyone involved in what goes on in ports – from the port companies to the shipping lines – is in favour of unambiguous rules on transparency to create fair competition between sea ports. The same can be said of all the groups in this House, and I might mention that none of them, in the course of the Transport Committee’s deliberations, have tabled any substantial amendments to the provisions on transparency in the Commission proposal, and so I find it quite incomprehensible that four groups should move that the Commission proposal be rejected outright, for in so doing they are preventing the introduction of the rules on transparency. It follows that, if you are in favour of transparency and fair competition, you cannot under any circumstances throw out that part of the directive. Turning now to the issue of market access, it was clear from the hearing that there are very divergent interests at stake here. The providers of port services, in other words the businesses currently operating in ports – container terminals, watermen, lightermen and so on – do not, of course want these things regulated at European level; they would like to see them remain in the national sphere. Those who use port services, for example shippers and the business sectors that produce and ship goods, believe – and I think they are right to do so – that market access requires a European regulation. That is why I believe that the right, laid down quite clearly in the EC Treaty, to establish oneself and offer services, must apply in sea ports as much as anywhere else and that we need to bring in fair and unambiguous regulations to make sure that it does. I shall now proceed to set out, in brief, just five arguments in favour of European regulation of market access. Firstly, it is to the benefit of new service providers that market access should be facilitated in the first place by means of regular invitations to tender for public leased areas, in the absence of which no new provider of port services will ever have a chance to get into the market. Secondly, it is to the benefit of existing businesses handling goods in ports that these transitional provisions are intended to secure public leases, in theory at least for a period of up to 46 years. What we are proposing does not, then, do anything to jeopardise any business or put even one single job at risk; on the contrary, the long transition periods make it possible for existing businesses to continue operating. Our proposals are the right ones in terms of the interests of the port workers, since we want to delete self-handling from the directive. We take the view that there is no need for European rules on self-handling, since it is not even possible in container traffic, which is the typical activity of a modern harbour. The fact is that there is not one single container vessel that possesses the loading gear that would enable its own crew to load or unload containers. I have already explained how the long transitional provisions secure the port workers’ jobs, and, at the end of the day, there will be no danger of social dumping or of any deterioration in working conditions, for it is stated quite explicitly in this directive that it does not interfere with Member States’ social security arrangements or with free collective bargaining. Fourthly, our proposals are the right ones when it comes to securing the interests of shippers and of the businesses that use them, since, if new businesses come into the market, they can make their choice among the most efficient and best-value service providers and will not – as they currently do in some ports – have to contend with a monopoly situation in which they have to take what is put in front of them. Fifthly, the directive, as amended, is right from the economic and consumer point of view, since it is vital to exports and imports, and of benefit to our consumers, that all ports be regulated even more efficiently and economically. I do therefore believe that fair market access combined with protection for jobs and of the existing businesses’ interests is the best solution. You have before you 140 amendments to that effect, and I urge you to vote on their substance rather than turning away from making a decision based on facts. If you throw out the Commission proposal lock, stock and barrel – that is to say, not just the part that deals with competition, but also the part covering transparency – then there will be no European regulation, and, in its absence, nobody will have the certainty needed to plan ahead or any certainty as to what the law is. Do not let yourselves be swayed by yesterday’s strikes. I thought it inconceivable that it could have been the trade unions that, by the use of false arguments, induced these people to come here. Let us not allow the flares fired off by some of the demonstrators to show port workers in general in a bad light. Let us come to a fair decision in this matter – that is my plea to the House.

 Mr President, Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I can, of course, do no other than agree with those members of my own group who have already spoken, whilst extending my thanks to both rapporteurs. There is one point I would particularly like to highlight. It is a very good thing that there should be such agreement on this issue within this House and with the Commission, and I am very happy about that. I would like to point out, though, that not all the Member States take the same positive view as we do of this idea of a single aviation policy to the benefit of our airlines, those who work for them and those who travel with them, and there are airlines that are often happier to be represented in their dealings with third countries by their national governments rather than by the Commission. That is why we must take care that the Commission’s negotiations with such third countries as, for example, the USA, provide the Member States with evidence that a single European aviation policy is preferable to 25 different policies on aviation with reference to third countries. This is a dimension of which we must never lose sight. We are convinced that it is right and in the interests of the industry, workers in it and of airline passengers, to pursue a single policy with regard to third countries. Several governments, though, remain to be persuaded that this is indeed the case.

 Mr President, Commissioner, that was a terrific speech you gave us, but I am not sure that you have spoken to all the interested parties in the relevant business circles. What you have said may well be true of firms like Maersk, the little outfit that has just bought up PNO, but what primarily interests me, and Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou too, is what happens to the small and medium-sized shipping lines whose situation is quite different from that of PNO, and have not been bought up by Maersk or by any of the other big players whom you might care to name. It is our belief that Regulation (EEC) No 4056/86 cannot be deleted without being replaced. Yes, of course, Commissioner, it must be adapted; that much is perfectly clear, and we all know it. It has to be adapted, and the principal object of the exercise must be to do so in such a way that the small and medium-sized companies are enabled to reach agreements on technical matters and to exchange information in order to be able to see where they stand the best chance of succeeding on the world market. That, Commissioner, is something to which you have paid no attention. A group calling itself the ‘European Liner Affairs Association’ has come up with some good proposals, which contain not only a markedly more limited exemption, but also unambiguous rules to protect small and medium-sized enterprises. There is actually a proposal for the opening of discussion forums with participation not only by shipping lines but also by shippers and the other stakeholders in the sector. We do not want price-fixing any more than we want hostile cartels, and you must never suggest that my colleague Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou does! What we want is technical agreements that make it possible for small and medium-sized enterprises to survive in shark-filled waters, that is to say, alongside the big conglomerates and alliances. If such discussion forums are facilitated, there really is a chance of our managing to keep the small and medium-sized shipping industry afloat. It simply has to be clear to us that, even though our big players dominate business worldwide, we do also have good reason to fear attacks by the Koreans and the Chinese shipping lines. This, Commissioner, is where we have to do something for European shipping!

 Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I think we can all agree that the rapporteur, Mrs De Veyrac, deserves our congratulations for having achieved such a splendid outcome, and having helped the Council and Parliament to find a common solution to these problems within such a short space of time. As I see it, she has provided us with an excellent example of the way in which Parliament, the Commission and the Council can act promptly in similar situations, where there are indications that the safety of passengers is at risk. I hope that the President-in-Office of the Council can give us his word that the Council will reach a final agreement in December at the latest, so that this regulation can enter into force at the beginning of next year. It is crucially important for us to be able to demonstrate the added value of our endeavours where EU legislation is concerned, and the added value of this regulation is plain to see. Our agreement to the drawing up of a joint EU blacklist will avoid a situation in which the public would be left with the impression that Germany was demanding that an airline be banned from flying, while France was refusing to impose such a ban. This would not bring us any closer to our goal of common security. Joint blacklists will spell it out to the public that we are acting together to protect them, and this legislation is therefore an excellent example of European added value. This is about more than just banning airlines from flying, however. Equal importance should also be attached to the second aspect of this issue, namely providing the public with information about what happens if they book a ticket and an airline subsequently intends to use a blacklisted plane. The passenger must be informed of this fact, and he must have a chance to act in response. It has been proposed that passengers should be able either to cancel their tickets and receive a full refund or to exchange their tickets, and these proposals show that we are being very flexible in protecting the public interest. This is a fine outcome. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we disagree on the matter of extending the powers of the European Aviation Safety Agency, but this difference of opinion can wait until the Commission communication is on the agenda. This Agency helps us all to gain a common perspective. Mrs De Veyrac has been an excellent rapporteur, and this has been an example of very speedy lawmaking. I hope that the Evans report will follow suit, so that we can act just as promptly in the case of the treatment and care of airline passengers with restricted mobility, and show the public where our priorities lie.

 Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, fellow sufferers, it is once again our good fortune to be taking part in such an important debate at 9 p.m., alone in our cosy circle of rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs. We should not let this annoy us too much, however, but rather address ourselves to the issue. I believe that the Vice-President has allies among us in favour of the package remaining a package, apart from a lone French voice. We do know, of course, that French voices are sometimes particularly important. Nevertheless, I believe that the majority wishes to, and will, keep the package intact. That is what we shall do tomorrow, and not just as an end in itself. Even I, as a lawyer, shall not put forward the argument that, almost 13 years after completion of the internal market, we really should set about completing the internal market in passenger transport. This argument is a good one for lawyers, but we shall refrain from making it. The intention with the third package is to make long-distance and regional transport more reliable and customer-friendly. That is our goal. We want there to be competition, we want better services for the benefit of passengers. Those are our objectives. That is why the issues of opening up national railway networks on a non-discriminatory basis for use by all railway undertakings, uniform passengers’ rights throughout the EU and the use of the same train drivers belong together. We do not want a situation in which, despite now having locomotives that can cross borders, the train still has to stop at the border to change drivers – only to find that the new driver is on holiday or off sick, and the train remains at a standstill. The aim is not only for people to be able to buy a ticket to anywhere in Europe, but also for them to arrive there quickly. This is why we need the third railway package. Admittedly there were discussions in my group at first, but then we, too, fell in with the line of thought of dispensing with regulations on quality requirements or freight traffic. Since we are opening up the networks for cross-border transport as of 1 January 2006 and for domestic freight traffic as of 1 January 2007, we hope that competition will have indeed developed in two or three years’ time, and that we shall not then need legislation on quality requirements. Competition can already be seen in traffic in the Alpine region, and customers have the choice between the services of two different alliances of railway undertakings. This is why I do not believe that we need any legislation on quality requirements; the market will regulate this. I should now like to introduce several aspects of my report. I do not believe that it is always necessary to break new ground; instead, when it comes to the development of railway undertakings, we should go back to what Parliament decided at second reading of the second railway package. At that time, we decided, by an overwhelming majority, to open up the networks not only for cross-border, but also for domestic rail transport as of 1 January 2008. That was what we called for two years ago; why should we now turn back, I ask myself. To give all the parties involved more time, however, the Committee is proposing that the opening-up be staggered: 1 January 2008 for cross-border rail transport, but 1 January 2012 for domestic rail transport. We all know that, when it comes to negotiations with the Council, 2012 can become 2013 or something else entirely. If, however, Parliament called for all rail networks to be opened up as of 2008 two years ago, it must stay on this course. I hope that the Vice-President comes round to Parliament’s way of thinking and decides to regulate not only cross-border transport, but also transport throughout the internal market. After all, we have to make headway sooner or later. To be frank, I do not wish to see a fourth, fifth or sixth railway package. We should draw a line under it and decide on liberalisation, the opening-up of the networks, customer orientation and competition with this package. Permit me to draw the House’s attention to just two more things. We already have a brake for the opening-up of the networks, and in particular for opening them up for domestic rail transport. The reason is that we share the Commission’s view that it should not be compulsory to open up the networks if this would create difficulties for a regional passenger service, by which we mean not just possible difficulties, but an actual threat to its economic viability. Naturally, it is not our intention for this opening-up of networks to endanger regional transport. I should like to say to my Dutch fellow-Members that there is no need to worry. I do believe that the brake, which you yourselves proposed for cross-border transport, but which is even more important for domestic transport, will enable us to prevent the collapse of domestic regional transport, because there is no obligation to open up the networks in this case. Our fellow-Members from smaller countries can put aside their reservations in this regard. I do not wish to go into detail on our desire to amend Directive 2001/14/EC in order to give high-speed railway lines a better chance of planning for the longer term. By way of conclusion, there is something else to which I should just like to draw your attention. Parliament – with the exception of individual Members right at the back – has always said that the package should remain intact, as the Commission proposed it. That is why we also put back the date for the introduction of this package in plenary. Once we have made our decision, the Council is free to take its own. The least positive experience has been with the Meijer report. Our first reading of this – following a Commission proposal on public transport in 2000 – was in November 2001. The Council has done nothing to date except to deliberately shelve this proposal. The Council is falling short in the performance of its duties; it lacks the courage to address this difficult issue. We have said, however, that these four parts belong together, and they also belong with the proposal on public transport. We have said that we are prepared to bring this issue to a definitive conclusion with a legislative resolution in plenary, as soon as the Council gives us a signal. The Chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism informed us this afternoon that the British Transport Secretary, Mr Darling, has assured us that this package will be kept intact. For this reason, we, too, should take the leap tomorrow and not just vote on the amendments, but also on the legislative resolutions, so that tomorrow afternoon we are able to state our position on the third railway package, to state our opinion. I would appeal to the Council to keep its word, to leave the package intact, to make sound proposals, then we shall be able to make good progress. I hope that, at the Council meeting on 6 October, the British Presidency will actively represent the signal that we are going to give tomorrow, and speed up the work. Amid all the details, let us not forget that we are doing this not for the sake of liberalisation, or because we are self-opinionated; we are doing it in the interests of passengers, because we can see the increasing trend towards passengers taking their cars or using low-cost airlines for long-distance journeys rather than taking the train. In line with our general thinking regarding freight, however – that it must be taken off the roads and put onto the rails – our line of thinking must be to make passengers an offer that tempts them out of cars and aeroplanes and back onto trains.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will start with the warmest of thanks to Mr Queiró for his report, and for his enthusiasm and commitment to foreign tourism, to which it testifies. Commissioner Verheugen quite rightly pointed out that the rapporteur was right to describe tourism as something that can create jobs, for which it has enormous potential, but I would ask him to admit that tourism is a field that the Commission has neglected up to now. It is for that reason that I hope that he has read the report’s demands and will later tell us which of them he endorses. Let me list five things that are called for: the first is an international advertising campaign to attract more tourists from third states to Europe, one that would have to form part of a support package for tourism and be mounted in consultation with the tourist industry. The EU’s embassies overseas can help with this. Secondly, in order for consumers to be better protected and informed, there is a need for the classification of hotel and restaurant standards to be standardised across the EU. Thirdly, I believe there to be a need for the uniform application of VAT at the reduced rate to restaurant services in all the Member States; this is not something that should be done in different ways in different places. Fourthly, national holidays need to be synchronised in order to avoid traffic jams on motorways and overloading of holiday destinations. There needs – and this is my fifth point – to be better coordination of emergency plans between state and private organisations at both the national and European levels, to give tourist protection in the event of natural disasters and against health risks. Those are just five points that I have picked out of Mr Queiró’s wide-ranging report. Fine words butter no parsnips, as they say; it is no use saying that we will promote tourism and that the Commission is right behind the idea if nothing ends up happening, so, Commissioner, perhaps you would be so kind as to tell us something about all the initiatives by the Commission that you intend to support. It is you who have the powers, the Commission that can work within the framework of the industrial policy, it is you who can work within the framework of regional policy, and there are many powers and responsibilities that you can combine for the benefit of tourism, so, Commissioner, I ask you to do something about it.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we could actually do with a double allocation of speaking time in order to respond properly to the excellent speeches by those who have spoken to this topic so far, and it is for that reason that I have no option but to speak in summary form. I think we all agree that the tensions in the Far East have to be taken seriously, whether we are talking about the tension between Japan and China or that between North Korea and Japan. You can take that further, as far as Russia, if you want to include such issues as the four islands that have been occupied ever since the end of the Second World War. It is vitally important that this Europe of ours should make a proper contribution, not merely out of economic considerations, but also with political considerations in mind. After all, we all agree – and I assume that the President-in-Office does too – that we want to promote democracy, human rights and the rule of law, and that we regard our work to these ends as a long-term basis for sound economic relationships. Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner was right to mention the success of the May summit held between Japan and the EU in Luxembourg, but I sometimes get the feeling that members of the Council and the Commission visit Peking three times as often as they visit Tokyo. It would be no bad thing either for them to visit Taipei; after all, both Taiwan and Japan are countries with multi-party democracies, in which human rights are observed and the rule of law prevails. Neither of those things are yet the case in the People’s Republic of China, and there is only a very distant prospect of either of them being so. If we want to demonstrate the need for democracies to cooperate among themselves, then the numbers of visits and contacts would have to be more evenly balanced. What I would very much like the Council to tell us now is what position has been reached in the ongoing deliberations on the lifting of the arms embargo. We in this House insist on three things before this can happen. Firstly, we – like you – expect substantial improvements as regards human rights in China. Secondly, the stand-off between Taiwan and China must be brought to an end. With China threatening Taiwan with over 700 rockets stationed on its coast, this is a flash point to the like of which you do not deliver weapons. To the Commissioner, who, I think, was being rather evasive, I would ask whether the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports is now to be legally binding, and if so, when. That, too, is something we regard as a sine qua non 
if there is to be any sort of talk about lifting the arms embargo. We must do everything in our power to get the countries of Asia to where we are now: the state, sixty years after the end of the Second World War, of having been reconciled with one another. It is for that reason that we should encourage them to press on with the same process of reconciliation, without which there can be no stability and no security.

 Mr President, let me say, on behalf of my group, that the Commissioner’s elucidations of this question were very persuasive. Let it be said that our desire for a joint evaluation of the agreements relating to PNR data is something to be welcomed. We find ourselves in the difficult position of having to hold in a balance the interest not only of every single one of the EU’s Member States but also of the USA in being protected against terrorist acts, as against the need to protect individual citizens’ personal data. The process is a difficult one. I hope that the Americans will actually deliver on the promises they have made to us that the data we supply to them will be collected and evaluated only for the purposes of protection against terrorism, that they will destroy them when they are no longer required, as they have promised to do, and that we will keep each other informed about problems relating to internal security. I think there is a good chance of the agreement between the European Union and the USA producing a result that will not only comply with our provisions on data protection but also give us all less cause to fear terrorist attacks. Let us also, though, look to the future; one thing I regard as important, and of which we must keep on reminding the Americans, is that we have no liking for unilateral security rules, for we want to protect our citizens just as much as the Americans want to protect their own. For that reason, Commissioner, I believe that the right approach is for us, jointly with the Americans, to assess the risks to our passengers and share the results that emerge from that, thereby, and together, making the public safer.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, there are two of Parliament’s statements in this report that I would like to revisit, and they have to do with the foreign and security policy situation in the Far East. It is my belief that the People’s Republic of China, by passing its Anti-Secession Law, has put the region in a much more precarious position. The Anti-Secession Law is something that we should firmly repudiate; by enacting it, the People’s Republic of China is attempting, without any justification, to legitimise its military threats against Taiwan and to acquire the right to attack it. This is in breach of international law, and completely unacceptable. Taiwan’s 23 million citizens have the inalienable right to take their own democratic decisions on their future: on whether they want to be reunited with the mainland or to continue as an independent and sovereign state. We should all be calling on the People’s Republic of China to stop making threatening gestures and instead begin direct dialogue with Taiwan on the basis of mutual recognition in order to bring about détente 
between the two countries and secure peace in the Far East. I am addressing the representatives of the Council when I say that, if this is to happen, the arms embargo on China must not be lifted. The European Council was right to impose it in 1989, and we can see that the position as regards human rights and the rights of minorities has indeed improved, although these are as yet far from adequate. This House has observed on many occasions that the situation in China as regards fundamental civil, cultural, religious and political rights does not even meet the international standards that China itself recognises. I hope that the President-in-Office will take some note of that. Particularly at the present time, and in view of China’s ongoing infringements of human rights, lifting the arms embargo would send completely the wrong message and would also appear to be a reward for the Anti-Secession Law.

 Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, I should first like to pick up on a comment you made towards the end of your speech. There needs to be a sensible number of checks, as any legislation is futile and ineffective if its implementation is not monitored. We should therefore join forces to persuade the Council to accept the proposals contained in the Markov reports, and to ensure that a sufficient number of checks are carried out. To put it quite bluntly, our task must be to protect lorry drivers from their own managers, as it would appear that some are being forced, either directly or indirectly, to drive for excessively long periods of time. This means that they pose a danger both to themselves and to everyone else. At the same time, however, the rules need to be realistic and based on common sense. I believe the Commissioner’s out-of-hand rejection of some of the proposals contained in the Markov report was somewhat over-hasty. Our proposals are a great deal more sensible and easier to implement, in particular those relating to rules on breaks and daily rest periods. These proposals should therefore be backed. I do, however, share your views on the issue of lorries weighing less than 3.5 tonnes. I agree with Mr Piecyk that they too pose a risk, but we must not forget the bureaucracy and costs that would be involved if the rules on tachographs and suchlike were also to apply to these types of commercial vehicle. We should go back to the drawing board on this matter, and we must face facts, Commissioner; your average local milk float, circus caravan or tractor really has no need for a tachograph. You said that we should avoid having too many derogations, yet the derogations we have proposed are based on nothing but a desire to be realistic and to apply common sense. The conciliation procedure for the legislation on tachographs will be brought to a close sometime this autumn, and there would be little point in having a regulation that cannot be applied. Based on my close contacts with industry, it is my personal belief that it is unrealistic to expect all freight forwarders to be able to install tachographs by August of this year, even if certain manufacturers are claiming that they could provide them. I would therefore ask you to go along with our proposals and to set a sensible deadline.

 Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, the rapporteur has, in my view, tabled an excellent report. It is short and concise, and it would be a fine thing if the same could be said of the speeches we will go on to hear. I will do my best to set an example of this myself. The Vice-President stated that the Commission had already taken a number of steps to promote short sea shipping, and I would ask him to regard the rapporteur’s report as a further invitation to engage in dialogue with a view to implementing further measures to promote this form of shipping. The Vice-President also referred to a number of other issues, such as simplified customs and administrative procedures and port development. I should like to focus on just two points. Firstly, I would be interested to hear whether progress is finally being made with the idea of motorways of the sea. A good debate on this issue was held in this House last year following a Commission initiative, but I have my doubts as to whether the Member States are doing their bit by proposing projects. As far as the motorways of the sea are concerned, we only wish to support projects that are useful and workable, and our primary aim must be to ensure that new funding does not have a harmful impact on existing ferry and feeder links. If a perfectly adequate service has long been in existence, it would be pointless to provide fresh funding to build something new in its place. I would therefore be interested to hear how things currently stand, and whether any sensible projects for motorways of the sea have already been proposed that you feel able to support. My second point is that no matter what lengths we go to overall to promote motorways of the sea and short sea shipping, all our good work will be undone if loopholes are repeatedly exploited by lorries. I have heard reports from the Baltic Sea region that it is a great deal cheaper to transport goods by lorry around the Baltic Sea than to use ferry or feeder services to cross it. This is due both to the fact that certain EU Member States do not monitor driving and rest periods, and also to the cheap price of Russian diesel. We must take care not to create something that in practice will be undone by the Member States’ failure to act. I would ask you to take action and to take on board the ideas contained in the report.

 Mr President, I was in agreement with what the previous speaker said – until he got to his last sentence. If, after discussions, it is agreed that our plenary sittings are held in Strasbourg, then that is where they are held, and I love this city; it is a beautiful place. One day, perhaps, we will come to an agreement with the French Government enabling us to have all our plenary sittings in Brussels, but as long as the treaty stands as it is, the present situation is not up for discussion. We should spell it out to the North Koreans that their activities are a menace to the whole security setting in the Far East. South Korea feels itself under threat, and so do Japan and Taiwan, and it is this whole regional security aspect that I think we have to focus on. We must make the attempt to persuade our Chinese friends to use their influence. They may well constantly maintain that they have none, but I believe that to be a diplomatic ploy. Quite apart from any talk about stopping building programmes, the reality is that the only country that can get the North Korean Government to return to the six-party talks is the People’s Republic of China, with the Chinese Communist Party. We have to make it plain to the Chinese that it is in their own interests that the security setting in the Far East should not be disrupted. We also have to bring it home to China that, although we do accept its role in Asia, we do so only if it discharges its responsibilities in a constructive way. Let us then try to get our Chinese friends to make a démarche 
to North Korea.

Madam President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wishes to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Grosch, on his excellent report on the Commission’s proposal for a third Directive on driving licences. He has presented detailed proposals for improvements relating to the future introduction of a uniform European driving licence and, most importantly, has drawn up people-friendly provisions, such as those dealing with caravans and campers. He has also tabled clear proposals for improvements in the realm of so-called driving-licence tourism. The cause of road safety is not served by allowing someone whose licence has been revoked with good reason to obtain a new one immediately in a neighbouring country. In this respect, Mr Grosch has made an excellent job of fleshing out the principle of eliminating licence tourism. There are, however, two points in the report which my group rejects. Like the Commission, Mr Vice-President, we oppose the compulsory exchange of existing driving licences. Road safety is not improved in any way by making people go to a public authority, have a new photograph taken and be issued with a new licence document. At best, such an arrangement facilitates police checks, but it does nothing to improve road safety. If the benefit of simpler police checks is compared with the trouble and inconvenience to which drivers would be put – tens of thousands of them, if not more, who will never drive in another EU country would still be required to obtain a new licence – the inconvenience outweighs any benefits, and my group joins the Commission in opposing such a provision. The second point we reject in the report relates to the compulsory limitation of the validity of licence documents. This does nothing to enhance road safety either. It only means that people have to go to the authorities, have a new photograph taken and be issued with a new licence document, even though, as the rapporteur rightly recognises, the authorisation resulting from the original driving test remains valid. I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to help us by supporting our position for the sake of the people of Europe. We do not want the compulsory exchange of driving licences, and we do not want any limitation of their validity.

 Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, it is now my turn to say something about transport, about which I think the Commission’s communications have had too little to say. You can order everything conceivable via every conceivable kind of electronic connection, but to trade goods – whether a fridge or a computer – you have to actually deliver the thing, and for that you need a proper transport policy. Your Vice-President, Commissioner Barrot, has made a very sensible statement outlining what we need, and I want now to recapitulate the three core issues. I believe that the internal market needs to be made a reality in the railway sector too. For 40 years, the railways have thought there was no such thing and that they could carry on making railway policy at national level. Now is the time to use the Third Railway Package to open up the passenger transport networks, and to bring in a single locomotive drivers’ licence, thereby doing away with the need for trains to stop and change crew at national borders. The only way we will be able to use railways for cross-border transport is if they are fast, efficient and well-organised, and for that the networks need to be opened up, there needs to be a locomotive drivers’ licence, but passengers also have to have proper rights when they are left standing waiting or when their journeys are delayed. The rules on compensation for air travellers are very good, but far more people travel by train, and they are just as entitled to compensation when the railways fail to organise themselves properly. Alongside the railways, there is the issue of the ‘Eurovignette’. Infrastructure costs need to be charged in a fair way, one that also has to be economically sustainable and structured in an environmentally-friendly way. This is an area in which we have to make headway. My final and crucial point, Mr President, is one that I trust you have already taken to heart. We need proper trans-European transport routes, not only as part of the rail and road networks, but also in the inland waterways sector. We really do need cross-border transport routes and a network of all means of transport, so that we can make real advances in the trade of goods. They need to be competitive, they need to be economically sustainable, and they need to be laid out in such a way that they do no damage to the environment.

 Mr President, Mr Nicolaï, Commissioner Patten, while the Council’s representative has been very frank in laying bare the ongoing disputes between two groups within it, I think the important thing for us has to be proper consideration, at the Summit, of the fundamentals of our relationship with China. It is on this that the Presidency should try to agree, while acknowledging that, although there have indeed been improvements over recent years in the way in which human rights are handled in the People’s Republic of China, they have not gone anything like far enough. It is evident from the way in which religious freedom, freedom of assembly and association and the freedom of the press continue to be brutally repressed in the People’s Republic of China that it simply is not enough to cast a veil of economic interest over it. I therefore call on the Council to draw a clear line here and to say that we acknowledge the improvements, but that they are utterly inadequate. China, under its new leadership, must make the first move. I agree with the previous speakers that we cannot lift the arms embargo while prominent representatives of the government in Beijing are threatening Taiwan with the use of armed force, as they did yesterday. It is not acceptable that armed force across the Taiwan Strait should be a means of making policy. Commissioner Patten has always shown us the right way to go. We have always called for political dialogue between the People’s Republic of China and Taiwan – a political dialogue on which both states must embark. I hope that the Chinese political leadership will indeed take the first approach, that of resuming dialogue through association. At a time when the People’s Republic of China is threatening Taiwan with the use of armed force, lifting the arms embargo would send completely the wrong message. I think we are all agreed on that, and, at the Summit, the Council should do some straight talking to that effect.

 The coordinator of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Georg Jarzembowski, makes the following statement, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, in relation to the meeting of the ICAO: The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will abstain in the vote on the joint resolution, as the resolution’s demands are too indiscriminate and as the pressure of time has prevented a nuanced debate, such as these matters require, on these demands with the Member States represented at the ICAO and with the industry and consumers affected. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is firmly of the opinion that further steps to reduce damage to the environment, including that caused by air transport, are necessary at both global and European level. At the same time, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats takes the view that the potential side effects of such steps must be carefully discussed with the industry and consumers concerned. It will also be necessary to take into account the extremely grave economic damage already sustained by European airlines as a consequence of the events of ‘9/11’ and the drastic rise in the price of oil. Hasty reactions by Parliament do not do justice to the seriousness of these issues.

 President. − 
 Thank you so much, Commissione Fischer Boel. It is very kind of you to mention this. It was and is always a pleasure to work with you and with your colleagues in the Commission. Of course, there are some differences, but with you and with Commissioner Piebalgs it has always been a pleasure, and I want to thank you very much on behalf of Parliament and also personally.
 President.  
− Ladies and gentlemen, in a few weeks’ time, between 4 and 7 June, the citizens of the European Union will elect the new European Parliament. For the first time 375 million people from all 27 Member States will be able to take part in the European elections together. For many of you this will be your last week in Strasbourg. For me, too, this is the last week in which I will be allowed to chair the plenary part-sessions. We all know that democracy gains strength through constant change. We do too. Together we have covered a good part of the way towards creating a forward-looking European Community. Together we have been able to achieve a great deal. We have been successful not only during the last two and a half years of my term of office but also in the term of office of my predecessor, Josep Borrell Fontelles. What we have achieved in the last five years has been achieved by all of us. I would like to extend to you all my sincerest thanks for your commitment and for your passion for our common European cause. As the European Parliament, we are the directly elected representatives of the citizens of the European Union. Ladies and gentlemen, we all embody the rich diversity of our European continent and reflect, through our political families, the huge variety of convictions and attitudes. What is more, a few days ago we celebrated the fifth anniversary of the historic enlargement of the European Union, the reunification of our continent on the basis of our common values. In the words of our Berlin Declaration of 25 March 2007, ‘We, the citizens of the European Union, have united for the better’. (Applause)
 The successful integration of Members from Member States joining the European Union in 2004 and 2007 and the adaptation of our parliamentary work to a European Parliament now bigger and more diverse rank among the most significant successes of this parliamentary term. We, the 785 Members of Parliament, have learned to meet each other half way, to learn from each other and to work better with each other. During this time, the European Parliament has gained in experience, strength and cultural richness. Ladies and gentlemen, new Members will soon revitalise the work of Parliament. They will join those who are re-elected in June. I hope that we will continue to have the mutual respect that binds us across all political and national boundaries. In my work in the last two and a half years, I have been guided by a basic feeling for parliamentary work and I have you all to thank for your support, encouragement and counsel. The President is responsible for ensuring that all the rules of the European Parliament are followed and must ensure that these rules apply equally to all Members and are applied uniformly, and that the dignity of our Parliament remains intact. That is what I have striven for. (Applause)
 I would like to say to those entering Parliament that we are only convincing if we preserve the dignity of the European Parliament and always defend it on the basis of our common laws. Today, very few resolutions are adopted in the European Union without the explicit consent and involvement of the European Parliament. To an increasing extent, the European Parliament has developed into the place where, crucially, political compromises are found at a European level. Evidence of this is the adoption of the Services Directive and the Chemicals Regulation, REACH, in recent years. For the 2007-2013 financial perspective, the codetermination of the European Parliament was groundbreaking. The European Parliament was instrumental in ensuring that the necessary funding was provided for programmes such as Erasmus to promote the young generation. Ladies and gentlemen, we have also placed tackling climate change at the top of the political agenda. The fact that we arrived at an acceptable result lent tremendous credence to the European Union for the negotiations at the Conference to be held in Copenhagen in December. Today, we are no longer alone in our endeavour; the new US administration led by President Barack Obama supports many of our proposals. Our task is now to win the hearts and minds of our global partners to support measures to combat climate change. One often hears that others are taking the lead in tackling climate change. We have taken the lead in tackling climate change and, ladies and gentlemen, it is something we can be proud of. (Applause)
 Financial market reform at European level is, in many respects, taking place on the initiative of the European Parliament. Since 2002, Parliament has called for better financial market supervision and regulation. All legislative procedures for better banking and financial supervision and for regulating hedge funds and managers’ salaries should be completed as quickly as possible. The European Parliament has already set many important benchmarks as a result of the resolutions it has adopted. There is still a lot of work to do, however. The newly elected European Parliament must continue this work in a committed and resolute manner in order to find a way out of the crisis on the basis of the social market economy defined in the Treaty of Lisbon and to safeguard the competitiveness of the European economy for the benefit of society against a backdrop of globalisation. Ladies and gentlemen, the overwhelming majority of Members see Parliament as the motor of the European unification process. In the last two and a half years we have revived debate on institutional reform and driven forward the process leading to the conclusion of the Treaty of Lisbon. We also succeeded in ensuring that the basic principles we have always represented are maintained in the Treaty of Lisbon. The Treaty of Lisbon contains the central reforms required to make the European institutions more democratic, transparent and capable of action. We should put all our effort into ensuring that the Treaty of Lisbon can enter into force at the beginning of next year. We are hoping for a positive outcome in the Czech Senate in Prague. (Applause)
 Ladies and gentlemen, Parliament is celebrating its thirtieth anniversary as a directly elected democratic European Union institution. It is now at the heart of a European parliamentary democracy unimaginable in 1979. Together we have advanced parliamentary democracy in the European Union and beyond. The European Parliament and national parliaments are now partners. Our work is complementary. We have deepened our cooperation with national parliaments and held regular meetings to move the important current issues forward together. The development of our relations with parliaments in third countries has always been a core concern of all our efforts. Today, Parliament is a partner respected around the globe, an advocate for human rights and democracy. And it must stay that way. Ladies and gentlemen, I have made every effort to ensure that Parliament is represented, through its President and through representatives of the political groups, in bodies of importance for shaping our common future. The President of the European Parliament now participates in the annual meetings of the Heads of State or Government of the G8 and in summits with third countries, such as the EU-Africa Summit, the EU-Latin America Summit and the EU-US Summit. Tomorrow morning, I will participate in the Troika summit on employment and tomorrow afternoon in the Summit for the inauguration of the Eastern Partnership in Prague. It is also an achievement of this legislative period that the role of Parliament in the European Councils is no longer restricted to the inaugural address by the President. Now Parliament also participates in the institutional and constitutional deliberations of the summits. At the Intergovernmental Conference that led to agreement on the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament was fully involved at the level of the Heads of State or Government through the participation of its President and, at the Intergovernmental Conference itself, through a delegation consisting of three Members. This is a huge step forward. Ladies and gentlemen, the reform of the working methods and procedures of the European Parliament was and still is a major project. To this end, the Conference of Presidents set up a working group equipped with a detailed mandate, in which all Groups were represented. The work was completed successfully. Much – approximately 80% – of what was proposed by the working group has been put into effect and implemented. This includes the reorganisation of the plenary debates, the reform of the legislative process, the improvement of the work done in committee with enhanced cooperation between the committees as well as the possibility of legislative initiative reports or conflicting resolutions. I would specifically like to thank the Chair of the working group, Dagmar Roth-Behrendt, and her – our – colleagues for their special commitment. (Applause)
 Together we have succeeded in adapting the working methods of the European Parliament to changing political circumstances. Now we have modernised procedures and reorganised working methods at our disposal and that is a good basis for the work to be carried out in the new parliamentary term. In the Bureau of the European Parliament we have also tried to improve the administration of Parliament, to make the day-to-day work of Members easier and to modernise the infrastructure for communicating with the citizens of the European Union through the introduction of Web-TV, the prize for journalism, 
the citizens’ prize,
 and the European Charlemagne youth prize. The new Statute for Members, on which we have worked for many years, will come into force in the new legislative period. It is an important contribution to the policy on Members’ finances, transparency and public relations. The adoption of a clear, transparent assistants’ statute is an important step forward and a huge success, for which we have to thank all our fellow Members. Ladies and gentlemen, today I should like to repeat and reaffirm the central idea that, for me, sums up the work of European integration. We are committed to the dignity of every human being. It is the supreme value. It unites us in the community of shared values of the European Union. Human dignity must always be respected – it is the ethical answer to the moral crises in Europe’s past. (Applause)
 For us, this leads to the precept of the unconditional protection of human dignity and the promotion of a dialogue of cultures, which have been guiding principles during my term of office. A lasting impact was made by the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, be it dialogue with the Euro­Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, encounters between young people of different faiths – including from Israel and Palestine – or the Arabic and African weeks held in the European Parliament. We have laid the foundation of a lasting dialogue, which must also direct, inspire and commit us in the future. A peaceful settlement in the Middle East is also important for peaceful coexistence between Christians, Jews and Muslims as well as the people of the European Union and of countries across the globe. Gaza and the West Bank are not in the back of beyond; they are on our doorstep on the Mediterranean. We must be more self assertive on the international scene and contribute to peace and stability in the Middle East. As Members of the European Parliament, we can offer an additional perspective in Middle East relations, as we can think and act outside conventional diplomatic channels. With this in mind, I have campaigned for a working group to be set up to deal with the Middle East crisis. Especially in the light of new developments in the Middle East it is important that we resolutely support a two-State solution – Israel within secure borders and a Palestinian State within secure borders. We must not allow these principles to be called into question. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say that, in our day-to-day work, we deal with many issues, sometimes relating to very specific circumstances. We should never forget our roots or lose sight of the values that bind us. Today’s free, peaceful and socially committed European Union was a long time in the making. We must breathe life into the foundations on which the European Union is based. That is why I am particularly thankful to you for your encouragement and continuing support for my initiative to establish a ‘House of European History’. In particular, I should like to thank not only Vice-President Miguel Angel Martínez Martínez for his unflagging support but also my fellow Members in this Chamber. The ‘House of European History’ will be used as a place where our European identity can be remembered and renewed. The basic decisions for establishing the House have already been taken. The constituent meetings of the two oversight bodies were held yesterday. With your support – if I am re­elected as a Member of the European Parliament on 7 June of course – I will devote myself to the task of ensuring that the ‘House of European History’ is completed by the end of the next legislative period in 2014. In 2014 we will be commemorating the one hundredth anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War. A hundred years later we are living in a new Europe of peace, freedom and unity. Many people support us in our constant striving. In particular I thank all the committed staff in the administrative services of the European Parliament, especially our new Secretary-General, Klaus Welle, and his deputy, David Harley, without whose commitment, expertise and dedication our political work would not be possible. (Applause)
 You are worthy of our thanks, our support and our appreciation. I extend my sincerest thanks to my personal staff in my Cabinet, but, above all, I thank you, fellow Members, especially the Bureau and the chairmen of the political groups, for your trustful cooperation. We have just had another meeting of the Conference of Presidents. On Monday evening we had a meeting of the Bureau, and we will have another meeting today. On substantive issues of European democracy, hardly any contentious, really controversial decisions were taken, and we agreed on the basic issues. A bond of trust was created, for which I am sincerely thankful. We have achieved a great deal together and we must once again gain the trust of our electorate. We do this, firmly convinced that this is the historically correct way towards European unification. The upcoming election campaign gives us the opportunity to speak with citizens about why the European Union is necessary. I should like to call on all citizens to vote in the elections and to cast their votes for the future of Europe in the 21st century. Much work awaits the newly elected Parliament. This includes helping to overcome the economic and financial crisis, implementing a European energy policy, moving to a low-CO2
 economy, providing more security for the citizens of Europe and peace and stability across the globe. Our work has provided a good basis for the newly elected Parliament to build on. My work over the last two and a half years as President of the European Parliament has been a tremendous challenge, and I have carried it out gladly and with dedication and will continue to carry it out until 14 July. It is a great privilege to be at the service of Europe. I thank you most sincerely for placing your confidence in me and for every moment of this collaborative effort in working towards a unified Europe. I wish you all the best for the future. (Sustained applause)
 President. − 
 Thank you, Mr Wurtz. Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of you all I should like to thank Mr Wurtz, who has been a Member since 1979 and will now leave Parliament. Our thanks also go to three other fellow Members, who have been here since 1979 and will now leave: Klaus Hänsch, a former President, Ingo Friedrich, former Vice-President and Quaestor, and Karl von Wogau, former Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and currently Chairman of the Subcommittee on Security and Defence. I should like to extend my sincere thanks on behalf of you all to these four and to all other departing fellow Members for their huge commitment. Thank you very much. (Loud applause)
 President. − 
 That you can make such a speech shows that this is a free and democratic European Parliament! (Applause)
 President.  
− We have taken note of it.
 President.  
− Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I warmly thank you for your largely favourable reviews. I wish all my fellow Members who are not standing for re-election all the best for the future and I hope that we will meet again. To all my fellow Members who are standing for re-election and who are re-elected, I should like to say that I hope that we, provided of course that I am re-elected, will continue our good work. What the chairmen of the political groups have said today has encouraged me to continue along the path towards a unified Europe. Many thanks to you all and I hope we will all see each other again. (Loud applause)
 President. 
 – The next item is voting time. (For results and other details of the vote: see Minutes)
 President.  
– Thank you very much, Mr Parish. When you go back to your national Parliament, we wish you the same zest for work that you had here in the European Parliament.
 President.  
– What I was about to say was that this is the last vote with me in the chair. I would like to say a special word of thanks to Paul Dunstan to my left, who has done his job so splendidly over the years. (Loud applause)
 Paul, I would like to tell you, together we have made few mistakes −
 sometimes I have made them, sometimes you. However, we were an unbeatable team. I give you my sincere thanks.
 President.  
– The next item is the statements of the Council and of the Commission on the preparation of the European Council on 18 and 19 June.
 President. − 
 I declare resumed the session suspended on Friday 24 April 2009.
 President.  
− Ladies and gentlemen, a few days ago marked the fifth anniversary of the biggest enlargement in the history of the European Union. On 1 May 2004, seventy-five million people from ten countries in Central and Eastern Europe, as well as the Mediterranean – namely Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Malta and Cyprus – expressed their pleasure at becoming citizens of the European Union. This enlargement was followed in 2007 by the accession of Romania and Bulgaria. The fact that this was possible was one of the most amazing developments of our time. After the people of Central and Eastern Europe had suffered sixty years of oppression, the enlargement of the EU represented the completion of the reunification of our continent, based on the shared values of freedom, democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights and human dignity. As a result of this process, the EU has gained in strength, diversity and cultural richness. The enlargement process was, and is, an enriching experience for every single Member State, as well as for the EU as a whole. Five years after that historical moment, enlargement has proved to be a great success for the EU. Its significance for the everyday lives of our citizens has continued to increase. After the servitude of Communism, the enlargement process contributed to making democracy a reality and to strengthening stability on our continent. Enlargement improved the standard of living in the new Member States and provided a powerful stimulus for the whole European economy, as the old Member States also benefited from the new export and investment opportunities, as well as a larger market. In essence, the accession of twelve new countries has strengthened the position of the EU worldwide, and has lent it more weight as an international political and economic actor. During the five years that have passed since enlargement, we in the European Parliament, and the other institutions of the European Union, have succeeded in integrating our new members. We have learnt to meet each other half way and to work together more closely. However, a larger and more diverse EU requires closer cooperation and the a greater capacity to take action. The Treaty of Lisbon contains the core reforms necessary to adapt the EU’s institutions to the consequences of enlargement and to place them in a position to meet the challenges we face. Even if the discussion about the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon has yet to be completed, we should be confident that we will have a positive result at the beginning of next year and we are hoping for a positive result in the Czech Senate next Wednesday. (Applause)
 Ladies and gentlemen, we should be extremely pleased that we are part of this community today and, as it is so beautifully put in the Berlin Declaration of 25 March 2007: ‘we have united for the better’. We have cause to be pleased and thankful. Now we must turn to a rather worrying fact: I wish to express our profound concern regarding the tragic situation facing the US-Iranian journalist Roxana Saberi, who has been sentenced to eight years in prison for allegedly spying on behalf of the US, and is currently being held in the Evin prison in Tehran. On behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to join the President of the European Council, and the President of the US, in demanding Roxana Saberi’s immediate and unconditional release. (Applause)
 The case of Roxana Saberi reflects the dramatic overall situation in Iran in terms of human rights, which, since 2005 – especially in relation to civil and political rights – has continued to deteriorate, in spite of the fact that, within the framework of existing international instruments, Iran has made a commitment to promoting and protecting human rights. The sentencing of Mrs Saberi comes at a critical moment: two months before the presidential elections in Iran, and only a short time after efforts were initiated by the US and the EU to improve relations with Iran. I am deeply concerned that, in the light of the political developments underway, Mrs Saberi could be used as a bargaining chip, and I would like to condemn in the strongest possible terms a move that is so clearly politically motivated. I would like to assure Mrs Saberi’s family of our solidarity and the strong commitment of the European Parliament to ensuring unconditional respect for human rights and democracy in Iran and throughout the world. (Applause)
 I would like to add that we have been informed that a young woman in Iran, who was accused of having committed a crime when she was a minor, has now been executed. This is contrary to all the rules of international law and we raise our voices against this crime. (Applause)
 Finally, I would like to inform you that after the tragic events which took place in Appeldoorn, in the Netherlands, last week, I have conveyed, on behalf of all of us, our deepest condolences to the Dutch Queen, the families of the victims and the Dutch people, and that, across Europe, we stand shoulder to shoulder with our Dutch friends. These were some items of news. We will now return to our usual business.
 President.  
The final version of the draft agenda for this sitting, as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 30 April 2009, pursuant to Rule 132 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed. The following amendments have been proposed: Wednesday:
 The GUE/NGL Group has requested that the joint statement on the Leinen, Dehaene, Brok, Guy-Quint and Kaufmann reports on the Treaty of Lisbon be removed from the agenda.
 President.  
– The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
 President. − 
 You are speaking in a free Parliament. If the Parliament was not free, you would not even have been able to make that speech. (Applause)
 President.  
– Thank you very much, Mr Pannella. I remember well that, when we were elected in 1979, you tabled thousands of amendments – back then still in hard copy. In the meantime, however, you have left us once, while I have remained here the whole time. You returned to work in Parliament in Rome.
 President. − 
 If you would allow me this comment, I think she was, and is, a great lady. She was a prime minister who agreed that the legislation concerning the single market could be done by majority voting. So Margaret Thatcher agreed to majority voting in the Council: this was a great decision.
 President.  
– Thank you very much, Mr Pannella. Your words do not contradict what I said. I am satisfied that between 1996 and 1999 you were absent from the European Parliament. You were elected, as you stated, and that does not contradict what I said. I would like to explicitly assure you of my respect for your activities and your work in the European Parliament.
 President.  
– Thank you, Mrs Gill. This is also the last time that I will preside over the one-minute speeches. I have always tried to allow as many people to speak as possible. We have often been able to get through the entire list – as we were indeed able to do this evening – for it is one of the privileges of the MEPs to be able to speak, and Monday evenings always provide an opportunity to do so. Therefore, I would also like to thank you sincerely for what you have told us. That concludes this item.
 President.  
− The next item is a statement by the Commission on the flu epidemic.
 President. − 
 Mr Deputy Prime Minister and representative of the Presidency of the European Union, Mr Nečas, Commissioner Rehn, honourable rapporteurs and committee chairmen, ladies and gentlemen. Today we have the pleasure of jointly signing two important packages, the climate and energy package and the package for an integrated maritime policy for the European Union. This is the high point of the consistent work which we have carried out with the Council and the Commission. In adopting these two legislative projects, the European Union is proving that it is able to act decisively in order to jointly overcome the challenges in the core sectors of sustainable development, environmental protection and safety at sea. This public signing will help to emphasise the importance of European legislation to European citizens. In the climate and energy package, Parliament and the Council have laid the basis for the European Union to achieve its climate targets by 2020 and to continue to play a leading role in the fight against climate change. The climate package includes important legal frameworks which will help, for example, to improve the emissions trading system or efforts by Member States to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and also to promote renewable energies or carbon storage techniques. The rapporteurs Mrs Doyle and Mrs Hassi are here with us, or so I assumed; at least I can see Mrs Hassi. This package will give the European Union the necessary credibility in the run-up to the international conference due to take place in Copenhagen in December and during negotiations on a comprehensive and binding agreement. As far as maritime transport is concerned, Parliament and the Council reached agreement on eight dossiers during the course of conciliation. That is the result of intensive work lasting over three years. This outcome is also proof of the strong pressure exerted by the European Parliament to ensure that disasters at sea, such as the accidents involving the Erika 
in 1999 and the Prestige 
in 2002, are prevented in future by improving safety at sea. Today we can see that many of the proposals by the Temporary Committee on Improving Safety at Sea set up by the European Parliament have become law. Thanks to these specifications, the inspection and surveying of ships, the supervision of maritime shipping and the insurance of ships owners have been improved, mandatory insurance has been introduced and investigation requirements and liability in the event of an accident have been strengthened. I am delighted to see that the rapporteur Mrs Doyle has now joined us. To close, allow me to express my thanks to the Czech Presidency, the Commission, the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and the Committee on Transport and Tourism and, above all, their chairmen and rapporteurs, who all worked intensively on these important legislative acts. My thanks in particular to you, honourable members, for attending the signing today of these important legislative projects. I am particularly delighted that two group chairmen have honoured us with their presence here at noon today. Thank you for that. I should now like to invite the President-in-Office of the Council to take the floor.
 President. − 
 Thank you Minister. I should now like to ask you and Commissioner Rehn and the rapporteurs to come to the table where I and Minister Nečas will sign the acts in your presence. (Signature of acts)
 President 
. − The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the conclusions of the G20 summit.
 President.  
− Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to welcome you all most warmly. I am particularly pleased that we are joined by Czech Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Karel Schwarzenberg. Mr Schwarzenberg, I wish you a very warm welcome to the European Parliament. (Applause)
 The next item is voting time. (For results and other details of the vote: see Minutes)
 President.  
− We are pleased when the Commission praises our work; this should always be the case.
 President. − 
 I declare resumed the session suspended on Thursday 2 April 2009.
 President.  
− Ladies and gentlemen, in the worst earthquake in Italy in recent decades, 295 people in the region of Abruzzo lost their lives in a most terrible way. Worst hit was the city of L’Aquila. We are all horrified by the violent power of this natural disaster and its tragic consequences. Up to 40 000 people were made homeless by the main quake and numerous aftershocks. It is estimated that one in three houses in the Province of L’Aquila, which was particularly badly affected, has been destroyed or damaged. On behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to take the opportunity at today’s plenary session to express our deepest sympathy with all of the victims of this terrible earthquake. I would also like to offer on behalf of everyone here our deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of those who have died as well as our solidarity with Italy, its citizens and authorities at this sad time. Our thoughts are with those who lost their lives, were injured or made homeless and everyone else affected by this disaster. I would ask you to rise from your seats in silent remembrance. (The House rose and observed a minute’s silence)
 Thank you.
 President.  
− The final version of the draft agenda, as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 16 April pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed. The following amendments have been proposed: Tuesday:
 The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has asked for the report by Mr Hökmark on a Community framework for nuclear safety to be taken off the agenda.
 President.  
− The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has requested that the vote on the motion for a resolution on the opening of international negotiations in view of adopting an international Treaty for the protection of the Arctic be postponed.
 President.  
− The Union for Europe of the Nations Group has requested that a Commission statement on the earthquake in the Italian region of Abruzzo be inserted into the agenda.
 President.  
− Mrs Lulling, I have just been informed that rosé wine is scheduled to be discussed in May. There will be sufficient speaking time then, something which would not be the case today.
 President.  
− Mr Vakalis, that sort of request needs to be made an hour before the start of the sitting. I have been told that this was not the case. It relates to Rule 132. I would recommend that we deal with this in May, otherwise we will not be able to proceed on the basis of the Rules of Procedure.
 President.  
− Mrs Lulling, the President does not make this decision alone, I follow the Rules of Procedure. The decisive factor is Rule 132, by which we are bound. The request should have been made an hour before the sitting. I will recommend to the Conference of Presidents that we consider this matter in May. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has requested that a Commission statement on genetically modified maize – MON 810 be inserted into the agenda.
 President.  
– The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
 President.  
− Mr Davies, you can be sure that in this case, too, the matter will be dealt with in accordance with the law.
 President.  
− Thank you very much. Parliament’s will is always decisive. We will consider what you had to say in the next meeting of the Bureau.
 President. − 
 Thank you, Mrs Záborská. We will take care of this matter.
 President. − 
 I welcome to the European Parliament a delegation from Rwanda headed by the Minister for External Affairs and Cooperation, Mrs Rosemary Museminali. Mrs Museminali is accompanied by the Chairman of the Senate Committee for External Affairs, Mr Valence Munyabagisha, by the Vice-President of the Chamber of Deputies, Mr Jean Damascène Ntawukuriryayo, and by the Senior Director for Europe, the United States, the UN and international organisations in the Foreign Ministry, Mr Balthazar Rutsinga. On behalf of the whole of Parliament, I wish the delegation a very warm welcome! (Applause)
 President.  
− The next item is voting time. (For results and other details of the vote: see Minutes)
 President.  
– If there are no objections to what Mrs Prets has proposed, we will, of course, check the text once more very carefully on this basis.
 President.  
– Mrs Angelilli, the debate is over. Anyone who does not wish to support Mrs Vălean’s motion can stand up. Forty Members would have to rise to oppose the motion, and no explanation would be given. (Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)
 President.  
− I see that Mr Landsbergis is indicating that – should he find himself making oral motions again in future – he will do as you have just asked.
 President.  
– I would like to bring to your attention the fact that Mr Nassauer and Mr Szájer have signed the joint motion for a resolution on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. – Before the vote on paragraph 3:
 President.  
– Ladies and gentlemen, just to make it clear what it is that we are now voting on, we cannot refer this back to committee as it did not come from a committee, but we can postpone the vote. This is what the Rules of Procedure dictate.
 President.  
– I declare resumed the session suspended on Thursday 26 March 2009.
 President.  
− Ladies and gentlemen, I am saddened and dismayed to have to inform you today that, last weekend, more than 300 people were drowned when a number of refugee boats went down in the Mediterranean off the coast of Libya. These boats were carrying people from North and sub-Saharan Africa. Some of the refugees were rescued by the Egyptian and Libyan authorities, and some bodies have been recovered, but hundreds of people are still missing. I would like, on behalf of the European Parliament, to say how deeply shocked and saddened we are by this event. Over the last two years, the European Union has been experiencing an increase in immigration via the Mediterranean, and the economic crisis means that we can expect to see significantly more people fleeing poverty in Africa. The large numbers of refugees that tragically lose their lives when attempting to reach the European Union threaten to turn the Mediterranean into a huge open-air graveyard; it is up to us to find solutions to put an end to these tragedies. I would ask you now to observe a minute’s silence in memory of the dead. (The House rose and observed a minute’s silence) Thank you.
 President.  
− Ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure to be able to welcome the 2008 winner of the Nobel Prize for Medicine, Professor Luc Montagnier, who is seated in the gallery. I wish you a very warm welcome! (Applause)
 I am also delighted, today, to welcome a delegation from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). This delegation comprises 15 members of its ad hoc
 committee on direct elections and additional powers. They are on an investigative trip to learn from the European Parliament’s experience in this area. I hope you have an excellent stay here and that our parliaments will work even more closely together in future. I wish you a very warm welcome! (Applause)
 President.  
– The next item is the report (A6-0140/2009
) by Janusz Onyskiewicz, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the new EU-Russia agreement (2008/2104(INI)

 Ladies and gentlemen, we have noted the internal political situation in the Czech Republic. I should like on behalf of all of you to state that this should not affect the work of the Czech Presidency and that we must have the will to ensure that work continues. We support the Czech Prime Minister, the President of the European Council, in his work to make a success of the Czech Presidency. I should like – and I trust that I can say this on behalf of all of you – to encourage the President of the European Council to pursue the ratification process for the Treaty of Lisbon in his country and in other countries where things still need to be done. We have been working on this treaty for the reform of the European Union for 10 years since the decisions were taken in Nice and we want to be able to take the final difficult steps so that this Treaty can hopefully enter into force in early 2010. We need the Treaty of Lisbon for greater democracy, so that the European Union has more freedom of action and for greater transparency. (Applause)
 The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the conclusions of the European Council on 19-20 March 2009.
 President.  
−
 Thank you, Mr President-in-Office of the European Council, for your determination to continue the work of the Presidency despite the difficult situation in your country.
 President.  
−
 Mrs Bobošíková, democracy also means that all democrats can express themselves on procedures in all countries of the European Union and beyond. That too is democracy.
 President.  
−
 Thank you Mr President-in-Office of the European Council. You take with you our good wishes that you will be able to discharge in full your duties as President-in-Office of the European Council and will do everything to achieve agreement on the Treaty of Lisbon in your country also. With these good wishes we thank you for your presence here this morning.
 President.  
−
 Thank you, Mrs Harms. You are quite right. We are all sinners – some more than others.
 President.  
−
 My dear sir, we are against monetary inflation and we are also against speaking time inflation.
 President.  
−
 Mr Vondra, many colleagues have thanked the Czech Presidency for its contribution. I did so at the beginning, in the presence of Prime Minister Topolánek. I would like to thank you for your very committed personal contribution. We want to encourage you to continue as you have just said, so that the Czech Presidency will be as successful in its second half as it was in its first half. Good luck for the continuation of your work.

 Ladies and gentlemen, dear colleagues, it is a great pleasure to welcome here this afternoon the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Gordon Brown. Welcome, Prime Minister, to the European Parliament. (Applause)
 The Prime Minister will make a statement to the European Parliament on the preparations for next week’s G20 Summit. This summit meeting, which will take place in London on Thursday 2 April 2009, comes at a critical movement in the handling of the current international economic and financial crisis. It offers a vital opportunity for the leaders of both the industrialised world and the emerging economies to work together on a common agenda for immediate economic stability and longer-term recovery. The London Summit needs to agree on the macroeconomic policies and regulatory structures that can get us through the current crisis and put in place a better, more sustainable framework for the future. As Chairman of the G20, Gordon Brown has been offering active international leadership at what is proving to be one of the most difficult times in recent history. The speed with which he has helped develop the G20 as a new tool of international economic governance is both encouraging and impressive. The Prime Minister has also made a strong and positive impact in showing how the United Kingdom can work effectively with its partners in the European Union, as together we find innovative solutions to the many challenges we face in common. I have always believed that it is vital that Britain plays a committed role as a central player in the European Union. (Applause)
 Prime Minister, we strongly welcome your determination to play such a role. I have great pleasure in giving the floor to the British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown. (Applause)
 President. − 
 Prime Minister, on behalf of the European Parliament, I want to thank you for that very remarkable speech here in the European Parliament. (Applause)
 Now, it is a pleasure to invite the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, to make his contribution.
 President. − 
 Colleagues, the lively debate today has shown the importance that we in the European Parliament attach to ensuring a successful outcome to the G20 Summit. I know that the Prime Minister has to leave shortly to go to New York for further preparations for next week’s summit. Prime Minister, we are very happy that you were able to join us this afternoon, and wish you every success in the important work you are engaged in. Welcoming a British Prime Minister to the European Parliament is always a very exciting occasion. Today’s excellent debate has been no exception. Prime Minister, thank you very much indeed. (Applause)
 President.  
– I declare resumed the session suspended on Thursday, 12 March 2009. ***
 First, I would like to welcome the new Secretary-General of the European Parliament, Klaus Welle, who is sitting on my left, and to wish him all the best in his endeavours. (Applause)
 On my right is David Harley, the Deputy Secretary-General. He represents, so to speak, continuity within the Secretariat. I would also like to wish him all the best. (Applause)
 President.  
– Ladies and gentlemen, I have been asked to make the following statement. This week marks the 60th
 anniversary of the deportation of hundreds of thousands of citizens from the Baltic states. On the night of 24 March 1949, a wave of Soviet deportations began, during which tens of thousands of Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians were forcibly expelled from their homelands. They were robbed of their civil and human rights, and perished as a result of the hard, inhuman conditions they faced in the Soviet prison camps. Almost every family in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, as well as in other former Soviet republics, suffered as a result of the horrific violence perpetrated by the totalitarian, Communist regime. Almost every family had relatives who went missing in Siberia, persecuted by the KGB or who were incarcerated and oppressed. The events we are talking about did not take place in some dark, distant past. They remain vivid memories for many people who, today, are EU citizens. Thus, it is our duty, on the basis of our common values, and in order to commemorate the many victims of these deportations, to clearly and decisively condemn these abhorrent crimes perpetrated by the totalitarian, Communist regime in the Soviet Union. For we owe it to the victims to assess the past in an objective, in-depth and careful manner, as reconciliation can only ever be based on truth and remembrance.
 President.  
– Today, it is my honour to welcome a delegation of the Pan-African Parliament to our Parliament. As you all know, the Pan-African Parliament is to the African Union what the European Parliament is to the European Union. I am particularly pleased to welcome Mr Khumalo and his parliamentary colleagues here today, as it gives me an opportunity to thank him and his colleagues, and thereby also the President of the Pan-African Parliament, Mrs Mongella, for the welcome I received in October 2008, during my visit to the Pan-African Parliament, as well as for the invitation to speak at the plenary session of the Pan-African Parliament. Once again, I would like to sincerely bid you all welcome. I am very happy that you are here with us today. (Applause)
 President. - 
 Mrs Frassoni, as you yourself were present, I am sure you will recall that we discussed this matter at the Conference of Presidents. There was only one objection with respect to 15 July, which came from you. All the other group chairmen shared the view expressed in my statement before the Council. In any case, you may read the exact wording I used in my speech. The speech is available to all MEPs and to the public.
 President.  
– The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
 President. − 
 It is always nice to see the British Conservatives fully on board the European boat, and totally at our side. Thank you so much, and I promise to be on my best behaviour.
 President.  
– Mr Davis, at its meeting last Wednesday, the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, which I myself chaired, adopted a resolution on the tragic situation in the Middle East. I would like to remind you of this fact. It is worth taking note of this resolution. Thank you for your comments.
 President.  
− The next item is voting time. (For the outcome and other details of the vote: see Minutes)
 President.  
− Before the last vote, which is always unruly, I would like to say something. This is the last plenary sitting in which our Secretary-General, Harald Rømer, will participate. I expressed the thanks of the European Parliament at length on your behalf at the reception two days ago. I would also like to do that here in plenary by way of conclusion: thank you very much Harald Rømer for your service to the European Parliament, which spans several decades. (Loud applause)
 (Protests)
 Anyone who has worked for the European Parliament for 36 years deserves well of the European Parliament. Our warmest thanks, Harald Rømer. (Protests)
 To those who are heckling now, I would like to say that I hope that your parents do not discover how you are behaving here. (Applause)

 President.  
− Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make a statement on the occasion of the fifth European Day for the Victims of Terrorism. It is a day which must remain in our memory and a day on which we commemorate all the innocent victims of terrorism. This weekend, two soldiers in the county of Antrim in Northern Ireland were murdered by the Real IRA and on Monday, a policeman was shot in the county of Armagh. The policeman who was killed was married and had children. This barbaric act of terrorism has once again torn a family apart and brought with it unimaginable suffering. Yesterday, at least ten people died in a suicide bomb attack in southern Sri Lanka and more than twenty were seriously injured. On behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to express my outrage at these abhorrent attacks on innocent people and send my deepest condolences to the families of the victims. They will forever remain in our memories. Today, we in the European Parliament would like to speak out loudly and clearly against the indiscriminate violence of terrorism. We condemn utterly the senseless destruction of human life, the deaths of entire families as a result of blind fanaticism, which causes people to kill their fellow human beings and to trample human dignity underfoot. Terrorism is a direct attack on freedom, human rights and democracy. Terrorism is an attempt to destroy by means of indiscriminate violence the values which unite us in the European Union and within our Member States. These acts of terrorism shock us all. They cause us deep and heartrending pain, but they cannot and will not destroy the foundations of the democratic society which is based on our shared values. Terrorism is a crime which deserves no leniency. Terrorism represents one of the greatest dangers to the security, stability and democratic values of the international community. It is a direct attack on our citizens, on all of us. The European Parliament plays an active role in combating terrorism and in supporting the victims of terrorist attacks. We cannot repeat often enough that there is no justification for terrorism. For this reason, we must continue to work together to fight terrorism by applying the principles of the rule of law and using all the force of the law. Today in the European Parliament, all our thoughts are with the victims of terrorism, wherever in the world they died. We would like to express our solidarity with them. I would like to ask you to remember in silence the victims of the Real IRA and of the suicide bomb attack in Sri Lanka. (The House rose and observed a minute’s silence)
 Ladies and gentlemen, the great European, Jean Monnet, one of the founding fathers of European integration, died thirty years ago on 16 March 1979. On the occasion of the 30th 
anniversary of his death, I would like briefly to honour and recognise his legacy and his life’s work in the cause of European integration at the start of this plenary sitting of the European Parliament. Today we remember the priceless legacy of a man, who, together with Robert Schuman, one of the architects of the reconciliation between Germany and France, took the first step towards establishing a community with a common destiny based on peace, understanding, democracy and cooperation among the people of Europe. Now, at the beginning of the 21st 
century, the principles highlighted by Jean Monnet and the methods he used to implement them have lost none of their relevance. On the contrary, their importance is obvious to us all. The major challenges presented by globalisation, the economic and financial crisis and global warming will cause Europeans to work even more closely together to provide an effective defence for our shared values and our interests in the world. Jean Monnet would, of course, welcome the progress made in the Treaty of Lisbon towards a democratic European Union which is capable of action and of facing the challenges of the 21st 
century. And finally, it is important to mention that it was the Action Committee for a United States of Europe established by Jean Monnet which, among other things, proposed direct elections to the European Parliament. In the last thirty years since the death of Jean Monnet, this dream has become an impressive reality with the creation of the parliamentary dimension of the European Union. We are all the heirs of this great European, Jean Monnet, and his work continues to have a lasting impact. It has resulted in fundamental changes to the relationships between the European states and still influences the lives of all of our citizens today. On the occasion of the 30th 
anniversary of Jean Monnet’s death, I would like us to think about the task ahead of us and our obligations for the future, which are to commit to continuing the great work started by Jean Monnet of unifying our continent.
 President.  
– The next item is the Joint Debate on the Council and Commission statements: Preparation for the European Council (19 and 20 March 2009), - the report (A6-0063/2009
) by Mrs E. Ferreira, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on a European Economic Recovery Plan (2008/2334(INI)
), - the report (A6-0052/2009

 President.  
− Nigel Farage, we might not always be happy in our European family, but you belong to the family as well.
 President.  
− Ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to ask for your understanding and to apologise for the fact that the session is starting so late, but I was only told two minutes ago that I will be asked to make a statement on a very sad event. I would like to make this statement now with your consent. It is with great sadness and outrage that we have heard today about events in the town of Winnenden in Baden-Württemberg in Germany, where fifteen people were tragically killed at the Albertville secondary school. The perpetrator, a seventeen-year-old former student at the school, later committed suicide. During a shootout at a supermarket in the town, two policemen who were in pursuit of the perpetrator were injured. On behalf of the European Parliament I would like to express my deepest condolences and my solidarity with the families and all the relatives of the victims, who are innocent young students and three teachers from the school. This tragedy takes place only six months after a similar terrible gun rampage at a school in Kauhajoki in Finland. As responsible politicians in the European Union and in all the Member States, it is our task to do everything we possibly can to ensure that acts like this are anticipated at an early stage and prevented from occurring, if this is something that we can influence. We are also shocked by another tragic event in the state of Alabama in the United States, where a gunman on the rampage shot at least ten people before turning his gun on himself. I would like once again to express on behalf of everyone here our deepest sympathy and our solidarity with the victims and their families. I would be grateful if you would take time to remember those who have been killed. (The House rose and observed a minute’s silence)
 President.  
– I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 19 February 2009.
 President.  
− Ladies and gentlemen, I have chosen to speak in the language of the country in which this terrible occurrence took place.
 President.  
− Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot invite all Irish Members to speak. I have spoken on behalf of us all, and that should be sufficient. Do you agree that this has been a worthy tribute to those who lost their lives? Thank you. I also have a brief statement to make on yesterday’s International Women’s Day. To mark the occasion, I wish today to extend a particular welcome to all the female Members of this House and give them an emphatic vote of thanks for their commitment. I also wish to advocate that we do our utmost to make the principle of gender equality a reality at both European and international level. A hundred years ago, 15 000 women demonstrated in New York for the recognition of their dignity and rights. We pay tribute to their legacy today. There is no doubt that a great deal has been accomplished since then in terms of the recognition and protection of women’s rights and the promotion of equal opportunities for men and women in all areas of society. We must not let up in our endeavours; a great deal more must be done to realise gender equality within the European Union and also to increase the participation of women in work, civil society and politics. In the opinion of the European Parliament, there is scope for further increasing the present degree of participation by women in decision-making at local, national and European Union level. Our Member States must find ways of encouraging and supporting women’s participation in the decision-making process and in politics at both national and international level. We are only a few months away from the European elections. I wish to emphasise today that the participation of women in these elections and balanced gender representation in the European Parliament are particularly important both to the democratic development of the European Union and to our society as a whole. In conclusion, I should like to remind the House that many wars on this earth hit many women particularly hard, and we are working to prevent the use of harassment and rape of women as weapons of war. We must defend the dignity of all the people of this earth and must never let up in our commitment. Thank you for your attention. (Applause)
 President.  
– The final version of the draft agenda for this part-session as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 5 February pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed. Monday:
 Firstly, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has requested that the vote on the report by Mrs Kósáné Kovács on the social situation of the Roma be held tomorrow instead of on Thursday as scheduled. Secondly, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has also requested that the vote on Mr Reul’s report on possible solutions to the challenges in relation to oil supply be held tomorrow. In both cases, the deadline for alternative joint motions for resolutions is this evening, which means that it is technically impossible to vote on these texts tomorrow. However, the votes could be held on Wednesday instead of tomorrow. Are there any objections to this?
 President.  
− This political will has been noted. I have been told that, in accordance with our Rules of Procedure, it is only possible to vote on Wednesday. However, we can let the representatives of the Roma know that this is the case, so as to express our political will. Then we would be able to vote on both requests on Wednesday. (Parliament approved the request)
 Tuesday:
 The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has requested that a Commission statement on MON810 genetically modified maize be included on the agenda and that the debate be wound up with the tabling of a motion for a resolution. Who wishes to justify this request? Mr Cohn-Bendit?
 President.  
− Thank you very much. That was the justification. Who speaks against the request?
 President.  
− Thank you very much. I now give the floor to Mr Fjellner, who may present a different position again.
 President.  
− On the one hand, a request has been made to place the topic of a resolution on the agenda; on the other, Mr Fjellner says that neither a statement nor a resolution should be placed on the agenda. I would suggest first voting on the procedure, and then we can discuss whether we have just the statement. In addition, I have received a request for a roll call vote. This roll call vote is to determine who supports the request by Mr Cohn-Bendit and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. The vote is opened.
 President.  
– We could spend another half hour discussing this. The correct procedure is that we vote on whether or not to meet the request by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. I have tried to help out with my proposal that we hold another discussion afterwards as to whether we want a Commission statement, but things cannot be done in any other order. (Parliament rejected the request)
 Wednesday:
 I wish to inform you that 113 amendments have been tabled to the report by Mrs Elisa Ferreira on a European Economic Recovery Plan. This exceeds the threshold of 50 amendments laid down in Rule 156, and so I have referred these texts for consideration by the committee responsible. The committee meets this evening, and the debate on the report remains on the agenda for Wednesday. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has requested that the oral questions to the Council and the Commission on SIS II be dealt with at 3 p.m., as the first item of the afternoon sitting. Since all the political groups have given their agreement, the agenda will be amended accordingly. I have just been informed that I have overlooked something relating to Tuesday: the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has requested that the afternoon debates be extended by half an hour and consequently Question Time with the Commission be held from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m. Is that all right? (Parliament approved the request)
 Thursday:
 The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have requested that the debate on the oral question to the Commission on the 50th anniversary of the Tibetan uprising be wound up with the tabling of a motion for a resolution.
 President.  
– I appreciate what you are saying, but that was not in accordance with our Rules of Procedure. (Parliament approved the request)
 Regarding the debate on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has requested that the sub-item on Sierra Leone be replaced by a new sub-item entitled ‘Expulsions of aid agencies from Darfur’.
 President. − 
 Darfur is now an item on the agenda. (The order of business was adopted)
 President.  
– The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
 President.  
− Parliament’s Bureau will deal with this matter in a legally correct, politically sound manner – you can rest assured of that.
 President.  
−
 Mr President of the Czech Republic, I would like to offer you a warm welcome to the European Parliament.
 President.  
− Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, it was your wish to address the European Parliament. We have gladly granted this wish. Mr President, in a Parliament of the past you would certainly not have been able to give that speech. (Applause)
 Thank goodness that we live in a European democracy in which we can all express our opinions. (Applause and uproar)
 Ladies and gentlemen, we are one European family and, as in any family, there are differences of opinion. Mr President, I agree with you when you say – I only wish to make a few comments, but I feel obliged to do so – : we are a human community. A human community is characterised by having advantages, strengths, disadvantages and weaknesses. Together, we must strengthen the strengths and eradicate the weaknesses. I also agree with you when you say that we need to ask whether each decision that we take could perhaps have been taken elsewhere. Yes, but our national capitals must also ask themselves whether many decisions should not be taken in our towns and communities rather than at national level. (Applause)
 Allow me to make one final comment relating to our Parliament’s understanding of itself: we thank you for your acknowledgement that this European Parliament is an important institution. If we were not so influential, we would not currently be the legislator in 75% of cases and we would not be a co-legislator in almost 100% of cases with regard to the Treaty of Lisbon, and then it would, in fact, be the case that decisions in Europe would be made by bureaucratic means. However, it is now the European Parliament that decides. (Sustained applause)
 Thank you, Mr President, for your visit. It was an expression of our diversity of opinion in Europe and of our European democracy, and in a democracy it is ultimately the majority that counts. I would urge us all to continue, together, to stand up for this democracy, for Europe, for unity and for peace. (Standing ovation)
 President.  
− I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 5 February 2009.
 President.  
− Ladies and gentlemen, two weeks ago, a Polish engineer, Piotr Stańczak, who has been held as a hostage by terrorists in Pakistan since last September, was murdered by his captors. On behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to express my outrage at this abhorrent murder of an innocent man who was a Polish citizen and a citizen of the European Union. The European Parliament denounces this criminal act in the strongest possible terms. We would like to offer the family of the deceased and all his relatives our heartfelt sympathy and condolences. Terrorism is a direct attack on freedom, human rights and democracy. Terrorism is an attempt to attain one’s ends through blind violence and to destroy our common values. It poses a great danger to the security and stability of the international community. Terrorism is a crime, and one which we cannot go soft on. Ladies and gentlemen, in the mother tongue of this murdered engineer, I would like to say, Niech spoczywa w wiecznym pokoju 
[May he rest in eternal peace].
 In memory of Piotr Stańczak, can I ask you all now to rise to commemorate him. (The House rose and observed a minute’s silence)
 Ladies and gentlemen, the forest fires in Australia have led to a tragic loss of life over recent days. These, the worst bushfires in Australia’s history, have claimed many lives in horrible circumstances. We were all horrified by the violent power of this natural disaster and its horrendous consequences. I have written to the Australian Prime Minister to convey the sincere sympathy of the European Parliament. On behalf of the European Parliament at today’s plenary session, I would like, once again, to express our solidarity with Australia, its people and its authorities in these sad times. Next week, a delegation from this Parliament will travel to Australia in order to convey our condolences personally. I would like to take this opportunity, however, to express our heartfelt sympathy and condolences to the families of all those who lost their lives. Our thoughts are with you. Ladies and gentlemen, worrying news is again emerging from the Islamic Republic of Iran. Seven leading figures in the Bahá’í religious community were taken into custody in May 2008. For eight months, they were denied the opportunity of legal counsel. Now, these seven dignitaries of the Bahá’í religious community are to be subjected to a trial this week that meets not even the most basic requirements of the rule of law. The Nobel prize-winner and Iranian lawyer Shirin Ebadi, who was prepared to handle the defence of the imprisoned leaders, has herself been on the receiving end of death threats. The European Parliament calls on the Iranian authorities once again, and in the most urgent terms, to respect human rights and the rights of religious minorities and to reconsider its indictment against the seven leaders of the Bahá’í – Fariba Kamalabadi, Jamaloddin Khanjani, Afif Naeimi, Saeid Rasaie, Mahvash Sabet, Behrouz Tavakkoli and Vahid Tizfahm. These people were incarcerated solely as a result of their beliefs and should be released immediately. (Applause)
 Ladies and gentlemen, last Friday, 13 February 2009, the Spanish Member of this House, Mr Herrero, was arrested by the Venezuelan Government in the capital, Caracas, and subsequently expelled from the country, as a result of comments he had made to the media about the Venezuelan Government. Mr Herrero was in the country as part of the official delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, who had been invited by an opposition party in the context of the constitutional referendum. To arrest him, the police forced their way into his hotel room and they then put him on a scheduled flight to Brazil, without an official explanation or any opportunity to collect his personal belongings. We find this unacceptable! On behalf of the European Parliament, I protest to the strongest possible degree about these methods. I emphatically condemn this incident, which represents an infringement of human rights and a denigration of the democratic institution that is the European Parliament. (Applause)
 President.  
– Thank you very much, Mr Chichester.
 President.  
− The final draft of the agenda for this sitting, as agreed by the Conference of Presidents meeting on Thursday, 5 February 2009, in accordance with Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been circulated. The following amendments have been proposed: Wednesday:
 The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has requested that Mr Reul’s report on possible solutions to the challenges in relation to oil supply be deferred to the next part-session.
 President.  
– Thank you very much, Mr Swoboda. Does anyone wish to oppose the motion?
 President.  
– Ladies and gentlemen, you have heard the political contexts. You have also heard what Mr Swoboda had to say. The decision will be taken tomorrow. (Parliament adopts the motion from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats).
 We will vote on Mr Swoboda’s motion tomorrow. I would ask you all to remember that in today’s vote. (The order of business was adopted thus amended)

 President. − 
 The next item is the statements from the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and from the Commission on the role of the European Union in the Middle East. It is my pleasure to welcome into our midst the High Representative, Mr Solana, and to ask him to address us.
 President.  
− Thank you very much, High Representative. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to bring to your attention the fact that, this coming Sunday, I will be leading a delegation, in my capacity as President of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, to Gaza, Ramallah, Sderot und Jerusalem for two and a half days. Amongst other things, talks are to be held with President Peres and Prime Minister Olmert in Jerusalem and President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority and Prime Minister Fayyad in Ramallah. In Gaza, preparations will be made for the United Nations visit, which will then be carried out.
 President.  
– Thank you very much, Mr Schulz. We do, of course, hope – and this is something we can all agree on – that Mr Solana will come before us a few more times before the end of this parliamentary term.
 President.  
– Other members have also overrun slightly, and we must accord the same treatment to everyone.
 President.  
− A motion for a resolution(1)
 to wind up the debate has been tabled under Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure. The debate is closed. The vote will take place today. Written statements (Rule 142)
 President. − 
 I have been asked to welcome a visiting delegation in the gallery from the region of Piedmont. Normally, we only welcome delegations from nation States but, since we do wish to bolster the regions, I will make an exception and wish a warm welcome to the delegation from Piedmont.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentleman, the Draft Common Frame of Reference (DCFR) has brought the work on European civil law to a head, at least for the moment. It is, of course, a draft produced by legal scholars which has yet to be debated politically. The goal of this debate, then, is to try and get a broad policy discussion going on the future of European private law. The European Parliament wants to achieve a situation in which all stakeholders are involved in this debate but, in order for that to happen, we have to make sure that the academic draft, which is currently only available in English, is produced in other official languages as well. Commissioner, the funds earmarked for translation have not been used up for 2008 yet. We need these translations if there is to be a proper Europe-wide dialogue on the future of European civil law. It is not enough just to get the forthcoming Commission document translated, although obviously that has to be done. The Commission has started a selection process internally, trying to sift through the rules of the academic frame of reference and picking up what needs to be included in the Commission text. We welcome the fact that all the relevant Directorates-General are involved in this selection process. However, I would stress that the ‘European contract law’ project should really be led by DG Justice and Home Affairs because the reference framework is not just about consumer contract law; it is also intended to make it easier for SMEs to shape their cross-border contracts with other business partners who are not consumers. Precisely because the Common Frame of Reference (CFR) needs to take account of the SME sector as well, over recent months the Commission has been holding workshops on selected problem areas in the business-to-business (B2B) arena, and the outcomes of these workshops need to be taken into account in the forthcoming Commission text as well. In the resolution, we also say that the final version of the academic frame of reference could play a toolbox role; indeed, it has already done so, in effect, simply by virtue of its publication. The Community legislator will have to make sure that, in future, legal acts in the field of Community private law are based on the CFR. The CFR can, at a subsequent stage, be turned into an optional instrument; the parties would then be able to choose an alternative system of civil law to govern their legal relationships. That is a step that will need to be taken in order to solve problems that are quite clearly still with us in the sphere of the internal market. In order to give a boost to legal transactions in the internal market, an optional instrument will, however, have to go beyond general contractual law. For example, besides rules governing the conclusion of sales contracts, there will have to be rules on transfer of property and on the rescinding of asset transfers which have no sound legal basis: in other words, the law of obligations. Parliament is particularly keen to ensure that it is consulted and involved on an ongoing basis by the Commission throughout the selection process. We will undoubtedly have to consider how, in future, the significance of this project can be enhanced, especially in the Committee on Legal Affairs. The Commission needs to start considering now, though, what sort of mechanisms we need in order to ensure that the new Commission document can take account of future developments. In the current selection process, the Commission must already start to consider, in its planning, the changes that will feature in the definitive version of the academic frame of reference. All this shows that this CFR is taking us into new territory in European contract law. The European Parliament, the Commission and the Council need to make a clear commitment to this project, which is likely to be the most important initiative for the next parliamentary term. It is a project which offers benefits for everyone: consumers, because they will soon be able to go shopping all round Europe with the backing of European contract law, and companies, because with this greater legal certainty, they will be able to tap into new markets, and as there will be a uniform set of rules, they will be able to achieve substantial cost savings.

Mr President, ladiesand gentlemen, the following three codifications include an innovation, in that we shall also be voting on the joint proposals from the legal services of Parliament, the Commission and the Council. This is the first time that Parliament will have voted on the same text as the Council. Setting aside these votes, which I support, I should like to point out that we are regulating matters here which should not be regulated by the European Parliament. This is not decision-making close to the people; it only makes us look ridiculous in the eyes of the general public when we legislate on matters such as the installation of lighting and light-signalling devices on wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors.
 (Loud applause)
 It would be far more logical to adopt a directive on tractors enshrining general requirements and safeguards. The details could then be specified in standards. In Europe there is the Brussels-based European Committee for Standardization (CEN) and the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (Cenelec), which is also based in Brussels. The standards organisations of thirty countries, including all the countries of the EU and EFTA, are members of CEN and Cenelec. This principle of adopting general directives in which reference is made to European standards has already been applied in more than 25 other sectors. Why should we not apply it to tractors as well? I presume that our Commissioner in attendance, Mr Verheugen, takes the same view. We want better regulation, and we Members of Parliament should be setting a good example. (Applause)

Mr President, I regard this Framework Directive for Soil Protection as a serious mistake which jeopardises the competitiveness of European agriculture and food supplies in Europe. What image do the supporters of this directive actually have of our farmers? Let me tell you: they believe that we need a fat bureaucratic directive, that we need to map 420 million hectares of farmland, wield the threat of horrendous fines and finally create priority areas for soil protection before farmers will take proper care of their soils. I say to you, however, that this image is completely divorced from reality. Soil is a farmer’s most precious asset. Any farmer who does not treat his soil with care will not be a farmer for long. Most of the soils in the EU are cared for; they are worth preserving and are nurtured by our farmers. I regard this directive as an example of ivory-tower bureaucracy, and I hope we can rectify this mistake quickly before any serious damage is inflicted on our agriculture.

 Mr President, in my view, the inclusion of aviation activities in the scheme for emission allowance trading is a step towards meeting the conditions of the Kyoto Protocol, that is correct. However, may I recall what Mr Sarkozy has just said. He said that Europe must demand reciprocity, and there is none, or far too little, of that here. Emission trading should not begin before 2012 at the earliest. As is the case for small cars, exemptions must be in place for small aircraft under 20 tonnes in order to avoid any disproportionality. A jumbo jet is not the same as a Cessna! Many points in the report by the Committee on the Environment simply go too far and leave European businesses no room to manoeuvre and no time to implement the measures. There is massive discord here. Recalling again the words of the French President, we must think very hard, once more, about how we structure this emission trading scheme.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by complimenting Mr Fruteau on his report, although our fellow Member knows that I am still not wholly content with the standstill period proposed. As the rapporteur for the Committee on Legal Affairs, I have examined the subject in great detail, and held a hearing in my constituency. As a result, in my report I called for a standard period of 14 calendar days from the announcement. I believe that a simple and standard deadline is imperative for the sake of small and medium-sized companies. The opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has confirmed this view. The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted my proposal unanimously. Unfortunately, despite the enhanced cooperation, the vote in the Committee on Legal Affairs has been ignored. So let me stress once again that this type of increased cooperation is not serving the intended purpose. We would be well advised to create clearer relationships in the current discussions on reform and enhancing cooperation. I personally feel that the compromise on deadlines is still too complicated for SMEs. The distinction made between postal and electronic notification is unnecessary in my opinion. What is positive is that Mr Fruteau and the shadow rapporteur have agreed to a standard deadline and have removed the references to calendar days and working days, thereby eliminating the confusion generated by the periods given in the original Commission proposal. On balance, I will be voting in favour of the compromise, which is the result of much discussion and a massive effort on the part of all rapporteurs, the Commission and the Council Presidency.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the successor to Mrs Wallis as rapporteur for codification, I should like to draw attention to a problem that Mrs Wallis also had. The codification procedure is a simple, quick procedure. It is based on agreement between the Council, Parliament and the Commission, and enables legal acts that have been amended several times to be consolidated into a single legal act. Substantive changes are explicitly exempted from the codification, which is why I broadly welcome the agreement on a fast procedure. Scrutiny is carried out by the legal services of the Council, Parliament and the Commission, which compare the revised legal acts carefully. The result is then presented to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the rapporteur. I am an advocate of simplification and of better lawmaking, but with one reservation. As rapporteur, I receive the codified legal acts together with the result of the scrutiny by the legal services between one and three weeks before the vote in the Committee on Legal Affairs. It is impossible to scrutinise so many legal acts carefully in such a short space of time. There should be the option of careful scrutiny, however, when one is to subsequently vote on the legal acts in one’s own name. I should like to request, therefore, that in future the codified version be sent to the legal services and the EP rapporteur at the same time. The simplicity of the procedure would not be affected, and the position of the rapporteur would be greatly strengthened. I think that this would be in the interests of the entire Parliament as well as the rapporteur for codification. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, speaking as a shadow rapporteur and on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I would like to thank Mr Zingaretti for his successful report, and, above all, for his outstanding cooperation. I should like to emphasise that our intention with this report should not be to make criminals of the EU’s citizens when what we want to do is to punish the criminal gangs, organised criminals, and professional counterfeiters. I myself see it as being of the utmost importance that there should be a derogation for private users motivated by personal reasons rather than by the desire for profit. The compromise achieved in the Committee on Legal Affairs on definitions is, quite simply, a practicable solution, and, like my colleague Mr Wieland, I welcome the definition of ‘infringement on a commercial scale’ and of ‘deliberate infringement of a right to intellectual property’, as well as the positive list from which patents are excluded. It also proved possible to arrive at a satisfactory solution to Article 3’s description of the characteristics of offences, so that, firstly, every deliberate infringement on a commercial scale, thirdly, any attempt at such infringement of the law, and thirdly, aiding and inciting the committal of the act are considered as offences. Since the oral amendment relating to incitement to the act originated from me, I should like once more to make it clear that the translations are problematic and that some of them are positively wrong. It is intended that the fines should avoid causing disruption to national criminal law systems in their applicability to bodies with legal personality, and it is for the Member States themselves to decide whether they want to make such bodies liable to the sanctions of the criminal law or only to fines. These are European rules, and every Member State may tighten them up, as some indeed already do, and we want to leave responsibility for that with the Member States.

 Mr President, I am now speaking in my capacity as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats on the Committee on Legal Affairs. The Commission’s recommendation for the collective cross-border management of copyright and related rights throws up a multitude of problems, for it secures neither the rights of the artists nor the diversity of the music on offer in Europe, and there are gaps in the assessment of its potential impact. The chosen legal remedy is unacceptable; recommending three options at the same time does not really do anything to solve the problem that Mrs Lévai has set out so clearly in her report, and which the compromise before you aims to address. What that means in detail is a ‘no’ to territorial restrictions on use, a ‘yes’ to fair and controlled competition in the collective management of rights, ‘yes’ to the modernisation of the online music market, but not at the expense of cultural diversity and the protection of the artists, and ‘yes’ too to transparent rights management companies. What is worthy of criticism about all this is that the Commission is trying, by means of a recommendation, to circumvent the rights of this House, and so we call upon it to present, through the codecision procedure, a proposal for a suitable legal instrument, founded, of course, on extensive consultation with all the interested parties. Thinking forward to the forthcoming ruling on the CISAC case, I would like to appeal to the Commission not to use ‘soft law’ or agreements as means of voiding Parliament’s rights of codecision, and I ask the Members of this House to give their assent to Mrs Lévai’s report.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I applied to speak for two minutes but will not need that long. All the same, I would like to emphasise several points in particular regarding the introduction of the European Small Claims Procedure. First of all, it is important that in case of doubt, the law is interpreted in the German language version since this was generally the working language of the European Parliament as well as being used exclusively by the Council and Commission for orientation purposes in the many trilogues. Furthermore, it is important that the Member States utilise all the opportunities afforded by this procedure and therefore use the possibilities offered by modern means of communication. Member States should authorise and promote telephone, e-mail and video conferencing as means of communication. A further important simplification is that form D must be translated by one person who is authorised to do translations in one of the Member States. This expressly precludes expensive authentications and the need for certification, for instance, by a notary. I wish to emphasise that with regard to all decisions made by the Court within the Small Claims Procedure, it should always be remembered that the procedure is economical, quick, simple and citizen-friendly. Anything which constitutes an obstacle to this is therefore inconsistent with the aim of this Regulation. I therefore call on all my fellow Members to give their approval to this new and citizen-friendly civil law procedure which is the same across the whole of Europe.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for this regulation is intended to facilitate compulsory licences for the manufacture of medicines destined for countries with public health problems. What is regrettable about this debate is that some Members – particularly in the lead committee – keep trying to point the finger of suspicion at the medical research industry, and hence also at those who deal with patents, with unwarranted insinuations that they are indifferent to people in poorer parts of the world. Patents do not stand in the way of humanitarian action – the contrary is the case, for without them, innovative companies are unable to take on high levels of financial risk and invest billions in research and development. It is only by means of such investments that medicines can be developed that can, for example, keep pace with the constant changes in certain pathogens. That benefits not only us in Europe, but also people in every country throughout the world. Were there no patents, medicines and vaccinations against many fatal diseases would never have been developed – medicines and vaccinations now within the reach of everyone, including of course people in the developing world. Compulsory licensing is no solution to the problem of how to combat diseases in developing countries. More effective control and better setting of priorities would make it possible for billions given for development and humanitarian purposes, but then misdirected, to be used to buy adequate supplies of medicines. If we want to take the Lisbon Strategy seriously, that is to say, if we want to move research and development forward, we need an effective protection for patents that cannot be weakened or set aside at will. TRIPS may well make compulsory licences possible, but they are not a necessity, for there are alternatives to them.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall try to encapsulate much in a short space of time. Hundreds and thousands of animals are caught in traps all over the European Union, and the practice is primarily used to manage animals living in the wild and, in particular, to combat pests, of which muskrats are but one example. It was in 1998 that the EU, together with Canada, Russia and the USA, concluded the agreement on international humane trapping standards. These countries are the principal exporters of furs and pelts, and the EU, in two decisions, rightly justified this by reference to its competence in general economic policy and, in particular, in policy affecting the internal market. The present proposal for legislation constitutes an attempt at transposing this agreement into EU law; the substance of it is that the Commission is arguing for a balance – which certainly stands in need of further discussion – between the need for the avoidable suffering on the part of animals to be limited and the need for trapping as a means of catching them. It has to be said, though, that the proposal takes environmental policy as its primary basis, but the EU is responsible for the well-being of animals only in conjunction with other policy areas, such as agriculture, transport, the single market or research. It follows that it possesses no general competence with regard to the well-being of animals in the wild. This House, of course, is – as of course, am I – all in favour of safeguarding the well-being of animals in the wild, but that, as a subject for legislation, is a matter for the Member States. It is because the European Parliament, as the European legislature, must respect the Member States’ rights under subsidiarity that it must reject this proposal for legislation irrespective of the good intentions it contains. I have to tell the Commissioner that the enactment of relevant regulations by the Member States will discharge the European Union’s obligations.

 Mr President, although it is claimed that we are debating one of the most controversial pieces of legislation, that would be the case only if half of us were in favour of it and half against. The proportions are, however, quite different, for the overwhelming majority in this House endorses the objective of this legislation, embodied in the unambiguous principle that software alone is not capable of being patented. This legislation does no more than to protect software by way of copyright. Just as not just individual sentences are protected by copyright, but rather the book as a whole, so it naturally follows that not merely individual lines of software are protected, but rather the work as a whole. What our economy does, of course, need, though, is patents, for patents denote and indicate a knowledge-based economy, which produces such things as technical advances, inventions with such additional requirements as novelty, whether they be computer-based, computer-implemented or computer-managed. Why do we need this legislation? We need it in order not to end up in the situation that pertains in the USA. We are well aware that over 30 000 patents have already been taken out on software, and we want to stop that going on in the future. The legislation is needed if we are to do that. We are in fact protecting ourselves by having the Commission monitor this and report back to us in three years’ time as to whether, despite our efforts at closing them by way of the latest compromises, there are still loopholes, and if there are, it must report them to us, while also giving us an account of the ‘open source movement’ that will enable us to turn our attention to that in three years’ time and close any loopholes that may have opened up. This is not, therefore, the end of the story, and not just because we have yet to reach agreement with the Council; we will also be continuing to observe the way in which our legislation is put into effect and will reserve the right to take further action in three years’ time on the basis of what emerges from that.

 Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats I would like to ask you, pursuant to Article 151(1) and (3), to reject Amendment 45a, tabled by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, as inadmissible insofar as it deals with the statement made by Pope Benedict for the following reasons. First, this statement was made in 2009, while the report deals with human rights violations that took place in 2008. This amendment does not therefore amend the text it is intended to amend. Second, this amendment compares the statements made by the Pope with human rights violations of the most serious kind, the use of the death penalty, human rights violations in China, and torture everywhere. This comparison shows a cynical disregard for the victims of human rights violations throughout the world. (Applause)
 Third, it is such an unbelievable aspersion, such an unbelievable discrimination against the Pope that the ALDE Group may well be identified with it, but under no circumstances should the European Parliament be. (Loud applause)

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to state on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats that it is not in the interests of European workers that the conciliation procedure on new working time legislation has failed and that the old working time legislation continues to apply. I would also like to say that it is a myth that this is purely the fault of the Council, while the majority of those in Parliament, like knights in shining armour, have sacrificed themselves in the interests of the workers. The reality is that both parties are at fault. In is true that the Council did not move an inch on the question of the opt-out, but the majority in Parliament was equally inflexible in insisting that a solution was only possible if the opt-out was abolished. As a result, both parties passed like ships in the night and the result was easy to predict. This is a lost opportunity. For example, it would have been possible to put in place a European on-call time regulation which specified for the whole of Europe that ‘on-call time is working time’, as the Court of Justice of the European Communities has laid down. In order to achieve this it would have been necessary for the majority in Parliament to have moved a very small distance on the question of the opt-out, for example when it was a case of determining the conditions under which an opt-out is possible, which should be as strict as possible, and who takes the decision about the opt-out. The two sides of industry should have been involved. However, none of this happened. The insistence on the removal of the opt-out at all costs became a sacred cow. This was the other side of the irreconcilable behaviour which resulted in the failure of the new solution. This is a very regrettable situation. As I have said, it is not in the interests of the workers.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, should prisoners from Guantánamo be accepted in the European Union? This is the question which we must ask ourselves today. The answer will depend on the considerations which we choose to be guided by. Some people allege that the prisoners have been tortured. This is a reason for accepting them, under the dictates of humanity. It is without doubt true that torture is the most inhumane and degrading practice. If these people have been tortured, then they have a right to our sympathy, regardless of the individual accusations made against them. However, is that the only aspect which we have to consider? For example, many of the people who are or were imprisoned in Guantánamo went to training camps for terrorists in Afghanistan after 11 September. They were not tourists who wanted to experience the beauty of the country, but potential terrorists. We have a duty to protect European citizens against potential terrorists. Unfortunately, torture takes place all over the world and we constantly condemn it. We have not yet gone as far as saying that anyone who has been tortured has a right to be accepted in Europe. We have not yet done this, for good reason. Instead we have weighed this consideration against the need for security in the European Union. We must also do that in this case. We must ensure that potential terrorists do not descend on Europe and, therefore, in evaluating this problem, I would like to see the need for security being given the highest priority above all other considerations.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it could be that you were not expecting such a friendly, benevolent reception in the European Parliament, Mr Topolánek – but the Czech Council Presidency is an event tinged with history. I have seen two landmark events in my political career, the first being German reunification and the second Europe’s reunification following two bloody European civil wars in the last century. The fact that the Czech Republic is representing the Presidency in the European Parliament today is a reflection of the incredible historic changes to which we have been witness and for which we can be grateful. I assure you of the support of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, without reservation and without scepticism. You rightly set the ball rolling with Charles IV, who was not only one of the first architects of a trans-European transport network but also the founder of one of the oldest and most prestigious universities in Europe, and thus an exponent of a European universality that has possibly left at least as great a mark on us Europeans as the treaties we have concluded. The occasional Eurosceptic remark aside – which we are familiar with from your own country – you meet with our support. We in the PPE-DE Group are very staunch Europeans – there is no doubt about that – but precisely because of this we are able to recognise wrong turns taken by Europe and to help put them right. The Treaty of Lisbon is an excellent instrument for correcting any wrong turns taken by Europe. For this reason, I wish to express here the expectation that you, as President of the Council, will contribute to the entry into force of this Treaty and that your country will ratify the Treaty as soon as possible.

 Mr President, Mr President-in Office of the Council, if even Mr Schulz is saying good things about the French Presidency, then it must in fact have been brilliant, because until now the socialists have not been great admirers of President Sarkozy. On behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like to assure you, President Sarkozy, that your Presidency has been outstanding and totally successful. You have acted decisively and successfully in both of the crises which occurred this year. You have given the European Union more political weight and have improved its reputation in the world. You have undoubtedly regained some of the confidence of its citizens and, not least, you have been able to highlight the beneficial and stabilising effect of our common currency, the euro, in these difficult times. In brief, fortunately for us you were the right man in the right place at the right time. I would like to think that we will be able to say the same thing after the next Presidency. The climate change and energy package is a success for the Council. However, we should remember that it is a decision which reaches far into the future and that its full effects will only be felt when the majority of the people who are responsible for it are no longer in office or able to take responsibility for the consequences. We will have to make a difficult choice between the climate policy objectives, which we fully support, and the unavoidable burdens that we can expect from the economy. Mr Schulz has challenged the PPE-DE Group to make this decision. Of course, we will make the decision, but we will attempt first to read about what we have to decide on. If you made the decision yesterday, then you cannot possibly have read the text. You have just decided blindly on the basis of left-wing policy. As for your criticism of the first reading agreement, when Mr Cohn-Bendit also sheds crocodile tears, I fully agree with the content of your criticism. However, who forced us into it? Did the Council gag us during the procedure? Did the Commission blackmail us? It was a majority in this Parliament that made the decision. In the Conference of Presidents, only Joseph Daul voted in favour of a first reading, which would have been the proper procedure. I hope that we can draw the conclusion from this that in future first reading agreements should no longer be accepted at least for such decisive projects.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there are three main crises that demand action from us. The first is the financial crisis – as has already been discussed – which is encroaching on the real economy to an ever increasing degree. Secondly, we must not forget the crisis involving the Treaties which underpin our Union, reflected in the fate of the Treaty of Lisbon. Thirdly, there is an EU crisis with respect to its acceptance amongst the public, which is, I believe, an important aspect to mention ahead of the elections. Mr President, you have presented a work programme for the rest of the term of this Parliament and of your Commission, and I would like to say that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will be happy to follow the main principles of this programme. We will support you. However, we will put different emphases on some aspects. Emphasis will be placed in line with expectations. These expectations are aimed at the last few months of your term of office and maybe even beyond. The PPE-DE Group would like to see itself reflected in the Commission’s actions. We are aware that other groups are making the same request, and rightly so. We will rely on your political skills for the response. You have rightly made employment and growth your highest priority. The response is increasingly linked to the issue of how we should react to the financial crisis. We support the measures required in connection with the regulation and transparency of the financial markets. We need extremely specific proposals for reorganising the regulation of the financial markets as quickly as possible. The implementation of the action plan from the Global Financial Summit is surely first and foremost the concern of the nation states. However, in view of the globally interconnected markets, close cooperation in connection with all regulatory measures – if only to prevent various different standards from being applied – is imperative. This represents a broad and important area of activity for the coordination work of the Commission. Regulation – and we must not forget this – is not an end in itself, but, in a particular crisis, it is a tool used to achieve certain goals. We need to keep reminding ourselves of this fact. You mentioned the climate change and energy package which is scheduled to be adopted by December. I am sure this goal enjoys broad consensus within Parliament. The PPE-DE Group – and I want to make this absolutely clear – also wants this problem to be solved before the end of this legislative term. It is a strategic aim. However, you are asking a lot of Parliament. Based on the current situation, we can assume that just after the December summit we will be presented with a package containing hundreds of pages in one language and we will be expected to say yes or no to it. While we respect the goal that we also share, this is a significant abuse of the rights of Parliament and its Members, and maybe we will be able to come up with something more ingenious than this unrefined option.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this morning it has rightly been stated that the European Union has demonstrated its ability to act in two major crises. This has inspired confidence in the rest of the world and in the role of the European Union and has allowed it to regain the confidence of its citizens. This is mainly due to the President-in-Office of the Council. President Sarkozy, this is an achievement that you can justifiably be proud of. Of course, it is not difficult to imagine that President Sarkozy would have taken an energetic and imaginative approach even if he had not been President of the Council. However, the fact is that he is President of the Council and therefore his actions have benefited the European Union. That is how it should be. Admittedly we should remember that it is a stroke of luck that he is currently the President-in-Office of the Council. However, the ability of the European Union to handle crises should not be dependent on luck. This means that we need the Treaty of Lisbon. This is another argument in favour of putting the treaty into force and I am convinced that there is a broad majority for the treaty in this Parliament. For reasons of restraint we have not yet stated this loudly and clearly, but I believe that it is time to explain that this Parliament is behind the Treaty of Lisbon and it would be a good thing if the Parliament could succeed in putting it into force before the European elections. This is not within our power, but I think that it is our position. Mr Schulz has analysed the financial crisis, discovered the causes in the system and, without further ado, has laid the blame firmly at the door of the Conservatives, Liberals and Christian Democrats. Mr Schulz, what a simple picture of the world you present, doubtless because of the elections. You are very well aware that the degree of prosperity here in Europe, which is unheard of throughout large parts of the world, the high levels of social security, the unparalleled levels of environmental protection, the related technological advancement and, not least, the level of personal freedom associated with all these achievements are all based on the social market economy and not on socialist ideas. We need to remind ourselves of this. The system itself has not failed, but some of the players in the system have failed and they must be called to account. In order to do this, we need new regulations. I would like to make one comment on the climate change and energy package. I would like to state also on behalf of the Group that the objectives of this are undisputed, but that we need to talk about the methods. During a time when emissions trading, according to the Commission’s calculations, will cost EUR 70 to 90 billion per year, which must be raised by those affected, we cannot seriously believe that this entire structure will not be affected by the financial crisis and the crisis in the real economy. For this reason we would like to state that we will continue our firm commitment to the objectives. However, I think it is appropriate to consider and debate the dossier carefully and thoroughly in order to ensure that we do not make any legislative mistakes and, above all, that those affected are involved. To do this, we need time and we must make sure that we take the necessary time.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this morning we are debating the legislative and work programme of the Commission for the coming year, 2009, which is an election year. Next year, a new Parliament will be elected and there will be a new Commission. No one's position is certain: not that of the Commissioners and not even that of the Commission President, who is unfortunately unable to be here this morning to present his programme in person. During any election year, it is always a temptation to do right by all our voters, assuming, that is, that we know what they want, or at least what they should want. The question, then, is this: how should the European Union present itself to Europe's citizens in the coming year? Like all politicians, our task is to try to respond to citizens' concerns. The European Union has an outstanding opportunity to do this. We have many possible ways of responding to people's needs and concerns. Peace has been a fundamental concern throughout human history, and the European Union has safeguarded peace in Europe for many decades. We are able to find answers to external threats, such as international terrorism or the conduct of large neighbouring countries which occasionally trample the rules of international law under foot. We can make a contribution to ensuring that Europe has a secure and sustainable energy supply, while doing what we can to protect the climate. We can safeguard social security and justice in Europe by unleashing the growth potential of our successful European economy, and we can safeguard innovation and the competitiveness of the European economy, with the associated opportunity to create and safeguard jobs. Europe can become a haven of security in a changing world. My colleagues will have more to say about the finer points of detail on many of these issues shortly. What are the prerequisites for successful action in the European Union? I would like to mention two in particular: firstly, we need appropriate institutional bases, and that certainly means the Treaty of Lisbon. This Treaty will create more transparency and more democracy and enhance the EU's capacity to act, thus enabling it to perform its functions more effectively. We can only appeal to the citizens of Ireland to reconsider their position on this Treaty. I share many of the criticisms levelled at the European Union, but we cannot ignore the fact that this Treaty provides sound solutions to many of these points of criticism. Thus the Treaty of Lisbon is vital. Secondly, however, we also need the backing of Europe's citizens, which has declined to an alarming extent. That became apparent from the referenda in France, the Netherlands and, not least, in Ireland. It is not about whether we need more or less Europe, as I recently had the opportunity to say to the Commission President. The real issue is where we need Europe, and where we do not. That needs to be decided. If I may cite an example – and I admit that this is my very favourite example – soil protection is not something that we need to deal with at European level. Soil protection makes work, but it does not create jobs. That is why Europe will be successful and will generate support if it acts where Community action is undoubtedly required, and where action at European level can achieve more than action at national level. The Commission would therefore be well-advised, in my view, to attach greater importance to the issue of subsidiarity in its action during the coming year. That will boost Europe's acceptance and we will probably all be re-elected by more of Europe's citizens than was the case at the last election.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, soil protection is an extremely important task for ensuring a healthy farming environment for future generations. I would underscore everything that has been said in that connection so far. However, none of these arguments means that soil protection should be a European task. Not every problem in Europe is necessarily a problem for Europe. Soil is a local, a localised medium. As a rule, soil contamination has no cross-border impacts, so there is no reason for soil protection to be a task for the European Union; nor, indeed, does it have any European added value. Many of the European countries already have soil protection regulations which work very well, and there is not the slightest reason to impose a European regulation on those that do not. Or do you believe, Commissioner – quite seriously – that wherever Member States are not taking action within their own sphere of competence, the Commission should fill the gap? That would be absurd. For reasons of subsidiarity, soil protection is a task for the Member States, and they are quite capable of dealing with it. That being the case, the Council – including your own country, Madam Secretary of State – provisionally halted this initiative. I very much hope that the French Republic will stick to this position. I have no doubt that it could be useful to draft a European soil protection strategy, and I would also have no problem with Europe making a financial contribution wherever optimum soil protection has not yet been achieved. However, I am firmly opposed to having harmonised soil protection legislation imposed upon all of us, funded by the Community, simply because there is no soil protection legislation in some countries. That is not what Europe is supposed to be about. It would be a piece of completely superfluous bureaucracy of the type which sends citizens running for cover, before expressing their opinions in elections and referenda. It has to be stopped.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if I were to summarise this morning’s debate, I would say that it is good that France holds the Presidency at this time, and good that you, President Sarkozy, occupy the position of President-in-Office of the Council. This has been a good day for Europe and for this Parliament, as for the first time in a long time we again have before us somebody who speaks for Europe with passion, not just with good arguments. Perhaps that is just what we need to win over the Irish and to win back our citizens: passion and good judgement, and good judgement includes Europe confining itself to certain limits. I should like to give you the ‘secret of success’: we need not only the Treaty in Ireland, but also a new culture of subsidiarity. We need boundaries for Europe in relation to the rest of the world, but we also need boundaries within Europe. A new culture of subsidiarity will bring renewed approval to Europe; I am in total agreement with President Barroso on that. Good luck, President Sarkozy.

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has managed to sum up its conclusions of the most important issue on its agenda in just over half a page. The entire document runs to 25 pages. This is – and I should like to emphasise this – a commendable show of restraint. The style of the deliberations is also in keeping with the circumstances. The Council is taking its time; it wishes to address the issue of the Lisbon Treaty again in October and, until then, it is doing what it can to clarify the matter. This is all right and proper. It is right and proper to respect the Irish vote. It is wrong to start cracking the whip now and to expect that the Irish will then cosy up to us – that is utter nonsense. Nevertheless, we must now give some thought to how we can overcome this situation, for the crisis that we are currently facing goes beyond what is now the second failed attempt at a treaty reform that is still necessary. This crisis affects the EU’s fundamental relationship with its citizens and the citizens’ relationship with their Union. Naturally, the Irish said ‘no’ for all kinds of different reasons. A referendum is a political hotchpotch consisting of many different ingredients; in this case, several reasons have certainly had a part to play. They lie partly in Irish domestic politics and partly in the Irish people’s general disillusionment with politics – that is true; however, ladies and gentlemen, a system error is starting to filter through here. A constitution needs a referendum and popular consent, but here we are dealing with an international treaty. An international treaty is generally unsuitable for a referendum. This system error is at our cost. We shall have to consider whether we wish to continue in this way in future. However, if you leave aside all aspects that derive from domestic political considerations, the Irish ‘no’ was basically directed at the European Union and perhaps least of all at the text of the Treaty. President Barroso, your Commissioner, Mr McCreevy, is probably not the only one who has not read the Treaty, for it is essentially quite clear that the European Union is seeing its citizens increasingly turn against it. It is up to us here to start searching for the reasons for this – we cannot leave that to the Irish. It is up to us, to Parliament, to the Council and, not least, Mr President, to the Commission to start searching for those reasons. The Commission’s role is to serve as the source of EU policy initiatives. Most notably, the Commission shapes the political climate. When people talk about Brussels, then most think of the Commission, and only subsequently – rightly or regrettably – of Parliament or of the Council. European unification is, essentially, undisputed. I know of hardly any citizen who says that he is against European countries working together. It is all the more astonishing that there has been such a large-scale rejection, which, in essence, is also encountered in all other countries to a greater or lesser degree. It is rather the European Union’s everyday image, primarily shaped by the Commission, that is presenting us with problems. I think it can be said, President of the Commission, that Brussels increasingly gets on people’s nerves. The idea of the EU as a peacemaker and as a successful economic superpower is receding rapidly, and it appears to be a moloch whose vast and unwieldy bureaucracy, at times operating arbitrarily, makes people feel as if they have no say in their own affairs. President of the Commission, you stated that you cannot bash Europe all week long and then expect a joyful ‘yes’ to Europe on Sunday. It would have been more correct to say that you cannot continually lay down the law, regulate and tie everything up with red tape all week long and then expect a friendly ‘yes’ from the people on Sunday. Let me give you an example: the Soil Protection Directive has been rejected by the requisite number of Member States on the grounds that it breaches the principle of subsidiarity. The Commission is not concerned why this came about; instead, it is now making an attempt to ignore the ‘no’ vote and attain its stated objective. It would be more appropriate that we in the European Union set ourselves limits – over and above the Treaty and its detailed provisions – and make decisions in Europe which manifestly need to be taken at European level. This is why we need to develop a new culture of subsidiarity. We must allow the Member States to exercise their powers and responsibilities, and we must also ensure that they do assume that responsibility. The President of the Council spoke about the European identity. It is, indeed, important. However, it must be based on what is Europe’s responsibility and what must remain the Member States’ responsibility. This is why we must do what we can to save the Treaty. It is so very much better than anything that Nice has to offer us. We must make the most of this opportunity – if such an opportunity exists – and we must try to reconnect the citizens with Europe.

 Mr President, before the vote, I would like to point out a problem which affects the vote and which may need to be discussed and resolved. In the calendar proposed, there is a reference to the date of the elections in 2009. We are not voting on that now, we are simply noting it. However, because of the date of the elections, the constituent sitting of Parliament will take place in July 2009. That being the case, Members from some countries have concerns because, if you look closely, it is clear that, if the constituent sitting takes place on 14 July 2009, some Members will not achieve the requisite five years for pension rights. In some Member States, they do not use the legislative term but a fixed period because the legislative terms in the Member States vary in length. I think that there are good grounds to consider and resolve this problem, either as regards the date of the election or the date of the constituent sitting. I would therefore ask Parliament’s Legal Service to look at this issue.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the two declarations prompt me to point out, for the benefit of those fellow Members who may not have fully understood what is going on, that these declarations form part of the compromise which we have agreed. We asked for clarification of two or three problems which has been provided in this way. However, the subject of the legislative procedure is of course solely the text as agreed jointly by us. I have the letter here from the Chair of Coreper – which is currently chaired by Slovenia – which confirms that this text, if we adopt it today, will also be approved by the Council. That means, of course, that we will have agreement at first reading which will give us the legislative success that we want to achieve.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commissioner has provided us with a persuasive and graphic portrayal of the way in which the ruling military government in Burma is cynically and brutally betraying its own people. I wish to address myself here to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the ASEAN Member Countries. For many years, the European Parliament has maintained friendly relations with the parliamentarians of the ASEAN countries. Not too long ago, those countries signed a new ASEAN Charter in which they explicitly affirm their adherence to the principle of respecting and protecting human rights. It goes without saying that ASEAN bears some responsibility for Burma, which is one of its Member Countries, and that the global reputation of the ASEAN countries will suffer if it continues to let the Burmese military junta act as it is acting at the moment. I appeal to the Member Countries of ASEAN, in their own best interests and for the sake of their good and friendly relations with the European Union, to do whatever they can to persuade the Burmese military junta that it must let the outside world help its country’s population. As I have indicated, this lies within the power and responsibility of the ASEAN countries. They will be asked how they are exercising this responsibility, and whether or not they use their scope for action in this matter will influence our relations with ASEAN. They need not act by means of public appeals – there are other ways – but the European Union expects that Burma’s neighbours in particular will do whatever they can to change the attitude of its ruling regime.

Mr President, once a year – in May, for some inexplicable reason – it is customary for all the committees to meet in Strasbourg. There appears to be no logical justification for this. As a result, we have committees meeting this evening at the same time as subjects within their sphere of responsibility are on the plenary agenda. This is an untenable situation. The only possible solution, really, is that the committees meet in Strasbourg in future and that we move the plenary sittings to Brussels to resolve the conflict! Seriously, though, committees meetings here in Strasbourg cannot continue to clash with plenary sittings and group meetings to the extent that this has been happening, especially over the last two years and in spite of all the declarations that such clashes were to be avoided. Now we even have a cooling-off period. There is no practical reason whatsoever why committee meetings here in Strasbourg need to clash with plenary activities. I should be grateful if you would do everything in your power to put matters right. (Applause)

Mr President, the European Union is resorting to the instrument of criminal law. In other words, sentences are to be passed in future in the name of the European Union, and these powers are to be exercised initially in respect of infringements of environmental law. This is a far-reaching and remarkable step, because criminal law is actually outside the sphere of competence of the European Union. Indeed, it is one of the core areas of the Member States’ national sovereignty. That is precisely why it took two rulings from the European Court of Justice to break the ground for this directive. That is curious in itself, because both the Council and the Commission and Parliament have long been in agreement that penal measures are a valid instrument for the enforcement of environmental law. It took several years, however, to establish where responsibility lay for such measures – with the Member States on the basis of framework decisions or with the Community on the basis of a directive. The European Court of Justice endorsed the position adopted by the Commission, which is not surprising. Moreover, having now been defused, the conflict is unlikely to resurface, since the new Treaty of Lisbon addresses the problem and comes down more heavily in favour of the Community than the rulings of the ECJ. This, indeed, is the reason why we concluded a first-reading agreement. We wanted to avoid having to restart the whole procedure from scratch if a solution did not materialise this year. Given a change in the substantive legal basis and in view of the forthcoming European elections, a considerable length of time might no doubt have elapsed before the appropriate legislation could be enacted. This is why we unanimously took the view that we must make every effort to reach a solution at first reading. When I say ‘we’, I mean the Slovenian Presidency – and I very much regret that it is not represented here, especially since I put on a tasteful tie in its honour – the Commission and the shadow rapporteurs, to whom I wish to pay special tribute for their amicable, constructive and informed cooperation. It was a joy to work with them. The new directive rests on three pillars, which I should like at least to outline briefly. First of all, we have not only defined the criminal acts that would henceforth be punishable but also set out in an annex the specific provisions under which offenders may be charged. That accords with the principle of nulla poena sine lege
. It is not just any criminal offence which would be punishable but the infringement of one of the legal provisions precisely defined in the annex. It was important to enshrine this principle in the legislation. The second point is, to a certain extent, an incorporation of the proportionality principle. The purpose of the directive cannot be to throw the book at everyone who commits even the most trivial environmental transgression but rather to combat significant offences. For this reason, petty offences would not be punishable under the directive. Thirdly, we also laid down that punishability would presuppose unlawful conduct. We unanimously enshrined these three principles in the draft. We also decidedly improved the definitions. I now keenly await the debate. Let me reiterate my thanks to all the Members of the House who have made this compromise possible.
 Hartmut Nassauer,  
rapporteur
. − 
(DE) 
Mr President, if I may begin with the last point, namely the transposition period, let me say that this directive sets a precedent. Mr Medina rightly pointed out that all of the environmental legislation in the Community will have to be screened for penal compatibility, as it were, in the light of the new definitions of criminal offences. This will be being done for the first time and is a very extensive undertaking. Accordingly, it makes sense to give the Member States 24 months rather than only 18. The other thing I wanted to say is addressed to the Commission. This matter may not necessarily lie within your sphere of competence at the present time, Commissioner Barrot, but it will in the future. The Commission now has a new resource; it has a new set of instruments at its disposal which, as I have said, are essentially and fundamentally in the hands of the Member States. I believe that the Commission would be well advised to exercise caution in the use of these instruments. Penal screening of Community law, of course, is not solely applicable to environmental legislation but can, in principle, be applied to all other areas of Community activity. That is why I believe the Commission would be well advised to proceed with caution here, for criminal law is the last resort in the enforcement of legislation and not an instrument for everyday use. The Member States will not exactly be over the moon about all of this. Besides, to put it very delicately, legal scholars have been extremely hesitant to incorporate the judgments of the European Court of Justice into legal doctrine and jurisprudence. My advice to the Commission is therefore to make cautious use of these instruments, and the directive will be all the more effective when it is subsequently applied in practice.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in a few days' time, the Council will decide whether to maintain its common position on Burma and whether to maintain sanctions. In Burma, there have been no substantive changes with regard to democracy, the rule of law or respect for human rights. Almost 2 000 political prisoners are being detained there. Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi has been under house arrest for years. In short, there is not the slightest reason to ease the sanctions. Admittedly, a constitutional referendum has been announced and a draft constitution has been published, but this lacks any democratic legitimacy. The public has not been consulted, and neither has the democratic opposition. The draft constitution is full of democratic shortcomings. It is absurd that a quarter of the seats in parliament will go to the military. It is absurd to exclude candidates who are married to a foreigner or have children who are foreign nationals. All this testifies to a lack of democratic progress. What is to be done? I endorse the appeals voiced by previous speakers, especially the measured comments of my colleague Geoffrey van Orden. However, we cannot address the issue of Burma on our own. Without the support of the Chinese, the junta would not survive. That is why the Chinese also have a responsibility for what is happening there. China has moved in to fill the economic vacuum created by the West's sanctions and is reaping the benefits. That is why an approach must be made to China if we want to see any change in the situation in Burma. I would also like to appeal to my friends in ASEAN. I know that my ASEAN friends regard any comment about Myanmar as interference in their domestic affairs, but I am also aware that the situation in Myanmar makes them uneasy. My message to them is that Myanmar is blighting ASEAN's image in the world, so ASEAN too must bring pressure to bear.

Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is producing its 2009 legislative programme from its strategic priorities of prosperity, solidarity, freedom, security and a stronger Europe in the world in a totally appropriate manner with our support, hence its priorities for 2009 of sustainable growth, jobs in an age of globalisation and a resource-efficient economic area with low CO2
 emissions. These are the common denominators for legislative work in 2009 and, Commission President, I wish to assure you of the express support of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. If I were now to make any additional comments of a critical nature, these would be misunderstood in translation. I wish to encourage you above all. What for? Firstly, next year is the year of the new Treaty. Secondly, it is election year, when the citizens will be talking to us. In your introduction you say what the new Treaty is about: were the national ratification processes to be concluded, the Treaty of Lisbon could also enter into force in 2009. Commission President, why so aloof? Why does it not say: the Commission will be advocating this new Treaty with all its power and all its might, of which it is already as good a guardian as it is of the existing treaties? Nail your colours to the mast, Commission President! Lead the way! Second point: next year citizens are being called upon and not every detail of the legislation is of interest to them, but only the overall achievement, the line taken. Here the trimming down of bureaucracy is in fact something by which you could secure the approval of citizens. Therefore, show a new culture of subsidiarity! Do not comb through the acquis
 until the end of 2009, but send out a signal before the election next year. Here, too, you have our support. (Applause)

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there is consensus on the fact that we wish to reduce the harmful effects on people and the environment emanating from the use of pesticides. In order to be able to calculate these effects, indicators need to be developed. In order to be able to develop them, we need data. To ascertain this data, we need this directive. I emphasise this in order to make it clear that this does not involve authorising pesticides, or using them, but merely ascertaining data suitable for developing appropriate indicators. There is agreement on this. We have also gone to great lengths to reach common positions, as Mr Staes has rightly demonstrated, and this has also been amazingly successful. We have agreed that the scope of application has to be extended to the non-agricultural sector. We have also found a consistent position for protecting company and trade secrets. Two items remain unresolved between us: the first is the inclusion of biocides. I fully share the position expressed by the Commissioner. There are no fundamental objections to it, but we do not have the necessary knowledge at present to take this step in a meaningful way. I have no reservations against it in principle, as I have said. This can take place at an appropriate time. The second item carries more weight. We categorically object to the fact that not only the application, but also the production of pesticides is included in the scope of application, because the production process as such does not provide any information about the application. Products are exported to third countries; products are stored before they are used. Hence production, as has been said, does not yield anything as such for the purpose for which we are issuing this directive and we would therefore gladly eliminate it. Nevertheless, I would say, Mr Staes, that if the Commission manages to abide by the compromises that we have worked out, your report will not come to grief in our final vote.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if you have followed the debate this morning, you will have noticed that this Treaty is accompanied by great expectations. First there is the expectation that it should be ratified and enter into force. Then there is the expectation that it will put the European Union in a better position to live up to its task in the world, a position from which it will be able to deal with the consequences of globalisation, and so on and so forth. I would like to add a further expectation to this: I believe and hope that the Treaty offers another opportunity to take a further step towards reconciling the European Union with its citizens, as there is a gap between the Union and its citizens. This gap was highlighted by the referendums in France and the Netherlands, and it needs to be closed. The Union needs the endorsement of its citizens, and the new Treaty offers good opportunities for this. It gives the national parliaments the opportunity to participate in creating legislation. Within the framework of subsidiarity, it includes national parliaments, and quite rightly. Therefore, because approval from citizens depends, among other things, on the allocation of tasks between the EU and the Member States being clearer than it has been until now, and managed in a more balanced way. The national parliaments have a contribution to make here. I do not see us as competing with the national parliaments, but I believe that we must cooperate. I am of the opinion that the national parliaments should also make use of these opportunities. I want to challenge them outright to do so. It will be fascinating to see whether or not this new instrument for monitoring subsidiarity is effective. One further point: if we look at the European Union from outside, we see an example of regional cooperation, successful regional teamwork, of which there is only one other example in the whole world, and it is not nearly as successful or advanced as the EU: the ASEAN states. As regards ASEAN, they keep a close eye on the European Union as they attempt to cooperate and make a contribution to peace and security in the world.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, may I start by saying to you, Commission President, that having heard your minatory words last year about the attendance of Members of this House, there are more Members than Commissioners in the Chamber today, and I trust that you have noted that fact with gratification. On behalf of the PPE-DE Group, may I also voice some words of encouragement: we encourage you, during the coming year – the crucial year for the ratification of the new Treaty – to utilise your Commission's most important competence, namely the right to bring forward legislative proposals for Europe, in a way which ensures that you address the issues of serious concern to citizens effectively and utilise the opportunities at your disposal to narrow the gap between citizens and the European Union. We support your general approach as set forth in your programme, as well as the priorities you have chosen, from growth and jobs – whose success is crucial to underpin social cohesion in Europe – to many other detailed aspects, up to and including migration and research. My colleagues will focus on individual issues. We welcome the fact that you have indeed taken up various proposals arising from the structured dialogue with the committees. We would like to see this dialogue being intensified even further. We would also welcome it if your planning were not only to cover the first few months of 2009 but were perhaps to encompass a two-year cycle which could be developed further on a year-by-year basis. What we feel is missing is an indicative time schedule, and we also see a gap between your programme and the budgetary procedure, which it would be sensible to close. You intend to bring forward a total of 79 legislative initiatives and around the same number of non-legislative actions. If we look at this in terms of your stated intention to reduce bureaucracy, I am not sure whether you are genuinely serving that objective. The items of legislation whose repeal you have announced notably include many which would have expired anyway. To that extent, reducing bureaucracy is more about 'talking a good game' than achieving a real and effective objective. Next year is the year of the new Treaty. You have the opportunity – and I am confident that this Treaty will come into force – to incorporate this Treaty into your programme already at this stage. The Treaty will bring in important new elements: operability, transparency and democracy. It will also bring in an element which is vital for us and to which I recommend you devote some attention, and that is the principle of subsidiarity. A new debate on subsidiarity is starting in Europe, and the main partner for that debate is you, Mr President, and your Commission. A storm of protest erupted in some parts of Germany a few days ago over the issue of fruit and apple wines. I do not want to discuss the public reaction to this issue in detail, but let me say this, Mr President: what sort of spirit is at large in an administration which, at one bureaucratic stroke, obliterates regional traditions which go back hundreds of years, and does so in such a cold and insensitive way? There is a problem with this approach, and it is your problem, Mr President. It is a problem with your Commission. You now have an opportunity, in the spirit of the new Treaty, to create a new culture of subsidiarity. That is the opportunity – the great opportunity – for your Commission to achieve more consensus among the population at large, and it is an opportunity which we in the PPE-DE Group would expressly encourage you to seize with both hands.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at one blow the European Union has disengaged itself from its constitutional impasse. The new European Union will be more capable of action, more democratic and more transparent and it will be in a position to discharge its duties more successfully both at home and throughout the world. This is good, and congratulations to the Portuguese Presidency in this regard. If I mention with pride that the German Council Presidency was there at the beginning of the road to Lisbon, I hope you will not mind my saying so, as a German. Not all the problems have been solved yet. The absurd episode surrounding the 751st seat mandate and the President’s voting rights made this clear. There should be no question at all of the Council not being authorised to remove an elected Member’s right to vote – irrespective of position. I am grateful that both the President as well as Parliament’s representatives at the Intergovernmental Conference have quickly and palpably made this clear. Nevertheless, there is a problem here. It concerns Parliament’s composition, which remains unclear as from 2014. I am convinced that it will involve finding a system that defines and governs Parliament’s composition according to objective criteria, irrespective of political caprice. It cannot be true that the Council effectively distributes Parliament’s seats as if it were lord of the manor. We have to strive towards this until 2014. One important advance has not perhaps been recognised sufficiently to date: the strengthening of the principle of subsidiarity. This is a very important step in involving national Parliaments in responsibility for European legislation as far as subsidiarity is concerned. Subsidiarity and the demand for it strengthen the Community and do not weaken it, Commission President. We shall also be striving for this in the future. I can merely ask the national Parliaments to make thorough use of these new opportunities! (Applause)

Mr President, of course we need a European Parliament resolution on this issue. We have drafted resolutions, some of them lengthy, on many other occasions and in some cases we could not have claimed quite the same urgency. Here we have a very concrete reason, here we have a very significant change in the situation of this country, which we have been observing for a long time. It has already been pointed out that the leader of the opposition, who has been under house arrest for many years, has been awarded our Sakharov Prize but has not yet received it. That is why we must react to these new developments with a resolution. Yet there is no urgent need to do so this Wednesday. We will be holding the debate on Wednesday and I would propose that we vote on a resolution at the following sitting.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Conference of Presidents decided unanimously last week to hold a major debate on Cuba in autumn, as there is no current occasion for a debate on Cuba. Yet the General Affairs Council has been discussing Cuba today and yesterday and has issued conclusions showing the Council’s position in a slightly different light. For example, the Council invites a Cuban delegation to Brussels for exploratory talks, and declares its willingness to conduct comprehensive, open dialogue with the Cuban Government on all issues of mutual interest. This constitutes a current occasion, and so we should be much obliged if, despite last week’s discussion by the Conference of Presidents, the subject could now be placed on the agenda after all.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it cannot be stressed too emphatically that this summit will determine whether the European Union possesses the political capacity and the conjoined strength to adapt the fundamentals of the treaties, which now apply to 27 Member States, to the growing demands of a globalised world, or whether it will fail to meet this challenge and keep on energetically running on the spot. The Barón Crespo/Brok report testifies to efforts to get the timetable for the adoption of the Treaty itself adopted, and this House firmly endorses these. Those few Member States whose consent is at present still a cause of contention should therefore perhaps consider whether they are jeopardising the consolidation of the Community, and doing it for the sake of very obvious and selfish interests. Europe must not allow itself to sink into this sort of small-minded swamp. All this having been said, it should still be borne in mind that the consent of all Heads of State or Government is required only primarily rather than exclusively, so let us remind ourselves that it was not they who brought the Constitutional Treaty down, but the members of the public who said no. Whether we will gain their approval by rescuing the Treaty from the dangerous corner of the referendum without examining the reasons for their rejection of it, I venture to doubt. The way my own country is constituted leads me to object to referendums, but I am very definitely in favour of addressing the profound and continuing disquiet about the European Union and getting to grips with it in a pro-active way; for that too, the summit must send out a signal, and to do so is not to square the circle, for dissatisfaction makes itself felt in very definite ways, with reference, for example, to the lack of boundaries both within and without. There must be limits to Europe internally, in its dealings with the Member States; in the internal market, at any rate, we are coming up against the limits of integration, by which I mean the limits of what the public are prepared to accept by way of European rules and regulations, and the Commission is not least among those who transgress those boundaries to integration, occasionally deliberately and without any feel for subsidiarity. We need the structure of a new Treaty. Those who bar the way to this revision of the Treaties out of self-interest and small-mindedness lay themselves open to the question as to whether they really belong in this Community, and we will not fight shy of asking them. Let us not forget, though, that, while the Treaty requires the consent of the Heads of State or Government, Europe also needs a ‘yes’ from its citizens.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, what your presidency is doing for us Europeans is to give us courage, in that, for the first time in a long time, we are being given the impression that Europe might actually emerge from the cul-de-sac into which the failed ratification of the Treaty has led us. We will not be required to work towards a new constitution, but the way in which the European Union is constituted must be adapted to new circumstances. That much is not a matter of doubt. That will call for courage and leadership of the kind you have already demonstrated, and you will have our continued support along the way. It is not, however, only the Heads of State or Government whom you will have to win over to this enterprise, difficult enough though that will be. You must also rekindle the European peoples’ enthusiasm for the European Union, for the EU risks forfeiting the confidence of its peoples, and it may well be that it has already done so. The question arises as to whether the integration to which Mr Schulz paid tribute is the right formula; although I have to say that I do agree with this basic approach and believe that integration is at the heart of the European way, more integration will not win us the support of ordinary Europeans, and so I urge you, Madam Federal Chancellor, to make yourself the spokesman for those who, although convinced Europeans and in favour of the integrationist approach, are less than satisfied with the way this European Union is perceived. The source of the disquiet, of the distance to which you yourself referred, is the excessively regulatory approach to legislation, with decisions taken here being perceived, by people at ground level, as harassment on the part of Brussels, and if you, Mr President of the Commission, want an example of this from your own area of responsibility, I recommend the study, shortly before going to bed one night, of the directive on the protection of soil; I can promise you that it will give you nightmares. While we are right to celebrate the European Union’s historic triumphs, what the dissatisfaction with it makes clear is that what Europe now needs, in general terms, is not more integration, but boundaries – both within it and between it and the outside world. Integration is indeed a good thing, but it has become unbalanced, in that we sometimes have too much of it at home, while outside – which is where the public want more of a common foreign and security policy – there is not enough of it, and, if you doubt that, you need only ask yourself whether it is not indeed the case that an appeal for the release of the brave British soldiers is much more effective when it is backed by the whole of the European Union rather than coming from only one Member State. The European Union needs to be liberated from the encrustation with which the integrationist approach has overlaid it, and that is where your thinking about discontinuity hits the nail right on the head, with the idea that a draft act that has not been passed into law by the end of a legislative period should be required to lapse. That will make for clarity, make it clearer who is responsible for what, and will build confidence, and so, Madam Federal Chancellor, my wish for you is that you succeed in winning back the trust of the peoples of Europe, which you have the opportunity to do.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is nice that you were able to come after all, Commissioner. We are glad you are here. We have no cause to be over critical, since the presence of Members is in inverse proportion to the importance of this project. This debate makes sense if, when formulating the final legislative programme in the autumn, the Commission listens to what Parliament has to say. A number of my fellow Members will be commenting on the details. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats) is in principle prepared not only to give the Commission’s work its political backing in Parliament, but also to go along with the objectives it defined at the beginning of its mandate: prosperity, solidarity, security and freedom. I am pleased to confirm that, starting from these objectives, you are also developing the correct political measures for the areas on which we now have to work: growth, employment, climate change, energy, the knowledge-based society, consolidation of enlargement. We can argue about the details. I have one criticism of what you say, Commissioner. You announce a common European asylum system for 2010. Forgive my saying so, but the Treaties open the way for minimum standards in these fields, but not for a harmonised European asylum system. Please check very carefully where you are leaving the level of the Treaty here. That is a sore point for me. This legislative programme is interesting not for what it contains but for what it does not contain. You say in the introduction that these measures meet the citizens’ expectations of where Europe should act. You paint a picture of a Union that is able to respond to the challenges of globalisation. Over all, you draw a comparatively rosy picture of this European Union, especially so far as the citizens’ expectations are concerned. If that is the case, then why did the citizens of France and the Netherlands say such a clear No to Europe? The Treaty itself hardly gave them any reason to, hardly any of them read it. There is a deep unease about the European Union, and if you investigate that unease, you find there is a reason for it — not the only reason, but a reason nevertheless – and that is European bureaucracy. It gives many people the feeling they are having their minds made up for them and having policies forced upon them, being exposed to decisions where nobody understands why they have to be taken in Europe and not in the Member States. This feeling of being treated like children provokes rejection, leads to falling turnouts in elections and, if the process continues, it will boost political forces that are really against Europe, and that ought to worry us. We in Parliament, too, must ask ourselves how long we can claim to be the European nations’ legitimate representatives if the election turnout is always less than 50%. One of the sources of unease is European legislation. That is why this is the right time to talk about it. You speak yourself, Commissioner, of an ambitious drive towards better regulation. How true and how worthy of support! You have our full political support in that. So far, however, you have only mentioned the target: a 25% reduction. You do not say how that target will be achieved. Better regulation is more than anything something which is meticulous about respecting the limits of subsidiarity and respecting the competence of the Member States rather than craftily pushing those limits back. The European Commission has in its hands a key to regaining the public’s confidence. We also need a new culture of subsidiarity. Every piece of draft legislation should take care not to regulate every detail, but to weigh up carefully where the Member States’ regulative competence begins. Point the way, Commissioner! Less central lawmaking will be Europe’s gain.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if we are to succeed in fighting terrorism – one of the most menacing threats that civilised humanity faces – we have to fight it together, and fighting terrorism will necessarily involve the use of our secret services. The war on terrorism will, though, be won only if we maintain the standards associated with the rule of law and not lay them aside for the duration of the campaign. That much has to be clear. Accusations have been made – which will have to be examined and investigated, and there will have to be consequences resulting from them – of the transportation of prisoners, their torture, and of the use of secret prisons. Of that there is no doubt, and the relevant public prosecutors have already started to take action, but what contribution does this report make to this? From the legal point of view, it is a collection of suspicions, with such phrases as: ‘the grave suspicion’, ‘the Committee is outraged’, ‘demands the disclosure of interview records’, ‘deplores the director of Europol’s refusal to appear’ – something that, incidentally, that person strongly disputes – ‘thinks it very probable that…’ and so on and so forth. This is not enough. It is quite obvious that the report does not meet the legal standards that we ourselves apply. Let us just consider the most important point into which inquiry was made, that being the assertion that there were secret prisons in Romania and Poland. For that, the report furnishes not even a shadow of evidence; indeed, we find in it nothing that we could not already have read in the media, and that is why the report is a complete flop. More to the point, it is tendentious, as you will find if you read it and consider the general line it takes on the work of the intelligence services. As a result of this, we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will vote to adopt it only if a degree of balance is restored to it by a number of amendments.

 Mr President, I would like to suggest that we avail ourselves of the option provided by Rule 168(2) of our Rules of Procedure and send this report back to the committee. The reason I have for saying this is that I am familiar with the problem of Article 90 and that this report surely describes the situation of the Dalits, India’s so-called untouchables, in accurate terms, it is no less apparent that nobody among us finds these conditions tolerable, and we are obliged to do whatever we can about them. However, it also appears that India has raised serious objections to this report on the grounds that it discusses the caste system in India and hence something that is part and parcel of that country's traditions and culture. I would, then, ask that consideration be given to whether it might be well-advised, in the interests of what we are trying to do, to discuss this again in the committee, even if what emerges from it later on differs from the present motion for a resolution in no respect whatever. We would, however, be well advised to talk to the Indian authorities again, since it is all too often we Europeans who wag the finger at others and tell them what to do, which tends to hinder us from achieving the objectives we seek, so I put it to the House that this would be a wiser course of action.

Mr President, you, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, as the Head of the German Government, are heir to a great European tradition; Mr Schulz was right to point that out, and I must spring to his defence against the charge unjustly levelled at him by my colleague Mr Langen of having forgotten your predecessor when listing the significant Heads of the German Government. I can assure you that Mr Schulz is not absent-minded and that he does not say things without thinking first. Our efforts are focused on the constitutional treaty, and so are our expectations of your presidency. If I might use your image of the European house, it is a house in which there is an audible murmuring, a house in which everyone would like to live, but the fact that the Netherlands and France have said ‘no’ means that the constitutional treaty is straddling two levels – the councils and governments on the one hand and the citizens on the other, and it is obvious that it has, for the moment, been brought down not by the councils and governments, but by the public, which is why it is they that we must endeavour to win round. The proverbial sixty-four thousand dollar question is: how are we going to do that? Coming back to your image of the European house, we all want to live in it, but the people who actually do, want to organise the interior decorating themselves. The interior décor of the European house is subject to too many European rules, and that tends to make people annoyed. There is excessive European regulation, including of things that do not need to be regulated by Europe at all. In many cases, this is attributable to the requirements of national governments, but occasionally – with all due respect to its President – to the Commission’s excessive enthusiasm for regulating things. That is why the reduction of bureaucracy is an essential consideration, and you have our fullest support in trying to achieve it.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this compromise bears Parliament’s imprint. This is the second time – the first being when we dealt with the Services Directive – that this House has made the decisive contribution to achieving a solution in an important piece of legislation. It is good that the solution was found here in Parliament. Nevertheless, it is a compromise – no other solution was possible at the time, and even mediation would have undoubtedly proved very problematic. For this reason, the right course of action is to endorse this compromise – although I do so only with considerable reservations. This REACH regime signifies revolutionary progress with regard to knowledge about approximately 30 000 substances used in trade and industry. This means dramatic progress for health and the environment in Europe, as the President-in-Office rightly pointed out. Why, however, I ask him, did he fail to say a single word about the fact that we are not only transferring responsibility for substances to enterprises, but also imposing considerable costs on them? Why did he not mention that we are introducing new bureaucratic procedures in Europe, and thus doing the exact opposite of what we proclaim in our soapbox speeches about cutting red tape and achieving the Lisbon objectives? I think that honesty requires us to admit that we want this environmental progress but are imposing considerable costs on the business and industrial community in the process. Time will tell whether, as Mr Verheugen and I hope, the competitiveness of this community can withstand that. The fact is that, first of all, costs are being mentioned that could have been lower. The Finnish Council Presidency rejected a relaxation of testing requirements for low tonnages. Firstly, these tests are expensive, secondly, they are not very useful, and thirdly, they require enormous amounts of animal testing. It would have been better to revert to the solution found at first reading by Parliament, together with Mr Sacconi – to whom I am obliged for his work. What comes next? The next step is the implementation of this massive piece of work, this Regulation, which takes effect immediately – that is to say, does not first need to be transposed into national law. A decisive factor in this regard will be the way that the Commission and the Agency deal with those concerned. I would ask the two Commissioners, in particular, namely Messrs Dimas and Verheugen – who are more acutely aware than others that the organisation of REACH tends to put small and medium-sized enterprises at a disadvantage – to work together with SMEs on implementation in a spirit of partnership, and also to ensure that the European economy can withstand this strain.

 I voted in favour of the report despite the endorsement contained therein of full Member States status as the ultimate objective, and, in a roll-call vote, together with the other CDU/CSU MEPs, expressed our repudiation of the idea that Turkey should be a full Member State. The realistic and critical view taken by the report of the situation in Turkey makes it appropriate that it should be adopted. It notes that, from the very outset of accession negotiations, Turkey has not by a long way met the Copenhagen criteria in such core areas as human rights and freedom of religion. It also speaks in plain terms of the failure to come to terms with what happened to the Armenians in Turkey. It is inconceivable that Turkey should become a Member State of the EU without facing up to the facts of history. The report also calls for a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus issue; if Turkey continues to deny Cyprus recognition, the EU must suspend the accession talks. Turkish accession would overstretch, and therefore weaken, the EU. European unification has been a success story so far, and can continue to be one only if the EU remains strong. A Europe without political or geographical contours is a Europe that the public reject. Enlargement must not be seen as an automatic process. We want Turkey to be an important partner alongside the EU, and it is for that reason that we advocate a privileged partnership as an alternative to full membership.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have just heard from the representative of the Vienna Congress. Our colleague has settled in over this period. Mr Schüssel, if we look at the facts it is clear that you have had a remarkably successful Presidency of the Council. The Financial Perspective, the final shape given to the new REACH chemicals policy, the Services Directive, new initiatives on asylum and migration - none of these was a foregone conclusion. It might almost be thought that your success contradicts the assertion that we need a Constitutional Treaty to enable us to act, because you have proved that there might also be other ways of proceeding. However, I do not share this opinion at all. I would like to remind you once more that we began work on the proposed ‘Constitutional Treaty’ when we were in the process of accepting ten, twelve or more new Member States and wanted, by means of this project, to make the Union not only more capable of taking action but also more democratic and more transparent. Had we achieved this in good time and, for instance, arranged for competences to be defined in the manner described in the draft Constitutional Treaty, then the people of the Netherlands and France might not have voted against the Treaty. I would like now, Mr Schüssel, to ask a leading question: are you sure that the Heads of State or Government would be as willing to sign up to the Treaty today as they were then? I am not sure quite how far the consensus that binds us in principle and according to which we need a new set of rules will be maintained. I think we still need to revise our ideas. Europe obviously needs borders, and not just of the geographical variety. Just a word about Turkey: how long does the Council really want to be held to ransom by the Turkish Government over tariff union agreements. The public are aware of what is going on, and it is unacceptable. (The President cut off the speaker)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are sticking to January 2007 as the date for accession, but attaching to that date conditions that must be satisfied by October. It is a winding road the Commission is pursuing here. It is clearly suffering under the burden of its own past mistakes. We are eager to see, Commissioner, how you will explain to us in October that the hurdles you have erected here today have now been overcome. It was a great mistake to set 2007 as the date for accession when it was still unclear whether it could ever be met. The Commission is now trying rather desperately to find a way out of this impasse
 into which it has got itself. Of course the proposal you have made today is sensible given the circumstances. That is why I am supporting it despite all its weaknesses. I will confine myself to a few remarks about Romania, since I have been there with a CDU/CSU delegation. Under the leadership of President Basescu and Prime Minister Popescu-Tariceanu, a determined and serious reform process has begun there, affecting home affairs, the judiciary and the fight against corruption. It has not been completed yet. The conditions are not yet fully satisfied. The corruption trials have not yet been finally concluded, but they are seriously under way and it will take time. I think it is important that we send this government a signal to continue determinedly down this road to reform. That is important. Romania is a European-minded country through and through. It will be a good ally for us in the European Union. There is a German minority there whose rights are satisfactorily enshrined in law. The law on minorities is an example to others. That is why, Commissioner, I would urge you to encourage the government to continue its process of reform.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot join with the majority that has endorsed the system of approval, and it is for this reason that we have voted against it. What can be adduced in the report’s defence is what it has to say about registration, which was accepted by a broad qualified majority – the only important block and the most important issue to be adopted by qualified majority here in this House. This is a decision that will carry weight both in the Council and in the Commission. It is only with that in mind, and explicitly rejecting the approval, which we know will be corrected by the Council, that I vote in favour of the report.

 I should like to clarify, at the end of this vote, that I have voted in favour of Mr Sacconi’s report solely in order to express my endorsement of the compromise on registration worked out by the rapporteur and myself. I certainly do not wish to express my approval of its other aspects, most especially not of the approach adopted towards authorisation, since I firmly repudiate the idea that the authorisation of substances should be limited.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that the environment and the protection of the consumer stand to gain if this REACH law is adopted is not a matter of doubt. If it is, then we will, within eleven years, be in possession of knowledge and information that we have not been able to collect before on some 30 000 substances used by European businesses. That is what makes this such a crucial leap forward. What brings it about is the fact that we will, in future, be transferring to businesses the responsibility for obtaining information and carrying out tests, along with the costs incurred in doing so. Businesses will be responsible for the safe handling of the substances that they produce and with which they have dealings. That is the crucial change over against the law as it was before, and I think it has to be mentioned that it involves considerable costs, for these tests cost money – up to EUR 200 000! Businesses would in future be required to bear these costs themselves in the interests of the environment and consumer protection, and that means that we have to give some thought to what effect this would have on competitiveness. Reference has already been made to the compromise that Mr Sacconi and I have been able to hammer out, and to which our respective groups have been good enough to give their approval. It makes the requirement for data in the range between one and one hundred tonnes, which is of particular importance for small and medium-sized enterprises, more dependent on the potential risk from a substance, rather than only on the quantity in which it is produced. That is a vitally important development for small and medium-sized producers and users; I am very pleased indeed that we have been able to achieve it, and it does of course have our unconditional backing. We have tabled old amendments only against the possible eventuality of our not getting a majority for it. It has to be said, though, that this compromise relates only to registration, which is the most important part of REACH, and certainly not to the whole thing. Matters relating to authorisation and scope are still outstanding, and I hope we will manage to come to an agreement on them too.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the reason why we called for this debate was that we wanted an opportunity to discuss at what point it would be right to invite observers. Let me start by pointing out that it was not the plenary that took this decision, but the Conference of Presidents. This is a highly political decision, and so there cannot fail to be some doubts about this. The proper place for decisions such as this one is in this plenary and in broad daylight, and it is not very democratic for them to be taken by the Conference of Presidents and behind closed doors. Turning to the matter in hand, Mr Horáček is quite right to draw attention to the continuing deficiencies in the processes of Romania’s and Bulgaria’s accession. We all want Romania and Bulgaria to become Member States of the EU; about that there is not the slightest doubt. If, though, we impose conditions on their accession, we must ourselves take those conditions seriously. I would add that one reason why the results from the French and Dutch referenda were so devastating was that many members of the public get the impression that, although we attach conditions to a country’s accession, we do not ourselves take those conditions seriously. That is why the enlargement process has got completely out of hand; the fact is that we cannot cope with enlarging the EU and deepening it both at the same time, and we must now be very firm in giving priority to deepening it. Even so, it sent the wrong message to invite these countries to send observers over a year before an accession the date for which has not yet been fixed. It is, after all, quite possible – as the Commissioner himself has just hinted – that accession will be put back a year in consequence of the situation that Mr Horáček has described so accurately. Are the observers, then, to be with us in this House for two and a half years? That would surely be inappropriate, to say the least, and so the right thing to do would indeed be to take the decision only once the progress report has been produced. It is for that reason that we want to discuss that now.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this House is not in any doubt about the fact that Bulgaria and Romania will join the European Union. What is still an open question is at what point in time they will do so. The Conference of Presidents has decided to invite observers in September, and, although we all, of course, accept its ruling with the utmost submissiveness and reverence, the plenary might perhaps be allowed to decide these things for itself from time to time. (Applause)
 There are three reasons why the date set for the sending of observers was too early. For a start, never before have observers been invited so early on; secondly, the treaties explicitly provide for the accession date to be delayed, and, if that were to happen, the observers would be here for rather more than two years; and thirdly they would be with us when the Commission presents its next progress report, in which we can expect an answer as to whether accession is to take place at the beginning of 2007 or of 2008, and debating with observers present is not a good idea. We therefore ask that this item be put on the agenda, thus enabling us, on the basis of the plenary’s decision, to consider the matter carefully. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the failure of the summit and, not least, the circumstances surrounding it, are symptomatic of the deep crisis that we are in, and which has been precipitated by the dramatic way in which the public have denied us their allegiance. That much is apparent from what the voters in France and the Netherlands have done, and in doing it they surely represent many others. Their motivations as individuals may differ, but what underlies them can be found throughout the European Union. If we are to regain the public’s confidence, we have to bring about a change in direction and a change in European politics. I have only a few comments to make on this. For a start, we do not want a constitution. The mere term ‘constitution’ is redolent of a European superstate; nobody wants one, and we are not even trying to build one. What we do need, though, and urgently, is a basic agreement setting out how decisions are to be taken in the European Union, and how the institutions – Council, Parliament and Commission – relate to one another. We need the Charter of Fundamental Rights in an agreed form. Such are the essential elements of what we need, and of what will enable us to organise and manage a Union of 25 or even more Member States in an orderly fashion. We have to enable the public to understand and get a handle on enlargement, and that means that Europe needs borders. A halt must be called to the process of enlargement until such time as we have consolidated the last additions, and I would also point out that most people in Europe would feel themselves affronted if the accession negotiations with Turkey were to start on 3 October. What is needed is a privileged partnership with Turkey, rather than for it to become a Member State. My final point is that a new culture of subsidiarity is called for in the Commission’s bureaucracy. The Commission must give thought to how many regulations have to be enacted in Brussels and about the point at which the Member States should assume responsibility.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from a legal point of view, this treaty, as everyone knows, has failed. Politically, the need to bring it into force is even more urgent than ever before. That is why we have to ask ourselves how we can help to advance the ideas outlined in the treaty. From this point of view, I wonder how wise it is now to expose the treaty to a series of public executions in the form of referenda. I think it would be much wiser to take time to reflect, so as to give the treaty a chance. This time should be used to clarify a few questions. Now is not the time or place for answers or magic formulae; now is the time for questions. One question is: have we in Europe perhaps reached the limits of integration? Are we not in the process of transferring more and more competences from the Member States to the Union, only for them to be managed there in procedures that are democratically rather dubious and in any case opaque and highly bureaucratic, to the extent that they are impossible for any citizen to understand? You might go to the Commission, examine all of the draft directives lying around there, and only find one in which a clear distinction is drawn between what needs to be regulated in Europe and what is best left in the hands of the Member States and their regions. I would bet that there is not one single directive in which this kind of subsidiarity culture is fostered. We must turn our attention to these issues. The second question is this: have we perhaps reached the limits of enlargement? No one knows how far the enlarged Union should extend. Ukraine, Belarus, Morocco, Israel – in the past all of these countries have been discussed. This lack of a boundary breeds uncertainty, and uncertainty breeds rejection. That is another reason why the voters said ‘no’. Seen in this light, giving Turkey candidate status was a failure of historic proportions on the part of the Union, and one about which we need to think long and hard.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union first adopted regulations aimed at combating money laundering in 1991. These prohibited the laundering of money from drug trafficking, and obligations were imposed primarily on financial service providers, or in other words on banks. In 2001, the scope of the Money Laundering Directive was expanded to cover a much broader range of offences. Most importantly, its obligations were extended to cover a much larger number of professions, in particular lawyers and notaries. This gave rise to considerable controversy at the time, and rightly so, because it raised questions such as whether lawyers would have to disclose confidential information they had learnt from their clients. A compromise was reached at the time, which remains in force today. The EU’s rules are based on recommendations from the ominous–
sounding FATF – the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering – which is a G7 body. These recommendations set out harmonised rules on combating money laundering, and are especially useful in that they are also applied in other countries outside the EU. It is, therefore, only sensible for us to incorporate these rules into our legislation. The task now before us is to amend the money laundering regulations for the third time. There are three reasons for this; firstly, the FATF – to which I have already referred – altered its recommendations in the summer of 2003, and these changes must now be transposed into law. Secondly, the Commission had in any case been asked to provide a definition of the term ‘serious offence’, which it had failed to do last time. The third reason, and perhaps the most important, is that the Directive will now also prohibit the financing of terrorism. No one would dispute the need for this instrument in the fight against terrorism. We agreed to adopt this Directive in a single reading. Of course, this meant that intense and complex negotiations were necessary in order to accommodate the interests not only of Parliament, but also of the Commission and the Council before today’s deadline. I am glad to say that we achieved this goal, but we were forced to make compromises in order to do so. What I am presenting to the House does not therefore correspond entirely to my own ideas, but unfortunately that is the nature of compromise. Parliament was prepared to play its part to ensure that the Directive could be adopted as speedily as possible, so that instruments for combating money laundering and terrorism could be made available without delay. Turning to the issue of impact assessment, there can be no disputing the fact that we must do something to stop money laundering and the financing of terrorism. I should like to point out, however, that we have been presented with this Directive before we have had a chance to assess properly how effective the Second Directive has been. It goes without saying that the new Directive will mean more bureaucracy and extra costs for financial service providers, lawyers and tax consultants, and in this day and age we must make quite sure that the demands we make of those concerned bear a reasonable relationship to the benefit we expect to derive. It has not yet been possible to verify whether this is the case, and the conclusion I would draw from this is that no further amendments should be tabled before this House for the foreseeable future, or until the issue of whether our endeavours in this field serve any real purpose has been settled. A number of improvements have been made to the Directive, and these include the incorporation of a risk–
based approach, which will make it possible to refrain from further measures if the latter are not mandatory from the outset. This approach is now enshrined in the Directive. I should briefly like to touch upon three points of contention. As a general rule, the Directive requires clients, for example of a bank, to be identified. It further stipulates that a bank must inform the authorities if it suspects that money laundering is taking place. It follows from this that the beneficial owners of legal entities must also be identified, and the question arises, with regard to public limited companies for example, of the number of shares that must be held in order to be regarded as a beneficial owner. We agreed on a compromise of 25%. As was to be expected, problems relating to politically exposed persons, or PEPs, caused somewhat of a stir in the House. I would note, however, that this Directive is not in actual fact aimed at MEPs, but at persons who are guilty of money laundering or similar offences, and we were forced to find a way of making this rule workable. We therefore came to a compromise whereby the residents of a Member State will be exempt from special surveillance measures, but that the latter will apply to residents of other Member States. It is open to debate as to whether this is a good idea, but that was the compromise that was reached. As a final point, I have every sympathy for the attempts that lawyers naturally made to gain exemption from this Directive, particularly in view of the fact that it was only when the latter was amended for the second time that they were included in its scope. I myself would have been prepared to make the relevant changes, but I must admit that my pleas to both the Commission and the Council in this regard fell on deaf ears, and so the rules in question have essentially stayed the same. At least some progress has been made, however, in that it has now been made clear that lawyers do not have to disclose information to which they become privy during confidential legal consultations or legal representation. I should like to thank Mr Peillon and Mr Muscat, as well as Baroness Ludford, for their cooperation, which made it possible for us to conclude the matter at first reading. I would ask Members to vote in favour of this draft report tomorrow.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I know of nobody of any standing in this House who would not be in favour of us welcoming Bulgaria and Romania into the European Union. I do, however, know of a great many Members who – for the reasons Mr Cohn-Bendit has spelled out – are loath to take a decision on this matter today. Delaying today’s decision would therefore be an eminently sensible move, as it would allow us to indicate that although we are still very much in favour of Bulgaria and Romania joining the EU, we wish to wait for the Commission’s next progress report before we actually take a final decision on the matter. (Applause)
 This would be one way of addressing many of the concerns that have been voiced, without giving rise to doubts about our basic willingness and determination to welcome these countries into the EU. I therefore have every sympathy with Mr Cohn-Bendit’s views. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to start by saying that I agree with all the expressions of sympathy in response to the calamity in South-East Asia. Having said that, I will now concentrate on making a few rather sobering comments. The donations made by people in the European Union and throughout the world are a truly overpowering demonstration of goodwill. The evidence of how the whole of the globalised world has been touched by this terrible event also makes a deep impression. In Germany, though, we have a proverb to the effect that ‘good intentions do not always do any good’. We need to learn how to help. The banner headline on today’s issue of one of the major German newspapers is ‘Many disorganised aid workers make Indonesia’s work difficult’. It also has to be said that the way in which the European Union has gone about things there is hardly likely to call forth rapturous enthusiasm about the success of the work it does. Let me also quote this: ‘If it were not for the American and Australian armies, who are all over the place, flying their cargo planes back and forth on a regular basis, then things would be far worse still.’ There is a problem here. It is quite obvious that what we need is not just goodwill and the willingness to come up with plenty of money; we also need an organisation that can get this money, in a proper way, to the people who need it. Let me therefore endorse what has already been said this morning: above all else, the European Union needs a crisis management unit, in other words, something with transport capacity, leadership and communications resources, and units to provide sanitation and supplies; that is what is needed if we want to help in a really practical way and very quickly. Until such time as the European Union has an army of its own that can deal with that sort of thing, we do in fact also need – however much goodwill is there – practical ways of delivering help, and a crisis management unit would be the very thing. That is what the EU must concentrate on.

 Mr President, with the special sitting on 21 December, you have given us something of an early Christmas present.

(Applause)

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate at least shows that the European Parliament is becoming more political and has more political power than is apparent from the Treaties. This is a further sign that, in terms of the way Europe works in practice, Parliament is often ahead of constitutional developments and it takes time for the Treaties to catch up. That is why, Mr Barroso, the CDU-CSU Group – and I mean all of its 49 Members – want you to take office and want you to work closely with the European Parliament, more closely than is laid down in the Constitution. Now the Socialists want to prevent you from taking office. They are clearly prepared to trigger a full-blown European crisis, even though the Chairman of the Socialist Group has taken the precaution of explaining that it would not be a crisis but a normal parliamentary act. The only problem is that it is so ‘normal’ that it has never happened before in Europe. And why? There is only one reason for this that will stick in the mind of the general public and that is the fact that a candidate for the post of Commissioner dared to express his religious convictions. And, because this is what it is actually all about, I should like, once more, to make our position clear. We are in fact under an obligation to respect the principle of non-discrimination. The state has no right to poke its nose into such matters. Nobody should be discriminated against on the basis of their sexual orientation or their gender, either. That is what is stated in the Charter and in the Constitution. I thought this statement would have been greeted with applause; in any case, I can see heads nodding in agreement, and so I can tell you that what I just said was a quote. I quoted word for word what Mr Buttiglione said in the hearing. And that is what you are arguing about. It is laughable, ladies and gentlemen! (Applause)
 Nassauer (PPE-DE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in this legislative period, our Parliament has to take on a new role, one that is also prefigured in the draft of the constitutional treaty. It is generally said that this treaty will give the House new rights; on closer examination, it appears that this House gains a role for itself only when it can rely on an absolute majority of its Members in doing its job. That is particularly the case when it is engaged in making laws. Only if Parliament acts with an absolute majority does it play its part in the triangle of power formed by it, the Commission and the Council. Such, it is becoming apparent, is the constitutional reality in this House, and there are political conclusions to which we must come as a result. In the past, it was all too often the case that Parliament was ground down between the Council and the Commission, for lack of any solid majority, and because either the Council or the Commission could play Parliament off against the other. For that reason, we are convinced that we in this House must, from now on, make the effort to take up a position and also accept our responsibilities. That presupposes political cooperation in this House. Looking at the relative strengths of our political groups, it is inevitable that even the two big ones will have to consider whether they can cooperate with each other, and, if so, in which areas. The fact is that, numerically speaking, that is the only way in which a majority in this House will come into being, and that is why we are presented with the unaccustomed sight of parties that, in their domestic, indigenous, national reality are as a rule the complete natural antithesis of each other – Socialists on the one hand, Christian Democrats and Conservatives on the other – attempting in this House to work together from time to time, which, in many cases, evokes misgivings back home. Here, though, politically speaking, the natural order of things is different. I do not think we should allow the rules whereby we come to decisions to be subject to merely national considerations. We should possess sufficient self-confidence to make it clear that we have ways of coming to policy decisions that differ from the national, indigenous realities of our nation states. For that reason, we urge the need to attempt to establish solid majorities, for only then will Parliament, along with the Commission and the Council, be able to play a part in the triangle of power.
 Nassauer (PPE-DE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by giving the new President of the Council, on behalf of the CDU/CSU delegation, a very warm welcome to the European Parliament and assuring him of our support should he need support from this House. It has been apparent even from the very first minutes of this debate that the issue of the European Union’s relations with Turkey will have a major part to play. We see the relationship with Turkey as being of fundamental significance, and Turkey as a dependable and important partner. We have to make that clear without reservations, and, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that involves not constricting this relationship or reducing it to membership, but instead bearing other options in mind as well. The newly-elected chairman of the Socialist Group has now made it known to us that negotiations are to be commenced with Turkey, provided that it has complied with the necessary conditions by the autumn, and, in so doing, he has acted as if Turkey’s compliance or non-compliance were at present a hidden mystery, one to be revealed in the autumn when the Commission produces its report. There is, of course, not a shred of truth in this. Far from it; everyone in this Chamber knows that Turkey, at present, does not comply with the conditions for the commencement of negotiations. That is apparent from the dominant role that the armed forces still play there. It is evident from – and here I am resorting to charitable understatement – the problematic position as regards the rule of law in Turkey, and I am mentioning only two of the conditions. Let me tell you, Mr Schulz, that we cannot reckon on any change in this regard before the autumn. I fear, therefore, that it amounts to something very like misrepresentation, not to say hypocrisy, to assert that we are starting negotiations once the conditions have been fulfilled. Are you seriously trying to tell us that they will be by the autumn? The fact is that I cannot seriously believe that they will be. It follows that honest dealing with Turkey is also about nobody, come the autumn, fooling us into believing that the Turks already fulfil the conditions, so that we can negotiate with them. It is also about the issue of negotiations – and of when they are to get going – not having the inevitable conclusion that they have to be started; instead, we have to be honest and frank in our dealings with them. I think it very important, Mr President-in-Office, that you should bear this point of view in mind as you set to work. The second relevant point is that the European public have, as we know from the elections, considerable reservations about us. If I may adapt Berthold Brecht’s phrase, we cannot elect a new public in Europe; we have to live and work with the one we have. I am therefore firmly convinced that we have to seize the opportunity presented by the debate on the Constitution to bring Europe and its citizens closer together. The debate on the Constitution offers us a unique chance to do that. Implementing the Constitution and making the public more familiar with it is a matter of obligation for us all. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can do no other than extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Budreikaitė, for a successful job of work, and for a very balanced report that does not give rise to contention. The report contains the core of what the Committee on Development wanted to say about, firstly, the challenges presented by climate change; secondly, the protection of biodiversity; thirdly the discharge of the least developed countries from their debts; fourthly the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises for the sake of improved social, environmental and economic cooperation in the countries of the South, and, fifthly, more foreign direct investment and greater diversification in exports. The report calls on the Commission to base all the Community’s development programmes on transparency and accountability, since corruption damages sustainability in the developing countries, and this House therefore advocates the introduction of independent offices to combat it, together with an adequate allocation of funds to them, and I can do no other than ask all Members of this House to endorse this report when we come to vote on it.

 Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for being here and for getting here so quickly. If we compare this situation with the case of avian influenza, then – even as an impatient MEP – I am very satisfied with the way in which the European Union, the WHO, and also the Member States themselves, have responded. Certain Members have said that there is insufficient information. In Germany, I feel that I have been provided with sufficient information on how I should behave. I also do not wish to always make Europe responsible for everything. It is the Member States that are responsible for providing this information. We should also take this opportunity to remind them that they need to fulfil their duty to provide information. I have also heard, on a number of occasions, that there are still certain shortcomings, particularly relating to the stockpiling of vaccines. I would be interested to know whether this is really the case, whether the Member States really do not want to share vaccines and whether they are only storing them for use on their territory, or whether they have agreed to share the vaccines. Then we would be at the same stage as the Commission is now. I would like to express my thanks for this rapid and excellent work. Congratulations!

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have produced a good report and we have succeeded in achieving a consensus on the regulation on animal by-products at first reading. For this, I owe my thanks to the French and Czech Presidencies, the Commission and the rapporteurs from the individual Groups. The cooperation in drafting this report was characterised by a spirit of trust and we were able to finish the report quickly, although – and we must think of it like this – the report before us now has significantly changed the Commission’s proposal, less so in the way of content, but more in terms of structure. Many of the details have been reordered. The new proposal was necessary, because a few shortcomings emerged in the application of the 2002 regulation which led to problems in practice. Although the 2002 regulation controlled animal diseases such as BSE, dioxin contamination and the spread of other animal diseases such as foot and mouth disease or swine fever, in order to make further progress in this regard it was vital to lay down requirements with regard to the questions of responsibility, traceability and the end point for slaughter by-products. It was also necessary to eliminate the legal uncertainty with regard to the scope of the regulation concerning by-products from wild game. In line with the previous regulations on hygiene issues, operators will in future also be responsible for their products. I have said this already in connection with the other regulations. However, this must not lead to a reduction in official control. Through the new regulation we want to increase safety for citizens and not merely shift the responsibility. It is therefore important for operators handling by-products to be subject to approval. The particular operators that will require approval are clearly regulated. The fact that, in addition to a process of approval, there is also a process of registration is due to the desire to reduce bureaucracy. In future, we will certainly have to examine carefully whether the registration procedure will ensure a sufficient degree of safety. I also think that the uncertainty previously caused by the provisions on animal by-products from wild game has been eliminated. It is now clear that good hunting practice is crucial. Game gathered in the woods must not be used. I also think that we have complied with the wishes of many Members in allowing the appropriate feeding of necrophagous birds in certain regions. The ability to establish the end point of the life-cycle of by-products is a significant step forward. This will eliminate legal uncertainty and resolve many shortcomings and difficulties. We will have to examine whether the setting of the end point by the European Commission complies with the aforementioned criterion, namely legal certainty. I realise, of course, that it can vary from product to product and for that reason flexibility is needed, but I will also say to the Commission now that transparency is also needed so that it is also clear to the user. Then we come to the crucial point, which, for me, is always the issue of comitology. Too many rules in the new regulation are implemented using the comitology procedure. We must examine this carefully. We know, of course, that as MEPs we have the chance to play our part here, but we also know from practice that we are not at all in a position to monitor or examine all comitology procedures. For this reason, I welcome the fact that the Commission has said that it wishes to present its proposals to the Committee on the Environment prior to their adoption. That is a good approach, because there are very many forms of comitology. I believe that we are on the right path here. I will make a couple of comments on other topics at the end of the debate.
 Horst Schnellhardt,

 Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Ulmer, I have of course taken note of the concern you expressed about the possible mixing of Category 1 and 2 materials and we also consulted the industry regarding this problem at the end of the negotiations. I think that one would already need to act extremely illegally in order to be able to mix in this material. We will check whether a more stringent regulation is needed here. What we wanted to achieve with this new regulation was to enable the by-products of slaughter to be used in many ways and in that regard I can also say to Mrs Doyle that your concern is unfounded. Everything is the same as before. By establishing the end point for slaughter by-products, we have also very clearly stipulated that they will then become subject to totally different provisions, in other words we have clearly indicated the transfer to the Waste Framework Directive. I believe that we are on the right path here. I would also like to mention that we naturally also want to address the issue of the rotten meat scandals with this new regulation. We are not completely on the right path yet in this regard, but with the labelling and the guaranteed traceability, I believe that we are heading in the right direction. Of course, we now need to see what sort of labelling the Commission will propose. This will not be particularly easy, as we all know the problem of the blue Chappi dog food – no one wants that. In this respect, we definitely need our researchers to choose an approach. As regards the issue of organic fertilisers, which was also up for debate and has not yet been properly discussed, the Commission actually intended to provide for more thorough mixing-in of the material so that the animals did not even notice it. However, that would result in a change to the quality of the fertiliser and I believe that we have formulated a good regulation in this regard and that our small-scale gardeners who like organic fertilisers so much can also be appropriately provided for. By and large, then, this is a good regulation. I am very happy with it and with the cooperation, and I hope that we will not have to amend it again too soon. The cooperation with the Commission was very agreeable and for that I am very grateful.

 Madam President, I would just like to make two brief comments. The translation may give rise to confusion in the different languages. I would therefore like to state for the record that the amendment made to Article 2(2)(a) with the wording ‘except wild game’ must always be considered in conjunction with point aa. This will remove the confusion.
 Horst Schnellhardt  (PPE-DE

 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion, the decisive point in the report before us is the change to the legal basis. Although the Member States of the European Union have developed at different rates and there are still large differences between them in terms of development, we will only achieve more legal certainty if the regulation is the preferred method of choice and remains so in the future. There are directives that have caused more damage to competition and more injustice than was previously the case as a result of the different ways in which they have been implemented in the Member States. Therefore, it is right that, in this report, the directive and the national implementation have been concentrated in one comprehensive regulation. In this way, there is, naturally, an increase in the level of legal certainty, which is extraordinarily important especially for companies in this sector that are also involved in research. Of course, the Commission’s commitment shortly to reduce 25% of compulsory registrations is also very welcome. We have taken the first step with this regulation. Congratulations, Commissioner. The present report also makes it clear how quickly new products can appear on the market and force the legislative authorities to act. We addressed the issue of changing the Cosmetics Directive as recently as a few years ago. The use of nanomaterials has forced us to address the issue again. Within the framework of preventive consumer protection, the decisions concerning labelling are welcome, while the opportunity of provisional acceptance, in view of the state of scientific discoveries is also acceptable. At this point, I would also like to warn against panic-mongering, as has happened in the case of other developments, and would instead advise a scientific examination of the whole matter. With the requirements we have implemented, namely that advertising claims and labels only reflect the true features of the product, we are acting as advocates for the consumer. However, the case of the deodorant which Mrs Roth-Behrendt mentioned, is a different matter. It works on one person, but does not work on another. Sometimes the same substance works on me one day, but does not work the next. Therefore, we should not take the matter quite as seriously. I only hope that the legal approach will not be diluted by the Commission as a result of far too many measures within the comitology procedure. Therefore, I ask you not to prolong this procedure too much.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this proposal for a directive on the promotion of clean road transport vehicles in public institutions is highly bureaucratic and impractical. It really cannot be assumed that it will have any detectable effect on the environment. There is certainly nothing wrong with the objective; moreover, we support it. We also want, however, to try everything we can to bring about a proper climate in Europe. I cannot, however, go along with this bureaucratic approach, which actually creates more problems than it solves and does not constitute an improvement. If, as has been pointed out today on several occasions, the percentages of private cars and lorries involved are, respectively, just 1% and 6%, it can hardly be assumed that any effects are going to be felt. If the local authorities constantly have to calculate what is going to be produced by a vehicle in the course of its life and what costs it is going to give rise to and then have to make their purchasing decision in the light of these factors – and in view, too, of the objection that the directive will entail still more bureaucracy – then we are engaging in a wholesale repudiation of procurement law. What we are saying quite simply is that, now, something else is being decided. It is a fact that local authorities have to decide on the basis of price. Because what we have here is duplicate legislation, we are creating legal uncertainty. That is a very reprehensible state of affairs, which I cannot endorse. Even the compromise designed to tone things down does not bring about any improvement. We cannot anticipate any improvement in the climate. Nor can we anticipate any reduction of bureaucracy in the near future. Moreover, all this is happening just six months before the European elections. It is not you who needs to conduct this discussion, Commissioner. Rather, we must conduct it in the election campaign. If I am still here in two years’ time when the Commission presents its report, I can just foresee its saying: the measure has been unsuccessful; we need to tighten up the provisions. It will not see that it has made a mistake – just as it did not foresee the rejection two years ago – but will just go on to say that, as has emerged from the consideration given to the matter, passenger transport by private individuals needs now to be included. That is the objective, and I simply cannot go along with it. Our debate needs to be at grass-roots level, so the Commission also needs to be aware that, in this case, it needs to listen more to Parliament and the MEPs.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with the White Paper, the Commission intends to present an integrated strategy for the EU which aims to reduce diseases related to poor nutrition and the overweight and obesity-related health issues with which it is associated. That is right and proper, for the increase in diseases related to poor nutrition and lack of exercise forces us to act. The Commission's aim of adopting an integrated approach across government policy areas is the right one. This is the only way to tackle the causes of obesity-related diseases. A balanced diet is important, as are nutritional education and promoting sports in schools, and it is important that we provide guidance and support so that people in the European Union can move in this direction. Various positive initiatives have already been launched. The EU Platform for Action on Diet, Physical Activity and Health is one of them, and supports this objective. It is a Europe-wide initiative which attempts to encourage citizens to make the necessary changes. The Commission's school fruit programme is another example. However, if we resort to populist demands again, as advocated in the proposal, we will simply distract attention from the real problem. What is the point of demanding, yet again, a restriction on advertising? We have only just adopted the Television without Frontiers Directive. It contains very clear rules, and yet here we are coming up with new ideas and demands again. I lived for 40 years in an area of Europe where advertising was banned. The result was not that we all slimmed down in the communist part of Europe. What are the Greens doing, calling for taxes on foods with a particular type of nutritional content? Do we want the poor in the European Union to be unable to eat certain types of food because they can no longer afford them? Which strategy, then, do we want to adopt? The strategy that we should be adopting starts with education and training. That is where we should be investing. We should not be restricting our citizens' freedom of choice with punitive measures or restricting their access to food.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we owe our thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Westlund. She worked with a great deal of commitment and very cooperatively. I welcome this, and it means we can also be happy with the result. I believe that the new Regulation on food additives has achieved a satisfactory result for both manufacturers and consumers. The current legislation on food additives is almost 20 years old. With the transfer of new directives and two decisions into two regulations, the text has been simplified and updated in accordance with new technological and scientific developments. It is a very good achievement to have a positive list that clearly states which substances can be used. I believe this is a good thing, and I am also in agreement with the use of the comitology procedure when new substances have to be added. We should act quickly here. I am satisfied with the rules on GM products. We need both authorisation procedures – there will be assessments – and so I do not see why we should not proceed accordingly here, as some Members have said. Granted, thinking about azo dyes – the results of the Southampton study are indeed available – we also have to take note of the fact that the European Food Safety Authority has developed a study that has published an initial verdict in which it clearly states that the Southampton University study is not infallible. It is not 100% reliable. We must not become hysterical and start striking out because a procedure has been instituted. The licensing procedure via the Food Safety Authority is excellent, but what bothers me – and here I should like to ask the Commission to have a rethink – is that we are giving the Food Safety Authority nine months for authorisation or risk analysis. The Commission also needs nine months to take a risk management decision. A business must therefore wait 18 months before receiving permission to place the product on the market. This is a long way from bureaucracy reduction, so we really ought to put some thought into how it could be done more quickly.

Madam President, I believe we can congratulate the rapporteur. She has certainly managed to achieve an acceptable outcome with the Council. I particularly wish to emphasise the inclusion of the divergent waste hierarchy. There are, however, minus points, which are truly incomprehensible and which were put into this document by the Council. The first of these relates to animal by-products. We had established in committee that animal by-products would be dropped from this framework waste directive. What the Council has now done is to erect the sort of bureaucratic obstacle that drives farmers to the barricades. It lays down that slurry processed into biogas suddenly becomes a waste product. Do you know what this means? It means that farmers will need a waste-treatment licence and will have to specify the precise volume and nature of the waste to be treated and the place of treatment. The Animal By-products Regulation lays down explicitly that exceptions apply to slurry. It would now therefore be easier for a farmer to spread slurry on his fields than to process it into biogas. In other words, we are creating bureaucratic obstacles to a practice we actually seek to encourage. The second point concerns waste oil. The Waste Oil Directive – which, as you know, is now to be repealed – stipulates that waste oils are to be treated and regenerated. There are large volumes being processed under that directive. It has already been established, of course, that waste oils need not be treated in cases where regeneration is not economically viable or technically possible. It has now been laid down that the Member States are to decide. Well, are we now a European Union or have we reverted to a collection of Member States? The fact is that we are quite clearly breaking up the market again. I find that very disquieting. Let me move on to the question of increased self-sufficiency. Local authorities will now determine who may dispose of what and when. Needless to say, there was a great deal of pressure from local authorities with spare incineration capacity. That, however, is the wrong way to go. It is not an option, and this extension is causing the market economy to grind to a complete halt in the realm of waste management.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with this report, we are making a contribution to cutting red tape. We have succeeded in making it clear that it is, and should be, possible to ease the burden associated with the implementation of HACCP criteria, especially for small businesses, without lowering or jeopardising our high hygiene standards. A priority – as the Commissioner has already said – is to ease the burden associated with record-keeping. I would just like to remind you that these options were already available in the hygiene package which came into force in 2006. However, we have noted that following this paradigm shift in the area of hygiene, difficulties have arisen in the context of implementation. It has always been the stated aim of Parliament and the Commission to preserve diversity of food production in a European Union of 27 Member States. It is only right and proper that small butchers' shops, for example, should be able to continue to operate in future too. However, the information that we have received from various countries is that in some regions, some small companies are finding economic survival increasingly difficult. That is why it is essential to draw attention to the flexibility built into the regulations and help it to become a reality. This – nothing else – is what we have emphasised clearly and unequivocally in this report. Maintaining flexibility means that we mention the focus on small and medium-sized enterprises only in the recitals. This makes it possible, for example, for companies which have 11, not 10, employees, let us say, to benefit from favourable treatment so that they too can apply for the administrative burden to be eased: provided, of course, that they can prove that either there are no hazards or that identified hazards are sufficiently and regularly controlled. The report also emphasises that the food business operator is responsible for furnishing the proof that either there are no hazards that must be prevented, eliminated or reduced to acceptable levels, or that identified hazards are sufficiently and regularly controlled through the implementation of general and specific food hygiene requirements. In 2006 we adopted a hygiene package which applies as it stands in the EU27. That is why I fail to understand the amendment tabled by Mrs Corbey, which states that it should be a matter for the Member States whether to allow any easing of burdens in HACCP implementation. This would create new subsidiarity scenarios, which was actually what we were trying to avoid with the Regulation; in other words, we do not want any distortions of competition. The adoption of Mrs Corbey's amendment would also conflict with the intentions of the Regulation itself: in other words, the regulation would conflict with itself. That is certainly not what we are trying to achieve! The text adopted in committee is certainly acceptable, but it explicitly restricts the option of easing the burdens to small and medium-sized enterprises. The strong involvement of the authorities, too, is out of step with the principles of the Regulation. In the Regulations themselves, it is made very clear that food businesses have a responsibility to maintain good hygiene practice and must furnish proof that they are controlling any risks. There have been repeated objections to the effect that a review of the regulations is due in 2009 so no new measures are needed now. I take issue with this view. By 2009 all food-producing companies must be licensed. Problems are likely to arise in this licensing process. This will trigger a debate and is likely to put at risk the survival of the small butchers I have already mentioned, for example. In fact, that was the starting point underlying the Commission's intention to bring forward this proposal. It is very important, therefore, for the European Parliament to send out a clear signal about the intention established in the relevant Regulation. This signal is sent out, first and foremost, to food companies and the regulatory authorities. The European Parliament has a strong track record in cutting red tape, and should do so again now, by giving its seal of approval to these regulatory provisions.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very grateful indeed for the various contributions to this debate. I think almost all the contributions have made one thing clear: we have the will to roll back bureaucracy, and we have the will to ease the burden on small and medium-sized companies in Europe when it comes to implementing the HACCP rules. Now it is up to us to express this will by voting in favour of the right amendments, and that means Amendment 10, which we have agreed with the Commission and representatives of the Council presidency. This amendment states in clear and unequivocal terms what we want to achieve. In this way, we can proceed in a very straightforward manner, building on the Regulations adopted in 2006. We want to equip the authorities and, indeed, the food companies with a procedure which enables them to react quickly. As I pointed out in my speech earlier today, the difficulties will arise in relation to the licensing of companies up to 2009. We need to send a clear message here. We want to roll back bureaucracy and we want to maintain hygiene standards. They are not diluted by this proposal. I think that is the message which conveys what Parliament wants.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, two reports on today’s discussion. Firstly, there have been violent protests against high food prices in Haiti, Bangladesh, Egypt and other countries. Secondly, European farmers are demonstrating against the fall in prices in the dairy sector. To all appearances, there are two conflicting reports, but they do belong together and prove that there are many sides to the crisis. We need a package of measures because the temptation to resort to protectionism through food producers and retail chains is an aspect that should be taken seriously and policy must be determined here first. Unlike Mr Borrell, I do no believe that we should be regulating, but that we should be providing greater competition. That is the key! I do not therefore see the often quoted connection between food prices and the cultivation of renewable raw materials. This is disproportionate and not targeted. The fact is that demand for foodstuffs has increased, particularly in China and India. We cannot avoid this, but we do nevertheless have to state that there is still no shortage of food to justify this increase in prices. I do think, however, that we must introduce measures to increase food production. Our farmers’ benefit payments should therefore be increased along these lines. I believe the revision of our agricultural policy is wrong; it has to be developed further – that is an important principle. We should also, however, be looking at our legislation to see whether it is at all appropriate for increasing production. We have a lot of regulations, which restrict the use of fertilisers and pesticides, which cause stresses and strains in the Water Framework Directive. These are not now causing price increases. Here we should once again be thinking about whether major developments are necessary. The issue of set-aside must also, of course, be developed further. Set-aside must be removed. We should be cultivating food in these areas.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what the Commission states – that soil is the crucial basis for the long-term, sustainable production of food, feed and biomass – is true. It is also true that we cannot be satisfied with the state of the soils in the European Union, but to draw from that the conclusion that we need a directive at European level is to head off in the wrong direction. Why is that? We are not taking account of the fact that there are already numerous regulations within the European Union that apply to soil and that we could use effectively. Examples are the Habitats Directive, the Directive on integrated pollution prevention and control, the Water Framework Directive, the Groundwater Directive, and the rules on cross-compliance: with these, we can have a financial influence on the improvement of the situation in individual countries. These are all existing measures, and if we add the Soil Protection Directive to them it will create regulatory duplication – parallel legislation – that really only creates more bureaucracy. We say we want to reduce bureaucracy by 25% by 2010, but this will only achieve the very opposite! It will achieve a 25% increase. In the Treaty, we undertook to regulate locally the things that could best be regulated at that level, and that is what we must do, and we must accelerate this. The claim that the deterioration of soil is causing climate change is, however, unacceptable. Scientists are unanimous that this deterioration is a result of climate change, and not the reason for it. The rapporteur has certainly put a lot of work into this, but when we see that rules that are implemented by other directives have priority, that is unacceptable: we do not have top-priority directives and then lower-priority directives. If we really want to achieve something, let us stick to the method of open coordination, transferring expertise from country to country. That is the right approach and it will surely bring a result. This Directive, on the other hand, brings only bureaucracy and confusing legislation.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen! In your introduction, Commissioner, you described the advantages of these new arrangements: greater legal certainty, better information for consumers and – very importantly – less bureaucracy. I can only support you! Please continue. Transform this patchwork of directives into regulations. Then we will have an important and correct basis for European legislation. Since regulations of course apply in all Member States as they stand, the conditions of the internal market demand a degree of flexibility and messages that are relevant. That is why the scrutiny of a product in the codecision procedure, as proposed in committee, is unnecessary. I am a strong supporter of the codecision procedure, but in this case I am nevertheless arguing that the extended comitology procedure be used. I am sure you will find that acceptable. The effect of products and food additives on health or – as Mrs Westlund says – on the natural environment should not come into these regulations either. We should be concentrating on what we want to achieve. Otherwise we will end up with a broad fabric of rules and will fall short of our target. There are plenty of other rules for that. I also think the proposal that food additives should be permitted only if the effect cannot be achieved with spices is altogether excessive. There is no scientific basis for this. We cannot agree to it. I am actually very happy with the authorisation procedures. But show a bit of confidence in your colleagues, ladies and gentlemen of the Commission! Why six months for the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and nine months for the Commission? You should change that, Commissioner. Follow the proposal of allowing both institutions six months. It should then be possible to develop something positive.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, you all heard what the Commissioner said, which, I can honestly say, expressed my feelings exactly. All of us in this room heard it, and we shall take it into account during tomorrow’s vote, too. What was the starting point? When we held the hearing on 26 June of last year, we soon found that there were very great differences in the implementation of the Regulation. The Council was divided, Parliament was divided, and we really wondered how all this was to be overcome. I regard the fact that we have before us today a compromise involving the Council, the Commission and sections of Parliament – after first reading, mark you – as rather sensational, considering the starting situation. It is a result for all those involved, and so I should like to thank the Commission, the Council and those fellow Members who have helped to work on it: Mrs McAvan, Mr Schlyter, and Mr Maaten of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, to name but a few. Their cooperation was excellent, and indeed this is the only way of achieving a positive result. Not only did this come together at the drawing board, it was also the result of a clear vote in committee: 58 votes in favour to only 2 against, with 2 abstentions – that was a result we could build on. As the Commissioner said, many of Parliament’s proposals have been implemented. We already agreed back then that the quality of the Regulation had to be improved, it had to include more consumer information, and it had to be brought into line with the internal market. This Regulation was necessary. There had been two regulations and many Acts of Accession, but they could not achieve all this. How wonderful – there is no system of categories. We are not classifying spirit drinks according to quality – that would have been a very bad thing – but in the field of quality we do have a ban on flavouring spirits. This means that it is forbidden to add flavourings to spirits. I once said, exaggerating somewhat, that I wanted to see spirit drinks falling under the Regulation on spirit drinks, not containing so many chemicals that they ended up under the Regulation on chemicals. What is important, however, is the protection of producers who use proper methods, and we cannot allow – to exaggerate – the production of spirit drinks to become the preparation of toxic cocktails. The issue of sweetening is another that was pushed through by Parliament. I should like to say to the Commission now that, when we discuss sweetening under the extended comitology procedure, we shall take great care that the addition of sugar is kept within reasonable bounds. Figures have been mentioned: 20 grams per litre, which corresponds to five teaspoons. I have to say that tea with five teaspoons of sugar added starts to lose its appeal! We shall keep an eye on this. The methanol content of 50 grams per hectolitre in the old Regulation has been reduced to 10 grams per hectolitre. This had been a health problem. The hydrocyanic acid content of stone-fruit marc spirit has been reduced by 3 grams to 7 grams per hectolitre of pure alcohol. These are achievements that cannot be praised enough. The new proposal also reflects traditional methods. We have been at pains to ensure, in particular, that traditionally produced products can continue to be produced. That is a very important point. Moving on, now, to vodka: a very contentious issue. I could have lived with the Commission proposal that the raw-material basis of vodka always be included on the label; but the traditional producing countries, for example Poland and Finland, objected. I took account of these objections, which related to traditions, and said: in that case, we shall exempt potatoes and cereals from the labelling requirement, and only the other agricultural raw materials used to produce vodka must be stated. That was the right solution as, when I look at the amendments that have been tabled and hear what the Commissioner has to say, I can already tell that all the amendments stating otherwise will fail to gain any support from within the Council, the Commission or the WTO. We are right to exempt these two products from the labelling requirement, in order to take account of traditions in Poland and Finland. We must not be tempted to introduce legislative amendments banning the manufacture of products when there is no basis for this in either health considerations or internal-market rules or consumer-protection rules. That would be taking things too far. We have always done things that way in previous legislation, too. Therefore, I would appeal to you to support the compromise tomorrow. There is no alternative compromise. Failure to adopt the present proposal will render all the other parts of the compromise invalid. The Commission will then try again to enforce its ideas, which were strongly contested, the Council will start quarrelling again, and we shall have no regulation for the coming years. I should like to point that out so that no one tries to say later on that they would have voted differently if I had only told them that. That is the reason for my request. I look forward to the discussion.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, warm congratulations to the rapporteurs; Mrs Jackson has made crucial improvements to the Commission’s original proposal. I particularly want to consider the proposed hierarchy of waste treatment from the point of view of the conservation of resources; it is because of that that this directive needs also to be seen in the context of the security of energy supply, which is the burning issue of the day in Europe at the moment. Europe’s dependency on energy supplies from various third states puts the issue of the scarcity of resources and the protection of them at the centre of almost every policy debate, and so, in order to stabilise energy supply, reprocessing of waste should be given high priority. It may not, to be sure, guarantee the security of energy supply, but it is a small contribution to it. Let us take oil as an example of this. Since it is generally estimated that the world’s stocks of oil will have been used up by 2050, it strikes me as irresponsible for us in Europe to continue to burn waste oil in such large quantities when, across Europe, it is used to produce around a third of all lubricants – an example of good technology of the sort that ought to be promoted in future. Yes, of course, flexibility is vital; after all, paper cannot be reclaimed and reprocessed an infinite number of times, and that is why I think the amendment that has been tabled on the subject of flexibility is so extremely important and relevant. For the sake of legal certainty, though – particularly where reprocessing is concerned – it is very important that, when the directive is transposed, it should be clearly laid down precisely when a substance is still waste and when it is that it becomes a product. There must be no legal grey areas here, for they result only in fraud and uncertainty, which we cannot afford. Let me conclude by saying something about the revision of the landfill directive. It is indeed the case that the disposal of waste in landfill sites is to be cut back, but the argument based on the alleged discharge from them of methane, which damages the environment, takes us down blind alleys. The technology exists to deal with this, and even now the gas is being trapped and turned into biogas. That is something we should take into account. Quite apart from that, I endorse the proposal from Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf on the subject of the reprocessing of foodstuffs, and I suggest that you, Commissioner, should have a rethink about that.
 Horst Schnellhardt (PPE-DE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s endeavours to reduce the large number of accidents and casualties and significantly improve the situation in Member States are certainly welcome, and indeed the rapporteur has had a few things to say about that. Do we really think, however, that these measures will result in fewer accidents in these countries? I believe that the exact opposite will be the case. These measures will mean the commitment of funds in these countries that can be used for precisely these measures. I should like to comment on the costs, which are always set out. Naturally, I am concerned about the number of casualties. I read today, with regard to REACH, the amount by which we could reduce healthcare expenditure if we managed to improve this situation. The figures are correct, of course, but we shall never achieve them. The only thing we shall achieve with this document is red tape, even though we all insist that the EU rejects this and wants to reduce it. Yet the EU Member States are well-placed to deal with this problem. They collect their own statistics, they take the necessary measures, they know the local situation much better than we in Brussels or Strasbourg do. We are deceiving ourselves if we suppose that our statistics are able to tell the Member States anything they do not already know; we are on the wrong track. Taking driving as an example, we cannot hope to influence driving practices in Sicily or Finland from Brussels. This can only be done by taking action locally, and therefore such action should be regulated purely by means of subsidiarity. I should like to offer a rather exaggerated analogy. Say someone were to tell me today that many people are injured falling off ladders whilst hanging curtains. There are some countries that traditionally do not use curtains and thus do not experience such accidents. Who would try to make a comparison? That is the way of things in many other cases, too. In my opinion, therefore, we are on the wrong track here. We should re-think these measures and focus on bilateral measures that will really lead to a reduction in accidents, as this proposal will not achieve that.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this outcome of the conciliation aims to achieve greater transparency in environmental matters and greater public participation in decision-making with regard to these. Mrs Korhola’s report makes it very clear that there had been a wide variety of developments in the legislative procedure and also some documents that certainly would not have met with our approval. Seen from this point of view, the compromise reached is undoubtedly acceptable. Evaluating this text on the basis of the objectives given is another matter, however. These state quite clearly that, through public participation, every citizen should be able to live in the environment he or she finds pleasant, yet this objective cannot actually be achieved, as everyone has a different way of looking at his or her environment. The fact is that this is a noble objective and, if I take it as a basis, our achievements do not live up to it. I should also like to make the basic comment that this compromise, in particular, fails to meet the general demand for less bureaucracy, more transparency and more democracy; on the contrary, it is completely wide of the mark. The additional bureaucracy that this proposal entails is hardly acceptable. In addition, from my perspective, it is unacceptable to grant special rights to non-governmental organisations in the environmental field. After all, many proposals and amendments would make it possible for NGOs to block or amend legislative texts from this House and Council just like that. I value the work done by NGOs in the environmental field, in particular, but I also see them as just lobbyists and representatives of a certain movement, like representatives of enterprises or associations. In this regard, we must follow closely what progress is being made with the legislative text, what the impact is on legislation in general, and also which objectives are being achieved – quite apart from the fact that I can also see this leading to harmful competition between enterprises and, potentially, to distortions of competition. We must monitor this situation. (The President cut off the speaker)

 Madam President, Commissioner, I feel I must spend a little of my time sending warmest greetings to Mrs Roth-Behrendt, together with best wishes for her recovery. My group considers many parts of this report on the amendment of the Regulation on the prevention of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies an extraordinary success. In the hectic days when the BSE problem was at its height, we had to take very quick and very harsh decisions on many things, and science has advanced in the meantime. That is why we can now speak of a good proposal. What are the advantages I see? Firstly, comitology has been limited to the necessary amount. The original proposal involved much more comitology, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf! That makes for clarity and reliability in the implementation. Secondly, the introduction of three risk categories simplifies risk assessment without jeopardising safety. It brings an internationally agreed programme of measures to prevent BSE/TSE into force throughout the European Union, based on the proposals of the World Organisation for Animal Health. The results of risk assessment in all countries can now be compared. Among other things, that also makes exporting and importing easier. Thirdly, the age from which animals must be tested for BSE is now the same for all the European Union, because the rule has been laid down in the main body of the Regulation. For animals that will be used for food it is now a uniform 30 months. We know that a lot of countries have adopted quite different rules. This new rule will make it possible to compare Member States’ statistics. We will be able to get a much better overview of the situation. Fourthly, I also welcome the fact that the general cull of the herd when BSE appears is abolished. That is scientifically based and that is how it should be done. Fifthly, the introduction of tolerance thresholds for animal proteins adventitiously and unavoidably present (I want to stress that) in plant-based feeds takes account of reality and removes problems in the sectors concerned without affecting safety. I expect the Commission and the Council to approve the agreed value of 0.5%. I consider this figure to be just about acceptable, although the tolerance limits can be expected to differ greatly in this measurement range and the tolerances can be expected to be very high. Sixthly, the scientific prohibition on the use of animal proteins in cattle feed will remain. I very much welcome the fact that we have agreed on a rule allowing some fishmeal to be used for young bovine animals. All right, it is a compromise. I would have preferred it to be clearly separated. There would then have been a clear separation in the feed industry, too, and we would have had much more safety. All the same, this rule is to be welcomed. I really must also mention, and remind the Commission of the fact, that it promised to include the question of feeding kitchen and food waste to animals when revising Regulation 1774/2002. I consider that to be very important and I would like to stress that once again. In this connection I believe we can agree to this proposal with a large majority without more ado.

 Mr President, Commissioner, this regulation takes as its starting point the need to tackle obesity and promote healthy eating, and that is something one cannot do other than agree with, but what we are presented with here is characterised by nothing more than a high degree of bureaucracy, which does little to achieve the objective and, in fact, simply asserts that there are bad food producers, consumers who cannot take responsibility for themselves, and foods both bad and good, the bad ones containing salt, fat and sugar, a state of affairs which nutrient profiles are now to put right. If you, Commissioner, really had taken note of what Parliament proposed at first reading, you would have been able to achieve all these lofty objectives, of which I am in favour, and it would have been possible without red tape and burdensome impositions, for these nutrient profiles are beyond my comprehension, and I cannot forget how Mr Podger from the Food Safety Authority said quite clearly that he did not know how he was meant to arrive at them. It is for that reason that we are, with this proposal, legislating in the dark, out of touch with reality, with what is going on in society and with the public, to whom it will be very, very difficult to explain this bureaucratic endeavour. We can of course turn round and say that we want all data from now on to have a sound scientific basis, which is what everyone wants, but this legislation will not give it to us, and that is why it is not actually a very good idea that we should adopt it in its present form, and it was not well-advised of the Commission and the Council to submit exactly the same proposal, for a second time, at second reading, for it was Parliament’s first response after first reading that was the basis for further discussion that would achieve our objective. What we are now embarking on is the suppression of competition and of the market economy, and I do not think that will do our society any good.
 Horst Schnellhardt (PPE-DE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of the present proposal for a regulation is to create greater transparency by means of increased public participation in the drafting of legislative texts, something which I very much welcome. We MEPs are dependent on receiving information from associations, organisations, non-governmental organisations and interested citizens, and reflect these in our legislative procedures. Only by incorporating the individual interests of the relevant groups in compromise legislative texts can we produce good legislation. That being the case, the public naturally needs access to information, something which – I should like to emphasise – is also extremely important, and there needs to be more of it. It surprises me, of course, that the Commission occasionally sends information to NGOs and associations rather than to the Members of the European Parliament; I have discovered – for example, in connection with REACH – that many organisations and associations have been getting such information before it reaches our pigeonholes. That does not worry me, but what does worry me is the shape and form of the amendments to the present regulation. Stipulating that NGOs – which, incidentally, safeguard sectoral interests – may take legal action to see their views incorporated into legislative texts actually presupposes considerable mistrust in Parliament. As a rule, all European institutions seem to be regarded with general suspicion. Permit me to allude to my previous occupation as a veterinary surgeon when I say that we are castrating ourselves and depriving ourselves of power here. We are calling ourselves into question and, in my opinion, we cannot allow this to happen. It would be a grave error to endorse this proposal; we should firmly oppose it. I am not implying that any NGO intends to exert a harmful influence on social developments, but I do request that it not be implied that Parliament is not up to its job. I wholeheartedly support the Council’s views on the second reading; everything else goes distinctly too far. That includes the proceedings for infringement of Community law, where intervention in ongoing proceedings is permitted: this does not benefit the public, either.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Scheele, for the cooperation in the drawing up of the report we are considering today, which was very fair, indeed positively agreeable, even though we were not of one mind on every issue. We did, though, eventually agree, and so I can say, quite simply, that there are many roads that lead to Rome. This item on its order of business is characteristic of what makes the European Parliament peculiar. We are concerning ourselves with the transposition of an international agreement between Canada, the USA, Russia and the EU, even though this agreement was – as the rapporteur said – rejected in 1998. Only in the European Parliament can such a thing happen. Speaking personally, I do not find this situation so problematic, having, at that time, voted in favour of the agreement or, to put it another way, against its rejection, because I was confident that the participating countries actually would maintain the standards required, and because I was keen that these countries’ indigenous peoples should not lose their livelihood and should be able to live from trading in skins and pelts. That is certainly defensible on the grounds that trade was freed up, but something else that was achieved – and this was another reason why I voted in favour at the time – namely that cruel traps that tormented animals were banned, some of which, leghold traps, for example, were no more than instruments of torture. What made this achievement possible was years of pressure exerted by the European Parliament, by the Commission, and also by the animal welfare organisations. The Commission directive that we have before us today contains all the measures of the agreement that facilitate trade, by which I mean primarily the import of animal skins and furs into the European Union. It is for this reason that we believe that its implementation would have an impact on the internal market and should therefore be subject to Article 95 as its legal basis. The fact that this is not the case is another reason for us to vote against this report. Even though my amendments did not attract the support of a majority in this House, I should nonetheless like to bring them to the Commission’s attention. It may be that the time is not ripe for certain regulations. I proposed that these Commission proposals should find their way into a regulation calling on the Member States to transpose the agreement, and consequently committing them to all that it would entail – reporting and so on – as well. I regard this as the right approach. I also agree with the rapporteur that we need to make improvements to the parameters and also require research, but this is not a task for the European Union, but rather for the Member States, where conditions vary so widely that due regard must be had to subsidiarity. That is why we have rejected the Commission proposal.
 Horst Schnellhardt (PPE-DE

 Mr President, Commissioner, I think Mr Blokland has done a very good job, and the final compromise amendments demonstrate his willingness to compromise, which augurs well for waste management. There are, however, a number of things in this proposal to which I would like to return. Not only is the proposal that waste law should also cover animal by-products lacking in any kind of logic, but it is also dangerous. Regulation 1774/2002/EC already contains stringent rules on animal by-products; it is a lex speciali
s prescribing in very precise form the manner in which animal by-products are to be collected, transported, processed and used, specifying, for example, the way in which vehicles and containers are to be disinfected and cleaned. That makes this regulation more stringent than the legislation on waste. As is required in the Council’s Common Position, animal by-products must generally be excluded for the sake of legal clarity. This attempt at including them is also dangerous. The fact is that we overlooked something in Regulation 1774/2002/EC. One of the exceptions provided for in it is that dead animals may also be buried as waste. One consequence of that was that officialdom, in several places, banned animal cemeteries and required people to bury their dead animals – covered as they were by waste legislation – in landfill sites. The fact is that this sort of confusion is quite unacceptable, and so it is vitally important that this should be removed from this regulation. I have just a couple more points on shipment. A compromise has, to be sure, been reached, and we have yet to see how it can be implemented, but, before it is, we must ensure that waste management is not removed from the internal market and that the shipment of waste is not excluded from it. To do so would be wrong. One consequence of it that we must prevent – and this is my second point – is something for which there may be some enthusiasm in some countries, namely waste management becoming, again, something for municipalities to deal with, thereby using their own plant to the utmost and preventing waste from being shipped. Rules must be enacted to prevent such a thing. If they are, the compromise will be a good one.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Doyle has done a splendid job and considerably helped our imminent and major improvement in the protection of the environment in Europe. It has to be said, though, that it is becoming more and more difficult to get people to show any sympathy for environmental protection measures when Article 175, the legal basis for them, is transposed in different ways in different countries, thereby endangering the smooth functioning of the internal market. The fact is that things are not the way the Council would like them to be; there are indeed differences between countries, and the internal market does get disrupted. All I can do, then, is urge that we accept Articles 175 and 95 as a dual legal basis, which is necessary in this instance; in any other, I would be in favour of a single legal basis, although I would then have to argue the case for Article 95, which does not fit the bill exactly. We in this House have always defended the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises, and it is particularly with regard to air-conditioning units that our objective gives rise to concern and criticism on their part. While the goal – an ambitious one, and important in terms of environmental policy – of changing air-conditioning units over to non-fluorinated gases by 2011 is to be welcomed, it has to be said that it does create problems for small and medium-sized enterprises, and that is why, at first reading, this House adopted a derogation, according to which, if the number of units produced is less than 50 000 per annum, the new arrangements can be introduced two years later – that is, in 2013. It is regrettable that the Council did not see fit to take this on board, but, as I regard it as necessary that flexibility in transposition be guaranteed if the changeover is to be successful, I have tabled an amendment, which enjoys support from all the groups. What is this amendment about? The intention is simply to make it possible for small-volume manufacturers, after 1 January 2013, to be given type-approval for vehicles operating in accordance with the old regime. We should give small businesses this opportunity, and not only the manufacturers of vehicles, but also the suppliers. I therefore ask you to support this amendment.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Council waited five years before delivering to Parliament its position for second reading stage, and I regard it as having demonstrated a great sense of responsibility in so doing, having waited for the results of the comprehensive assessment of the risks presented by phthalates, notably by DNP. The EU’s assessments of the risks of DNP do not show any risk as being associated with its use by all categories of the population including infants. Despite that, the Council, drawing on the study carried out by the Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment, extended restrictions on phthalates in children’s toys to the age range from 0 to 3 years. The precautionary principle, on the basis of scientific results, was thereby sufficiently reflected in practice. I therefore regard the Council’s proposal at second reading stage as even-handed and realistic. It takes account of the need for our children’s health to be adequately protected and gives businesses in the toy industry clarity about their prospects. It is also a good thing that we have been able to broker agreement between Parliament and the Council, and so I am addressing my fellow-Members of this House when I say that I am not entirely satisfied either with the way this debate has gone or with the result that has emerged from it. Let me explain what I mean. For a start, the approaches we are currently taking are characterised by an excessive emphasis on the precautionary principle. What is the point of warning notices if there is nothing to warn against, and what is the point of bans on fragrances that are meant to neutralise smells? If we carry on like that, we will end up as a breeding-ground for prohibitions and panic. Contrariwise, although hardly any deaths are attributable to phthalates, 380 people a day die as a result of smoking, despite which we have not yet managed to ban smoking from the sittings of this House. People puff away to the point where it makes one’s eyes water. Secondly, by submitting these compromise amendments, we are abandoning our most fundamental function – the drafting and enactment of legislation – into the hands of the Commission. What Commissioner Verheugen has said encourages me to have confidence in the Commission, and so I can do no other than urge continued adherence to the risk assessment with the Council’s position for second reading; then, I believe, we will end up with a positive outcome.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when the Commissioner listed the advantages of this proposal just now – let me repeat them once more: a high level of consumer protection, facilitating the free movement of goods in the internal market, enhancing legal security for economic agents, creating fair competition in the food sector, promoting and protecting innovation in the field of foodstuffs, all laudable objectives – I nodded, because yes, that is quite right! But in the regulation this is to be achieved by restricting market principles, degrading citizens to sheep–
like consumers and introducing a great deal of bureaucracy. The basic approach of doing more to promote a healthy diet and lifestyle is something that I support unreservedly. We must take action here. But the proposed means of doing so is inappropriate; it does nothing more than create the opportunity for an alibi, enabling us, in a few years’ time, to say: ‘We did something. It didn’t help, but we can wash our hands of it’. Restricting advertising to the point of banning it surely also flies in the face of a whole series of scientific and political arguments. The idea of prohibiting the making of such claims about the nutrient profile on particular foods goes against the principle of food science, according to which there are no good or bad foods, but only a good or bad diet. Across all of its committees, Parliament has sought to reduce consumer nannying, observe market principles and cut red tape. The elimination of Article 4 is the core of or basis for these changes. It is high time that you in the Commission also had a radical rethink of your procedures. Let us concentrate on informing consumers; let us close loopholes in the law to put a stop to the dishonest practices of a few economic agents, and let us create a climate in which it is acceptable to strive for a healthy lifestyle, which in itself has to be presented differently to each individual generation. You cannot live without salt or sugar. Mrs Corbey, I heard your first comments and am very concerned about your lifestyle. Soon there will be nothing left that you can eat! I should like to make another proposal, which could be a follow–
up to yours. Why not determine human beings’ nutritional requirements on the basis of their body structure, with a computer chip inserted in the head, so that they can only go in certain directions in the supermarket and can only go to certain foods. That would be the epitome of consumer nannying, and then we would have only slim people in Europe. This is good advice I am giving you, so please take note of it!

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Environment and Health Action Plan 2004-2010 before us today, combined with the proposals from our rapporteur, Mrs Ries, is equal to the heavy demands we are making of it. Its numerous projects are capable of significantly improving our knowledge about environmental impacts on health, and thus provide stronger scientific foundations for our legislative process. Furthermore, it could enable our legislation to become preventive, which is perhaps even more valuable. Maybe I am somewhat optimistic about that point, but we all need to have some dreams! Some projects will certainly be completed by 2010. I have in mind, for example, improved coordination between the Member States in the field of environment and health, something that should have been sorted out long ago in the European Union. Most of the actions will, however, extend beyond 2010. The relationship between humankind and the environment is subject to constant change and often requires new actions and reactions. I believe that we should be taking steps now to ensure that this action plan does not come to an end in 2010. The action plan will, however, be successful only if we do not implement it in isolation from the necessary economic processes and pressures and from people’s lifestyles. It will be successful only if we monitor research results as regards their general validity instead of treating the world like a laboratory. Our actions must be based on risk analysis and not on ideology. Paragraph 5 of the resolution contained in the report is doubtless well intentioned, but even the precautionary principle can only be applied if there is an appreciable risk and firm findings. Legislating on the basis of panic mongering is surely not the way to go and I cannot take this seriously. Much the same applies to the substances listed in paragraph 6, which are to be replaced by other substances. I agree with the Commissioner on this: this would breach the principle of the action plan, because we should not be concentrating on things that are covered by EU regulations, such as the REACH programme. Apart from the fact that available substitutes are costly, we also know little about the risks of exposure to them. So things need to be weighed up carefully. As regards smoking, I am in total agreement with the Commissioner: it is not for us in the European Union to be enacting laws in this area; we should instead be encouraging the Member States to proceed in the right direction here.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for what you have said, which has in fact made it even clearer that this proposal from the Commission is to a large degree accepted by this House, and, in the final analysis, wanted by the Council, as it stands. For that reason we should try to complete work, as soon as possible, on a joint directive that can then enter into force. It is still a characteristic of the European situation that European airspace belongs to those who are most overburdened on a global scale. On the one hand, the high level of traffic occurs, not in a flexible space, but rather in a fragmented European sky; the Member States’ air traffic control systems are still often not mutually compatible. Individual states often retain their own rules, regulations, procedures and performance standards. It was this, just over two years ago, that led the Commission and Parliament, under the slogan of the ‘Single European Sky’, to introduce four packages of measures aimed at doing away, once and for all, with this fragmentation in the sky above Europe. At the time, my response to all this was rather cautious, for it was unfortunately impossible for the Council to fully implement all the things in this package of measures that Parliament had thought up and asked for. Right now, though, we can be confident that the Member States – at least where the issue of cross-border blocks of airspace is concerned – are evidently prepared to accommodate each other, so that it may well be possible to create a single airspace in Europe within the foreseeable future. At that time, we also – as you said – put on the agenda more things that we wanted the four regulations to do, it having become apparent from discussions at the time that there were many incompatibilities in the field of air traffic control, whether the hardware, the technology, or even the actual services performed by air traffic controllers. That is all the more astonishing when one considers that many of the preconditions and standards have been made the subject of international rules by the ICAO or by Eurocontrol. Despite that, there exists in almost all the Member States a variety of regulations, with the consequence that individual air traffic controllers’ licences are not compatible. That is why I believe this harmonisation to be urgently necessary, and that there are three things it will enable us to achieve. Even greater safety is, in any case, worth working towards, and that we will achieve by standardising training and in-service training – with high standards, of course. As you yourself said, one fundamental issue in this is language skills, which are not, at present, guaranteed in every area. You also stressed a second point, that being the issue of who is to provide the training, of how people are to be tested and certified; in future, an independent body will be able to examine their performance in terms of how good the training is and how well it enables the air traffic controllers learning there to do their jobs later on. A third point, and one that I regard as far from secondary, is that air traffic controllers are, to this day, as a rule barred from pursuing their occupation if they were trained in another Member State. I regard all three of these points as important, and we should therefore implement them as soon as possible. If I am right in my judgment, this is not a matter of dispute. Such was, in any case, the impression I got from the competent specialist committee, which adopted my report by a large majority. It is also clear from conversations with Members that there is scarcely dissent, except – as always – on minor points with the Council, but I am confident that we will agree on a joint regulation as soon as possible. I would like to thank all the Members of the House who have contributed helpful proposals, suggestions, or criticisms to this or that aspect of this report, enabling us, overall, to come to a result with which we, together in this House, will be able to take a positive decision. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats takes the view that the oral question put by the Group of the Greens and the debate on the forthcoming meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organisation are neither timely nor relevant in content, for the question presupposes that the USA will be presenting the ICAO with a resolution when it meets on 28 September. That itself is doubtful, to say the least. That the debate on emissions trading and state subsidies to the world’s civil aviation industry is happening at all is attributable to a proposal from the ICAO Council. Moreover, the debate is taking place at the worst possible time, as neither the Committee on Transport and Tourism nor the plenary are in a position to consider in detail the ICAO’s position paper. The internal discussions within the Commission, and, in particular, among the competent Member States, have not yet been concluded either. Not only that, but the issue of emissions trading and state subsidies to the air transport sector is far too complicated for this House to be able to comment on it without careful preparation. It is also in the passengers’ interests that European airlines should answer questions about the possible effects on air transport and on how they compete with the airlines of third countries – all the more so in view of the extremely heavy economic burdens already placed on European airlines by the consequences of what happened on 11 September 2001 and by the increase in the price of oil. There is no disputing the European Union’s right to come to its own autonomous decisions in these matters, and so, for the reasons I have stated, we regard the motions for a resolution tabled by the other groups as ill-considered and premature and will vote against them accordingly.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank you, Commissioner Ashton, for your words, which we certainly should remember for a long time. A few weeks ago, I attended the most recent regional ACP summit in Guyana. The predominant opinion amongst my colleagues from the Caribbean States was that the time has come to look to the future, to stop crying over spilt milk and to single-mindedly implement the Economic Partnership Agreements. In order to ensure successful implementation of these agreements, it is vital for the parliaments to control the process by means of their parliamentary scrutiny. It is only if the parliaments are able to verify whether the new system of regulations can achieve what it was designed to do, that the Economic Partnership Agreements can operate as a driving force for development. It is only when the parliaments take on this supervisory function that we can ensure that financial aid reaches the areas where it is needed. This applies to the national parliaments of the Caribbean as much as it does to the European Parliament. In all of the resolutions before us concerning the Economic Partnership Agreements, there are paragraphs which address the issue of parliamentary control. However, these references are not consistent. The text contained in the SADC-EPA Resolution presents a good compromise. It ensures that the European Parliament’s Committee on International Trade and the Committee on Development, as well as the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Committee are involved in the process. As I view this compromise as a success, I have, together with my colleague Mr Sturdy, tabled a number of amendments, which aim to standardise these paragraphs in all of the EPA Resolutions. I would very much like your support for this initiative.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I personally was in Darfur and I was also in neighbouring Chad with Mr Ribeiro e Castro and I can therefore fully support what he has said. It is a calamity, and this calamity is exacerbated by the fact that, due to the expulsion of non-governmental organisations, only around 60% of humanitarian aid is getting through. This disaster could escalate. Three million people depend on our help. Therefore, Madam President, Commissioner, I am of the opinion that paragraph 4 of our resolution, in which we call on the only great power in the world that can influence this region, the People’s Republic of China, to make the Sudanese Government retract its expulsion of NGOs, is particularly important.
 Jürgen Schröder,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking about the impact of economic partnership agreements on development. ‘Economic partnership agreements’ really is quite a mouthful, particularly in German. It is a horrible phrase, and no doubt very few people in Germany will concern themselves with this topic, despite the fact that it will be one of the most important topics in coming years. What is it all about? The Cotonou Agreement states that economic partnership agreements should be concluded between the European Union and the ACP (African, Caribbean Pacific) States by the end of 2007. The background to this was that developing countries that were not, and are not, in the ACP Group of States complained to the World Trade Organization (WTO) that the European Union was according the ACP States special privileges. We have now managed to set up, at least in part of the Caribbean, an economic partnership agreement of this type, which we hope will be a success. My report states that this agreement will form a new basis for development cooperation: we are helping them to help themselves. We are trying to link together trade and development, by which I mean trade policy and development policy. There has, of course, been a certain amount of friction, in particular here in Parliament between our committee, the Committee on Regional Development, and the Committee on International Trade, relating primarily to the compatibility of this agreement with the rules of the WTO and especially the issue of parliamentary scrutiny. My report originally included two paragraphs – numbers 5 and 17 – relating to parliamentary scrutiny. At the request and on the advice of the chairman of the Committee on International Trade, I deleted both of those paragraphs completely and submitted an alternative draft report with these paragraphs deleted, on which we will be voting on Thursday. Apart from the two deletions, my draft report is identical to the first draft. It sets out both the opportunities and the risks of the economic partnership agreements, but it particularly emphasises the potential positive effects of these agreements on the people in those countries. Before I finish, Mr President, I would just like to say one more thing: some of our fellow Members have repeatedly claimed that people in the ACP States had too little time to conclude these agreements. That is not true: they had from 2000 to 2007; then they had another year until 2008; and we still have time. We are not, however, saying to people in these countries that they can do it whenever they like: time is running out. It is in the interests of the people in the ACP States, and I therefore call on all Members of this House to vote in favour of my report on Thursday, including those who originally intended to vote against it. This is not an argument between the left and the right; it is about helping people in the ACP States to become more self-confident and, in the foreseeable future, to become equal partners in international trade.

. – Mr President, currently we are facing a financial crisis which will go down in the history books. Nevertheless, in only a few weeks, it was possible to set up a G20 meeting which delivered concrete results, the most notable of which was the decision to use 2% of GDP to stimulate the economy and help the financial sector. On the other hand, we have not managed to fulfil our commitment to use 0.7% of GDP for development. If we had done so, the DRC would certainly be more developed and maybe this entire conflict would not have happened at all. But let us take things as they are. We do not have time now to discuss development for Kivu: we are facing a humanitarian crisis there. Two hundred and fifty thousand additional people have been displaced over recent weeks. People are dying as a direct or indirect result of the fighting, and diseases such as cholera are spreading rapidly. Since 2005, the UN has accepted the concept of responsibility to protect. The UN sent the peacekeeping force MONUC to the DRC. With 17 000 troops, MONUC is the largest peacekeeping mission in the world operating under a strong Chapter 7 mandate. But what can MONUC do? The quality of soldiers and equipment is very poor and the size of the DRC is enormous. I therefore strongly support the call to strengthen MONUC, but realistically speaking, it will be months before this reinforcement can be on the ground – precious months, during which people will die. For that reason, I propose sending a short-term European force to stabilise the region quickly until the reinforcement of MONUC is operational and deployed in the field.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the facts are known: there was an attack on the AU peacekeeping force on 30 September; ten soldiers lost their lives, eight were seriously injured, and forty are still missing. I was in Darfur with a delegation from our Parliament in July. During our visit we met representatives of AMIS, the African Union Mission in Sudan. It was, and still is, an incredibly difficult mission, as we heard from some of these AMIS representatives. For example, one of the commanders, a Nigerian general, told us that he felt as though he were a priest rather than a soldier. All he could do, he said, was appeal to people to refrain from evil acts; he had no real mandate to act, and so it is hardly surprising that rebel factions have exploited this weakness. The West is not focusing sharply enough on Africa. There is an imbalance between the extent of the tragedy in Darfur and the level of attention we devote to it. Military operations in Africa are all very well, but there is a danger of Africa becoming a testing ground for that type of mission. When the EU conducts operations there, its forces must be armed with a robust mandate, appropriate equipment and sufficient manpower. The duration of the mission must also depend on its objectives. We must not hide behind others, but must fulfil our own obligations. This applies to the funding of AMIS and to support ranging from logistics and military equipment to personnel. Above all, however, we need the political will of everyone, and it is my opinion that peace in Darfur and the whole of Sudan can be achieved only in cooperation with China.

 Mr President, perhaps I might be permitted to start by congratulating my colleague Mr Elles on his strategic thinking, particularly with regard to China and India. This is a new thing and something we should take very seriously. We in the Committee on Development have managed to get the funds from the preliminary draft budget reinstated, to keep the budget transparent, and to produce a report that is already in line with our colleague Mr Mitchell’s on development cooperation instruments, but I have nevertheless tabled two amendments in the plenary, which were not, however, adopted by the Committee on Budgets. One of these was Amendment 250, which was intended to set up a pilot project for small and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries, which were, I would remind the House, the subject of a report we adopted earlier this year. If we want to build up the self-employed and small business sector in developing countries, we need to give SMEs an enhanced role. It really would be vexatious if we were to fail to put in place a pilot project that underlined our own call for stronger SMEs in developing countries. The other amendment to which I referred was Amendment 253, which has to do with exchanges with other parliaments. It refers to our own House’s Budget and to the possibility of maintaining links with other legislatures, such as the Pan-African Parliament or the Parliament of Afghanistan, which would enable this House to have a real and positive influence on the democratisation process around the world, and so I urge you, on Thursday, to vote to adopt this amendment too.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, responsibility for Commissioner Michel’s statement lies with him himself and with the Commission; he alone bears responsibility for a statement he made some time ago in an interview. The Committee on Development discussed this with the Commissioner a week ago, and as far as I am concerned that lays the matter to rest. There is one lesson, though, that we must learn from what has happened, and it is that what is said in this House on the subject of the Congo may well not always be listened to here, but a very great deal of attention will be paid to it there, as we have been obliged – painfully – to learn. Let every one of us, then, be careful in what we say in our contributions to this debate. This very evening, the results of the parliamentary elections and the outcome of the scrutiny by the Supreme Court are expected. That is the moment at which the first round of the presidential election can be regarded as over. Even though it is fundamentally improper that we should be debating the Congo at this point in time, let us, here in this House, congratulate the Congolese people and its independent electoral commission, whose dedicated work, patience and tenacity have made this first electoral round a success. Let us hope, for our own sake and for that of the Congolese people, that the first national assembly to be elected for forty years may be able to convene and commence its work. It will help to stabilise the country. It will be for us an important partner in dialogue. Let us play our part in preparing the provincial elections; Europe and its Member States must play an effective supportive role, not only in the electoral process from beginning to end, but also in the subsequent period of reconstruction. As Mr Morillon will confirm, the EU’s election monitoring commission is staying put, and the UN is making its own considerable contribution. MONUC and EUFOR have found their roles and enjoy respect, and we MEPs will observe the forthcoming round of elections. It is cause for hope that the Congo has such a considerable potential as a democracy, but the process of democratisation is under threat from agile forces with which we are familiar, and on which we need to exert influence. Let us then persuade them that it is in their interest too that peaceful democratic elections should meet with success, and that the authority of a legitimate state should come into being; that is the only chance for the Congo and its people.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, SMEs in developing countries are generally micro-businesses, and one of the problems they have to face is that many of them work on an informal basis, that is to say, in the black economy. That is why it is important that there should be legal recognition for the property of these entrepreneurs, not least – and this is no empty phrase – for that belonging to those of them who are women. Land registry entries and legal property rights are the key to the success of SMEs in the developing countries as much as they are anywhere else. I wish to thank all those who worked on this report, which has been adopted unanimously by the Committee on Development, and ask the House to give it the greatest possible support.

 Mr President, let me make some remarks from the point of view of development cooperation. In my view, the Commission is seeking to amalgamate various budget lines. If it succeeds, it will no longer be possible for this Parliament to take decisions on how much is allocated to important sectors such as combating HIV/AIDS. Parliament should not allow its powers to be curtailed in this way. Secondly, the Commission’s APS document does not refer at all to the Millennium Development Goals or sectors important for poverty reduction, particularly education and poverty diseases. What is more, I have to insist that the ‘simplification’ of the legislative context for external action for the period from 2007 to 2013 must not result in a loss of transparency in the use of development policy resources and that the breakdown between budget lines for geographical regions and thematic sectors for the 2007 budget must allow for at least the same level of visibility as the 2006 budget. In addition, let me mention the importance of the Commission monitoring the Member States and their official development assistance levels, because of the problem of some Member States overstating ODA levels by taking into account funds that are not actually part of ODA. Linked to the ODA level is aid effectiveness and quality. The Commission must continue to implement the Paris Agenda on aid effectiveness and show the public that EU development aid makes a difference. Finally, I want to underline the need always to put the fight against poverty at the top of the EU agenda and, therefore, the need to strive for a substantial share of aid to go to the LDCs.
 Jürgen Schröder,

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, I believe that what is at stake here is not so much the distribution of funds, legal issues, programmes and so on, but, unfortunately, the fact that funding has been cut. All of us in this House are watching with concern how the revision of the Cotonou Agreement and the negotiations on the tenth European Development Fund are progressing. The Council has made a firm commitment to make more money available for development aid. This was announced amidst much backslapping at the summits held in July and December 2005. The Commission calculated that the tenth EDF covering the period 2008-2013 would have a budget of just under EUR 25 billion. I very much regret that contrary to these undertakings the Council has now only been able to agree on an amount of less than EUR 23 billion. Apart from less money being made available, this would mean that with increasing public development aid and a fixed EDF budget, EU development aid would effectively be renationalised. This would represent a backward step in all our efforts to improve coordination of EU development aid. That surely cannot be in our interest. I do, however, welcome the fact that here in this House we have come up with a cross-party motion for a resolution aimed at resolving this deplorable situation. I call on the Council to stand by its promises and to make available the urgently needed appropriations for EU development aid. A difference of EUR 2 billion is not chicken-feed. We are talking about eliminating poverty, about sustainable development and about gradual integration of the ACP countries into the world economy. Mr President-in-Office, EUR 2 billion less would be a false economy.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the case of the former dictator of Chad, Hissène Habré, should not be viewed in isolation but must be considered in the African context, because impunity of former despots is still widespread in Africa. I need only remind you of Charles Taylor from Liberia or Mengistu Haile Mariam from Ethiopia. African Dictators have ruled with extreme violence, suppressed their own people and maintained their positions of power through torture, murder and tyranny. What all of them also have in common is that they have found refuge in other African countries unpunished and have nowhere been called to account. That is the very thing we can no longer accept, however, because the victims and their families have been fighting for a long time for a trial at which the despots will have to face up to their responsibility. I therefore very much welcome the great amount of progress that has been made in the case of Hissène Habré. In September 2005, a Belgian judge issued an international arrest warrant, as a result of which Hissène Habré was placed under house arrest in Senegal in November. Senegal has stressed, however, that Hissène Habré should be brought before an African court and that the African Union should decide about it. At its last meeting in January, the African Union set up a committee, which will report in July on what such a court should look like. Mr President, Commissioner, I believe there are several possible ways of bringing Hissène Habré to court. The most realistic is his extradition to Belgium, since he could quickly be examined by a fair court in Europe. The International Criminal Court might also take on the case. An ad hoc African court, on the other hand, will require a tremendous amount of political will and is probably scarcely possible without an enormous amount of money, time and administrative effort. It is now up to the African Union to make every effort to ensure that the case of Hissène Habré is finally brought to a conclusion before a court. If, on the other hand, extradition to Belgium is ruled out, then the African Union will have to put forward a precise plan as to how an African court can deal with the matter as quickly as possible. I would be pleased if a precedent were set here and Hissène Habré were brought to court. The many victims demand it.

 Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to start by warmly thanking Mrs Bonino and Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra for having done such a good job of leading us in Kabul. I would also like to express my gratitude to all the Members of this House who were with us there. Perhaps I might be permitted to return to one subject that has cropped up a number of times this evening, namely the criticisms that are levelled at Afghanistan, a country that I think has made a gigantic leap forward and is in the process of making more of them. We should be very, very judicious in our criticisms; we Europeans have no good cause to point the finger at this country, which has suffered so much, and say who should be punished and what has gone wrong. To be sure, many things have gone wrong, and many more have yet to do so, but let us consider the history of Europe over the past century, that of my own country for example: even in the old Federal Republic, after the Second World War, many people with links to the old regime were accepted into the civil service and spent their careers in it. Recently, too, the West – to which we belong – has cosied up to the former Soviet nomenklatura
; being on friendly terms with former KGB bosses has become something to be boasted about, and so on and so forth. I would warn against our constantly telling the Afghans, from a position such as our own, what they have to do. A lot of very good things are happening; I was most especially impressed by the high degree of open-mindedness and commitment shown by the young people. There were very many young people helping out in the polling stations, and, when we asked them what they wanted, they said, ‘We want education, education, education’. I shall conclude by saying that I would very much like to see this House set up a delegation for relations with Afghanistan, for I believe that to be the best way for us to help the parliamentarians there.

Mr President, I have read Monday’s Minutes and note, to my regret, that they do not include my name, even though – as the lady Members sitting next to me can confirm – I was, as usual, present punctually for the beginning of the sitting. I ask that the Minutes be amended accordingly.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when the Soviet Union came to an end, many took the view that it would also be the end of the nuclear scare, but what was then a global nuclear scare has re-emerged at regional level; I need only mention Iran, North Korea, India and Pakistan. Unfortunately, not even the NPT has been able to prevent that. The real danger is that terrorists or criminals or irresponsible regimes might obtain nuclear weapons. The initiative by Kissinger and Shultz and Obama’s speech in Prague has now brought new momentum to this issue. That is extremely important. It is becoming clear here that even the nuclear powers are now prepared to reduce their arsenals, and that is what was new about President Obama’s declaration. It is important now for Europe to speak with one voice, for Europe, its nuclear powers and the others, to speak with one voice. A first step on this path is the fact that Mr Solana is conducting negotiations with Iran on behalf of all the European countries, as well as of countries beyond Europe. I believe that we should latch on to that. We must not expect any quick miracles on this path, as Mrs Beer is doing, but if there is an opportunity today for us to really be able to reduce this threat, step by step, then we should grab it.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from the point of view of the Committee on Budgets, the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Subcommittee on Security and Defence, I should like to introduce another rather different emphasis into this debate. Some speeches we have heard could give rise to the impression that there is no parliamentary scrutiny of common foreign and security policy, but this is far from the truth. Excellent cooperation has evolved between the Council and the Subcommittee on Security and Defence, and we are informed of every detail – including the budgetary aspects. The Committee on Budgetary Control is not involved in this – this is an internal matter for the European Parliament – but the Chairmen of the Committee on Budgets, the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Subcommittee on Security and Defence are regularly informed of budgetary aspects. Parliamentary scrutiny is taking place here. Then there are the confidential aspects, for which there is a special committee, which is also informed at regular intervals of all the details of European security and defence policy by Mr Solana personally. Things may have gone very unsatisfactorily in this regard from the point of view of the Committee on Budgetary Control. I agree that the Council’s absence from this debate is unsatisfactory. Nevertheless, nonsensical remarks such as those made by Mr Martin give the impression that there is no democratic control of any kind of the important matter of foreign and security policy in the European Union. There are more important things, for example the issue of the accounts from which Mr Solana’s travel is financed. There is the issue of the operations in Chad, Congo, Georgia and many other countries. Dialogue and effective democratic control are a reality here.

 Mr President, Mr Martin has just addressed me in a most outrageous way.

Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, this report should provide us with an opportunity to consider how far we have come with the European Union’s security and defence policy, where we are now, and what part the European Parliament has to play in this. In so doing, we must observe that there have so far been 22 deployments within the framework of the European security and defence policy, of which 16 were civilian deployments and 6 military ones. This means that a very strong emphasis has been placed on the civilian side of things. This civilian side, of course, comes complete with functional democratic control as the civilian operations under the ESDP are funded from the European budget and are therefore scrutinised by the European Parliament. There are other things that are funded from the European Union’s budget that are directly linked to security policy. Examples include security research – EUR 1.3 billion over 7 years; Galileo, which we say there are security aspects to – EUR 3.4 billion; and GMES/Kopernikus, a project for which another EUR 1 billion is available. We also now have, and this is a new development, legislation in the European Parliament in the field of security and defence. We have adopted a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the intra-Community transfer of defence equipment and on tendering in the field of security and defence. This is an important first step along the road. Of particular importance, however, is the information for the European Parliament. In this regard, our special committee, which also has access to secret information, is of particular importance, as are the regular discussions that we hold in this committee with the Special Representative on these subjects. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the High Representative and his colleagues for the constructive cooperation that has developed. I shall turn now to the individual points of this report. This report calls for the European Union to define its own security interests more clearly. We always speak of the security interests of the individual countries, but we do have common security interests. The protection of our citizens within and beyond the Union, peace in our neighbourhood, the protection of our external borders, the protection of our critical infrastructures, energy security, the security of our trade routes, the security of our assets at the global level and many other things represent, in reality, individual security interests and common security interests of the European Union. We also need to consider what the security and defence-related ambitions of the European Union actually are. The draft report states very clearly that we have no ambition to become a superpower like the United States. It is also made very clear that we must concentrate on the geographical surroundings of the European Union. Our priorities are the Balkans – the European Union’s main assignments – North Africa, the frozen conflicts in the East and our contribution to resolving the conflict in Palestine. We must put our focus quite clearly on these areas. I feel compelled to observe that, at the end of the French Presidency, the Council set very ambitious objectives, namely acquiring the ability to carry out certain operations in parallel. If that is what we want, we will need the funds to bring it about. This will involve the establishment of an autonomous and permanent headquarters in Brussels. This is a first, very clear demand from this Parliament. There was a very broad majority in favour of this in the committee. Secondly, we need to bear in mind that the 27 Member States have 2 million soldiers at their disposal. Three per cent of these soldiers should be made available to the European Union on a permanent basis. That would be 60 000 soldiers. This is why the report also calls for the Eurocorps to also be permanently assigned to the European Union. This call is aimed at the six Member States that make up the Eurocorps. We then make clear statements about the capabilities that we need to develop. The 27 Member States of the European Union spend EUR 200 billion per annum on defence, and this EUR 200 billion must be better spent than it has been in the past. We cannot afford to re-invent the wheel 27 times and we are therefore asking you today to ensure that, in future, where the European Union’s and the taxpayers’ money is spent on defence, it is better spent than it was in the past. Thank you very much.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to comment on a few points. Firstly, I wish to explain why I did not include the principles of ‘human security’ and ‘responsibility to protect’ in my report. This has been very controversial. In my personal opinion, these concepts that we have developed, whilst very important, are not suitable for a security policy, as they can be misused to justify military intervention all around the world. This is a very real risk I can envisage. Therefore, I do support these two concepts, but not for the security policy. It has also been said that I am in the process of creating a European army and am calling for this in my report. I would ask you to read the whole report through once again – you will most certainly not find the words ‘European army’ in it. What the report says is that taxpayers’ money should be spent better in this field than has been the case up to now. Then there is the European Security Strategy, which now has everyone’s support. The work that needed to be done on this took several years and was very successful. In my opinion, the next step must be to produce a work on the implementation of the security policy, a white paper on the security policy. This is a job for the next parliamentary term. Last but not least, I believe that the next talks we hold on this subject must deal with the issue of EUBAM Rafah: how to revive this mission and how it can possibly be extended.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Somalia is a failed State, with all the dreadful things this entails. You have set out most excellently what needs to be done here, and my friend Mrs Gomes has also stated this very clearly. Piracy is just one part – albeit an important one – of this problem, as piracy is very firmly established in the region. A second aspect is the protection of EU maritime routes, which is in the European Union’s own interests and those of its citizens. That is why we have the ESDP operation Atalanta, which is the first maritime operation under the ESDP. The operation’s headquarters are in the United Kingdom, which is also new, and it is being led by a British naval officer, Rear Admiral Jones. Its first task is to protect food aid and to make sure that this aid can actually reach Somalia, and its second is to combat piracy and take the appropriate action. We had a conversation with the operation headquarters in Northwood, which made clear that they are missing several things, such as tankers and reconnaissance aircraft – manned and unmanned – and helicopters, as the surveillance needs to be carried out over a very large area. We must all have a common interest in a successful Operation Atalanta. This is necessary both to protect our maritime routes and to make a contribution – albeit possibly just a small one – to solving the problem of the failed State of Somalia.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the difficulties in evacuating European citizens from Mumbai have revealed the necessity for closer coordination in matters of security and defence in the European Union. Cooperation with the Council has gone very well in recent months. Cooperation with the French Presidency and the Council was very fruitful. The central event was undoubtedly the crisis in Georgia. Here the Presidency of the Council acted quickly. It negotiated a ceasefire and ensured that observers arrived in Georgia in good time, and the European Union was at the centre of events. On the same occasion, nonetheless, shortcomings were also revealed. We saw that our Brussels instruments for crisis management had really reached the limit of their capability on this occasion. It is quite clear that we must further improve both the capabilities of the European Union in preventive analysis and the instruments of crisis management. As we know, the European Union is currently involved in revising the security strategy by the end of this year. This security strategy has proved its worth. The principles must be retained. There are individual items which must be amended and tailored to more recent realities. However, even more important than adapting the security strategy is the implementation of this security strategy. We are therefore requesting the preparation of a White Paper on Security and Defence in the European Parliament. Perhaps the French White Paper which has been drawn up on this topic might serve as a model, for here we need a very broad debate on the preparation of this White Paper – a public debate on these matters of European security. For European security is not a matter that should only be decided behind closed doors – this is a matter which concerns all citizens.

Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the European Commission, ladies and gentlemen, operations under the Security and Defence Policy are becoming more dangerous. That has been shown by the fact that for the first time a soldier has been killed during an operation under European command. Gilles Polin was killed on the border between Chad and Darfur. We must, therefore, consider whether some of those risks can be avoided. They arise as a result of the wrong kind of command structures, but also when the necessary equipment is not available for specific operations. When we consider this matter, we start with Javier Solana’s broad approach to security strategy, which covers the armed forces and also the European Union’s critical infrastructure, its external borders and humanitarian operations as well. Here we keep finding weaknesses in the area of space, satellite-based reconnaissance, satellite-based telecommunications and satellite-based navigation. If we cooperate more closely in this area, we will be able to spend our money more usefully and achieve greater efficiency. I will start with reconnaissance. We have the Helios reconnaissance satellites, the German SAR Lupe ones and the Italian Cosmo-Skymed. It is vital to ensure that the imagery received from these reconnaissance satellites is actually available to our satellite centre in Torrejón. Then there is the MUSIS project, planned for the future. In the report I urge that this project eventually be brought within an appropriate European framework. Then we have satellite navigation, the Galileo project. The report states quite clearly that the Galileo project should also be available in future for military operations, because our military forces that plan and conduct such operations need Galileo to give them directions. That brings me to telecommunications, which must also be satellite-based. Closer cooperation can be of great benefit here. I also regard software-defined radio as a joint project that offers great opportunities; it sets a common standard for protected telecommunications that could lead to interoperability between armed forces on the one hand and the police on the other, and also with the forces that have to stand by for disaster aid. We also need space surveillance to monitor our space infrastructure and protect our satellites. Here we should develop a common European system. We need an early warning system for ballistic missiles and for communications and electronic intelligence. A word on financing. We note that we are already spending a sizeable amount of the European budget on security, firstly on security research, secondly on GMES, the satellite observation system, which also has security connotations, and now on Galileo. We are in fact spending EUR 750 m of the budget on security aspects. Perhaps we should consider whether European budget funds could not also be made available for the other planned projects I mentioned.

Mr President, I would like to take up what Mr Verheugen said and also answer Mr Pflüger and Mr Batten on the question of what the citizens of the European Union want. Eurobarometer surveys show that 70% to 80% of EU citizens believe we need a common security and defence policy. That became particularly clear with the terrible events in the Balkans. The 27 European countries spend EUR 170 billion a year on defence, yet these countries were unable to put an end to the bloodshed in the Balkans because we simply do not yet have a common European organisation for such operations. There were German, French, British, Italian, Luxembourgish and other forces, yet at the time it was only the Americans, not the Europeans, who had the capability to put an end to the bloodshed. Mr Morillon saw that with his own eyes and experienced it very much in person. It is also quite wrong to refer to weapons in space here. What threat is there? If, for instance, we station Galileo or observation satellites in space to find out what is happening, it is done for the security of our citizens. The real danger is that weapons are stationed in space and used to destroy our communications satellites, because then our entire social system could be disrupted by relatively minor means. Just imagine what would happen if the telecommunications satellites for TV, for radio, for everything that makes up our society today, were destroyed. That is why I believe we are on the right track, including with Galileo. We will probably find at the vote tomorrow that there has been a change of mind in the European Parliament. The first step was that we managed to get Galileo financed out of the European budget. The Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Foreign Affairs urged this very strongly and managed to obtain it. The second step is that Galileo is of course a civilian project, somewhat different in type from the American system, but that it is also necessary and that it is available for operations by EU forces in, for instance, Congo, Bosnia and Herzegovina or Chad. I believe, therefore, that tomorrow will see a change in the majority view in the European Parliament.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Solana, I would first like to thank Mr Kuhne for his report and for the way he went about it, which meant that we were able to achieve unity on almost all points. Mr Solana, a few months ago, you attended Mr Polin’s funeral in Bayonne. He was the first soldier to have lost his life in a European operation. For me, this was a very moving event, a very sad event, which caused me to think very carefully again about when we actually deploy soldiers and under what conditions. This is also, at the same time, my answer to Mrs Beer and the concept of human security. The concept of human security is certainly an interesting one – including for development aid. Without security, there is no development. However, I am not sure that this concept is appropriate for the European Union’s security and defence policy, as it would be possible to take it to mean that we should intervene in every case, all over the world. That raises expectations that it may not be possible to fulfil. When people are in need, they do not look for the one who has the best intentions but for the one who can actually help them. This is the weakness in this concept, and nothing would be worse than raising false hopes here. My group will therefore be voting against mentioning this principle. The French Presidency is ahead of us and along with it, there will most probably also be some important decisions to make. I have mentioned this already: more and more soldiers are being sent on dangerous missions. We have a responsibility to ensure that that they also have the necessary equipment, the best possible equipment for these operations. That is not yet the case in many areas. We have shortcomings in telecommunications and – this is extremely important – in the civil area and in civil operations. We have deficits in reconnaissance and navigation. Here I expect concrete suggestions to be made so that, in the future, there will be closer cooperation and so that such projects and shortcomings will be solved together in the European way. The report in front of us demands that Eurocorps be permanently subject to the European Union. In my opinion, this would be a great step forward compared to Battle Groups, which are only ever made available to the European Union for a six-month period. I am calling for the European Security and Defence College that Mr Kuhne mentioned to become more than just a virtual college so that it is given the means with which to perform its task.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in recent years, Europe has made great progress towards a common market. However, even today there are still markets, even within the European Union, that are being opened only gradually, for example in the area of financial services, where we do not really have a common European market. For vehicles, too, although there is a common market within Europe, we stopped half-way through the process in the transatlantic area. Progress towards a common market in the area of security and defence has been achieved. A first step in this direction was the introduction of the European Defence Agency, and another step was the decision to make EUR 1.4 billion available for defence research as part of the Seventh Research Framework Programme. However, the most important step forward is the current directive proposals by the Commission, firstly for procurement in the area of security and defence, and secondly in the area of the internal shipment of defence goods. These are decisive steps towards a common European market in the area of defence, but how does the transatlantic market fare in this area? Here there are two important changes. One becomes apparent in that the United States recently decided to purchase refuelling aircraft from a European firm. Secondly, the proposed directive put forward by the European Commission for the procurement of defence goods does not contain any ‘Buy European’ rules comparable with the present ‘Buy American’ rules. The crux of the matter is to obtain the best equipment for our armed forces and this involves intensive dialogue between the European Union and NATO. It is equally important to seek direct discussions between the European Union and the United States in these economic matters, however. The Transatlantic Economic Council will therefore have to discuss this matter – either this time or perhaps at some later opportunity.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when we in Europe talk of anti-missile defence, the discussion normally revolves around the United States’ planned installations in Poland and the Czech Republic. Many people are unaware that these are merely extensions to an existing system designed to protect the United States of America. We in the European Parliament, however, must focus first and foremost on its implications for the security of the continent of Europe. As we know, the United States has already spent more than 100 billion dollars on its anti-missile defence system and is investing a further ten billion a year in the continuing development of the system. Yet the United States is much further away from potential sources of danger than we are in Europe. The present situation is rather like Luxembourg spending money to build dykes but the Netherlands seeing no need to do likewise. We must ask ourselves whether a threat actually exists and, if so, whether we need to respond to it. The debate we have just heard with Mr Solana shows that the situation in Iran remains a source of concern. We are also aware of the threat that could emanate from the unstable situation in Pakistan. We in the Subcommittee on Security and Defence have engaged in intensive dialogue with representatives of the United States, including Lieutenant General Henry Obering, Director of the Missile Defense Agency. It emerged clearly from these talks that the US system would be able, in theory, to protect part of Europe but not the whole continent. In particular, it could not protect Cyprus, Malta, parts of Greece, Romania, Bulgaria or southern Italy. From a European point of view, however, we cannot tolerate a division of our continent into areas with differing degrees of security. Accordingly, we must jointly define our common European security interests in this context. The present appraisal reminds us that there is currently no forum in which this matter is being discussed and in which these common European security interests are being defined. This is clearly another area where very close coordination with Russia is needed. We expect NATO’s Bucharest summit in April to present proposals for a joint system, and we expect these proposals to take due account of our specific European security interests.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the humanitarian situation in Chad, especially along the country's 1 360 km border with Sudan but also in the area bordering the Central African Republic, in my view makes intervention by the international community necessary. I myself was in Chad a few days ago and was able to form an impression of the situation there. More than 400 000 refugees and displaced persons are hosted in camps in this border area. These camps are permanently under threat from bandits and marauding gangs but also from the Janjaweed militia from Sudan. The situation in the open country is even more difficult. Due to the lack of security there, more and more people are seeking refuge in the camps. To help alleviate the plight of these people, the security situation in the region must be improved so that they can return to their homes. This is a difficult challenge, and in order to manage it, burden-sharing is essential. The United Nations has committed to helping to develop the police force, which can then partner the security forces. The European Union, on the other hand, was asked to provide troops with the capability to ward off the Janjaweed and the bandits and prevent attacks on the refugees, displaced persons and the civilian population. With this draft resolution, the European Parliament endorses this operation, albeit subject to the following conditions: firstly, as you have pointed out, Mr President, Commissioner, political negotiations must continue, for ultimately we need a political solution. If we send troops, however, they must have a robust mandate which genuinely enables them to deter the Janjaweed and the bandits. A very large area needs to be secured. The force must therefore also be large enough to achieve a genuine improvement in the security situation. It must be clear that this is a European force involving several European nations. EUFOR must also be adequately equipped to fulfil its mandate. In view of the relatively low troop strength and the size of the border area, this means that outstanding intelligence and transport capabilities are required, for the force must be able to determine quickly where there is a threat and must be able to reach the relevant location swiftly. Under no circumstances should a situation arise in which, due to the mandate itself or to equipment deficits, a European force in Chad could only protect itself without being able to fulfil its real mandate. A further condition imposed by the European Parliament is that a clear exit strategy must be defined which should foresee how and by whom EUFOR is replaced after its intended operational duration of one year. In the present draft resolution the European Parliament also emphasises that in the light of the complex political situation in the region, this European force in Chad should act as a neutral force for security and the protection of the civilian population. The deployment of EUFOR last year in Congo made it clear how important credible impartiality and independence can be for the success of an operation. In the present situation, by deploying a force for a limited period of one year, the European Union can make an important contribution to improving the humanitarian situation and supporting the African Union as it takes on more responsibility in the region. Both these aspects are necessary, and so I ask you to vote in favour of the present resolution.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, each year, the 27 Member States of the European Union spend EUR 170 billion on defence. These 27 Member States have two million soldiers, 10 000 tanks and 3 000 fighter aircraft. In spite of this, they could not end the bloodshed in the Balkan conflict; we needed our American friends to do it for us. Why was that? At that time there were not yet any common decision-making structures in the EU to enable the implementation of such operations. Another of the main reasons for the inefficiency of European defence is the lack of a common defence market. One of the reasons for this is Article 296. I am convinced that this Article will be retained in future. The reason that no common European defence market has developed is the excessive application of this Article in the past. First of all, the Commission issued its communication clarifying what is and what is not covered by Article 296: I think this communication is helpful. Then the European Defence Agency took action: in my opinion, the Code of Conduct it adopted was an important step in the right direction. We now also need EU legislation in this field, however – which is why I welcome the fact that this Directive is now envisaged. As MEPs, we keep hearing a great deal of criticism of the EU rules on the award of public contracts, particularly from local authorities. Therefore, we MEPs shall take very great care that the rules established here are indeed tailored towards the defence field, and that they improve rather than worsen the situation in that field. Our assent will be conditional on this. In addition, we keep hearing that we Europeans are spending too little on defence. If we continue working on this field and create a common market, we shall at least achieve more security for the same money.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate on the anti-missile system always gives me the impression of people poking around in fog, and if that is the way a debate is conducted, it is always a good excuse for polemics. For a start, what we are debating here is not ‘an’ anti-missile system, but two of them. One of them is the one belonging to the United States, a system on which USD 100 billion have already been spent, and of which the installations planned for Poland and the Czech Republic form part. The anti-missile system has cost nine billion this year so far; we have to ask ourselves what that means in terms of Europe’s security, something for which we, as elected representatives, are responsible, so the question that presents itself to my mind is whether this system is capable of protecting European countries, and, if so, whether it is actually capable of protecting all of them. What must not be allowed to happen is that Europe should be divided into two zones, with one less secure than the other; that is something we have to prevent. A second question arises in connection with the NATO anti-missile defence system, which has, so far, got no further than a feasibility study. What is NATO – what is Europe? – going to do on the basis of that feasibility study? Without a doubt, it is NATO, rather than the European Union, that bears responsibility for this, but, if we want to carry on down this road, we have to give some thought to just how the European countries are supposed to operate within the NATO framework, for if, for example, we are to take, on that basis, decisions relating to development or industry, we have the choice of dealing with the USA as 27 countries within the NATO framework or together as the European Union. In the first instance, we will certainly not be partners to the United States; in the second, we will be, but only with junior status, albeit with a chance of being their partner.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the nuclear weapons non-proliferation treaty was a great achievement, but we see nuclear weapons continuing to proliferate. We also, alas, cannot fail to see that the review conference has, for the moment, proved abortive, and that is why this preparatory conference in Vienna is so important. It is also of the very utmost importance that this House should be able to contribute its opinion to it, but the effectiveness of this is conditional upon the resolution being a joint effort, and one reflecting all our views. I hope that we will achieve that sort of result when we come to the vote. After the Soviet Union collapsed, we all believed that the days of mutually assured destruction were behind us, but, today, the risk is that, while that may have been banished from the global stage, it may be about to resume regionally. We must, together, do everything in our power to prevent this from happening. I would like to say something about one of the proposals, of which there are many, namely the international system for uranium enrichment, something that has now acquired extraordinary importance, but I also want to say something about another matter that is not directly connected with this debate, although it does have to be the subject of public discussion, and that is the issue of the anti-missile system. Here in Europe, we are currently discussing an American anti-missile defence system and its effects on us, but what must be of real interest to us is the security of Europe. The Iranian rockets against which the Americans are protecting themselves, are much closer to Europe than they are to America. We are told, for example, that these Iranian rockets are already capable of reaching Southern Italy and Greece, and that is why we have to have a general debate on the question of whether this sort of system is needed, for if it is, it is we, Europeans, who need it just as much. That is something else that we in this House must discuss and on which we have to reach decisions.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by extending my own, very heartfelt, congratulations to Mr Romeva i Rueda for the very valuable and dedicated work he has done as our rapporteur on this subject over recent years, and which he is continuing to do today. I would also like to thank you, Commissioner, for what you have had to say about the Commission’s activities in combating arms smuggling and about the fact – well-known to all of us – that the first precondition for any economic development in developing countries is the establishment of security, without which no economic development is going to happen. Mr Romeva’s report has to do with common rules applicable to arms exports, and the problem with these is that, while we do have common rules in the shape of the Code of Conduct, this code is not itself binding. How, then, can it be made binding in law? Firstly, this can be done by individual Member States declaring it to be so or stipulating it by law, which is what Germany, among others, has done. It can also be accomplished by means of a single European regulation, a Common Position, towards which we are now making progress, and in the direction of which we must continue. The real problem, however, is that, although we have, in principle, common rules, these are implemented by 27 different offices in 27 Member States, and, moreover in highly divergent ways. Although the Member States keep each other informed about these matters, they do not reach decisions jointly; for example, a weapons embargo has been imposed on China, but the definition of what is a weapon under the terms of this embargo is subject to rules that are interpreted differently in the 27 Member States and in a different way again in the USA. Things cannot go on like this; we need more common ground here. We are heading towards a common defence policy, of which the development of joint armed forces forms part. There are many who seem not to be aware of the fact that – in Bosnia-Herzegovina, for example – troops are already under European command and that they are bringing peace and security to those places. There is also a need for a single defence market, something towards which we have taken great strides over recent years, but, if both these things come to pass, there will also be a need for more joint action in the field of the monitoring of arms exports. That is one of the important tasks that we will have to deal with over the coming years, and it is one for the German Presidency of the Council too.

 – (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start, Mr President, by pointing out that Mr Dimitrakopoulos has passed on his two minutes’ speaking time to me, so that I am in the fortunate position of being able to speak for over seven minutes. The topic for this debate is the European Union's security strategy, as proposed by the High Representative and adopted by the heads of state and government on 12 September 2003, the basic outlines of which are as relevant as ever they were, but it has to be said that the geopolitical situation has changed over this period of time, and that our priorities have to change, and that is why we are calling, in this report, for the Council to submit to this House, once in every legislative period, a report on the European Union’s security strategy, which could then be debated both in this House and in the national parliaments. That is what happens in the United States, where a core report of this sort is made once in each legislative period, and so a similar arrangement here could help to step up transatlantic dialogue on these matters. We do, after all, currently put different emphases in the strategy for Europe’s security than the Americans do in respect of their own; we favour a multipolar global order, something that Mr Solana calls effective multilateralism. We do not put our trust in coalitions of the willing, but rather in the Charter of the United Nations and in international organisation. If we want this strategy to be successful, we have to be clear in our own minds that it will be that only if we manage to make international organisations more efficient. The report also contains a new definition of the Security and Defence Union, which is the next thing we should be working towards, and which is actually wanted by the European Union’s citizens, for, according to opinion polls, 70% of them want the European Union to have powers in respect of security and defence policy and of their security; that is what the  citizens of the European Union want. What, though, is a security and defence union? It involves a number of elements, such as, for example, the European Foreign Minister envisaged by the draft Constitution. We are also proposing a deputy Foreign Minister, who would be responsible for defence matters. Why do we need one? I am – still – the chairman of this House’s security and defence sub-committee, but I do not have an opposite number on the executive side – something reflected in the fact that none of the seats on the Council bench are occupied. We need someone on the executive with whom to discuss these developing issues; hence our call for a deputy Foreign Minister, as well as something that is not in this report, but in which I know Mr Brok is taking an interest, namely a single foreign service and a commitment to mutual assistance, as proposed in the draft Constitution, but present already in the Treaty of Brussels, on which the Western European Union is founded. My personal proposal would be that we should concentrate on this project for a security and defence union if we want to restart the constitutional process, for I am convinced that it is easier to persuade people of their desire for a single security and defence policy than to explain to them once more what a constitution is. Our past experience was that we were always successful if we said first what we wanted to do, and worked out on that basis what institutions, and what institutional changes, were required, and so I do believe it makes sense to put this project at the heart of the constitutional process. The European Union does, today, have troops under its command – they are serving in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Congo. With effect from the beginning of 2007, we will have at our disposal two units going by the fine English name of 'battle groups' every six months, which will be capable of being deployed at short notice. The European Union and this House have a particular responsibility with respect to these soldiers, whom we send to the Congo, to Bosnia-Herzegovina, and elsewhere, namely, that we do not expose them to unnecessary risks, which are, for soldiers, a fact of life whenever their equipment or the leadership structure are inadequate, and so, with that in mind, we make, in this report, proposals for the removal of the deficits in the area of reconnaissance, which I found recurring in the Congo. Although the European Union is still performing inadequately in the field of telecommunication and in transport by land and sea, what is needed most of all is effective democratic control, but that necessarily involves information and consultation, both of which are often still lacking. We are not adequately informed concerning what the Council is planning; even though there is reference to consultation with us in the inter-institutional agreement, the Council is extremely hesitant about doing it. Issues of security, issues of war and peace, must not be left to generals; nor, though, must they be left to the executive alone, for what is needed here is democratic control by the popularly-elected parliaments, that is to say by the national parliaments and by this one.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution of the status issue is not only in the interests of Kosovo itself, but also in those of the European Union. It is, however, conditional on our finding ways of protecting the minorities – and by that I mean all of them – in a credible manner, for it has become apparent during our numerous visits there that people are still afraid, and events over recent years have shown that those fears are still justified. That is something we have to take into account, and that is why the European Union still needs to be involved there, firstly in building up the police force – something that is very important indeed – and, secondly, in building up the legal system and the administration, for I share Commissioner Rehn’s view that this is where resources need to be made available, but Kosovo’s economic development will be dependent most of all on peace, stability and functioning institutions, and it is to these that our efforts must be particularly devoted. This will also involve resolving the issue of which military forces are to perform the function of keeping Kosovo secure once it is independent, and I could well imagine a similar solution being arrived at to that found for Bosnia and Herzegovina, with the KFOR being replaced by European armed services. When we visited the country, I put this question to the Prime Minister, and it was evident from the answer he gave that nobody had given the matter any thought until then. Greater involvement by the European Union in this area would also be in line with our security policy – or with the security policy of which I am an advocate. What is important is that we, at this stage in the development of our security policy, should prioritise our efforts in our geographical neighbourhood, and the stabilisation of the Balkans continues to be our most important task.

) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what happened in Kinshasa on 21 and 22 August showed clearly that the European Union was right to take the decision to send troops to help secure the elections in Congo, even though there had been many, in various of its Member States, who had expressed doubt as to the wisdom of this approach and as to whether the European Union and its forces really could make an effective contribution. Just now, Mr Morillon, to whom we must be grateful for the outstanding work he did as chief observer of the elections, once more confirmed that it would not have been possible for calm to be restored as speedily as it was had it not been for the deployment of troops – specifically Spanish and Polish troops – under European command, and I see that as the best indication of the rightness of that decision. We must, however, remain vigilant, not least in the immediately ensuing days and weeks. It is also significant that our activities in Congo should involve the civil and military powers, working closely together to manage the crisis. Commissioner Michel has just brought home to us in a powerful way what the European Union did in the past to stabilise the Congo; the securing of these elections is just one among many interventions. I am confident that the Commissioner, now that these elections are over, will continue to develop the plans that are needed if this country in the heart of Africa, which is important not least in terms of the security of Europe, is to be made even more stable.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we in the Committee on Foreign Affairs have considered these questions, and there are two main points I would like to put before you. One is that it is of the utmost importance that funds should be made available for the European Union’s peacekeeping operations in the Balkans and also in many other countries around the world. There is now the prospect of an operation in the Congo. That the funding has been topped up is something to be welcomed, but we would prefer it not to be divided up. The civilian component will be funded from the European Union’s budget, and the rest provided by the Member States from their current income. This results in shadow budgets that are ever more difficult to monitor as a consequence of their no longer being subject to the full scrutiny of the national parliaments, or, indeed of the European Parliament either. This must surely be counted as a deficit. I might add that it is also of paramount importance that we have discovered deficits in these overseas operations, specifically in connection with reconnaissance and telecommunications. If we are to send troops on difficult missions, it is very important that it should first be ascertained what is going on on the ground, and for that we need satellite-based reconnaissance systems. It is irresponsible to deploy troops with five or six different types of communications apparatus, which often work together only with difficulty or are not mutually compatible at all. That is why we in the European Union need a single satellite reconnaissance system and common standards for telecommunications in this sphere. Another reason why that is particularly important is that it is the very same deficits that are to be found among the police and in disaster prevention and management centres. Let us imagine Europe being struck by a tsunami. In that event, it will, in the first place be of the utmost importance to be able to see what is happening, but also, and secondly, that those managing the disaster, the police and the armed forces, be enabled to communicate with one another without difficulty. This is another important task for the budget of the European Union. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we have heard, the United Nations have requested and called on the European Union to make a contribution to the elections in Congo by sending a military mission. What should our answer be? We need to bear in mind a number of things. First, we need to ask ourselves whether, at this point in time, the European Union has the capabilities needed to carry out such an operation. The second question is: do we not have other priorities in the immediate vicinity of the European Union, for example in the Balkans, where peace-keeping is our first and most important task? Thirdly, is there not a risk here that we will become entangled in a conflict from which we will then not be able to extricate ourselves promptly? These are questions that I, as an MEP, am repeatedly asked in this connection. On the other hand, we must, as the President-in-Office said, recognise that the European Union has an interest in the stability of this country in the heart of Africa. The fact that the European Union itself is also affected should be clear to anybody who has looked towards Ceuta, Melilla or Lampedusa and the terrible scenes played out at these borders with poverty. Stability in Africa is in the interests of the European Union and of its citizens. We must be conscious of our responsibility towards the UN. We must be clear that the prevention of violence, which is the aim of this operation, is very much in line with the European Union's security strategy. We should also not forget that a large number of election observers from the European Parliament and from other parliaments, under Mr Morillon’s leadership, are already working in Congo to secure the elections. What are our conditions for intervention by the European Union in Congo? First, there must be a clear time limit. It cannot be the task of this kind of intervention to stabilise Congo as a whole – that is a long-term task, and the responsibility of the United Nations. That is why there are 17 000 UN soldiers in Congo. We must concentrate on helping to stabilise the elections on 18 June. Secondly, there must be a clear succession regulation, showing how the United Nations on the one hand, and the Congolese army on the other, will re-assume these activities after our intervention. There must also be a geographical boundary, and it must be clear, for example, that Katanga and the eastern provinces of Congo must continue to be the responsibility of the United Nations and not of the European Union. Furthermore, it must be quite clear that this operation is definitely European. It must not be just one or two European nations getting involved, but more European nations must really be committed to the task. We need a formal invitation from the interim government. Here, too, there still seems to be some doubt as to what the government of Congo has actually formally said. Above all, however, we need a convincing plan, a plan that is able to convince any troublemakers that it is better to accept the results of the election, and also to encourage the citizens of Congo to exercise their right to vote. Those are the conditions under which the European Union and we in the European Parliament could agree to such a mission. Now we need, and as soon as possible, to get answers to the questions that are still outstanding.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by opening up the borders between the European Communities’ Member States and by establishing the four freedoms of the European Union, we, in Europe, have brought into being one of the freest societies in the world, but freedom without security is nothing, and that is why especial significance attaches to the security of the external borders that are thus created to the East, to the Balkans, and across the Mediterranean, the latter with its own uniquely serious problems. These borders must be as secure as possible, and that will require the use of the most modern technologies. At the same time, they must also be as flexible as possible, in order not to impose needless restrictions on businesses in the border regions and on the people who live there. For that to happen, two things are required. One is integrated administration of the border, an administration shared by the customs authorities and the border police, something that cannot, unfortunately, always be guaranteed, but this integrated administration must also be shared with the neighbouring countries. The fact is that a border is truly secure and flexible only when those on both sides of it work as closely as possible together, and it is certainly one of the tasks of our new neighbourhood policy to get this aspect of bilateral security addressed by both sides jointly. The other thing we need to do is to create a ‘frontier worker’s card’ – ‘local border traffic permit’ is a splendid term, but a very long and bureaucratic-sounding one – for those people who live on the border and have to cross it frequently. Only if we do both these things will we prevent the people living in the new border regions sustaining any unnecessary disadvantages. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if you ask me, today’s debate is a missed opportunity. Firstly, regarding the time of day, this debate was actually scheduled to take place at 11 a.m. today in the presence of the Council. It is now taking place at nearly midnight, after an undoubtedly fascinating debate on trapping standards for certain animal species. Secondly, the heading is incorrect. It is not arms that are at issue here, but the European Security and Defence Policy. If, for example, we were to discuss our course of action regarding Iran, this would not be a matter of arms, but of politics. Thirdly, I very much regret the absence of the Council, as the defining element of the European Security and Defence Policy is the close dovetailing of civilian and military crisis management. This can only be achieved through joint action between the Commission and the Council, and I know how difficult that is. How are we to discuss these issues if the Council is not even present? Another reason why this is a missed opportunity is that the field of security and defence, in particular, presents great opportunities. Even in the presence of a founding father of the European Constitution such as Mr Brok, I would venture to say that the Constitution is currently at a standstill. We are currently at a standstill on the financial issues, too. What is not at a standstill, however, is the further development of the European Security and Defence Policy, as just recently the European Defence Agency was brought to fruition. This had only been envisaged in the draft Constitution, of course, and is already a reality. We have assumed responsibility for security in Bosnia–Herzegovina; there are troops there under European command. The mutual defence commitment, which had also first been envisaged in the draft Constitution, is now a reality. That means that we are making progress in this field, and I am convinced that we are on the path to a European Security and Defence Union, which is also our common objective. This is not a debate that should be conducted in camera, as we are doing this evening. I should also like to say a few words to my colleague Mr Lambsdorff. I think that Strasbourg is the right place for this debate, as it is the seat of the European Parliament.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on 1 August, in Isfahan, Iran resumed its recycling of nuclear fuel, which constituted an unambiguous breach of the Paris Agreement. The IAEA’s Board of Governors stated on 24 September that past experience had led it to have no confidence that Iran’s nuclear programme was for peaceful purposes only. What does that mean? It surely means that it is not just our relations with Iran that are at stake, but also the future of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the dangers that result from more and more regimes getting their hands on nuclear weapons. Along with the ever-increasing flow of reports of executions of juveniles under the age of 18 and of others being sentenced to death, there is also the fact that Akbar Gandji, having been arrested over five years ago, is still in jail and is in a critical condition. One cannot fail to get the impression that Iran is using the European Union as a means of buying time for its programme. It would also appear that Iran is working on the assumption that the European Union will, in future, still not have the capacity for joint action – something that was lamentably apparent to us from our experience with Iraq. I am convinced that this is not the time for sympathetic resolutions and friendly visits; instead, we must present a united front in order to make it plain to Iran that it is harming itself by persisting on this perilous course.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I propose to start by raising a number of issues relating to the Schengen Agreement, for I have a very clear recollection of the circumstances surrounding its adoption, which was heralded by a number of things happening at borders, where customs checks were abolished and VAT was no longer to be levied; veterinary controls at borders were abolished, the collection of statistics at borders was consigned to the past, and checks on branded products came to an end. At the same time, export subsidies and import levies were done away with too, the effect being that the borders really were open. Last to go, and at the hands of the Schengen Agreement, were controls on persons. The very opposite is the case in Switzerland, where all the things I have listed remain in place, and only controls on persons are to cease. I therefore want to raise the question of whether our Swiss neighbours have not managed to extract the only raisin from what I, in this House, have called this very dry bread, and, in these negotiations, they appear to have done just that. At any rate, that is the impression that the people in my electoral district on the Upper Rhine get; they are constantly pointing out the ways in which the things that the Swiss regard as important have actually been dealt with. There are, though, very serious problems – the noise made by planes at Zürich airport is one of them – that have been left untouched, even though they are bilateral in nature, affecting both Switzerland and Germany alike. The second issue is no less important and has to do with farmers on this border. The very great difficulties that the German farmers face have to do with the fact that the Swiss pay much higher subsidies, so that the Swiss farmers are able to pay higher rents, and now they are going to get aid from the European Union too. It is enough to defy anyone’s powers of comprehension. If adequate account cannot be taken of these interests, then something has gone wrong with the negotiations at some point. Our opinions differ as regards the legal basis. It is our belief – and our own Legal Affairs Committee confirms it – that these mixed committees really are institutional in character. That being so, I do not think this House is in a position to deliver a definitive opinion, and so we will have to go on discussing this. I do not therefore think that it will be possible for the European Union to ratify this agreement at present.

 Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr Blair, the European Union’s Heads of State or Government have prescribed a period of reflection, and you are participating in it by deferring the United Kingdom’s referendum. It is because I know from my own experience that the enlargement issue played a particular part in the debate around the referenda in France and the Netherlands that I believe that the present period of reflection must include consideration of it. What we have here is a new situation. After adopting the Treaty of Nice, we discovered that it would not function adequately if we had 25 or 28 Member States, and so we summoned a convention and compiled a draft Constitution, which you, Mr Blair, support. We know too, though, that there is no very great likelihood of this draft Constitution seeing the light of day in its present form. That is what makes this situation new. There is also a fourth criterion for accession, one that is of very considerable significance, and it is the one adopted in Copenhagen, which states that consideration must also be given to the Union’s own capacity to cope with further accessions. In the absence not only of a constitution but also of any financial settlement, we have to ask ourselves the very serious question as to whether it really is well-advised to start accession negotiations with Turkey on 4 October. We have to ask ourselves – that is, the European Union itself – whether we really are in a fit state to handle another enlargement. Along with many of my friends, I take the view that this question has to be answered, and firmly, in the negative.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the figure of four million victims just quoted by the President-in-Office of the Council shows how important this topic is. We are all agreed that small arms have to be prevented from getting into the wrong hands. Here in Europe, in the European Union, the state has a monopoly on the use of armed force, and that is of enormous benefit. Circumstances here are different from those in the United States, where this is not understood in the same way. What that means is that the use of small arms is reserved to soldiers and police officers, with special arrangements being made for those engaged in hunting and in shooting as a sport. It is vitally important that every single weapon here in this European Union of ours is actually registered, or in other words that its origin is known. A problem arises when these weapons find their way into countries outside the European Union, and this is what makes it so important that the code of conduct on the export of arms, as it stands at present, should be further tightened up and that we prevent, in so far as possible, at least the supply of weapons to the trouble spots where, in fact, this extraordinary number of people are killed. To do so will involve developing a tracking system, in which every single purchase or sale of such weapons is recorded by being entered in an international register, thus making it possible to trace a specific weapon back to its origin and to its manufacturer, and to determine who was responsible for it being sold and who for it being passed on. For this, international agreements are needed, and that is what makes it especially important that we, in this House, should play our part in actually taking these projects – set in motion by the United Nations – further and bringing them to a successful conclusion.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Mr Kuhne most warmly for his wide-ranging report. I believe it to be of the utmost importance that Parliament’s line on this Security Strategy is supported by four major political families in this House – the Greens, the Social Democrats, the Liberals and the group to which I belong, thereby putting us on a footing unheard of 10 years ago. The report discusses the Security Strategy devised by Javier Solana, and this House shares his view of the threats. The three major ones are, without a doubt, terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, and conflicts among our neighbours with direct effects on the European Union as a result of floods of refugees having a direct impact on the public in it. What is absent from his analysis, in my view and that of many others, is homeland security, which is normally at the heart of all defence policy. If we consider the attention given to homeland security in the United States in comparison to how little we hear about it here in the European Union, then I think there is a deficit here that must be made good. There is also, I believe, a need to add to the conclusions drawn as to what must be done. As the conclusion put forward in this report cannot be turned into practical actions, I believe it important that the next thing we need is a White Paper on European security and defence policy containing perfectly clear specifications of substance and timescale – rather clearer than what we have been given to date. It is important that the crisis intervention force, which was very much virtual in nature when it was decided on in 1999, has today become active in reality: in Macedonia, in the Congo and now in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I was there on a visit with the defence sub-committee when, for the first time, a British general, bearing on his sleeve the European emblem with its stars, introduced himself to me as a European soldier, I realised that something had happened here that would reverberate throughout history; you, Mr Schmit, may mention ‘European troops’ or the ‘forces of the European Union’, only in passing, but there is no doubt that this is a development with historic significance. It is in Macedonia that the general approach of relying on more than merely military action to deal with a crisis is proving itself; the European Union’s strength lies in the civilian aspect of peacekeeping, where we are doing more than the United States. It is a good concept. On the other hand – as we have seen in the sudden emergence of unrest in Kosovo – it is vitally important that we should not lose sight of the fact that our troops must remain capable of intervening and also of taking robust action if it is necessary to protect minorities. These are two of the tasks that our troops have to cope with there, and they are equally important and difficult. Among the things we learned from our visit to Bosnia-Herzegovina was that the combat troops that are currently being mustered, some of whom – we hope – will be capable, as soon as possible, of short-term intervention and deployment, need the best equipment. What they are being called upon to undertake there are peacekeeping missions, but, should they need to carry out peacemaking missions or combat operations, the very diverse equipment that our troops there have will prove very much a disadvantage. We demand that what are being termed the European battle groups, which are currently being assembled, should be equipped as uniformly as possible, that they should be the first to get the latest equipment and should get it without delay, and that this be made a matter of priority. As we were also told when we were there, there is also a need for helicopters if large areas are to be secured, and also for additional mine-proof vehicles. We were told that it would take until 2010 for Bosnia-Herzegovina to become free of mines, so mine clearance is proceeding too slowly, and this needs to be made an additional financial priority for our work.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the common foreign and security policy that the European Union is engaged in developing necessarily involves joint regulation of weapons exports, and so I would like to draw your attention to the fact that Venezuela is currently engaged in a process of rearmament and that this, in view of the conflicts on its borders, is particularly likely to prompt a crisis situation. If I may give an example, Venezuela has bought 100 000 Kalashnikov rifles from Russia, and, as its army consists of only 35 000 troops, one cannot but wonder for whom they are intended. Venezuela has also signed a contract with a Member State of the European Union for the purchase of four corvettes, four patrol vessels, ten transport aircraft and two sea reconnaissance aircraft. I would ask you, Mr President, to ascertain whether these actions are in breach of the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Nuclear Arms Non-Proliferation Treaty is of fundamental importance in terms of the European Union’s security and defence policy. There will, in May, be a conference to examine compliance with the Treaty, and we think it necessary and proper that an official delegation from this House should participate in it. It will, at this conference, be of the utmost importance that the Member States of the European Union should actually put together a common position on this matter and be united in putting it forward. The conference will also, though, be an opportunity for us to consider where we stand on compliance with the Nuclear Arms Non-Proliferation Treaty, and this is where a number of developments give cause for concern. For a start, there is North Korea, which, as we have heard, has both opted out of the Nuclear Arms Non-Proliferation Treaty and announced that it has nuclear weapons at its disposal. Although we, in the European Union, possess no powers or means whereby we might in any way enforce the reversal of this decision, we do expect North Korea to resume dialogue with its partners, China in particular, which may, in the medium or long term, make a peaceful resolution of this conflict possible. At the same time, we are deeply concerned about what is happening in Iran, where, although the temporary suspension of its enrichment programme that has occurred is a positive development, we do expect it to become permanent in character. The three-way talks between foreign ministers – a means of diplomatic conflict resolution in which we expect our partners, including the United States, to play an active part – are intended to help us reach a common solution to the Iran problem, one that will do justice to its interests and to those of the European Community.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to say how happy I am that we still have the chance to see Commissioner Patten in the plenary. I feel the same way as he does about Frank Sinatra: I keep on hearing his voice, and Commissioner Patten’s as well. Passing on to arms exports, while I think we really can be justified in saying that the Code of Conduct has resulted in progress where arms exports are concerned, I must also say that this progress has not been enough. We are very pleased to learn that the Presidency of the Council is conducting negotiations with a view to clarifying a number of points in the Code, and I hope that these negotiations will have a successful outcome. I also see it as very important that these rules should cover not only sales, but also their mediation and brokerage. It is not, however, the legal basis that is the actual problem where arms exports are concerned; the real problem lies in the different ways in which these legal bases are applied in the various countries within the European Union. It is on this problem that we must focus our efforts — for a start, by declaring the Code to be legally binding. If this cannot be done at Community level, there is nothing to prevent the Member States from doing it, and, indeed, a number of them already have done so. This is the road down which we must go; whilst, on the one hand, we must aim to eventually stop treating intra-Community transfers of defence equipment as exports, this can be done only when every country in the European Community applies the rules relating to this uniformly and with rigour. Let me now turn to the question of the embargo on China. My group takes the view that this strategic partnership with China is what will take us into the future, and that we must seek to bring it about. We are aware, though, that there are a few problems left outstanding, such as China’s approach to human rights, problems that have to do with Taiwan and Tibet, and so my group’s position is that the conditions are not yet in place that would allow us to lift this embargo on China.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the transfer of responsibility for the security of Bosnia and Herzegovina from NATO to the European Union is a very important step on the road towards a European defence identity. This operation follows on from those in Macedonia and in the Congo; it is the third of its kind and also the biggest, involving 7 000 men and women, so it is much bigger than anything of which we have prior experience. What are we in this House now to do? Our task is to exercise democratic control, although, at this stage, I would prefer to speak of parliamentary guidance. There are, however, certain questions we must ask. Is the leadership structure the right one, and is it capable of doing the job? Will it stand the strain even in times of crisis? What about the equipment and weapons of the soldiers who are being sent there – are they mutually compatible? Do they meet the requirements? It will also be very important to see how cooperation with NATO works in the aftermath of the ‘Berlin Plus’ negotiations, and particularly – in what is a speciality of the European Union and its security strategy – how well the civilian and military sides of this crisis management operation work together. We also regard the issue of how this operation is funded as most especially important. Time and again, we have cause for concern about the emergence of shadow budgets capable of being monitored neither by the 25 national parliaments nor by the European Parliament. It is for that reason that the resolution we will be adopting includes the demand that the expenses incurred in this operation should – insofar as this is possible at this stage in the Constitution’s development – be borne by the European Budget.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me say at the outset that I find it very regrettable that this House has not made use of one of the options available to us. It is a fact that the European Parliament is not just responsible for the protection of the environment, but also for security and defence matters, on the latter of which we have set up a sub-committee. I believe that any resolution adopted by us would carry much more weight if it took full account of these aspects. I would say that it is extraordinarily important that we should find a solution, and that whales and dolphins have to be protected. About this, I believe there is broad agreement in this House as a whole, but there is, on the other hand, the question of what is the best course of action. I do not know whether it is realistic to call for a moratorium, for the continued use of these devices to some extent will continue to be necessary for security and other reasons. For that reason, I believe it would be more realistic to seek first a suitable geographical limit and come to an agreement that these devices should no longer be used in places where whales and dolphins have died in particularly large numbers. For that reason, I very much commend the amendment tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party. There is yet another aspect to this, in that a preparatory programme for safety research is currently under discussion – it features in the Budget debates, Commissioner Schreyer – and it is to be introduced and funded by the European Union. As I see it, the issue of substitutes for sonars, or that of other methods for protecting whales, should be dealt with under the heading of this programme.

 Commissioner, although I do of course agree with you that military operations are excluded from funding under the EU budget, my question relates to the police operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. According to reports I have received, there have been long delays in the arrival of equipment in the country, with six to eight months passing between the requirements being determined and the equipment actually arriving. The European Union has decided that it wishes to provide itself with instruments to ensure that crises, especially those in neighbouring countries, are overcome rapidly. Yet we are surely failing to achieve our aims if equipment arrives only when the crisis is already over. I should therefore like to urge the Commission – perhaps jointly with this House – to re-examine this procedure.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the lack of financial oversight operating uniformly throughout Europe and the failure of the system at international and European level are some of the reasons for the current financial and economic crisis. We must therefore ensure that information is integrated in the system in a coordinated manner and that the individual organisations exchange information so as to prevent another crisis. The good public oversight operating in some Member States must be optimised for all 27 Member States to ensure the good transfer of information. This needs financial resources. We must resolve the crisis now and provide the resources now. This is exactly what the Community programme to support specific activities in the field of financial services, financial reporting and auditing achieves. I welcome the fact that the Commission has responded to Parliament’s call for action and is proposing to provide financial support for the Community in the financial services sector and in the financial reporting and auditing areas as well as for the activities of certain European and international institutions in order to ensure that Community policies in this area are effective. A new Community programme will be brought out to enable direct contributions to be made to finance these individual institutions from the Community budget. Cofinancing of this kind for the committees and the supervisory authorities can to a large degree help to ensure that they fulfil their mandates independently and efficiently. The programme must be flexibly designed and adequately funded to ensure that the requirements of at least the level 3 committees, including CESR, CEIOPS and CEBS, are covered. The Commission proposal was 40% below what the level 3 committees considered necessary for the next four years. There was little appetite in the Council for substantially increasing the budget even though it was clear that considerable improvement of financial market supervision was called for. At the end of the negotiations we had agreed on a figure of approximately EUR 40 million over the four years: EUR 500 000 for the level 3 committees for 2009 and a further EUR 38.7 million from 2010 to 2013, 13.5 million of which are earmarked for these committees. As regards the financial reporting and auditing committees, the original Commission proposal for reform of this organisation was too weak. This means, therefore, that we, as Parliament, have been able to make improvements and, following the trialogue negotiations, we have achieved an acceptable result as far as the individual financial reference amounts and financing periods are concerned. The latest findings of the Larosière Group and of the report indicate that there are goods reasons why the Commission should present to Parliament and the Council no later than 1 July 2010 a report and the necessary legislative proposals for further reform of the regulation and oversight of the European financial markets to adapt this programme to the changes made. Against the backdrop of the current financial crisis it would seem essential to give top priority to expanding convergence on oversight and cooperating in the area of financial services in connection with financial reporting and auditing. In the plenary session on Solvency II 14 days ago I said that it was important that Europe sent clear signals that were heeded in the rest of the world. I believe that we have sent clear signals in recent weeks, including with the report by Mr Karas on the rating agencies, that we can be taken seriously by our international partners and that we are not just passengers, as we have been over the last few decades. This is a good signal. I would like to thank my shadow rapporteurs, Mrs Bowles and Mrs Berès. As this is my last speech in this Parliament, I would also like to thank the Commission, my fellow Members and the Council for their cooperation. It has been a pleasure to work with you all. Let me give you an example of a pleasing result of this cooperation. The Czech Presidency of the Council decided 30 minutes ago to accept the outcome negotiated in the trialogue negotiations. We have a proposal that we can adopt today and I am certain that the large Groups in this Parliament will also vote in favour of these proposals. Many thanks once again for your cooperation.

Mr President, I have already given my opinion on certain things in the first round of talks. However, I would like to say once again very clearly that the world, including our partners in the United States, China and other places, is watching the European Union, the Council, the Commission and Parliament to see how we will react to the crisis. I have already said that there has been a reaction, which we notice in certain rules that are being re-drafted. Things are moving somewhat in the US in terms of the Reinsurance Directive and other things like that, such as the collaterals. Moreover, the received wisdom is that, if we, as Europeans, do not have anything concrete in our hands, then our partners will not react. Last month and this month we took decisions and got them off the ground, and we managed to find reasonable solutions together with the Council. I would once again like to take this opportunity to thank the Commission, which was sometimes a bit heavy­handed, and the Council, where we tried to find reasonable solutions in night sittings and in many trialogue sittings, because, just an hour ago, they also approved the reasonable compromise we found. I of course thank my co-combatants in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mrs Berès, Mrs Bowles and others, but also the members of staff, who had to bear a large part of the burden. I believe that it is important to perhaps point out once again that I was involved in the introduction of the European Single Market, as coordinator during the introduction of the euro and other things like that. These are milestones that have naturally informed this work and also policy making. It has been fun working with you all, and I should once again like to thank my fellow Members, the Commission and the Council – I have already said that – for their cooperation. I wish all those who will voluntarily not be returning all the best for the future. There are many tasks, including the task of conveying just how important the European Union is and what an important job the European Parliament does. It is also important for the elections to be held in Germany on 7 June and elsewhere from 4 to 7 June that people’s attention is drawn to just how important our work is. I hope that there will then be a high turnout. Once again, many thanks to you all and all the best for the future. This is my last speech, as I have already said.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteur has already pointed out both the aspects worthy of criticism and the positive aspects of the result achieved on Solvency II. I believe we can say that it represents significant progress towards rendering the European insurance industry workable in future, even in times of crisis. I also believe that, as has already been said, we have made clear where the aspects worthy of criticism lie, namely in group supervision. There is, of course, more work to be done in the combined area of group supervision and group support. In a crisis, however, when capital flows are not as would normally be expected, it is natural that there is a need to catch up in this field and also to show consideration for countries experiencing difficulties. We have also discussed another issue that is crucial, since there are 500 million consumers in the European Union, who are also all insured persons, with ‘equity risk’. Industry, the economy and the Member States also all have clear opinions on the subject. We have had to accept a compromise on this, which may also be reflected in the analysis at some stage under a review-clause system. The important thing is that we can say that the European Union has sent out a signal in this regard that Europe is on the move, that it is capable of action. I believe that the United States, China and the other countries working on these prudential issues and preparing better systems for the future in these particular circumstances have also recognised this signal. That is one of the important insights. I should also like to reiterate the following very clearly with regard to the past. Four presidencies have been involved, including the current one. The negotiations have varied widely, naturally also under the influence of pressure from the respective Member States, but we have achieved a result. That is one insight. The second is that we have worked together with the European insurance industry, and that the impact studies on the individual fields were very important in this regard. Why was that? It was because of the need to involve the insurance industry in finding a path to this solution in view of the very complicated system and subject matter. If we consider that 1 400 undertakings took part in the last impact study – both large and small, as the aim is not market clearance but to involve all actors in the interests of consumers – then this has been a great success. Together with the Solvency II negotiating team, we have refused to be intimidated by any particular sources of pressure, and instead have steered a clear course in the interests of consumers, of the insurance industry and, above all, of course, of our parliamentary duties.

 Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the Presidency, but also the Commission, for their very clear statements on this situation. I share Commissioner Verheugen’s optimism that the motor industry has recognised the signs of the times and will find future-oriented solutions for many areas. Of course, we live in the real world, however, and following a 5% fall in vehicle production over the last year, the industry is expecting a further 15% fall in 2009. That is the biggest fall in the European Union since 1993 and will mean 3.8 million fewer vehicles than in 2007. It is important to realise that for every job that is held in the motor industry itself there are another five in associated areas and industries that depend on it. That means that the financial crisis, clearly, has a particularly heavy impact on the automotive sector, as it affects both the manufacturers themselves and their customers. Both groups very much need better access to credit. The point has been made that the motor industry has access to EUR 9 billion from the European Investment Bank. However, both manufacturers and suppliers do need further credit in order to finance their businesses and so, too, do customers if they are to finance the purchase of cars. We therefore need to put our foot on the accelerator in order to shore up demand, as European passenger car registrations fell by 19% in quarter 4 of 2008, while those for commercial vehicles fell by 24%. So far in this crisis, the banks have been backed to the tune of billions of euro in order to save the entire system. By and large, however, the motor industry’s banks have been left out. As yet, these institutions have no access to State aid. Across Europe, as in the United States before it, the motor industry has had to reserve billions of euro for the residual balances on leasing accounts that are not covered. These losses – especially in the light of the 2 million stockpiled vehicles – are based on significant falls in the book value of leasing vehicles which then lead to problems in this respect, too. In other words, there is a need for very rapid action here in order to throw a lifeline to these banks, just as has already been done for the other banks within the system.

Mr President, the entire debate and report on carbon capture and storage (CCS) are a small cog in the huge machine of the climate package, but nonetheless a very important and essential cog, because CCS could be used as a transitional technology for the next 50 to 80 years. The results of the vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety were on the whole positive. Chris Davies tabled a good report here and our position was very well represented at the trialogue. However, from the outset I was against setting emission limit values as early as 2015, and that is what has now been decided. This would have resulted in the compulsory introduction of CCS, before the results of the demonstration project had even been presented. Had we done that, then we would have worked away from coal toward gas-fired power stations. The introduction of CCS technology, as we have already heard, depends on the finances. Avril Doyle has set a pugnacious tone here. I have no wish to reiterate the figures; they have already been reiterated. The question of course is when we can start, because the emissions trading scheme has to start at the times stipulated; it cannot start immediately. I think it is also important for highly-efficient plants with CCS capability to be promoted by the Member States up to 2016 with 50% of the total investment. The transfer of responsibility following the closure of storage sites has now been set at 20 years, which is also very positive. As we have just heard, with China we have a factor which is set to use coal for about the next 50 years, or so it is estimated, for at least 60% of its energy requirements. As far as further technological developments are concerned, India, South Africa, Australia, America and Russia also want to use these technologies. That gives Europe an opportunity to invest and further develop this technology for the good of CO2
 capture and storage.
 Karsten Friedrich Hoppenstedt  (PPE-DE

(DE)
 Mr President, carbon capture and storage is only one small cog in the overall climate package. But little cogs and little wheels have their significance too. That is why it is so important that we and the European Union clear the way for the construction and establishment of demonstration projects, because a whole new industry, a transitional technology for storing CO2
 can be developed without minimising major efforts elsewhere. There are three major demonstration projects in the world which have other targets, that is to say, to accelerate oil and gas production. However, we need our European demonstration plants because we are responsible for mines, for technology, but also for the regulatory framework for the time after the closure of mines, which we must then set in motion in Europe. We have problems with financing, at least that is what is said. I do not believe these should be genuine problems. We put – and the figure stands – EUR 1 800 billion into the financial umbrella for companies and banks and for injection into businesses. 1 800 billion – and we do not have 10 billion or 5 billion to try out new technologies which might be of worldwide significance. I have just come back from China. Here we talked about CCS technology, with China producing 60% of its energy from coal in future. South Africa, America, USA and Russia all need these technologies, and in Europe we fail to get these technologies off the ground. I think that we and the Council should make an effort to get funds via whichever instrument we can, be it ETS or others, so that we can blaze a global trail in precisely this technology.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would very much like to thank the rapporteur for his comments on the future of the euro and all the associated policy areas, and to say that he has garnered widespread support in the committee. I am also grateful to the other participants, in particular to Mr Juncker, who was the face of Europe at the IMF meeting in Washington and made a very good job of it. We were proud of him, and I would just like to say: do not let the negative discussions discourage you from continuing this very successful work. Ten years ago, I had the honour of speaking about the euro on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and at the time I said, and I quote, ‘the euro will be strong, in defiance of the negative comments’, such as those from Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, as he was to become, who said at the time that the euro was a sickly premature baby. We repudiated that, and successfully in my opinion. After all, the euro was brought into the world following several years of dieting by means of a strict, consistent fitness policy, and it has been a success. I do not want to go into that yet again. At the time, Gordon Brown was President-in-Office of the Council, and he stated quite clearly back then that the European Parliament had played a major role in the historic process of monetary union. Other players also spoke, including Jacques Santer, and also Wilfried Maartens, who at the time described the countries in the Euro Zone – first 11, then 15, then 16 of them – as the pioneers of a courageous Europe. I believe that we in Europe need courage for the future, so that we can carry on working so successfully and continue to stand up in the world of the other major powers – the USA, Asia and the other world powers – successfully with the euro. The currency reserves held globally in euro are the best possible evidence of the success of the euro and of the Euro Zone.

 Madam President, the Commission proposal before us on the promotion of energy-efficient vehicles is a revised version of the original proposal that we rejected two years ago. The new Commission proposal represents a considerable improvement. It has to be said, however, that this text too contains numerous points that can be criticised, such as the absence of an impact assessment, the relatively small market share of the vehicles concerned – a point that has already been made – and, not least, the compulsory inclusion, in contravention of legislation by the European Court of Justice, of environmental criteria in the applications procedure. These defects have been exacerbated by the agreement in the lead committee, which would produce rigid and bureaucratic regulations. This outcome would have been unacceptable to me. Within the framework of promoting a compromise – and this is something positive to be noted – the content has been completely changed in conjunction with the Council and the Commission – so that there is now a text to be agreed on in plenary that can be supported. Flexibility for the municipalities is at the heart of this. The Member States are free to set their own guidelines, replacing the standardised methodology of the Commission proposal. In Germany alone am I aware of numerous standards governing the procurement of environmentally friendly vehicles. These standards are already being used successfully today and, according to what is stated by our municipal associations, should remain in this form in the future. In these cases, no new obligations are to be expected, therefore. For Member States without corresponding regulations, the text presents, on the other hand, guidelines for an environmentally friendly procurement policy. If, however, Member States should opt for the model developed by the Commission, they can now count on simplified procedures. In the case of procurements of up to EUR 249 000, no formal applications procedure needs to be set in motion. The de minimis
 threshold values apply. Special vehicles too are excluded, as we have heard. The compromise text is supported by the Council and the Commission and is accepted by the municipal associations, as well as by the motor industry. Even if it had perhaps been possible to dispense with the whole legislative text, there are practically no contrary interests left. Overall, I recommend falling in with the compromise approach.

) Mr President, over the last few days, we have seen great turbulence in the US financial system, and that is putting it mildly. One of the major news items was that the company Lehman Brothers Holdings was forced to file for bankruptcy protection from creditors. I would like to make two points in this context. Firstly, the US is planning a massive support package. However, this will not end the crisis or protect us from further surprises as events continue to unfold. Secondly, yes, it is necessary to determine which regulatory mechanisms could be improved and where more transparency could be created. Unfortunately, though, more and better regulation will not rule out all the unpleasant surprises that might occur in the financial markets in future, because we are not familiar with all the existing banking mechanisms. Why do I say that? Let me give you an example. Surprises can arise, for example, in the netting agreements between banks, which are very important in minimising risk. Of course, banks can only take netting agreements into account in risk assessment if these agreements are enforceable in law. Could better rules in future rule out any uncertainty about the validity of netting agreements? I do not think so. In my view, therefore, even sound and reliable regulations will not rule out unpleasant surprises in future.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have now heard everything from the experts who produced the report – Mr Rasmussen, Mr Lehne, Mr Lauk, thank you very much. It was an excellent piece of work and met with great approval in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. In the past three years, Commissioner, we have constantly been asking for rules to be established, for questions to be raised, such as: how can we obtain greater transparency for hedge funds, who is advising the rating agencies, and so on. They now come from Ireland and are therefore racing experts. When the fences are high, the horses may well shy. Put simply, shying away from an obstacle that is no longer there! We must now – and this you have indeed promised – lay down rules and make proposals. We have to show that we have learned something from all these crises and are striking new paths. You put forward this proposal . I hope that in October we shall be receiving the guidelines from you. A few days ago I was at a large conference near Rome. The first item discussed there, of course, was that of the banks. On the Thursday the newspaper headlines read: Morgan Stanley offers hope. On Friday, they read: Morgan Stanley seeks protection. How can this happen in a single day? There are deficiencies here in transparency and the like. If, after Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and Merril Lynch, this investment bank is also now sinking in the chaos of the financial markets, corrective action should be taken as a matter of urgency. A short time ago I was in China. The Chinese were saying: our role model, the United States, has collapsed. Together we – Europe, China and others – must seek out new paths. My hope is that together we shall have the strength to strike these new paths, then not only those who have won, but also those who have lost will be rescued with us.

Madam President, as draftsman of the opinion on the first part – better lawmaking – in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I refer the House to my written opinion, but there are three points to which I attach particular importance. The first is the promotion and development of fibre-optic networks, known as next-generation networks. In order to promote these networks, consideration must be given to risk-sharing for the funding of new facilities and to sharing of ducts. Besides the telecommunications companies, other public enterprises must also be involved in duct-sharing. My second point – and this has already been touched upon – is that the Commission’s centralisation drive, pursued by means of the authority, the right of veto and comitology procedure, must be firmly resisted. Thirdly, the precise distribution of frequencies should not be laid down until numerous preliminary questions have been answered. Does responsibility lie with the EU? For which aspects is it competent? What is the real extent of the digital dividend? And what is the impact of specific distribution models? Secondary services such as wireless microphone systems must not be endangered, for such systems are responsible for major transmissions of events such as the Olympic Games. For that reason the results of the current studies by specialised bodies must be taken into account in the political decision-making process on the distribution of the frequency spectrum. I hope that we shall then jointly achieve European added value for all stakeholders.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, during the public minutes of silence ordered by the Chinese authorities, people stood still – people in the streets, on buses and in shops – and their facial expressions left no doubt of the sincerity of their feelings. It was quite different from the normal compulsory collective demonstrations of solidarity. Why was that? Because state television was able to report round the clock, evoking a profound sense of shock at the unimaginable suffering of the people in the stricken areas. That inspired a new sense of solidarity in China. Respect for the individual has become apparent again, even among political leaders. The only great national focal points had hitherto been China’s economic growth and, more recently, the Olympic Games, but in the light of the present disaster, these things almost fail to register any more with many people. What should the international community do? This question has already been answered to some extent: besides sending aid materials, disaster plans and, of course, technical equipment, there is a need to pool the experience gathered in the aftermath of the major earthquakes in Armenia, where more than 100 000 lives were lost and a nuclear power plant was damaged, in Turkey, where tens of thousands lost their lives, and in China in 1976, where several hundred thousand people died, and to use that collective experience to develop principles of good practice for the international community and apply them for the benefit of China. I know it has been mentioned that what could happen to dams in particular should make us examine the earthquake resistance of public buildings, hospitals and schools. There is much that can be done in this respect, and appropriate indications can be given as to which rules should apply to the building of earthquake-proof structures. As a member of the Delegation for Relations with China, I naturally subscribe to the messages of condolence conveyed by the previous speakers.

Mr President, money simply is a part of the development of Europe. Let me, therefore, come back to the financial situation, to the financial markets and the examples of turbulence we have known so far. We all know about the situation of many banks in Europe – not to mention US banks – and how much the European Central Bank had to inject in order to keep the financial markets functioning. That is why any adjustment of the basic approach until 2010 naturally also involves the necessary increased cooperation with all global market players in order to give our European financial economy more protection against further attacks from the outside, together with better rules on rating and adjusted supervision and great transparency, and restoring the banks’ trust among themselves and the trust of the investors. There is a reason why we need more intensive dialogue with other global market players, especially the USA. Over the last seven years, the US economy has grown in value by 4.2 billion, while total credits, however, have grown by 21.3 billion. That means a debt level that is 350% too high in relation to GDP. Unfortunately, the US intends to continue with the monetary policy that has led to that huge over-indebtedness. The US is aggressively lowering its base rates, which means money is being pumped into the financial institutions. That results in growing currency devaluation, together with a fall in household purchasing power and a stagnation that is difficult to control and may have a considerable impact on Europe. These monetary policy methods are largely to blame for the latest crisis. Europe and all global market players must fight the next wave of crises promptly and together, to ensure we are not overtaken by an absolute tsunami and that many of the endeavours to achieve the Lisbon objectives are not in vain.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Soil Protection Directive and the Soil Framework Directive, together with the Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection, rank among the key topics in this part-session, as of course they have done in recent weeks and months in the committees. Normally a strategy – in this case about soil – is dealt with before the relevant directive, for good reason. The advantage of proceeding in stages is usually that interests are discussed openly early on, so that the newly gained points of view can be taken into account as the directive is formulated. With regard to the strong criticism that has been directed at the Commission proposal on the Soil Protection Directive, prior discussion about the topic would undoubtedly have been helpful, including to calm tempers all round. In contrast to the normal nature of a framework directive, the Commission proposal – and I share this opinion – includes very rigid, detailed regulations, and commits the Member States to numerous examinations and reports that would result in a considerable administrative load. This is unacceptable. The new Member States already have national soil protection legislation that functions well. For them, the Commission proposal would in some cases require their systems to be completely restructured: a high level of regulatory duplication and additional bureaucratic burden. Therefore, numerous Member States are sceptical about this Directive, as has already been stated. Nevertheless, in the last few months I have been heavily involved in transforming the Commission proposal, rewriting it. Essentially, it was a matter of allowing the Member States more scope within which to operate, while still pursuing the goal of curbing the growing deterioration of the soil at European level. I hope that, in the end, together with our friend Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines, we arrived at a sensible result, including with regard to the significance of the overall topic of soil protection, a result that can be a model worldwide as well as in Europe. May I therefore express my warm thanks to the rapporteur once again for offering a solution that enabled a compromise to be found.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the full extent of the instability sensed on the global financial markets is not yet clear. The weak points of global finance are the poor creditworthiness of borrowers on the US mortgage market and the errors made in assessing credit risks of assets and/or in auditing these. We could ask what happened to Basel II in this phase in the United States; I realise that it has not been brought in yet, but it would have been helpful. In the United States, a mortgage volume of USD 120 billion has been adjusted up to now. This fact alone has triggered rate-adjustment shock of the proportions known. Approximately 700 billion more mortgages are to be adjusted in the next two years. Heightened investor sensitivity has exacerbated the dilemma, with confidence and the appetite for high-risk investments down. Even boards of directors of banks are now admitting that they did not know what they were doing. Lack of investor confidence and realistic assessments are currently preventing a return to normal levels – a process that will undoubtedly take some time and will not even spare the professionals of banking supervisory bodies. Confidence cannot be expressed statistically by mathematical formulae. However, transparency builds and maintains confidence and facilitates risk control. Commissioner, you mentioned Solvency II. The risks from hedge funds and sub-prime mortgages have tended to be low thus far in the insurance sector; and that is the way it should stay. That is why Solvency II is intended to provide the right starting points and incentives. Under the present proposals, alternative investments such as hedge funds and asset-backed securities, which are often also exposed to sub-prime risk, will be subject to own-capital backing of 45% as a standard consequence of Solvency II. This may seem high at first glance, but it provides a clear incentive for enterprises to push an envisaged hedge fund to disclose its investment to the investor. In my opinion, one principle applies here, and that is that only those who have the necessary know-how themselves should be making higher-risk capital investments. The European Parliament has long been calling for transparency in specific financial products and mechanisms. A response by the Commission to the creation of further transparency rules for the 9 000 and more existing hedge funds is overdue. Transparency rules for credit rating agencies are also needed. A more realistic assessment of global credit risk would benefit both. Over the past few years, European budgets and the economy have been incurring multiple debts. The sin of taking out loans at enticingly low rates of interest automatically produces imbalances between monetary and real-economy performance.

 Mr President, the agreement we have now achieved – at first reading – represents an important step towards the single euro payment area, being the only way in which the first measures can start in good time at the beginning of 2008, and for this I am of course grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Gauzès, and to the German Presidency of the Council, not forgetting the Commission too. This is an important political signal; it is the starter’s gun for which the European banks have been waiting, and they too deserve thanks for their constructive and effective cooperation. For the consumers, the regulations represent a step towards a truly united internal market for financial services, as previous speakers have rightly appreciated. However appropriate it is to sound a celebratory note, we should not forget that a compromise always falls short of the ideal solution in certain respects; the pre-eminent example is the way in which the banks will incur considerable costs by reason not only of the single working day execution time allowed them, but also of other structural measures. There are indications that some EUR 23 billion have already been invested in the structural orientation of SEPA as a whole. An execution time of two banking days without any exceptions would, for the European financial sector, be simpler and more transparent, would have been more beneficial to competition, and would, in any case, have saved on costs, but the decision we will be taking tomorrow is one we will be living with. While consumers will have cause to welcome the greater choice of banks from different Member States, a critical note has to be sounded where their protection is concerned, in that not all suppliers are subject to the same supervisory regulations; the principle of ‘equal conditions for all market actors’ does not apply in every case. Our political actions should always be guided by the needs of consumers and by the need for a functioning and competitive financial market; so national procedures and financial products that work well, are affordable and accepted should not on any account be sacrificed on the altar of European money transfer transactions, the number of which, expressed as a proportion, is constantly diminishing.

 Madam President, it is good that Mrs Berès’ question on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is being discussed and answered here today. This follows on seamlessly from the Muscat report, and also from yesterday’s debate in committee – in which the Commissioner also participated. The crisis simulation with a view to reviewing financial stability in the EU that was presented at the Ecofin meeting in Helsinki last September has indeed revealed shortcomings. This scenario – that is, constantly evolving financial instruments such as hedge funds and derivative financial instruments – illustrates the need for further debate that takes sufficient account of consumer security. Thus, we need a system of functional, interlinked supervisory rules and practices in the EU. Consumer protection, an effective financial industry and stable financial markets constitute the supreme objective of financial supervision, which must also help the industry fully utilise its potential and creativity. Therefore, good supervision must be guided by the existing risks and must take a principle-based approach instead of devoting itself to detailed individual analysis. It must not impose any additional burdens on enterprises, the rules must be developed in close contact with the financial industry, and cross-border financial markets must be dealt with at pan-European and global level in equal measure. Supervision should be limited to what is really necessary and useful. Existing measures should be used in a more cautious, more market-friendly way, avoiding imposing unnecessary burdens. At the present time, I strongly oppose a centralised European supervisory authority additional and parallel to the national supervisory authorities, as this would cancel out the EU principle of subsidiarity and lack any democratic legitimacy. Not only would a body such as this meet with a lack of understanding on the part of many, particularly as it would create additional non-transparent bureaucracy, but it would also be accompanied by a serious loss of sovereignty for the Member States, as it would disregard national budgets in the case of crises. Let us first wait and see how the supervisory bodies of the newly formed 27 come together and do their work. We do not need a uniform, centralised supervisory structure, but we do need a common supervisory culture characterised by the same values and objectives.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the oil price increase, notably in 2006, has of course resulted in price increases, which have not helped Europe’s economic upturn. This is undisputable. It would be going too far to speak of a recession, however, as the rapporteur would have liked. This report is one year old, and I am very much obliged to Mr dos Santos for incorporating our contributions into the report now present. This means that we have eliminated all our differences on this and acted according to the state of affairs. When it comes to this subject, what we need is not heated debates, but rather a sober analysis. The oil price increase has naturally led to certain increases in production costs. Yet it is wrong to assume a direct link between energy prices and competitiveness on this account. After all – as the Commissioner has just said – the increase in the price of fossil fuels has been universal, and thus the competitive starting position of our competitors has been equally affected. Oil prices are calculated in US dollars. In this connection, I warmly welcome the fact that the European Central Bank is proceeding with caution in monetary matters whilst remaining vigilant. Yet it must be borne in mind that rising oil prices promise oil-producing companies an increase in profit. This, in turn, leads to the development of more areas, to increased supply and ultimately to a fall in prices – which is what we have seen in the last six months. If the situation in Iraq were more peaceful, the uncertainties in Iran removed and the Caspian Sea oil flowing, the outlook for the medium term would be better. How can we improve the organisation of our energy supply in future? This will be discussed shortly – with our participation – and an objective analysis will help in this discussion. As we know, Europe relies heavily on fossil fuels – of which there are few sources in Europe – and so it is desirable to develop renewable energies. Developing these at all costs, however, will have the same negative impact as rising oil prices, as the cost of these new technologies will be passed on to the final consumer. This will mean less money in the Member States’ coffers for other fields. We need more investment in research and development to make renewable energy supplies more competitive and ready for the market. In terms of the energy issue, this is the only course of action that will help the European economy. If I may make an additional comment on the medium-term outlook: the situation regarding China will become clear in the medium term. Looking at the progression of its economy, particularly the automobile industry, China will need as much energy for its cars by 2030 as is being produced today. This means that we need new technical possibilities.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me say, as spokesman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, how pleased I am that our position, which was accepted with only two persons voting against it, is largely reflected in the report voted on by the Committee on Culture and Education, so many thanks to Mrs Hieronymi for that achievement. In the last few weeks in particular, we worked successfully on keeping the country-of-origin principle at full strength, and I am of course grateful to all those who had a hand in this, for it is this principle that underpins the directive, and it is in the interests of a functioning internal market that we should not go soft on it. I take the view that the opening up and liberalisation in respect of advertising is essential if our dual-system media landscape is to be preserved together with the free reception of advertising-funded television. If this liberalisation is to be accomplished, then what is needed is the suspension of the requirement that commercials be grouped together in blocks, along with the abolition of the rule that requires thirty minutes between advertising spots in television and cinema films, in children’s’ and news programmes, and also for product placement to be allowed. Product placement is a controversial issue, and I think that its being permitted subject to tight constraints is the only way to go forward; banning it would be unrealistic. A scientific study has confirmed that product placement, even though banned in many Member States, still goes on, and, moreover, any ban would push European investors towards the American market. I believe that the positive list can be a way of offering a balanced solution that takes account of the way things are at present. Another core aspect of the directive, alongside the liberalisation of the rules on advertising, is the rearrangement of its scope; as we know, televised material can now be received over the Internet and mobile telephones as well, and to deal with this, we have opted for a technical approach that guarantees that the developments and platforms of the future will be taken into account as well. Provided that the plenary takes these essential items on board when it votes, we will be able to face with confidence the challenges of the age of digital media while at the same time maintaining European televisual culture, which is so great a good.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Groote, who comes from the car-making country of Lower Saxony, a German province where many cars are manufactured, which is why he has taken the trouble to consider the industry’s point of view as well. We have heard – and I will not go into detail – that there is a pressing need to act. This we have done. By further developing the Euro standards, we have doubtless taken a decisive step in the context of European environmental policy, a step which is also tolerable to the automobile industry. As has already been mentioned several times, the effects of the Euro standards are extraordinarily positive, so that non-European countries are already orienting themselves to our standards. I would like to take the example of China as an illustration of this, since I was able to follow that country’s development in my role as a member of the China delegation. Only six weeks ago I gave a lecture at the China Automotive Industry Forum in Shanghai, in which I spoke about European environmental policy activities, which involve dialogue with the automobile industry. There I learned that, in 2007, China will introduce emissions values which correspond to the Euro 3 standard, thereby reducing emissions of pollutants by 30%. As soon as 2010 they will reach the next stage, which corresponds to the Euro 4 standard. One reason for them to use our European environmental standards is certainly the expanding Chinese automobile industry, which wants to compete with our market and which must therefore comply with European standards. This could be described as a welcome side-effect of the entry hurdles to our market. I very much welcome this extension of the influence of the Euro standards beyond Europe itself, since, from a global point of view, if Europe were to go it alone with these standards, this would have relatively little effect and it would also reduce our competitiveness. All of those who are involved have accepted this compromise, and thanks to this being achieved, we can vote tomorrow on a balanced proposal on the Euro 5 and Euro 6 standards. Now, however, it is up to the highly profitable fuel industry to take part more intensively in this process and to improve the environmental compatibility of motor fuels, so that the burden of costly improvements is not borne by the automobile industry alone.

 Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I will start by thanking the rapporteur for his good cooperation in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which, I hope, will continue into tomorrow. I also have cause to be grateful for the way in which the significance of this report as one that determines the future of municipal services – or, to put it another way, of services of general interest – has been highlighted. That is also made clear by the amount of time allotted to the debate. Those of us who have spent many years in local and regional politics will be aware that, as far as the public are concerned, politics begins at their own front door, and so subsidiarity requires that the right of communities to manage their own affairs, and hence the powers of local authorities, should not, despite the complexity of European structures, be tampered with. It follows from that that municipalities must play a major part in defining and organising services of general interest, and that, in essence, must involve, seeking by every avenue available to offer these services to the public at as reasonable a price as possible, and must, of course, also mean that public and private service providers must be brought in as partners together. We should continue to urge all the interested parties to take the line that limited market activity within the remits of local authorities should not be required to be subject to all the European rules and regulations in order that local authorities should not be deterred from entering into public/private partnerships that are, in fact, beneficial to the public. What is needed is the sort of legal certainty that encourages municipal authorities to be creative in performing their services, that does not overburden them with bureaucracy and makes long-term forward planning possible. Creativity and the guaranteed right, founded upon legal certainty, for municipalities to govern themselves, can be crucial in facilitating locally-based contributions to Europe’s economic growth.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what would happen if we were unable to speak today about the issue of China? As was mentioned previously, the forthcoming summit between the EU and China takes places on 9 September, with the Prime Minister, with Foreign Ministers, and with Ministers for Reform, Planning and Trade. On 12 September, also in Helsinki, there will be a high-level Chinese-European economic forum. From the perspective of the world economy there are other important dates approaching, namely a new distribution of votes within the International Monetary Fund in favour of China and possibly to the disadvantage of Europe, and, at the end of September, new groupings and alliances will need to be formed in the Doha round in Australia. As the draftsman of the opinion on this issue in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I will concentrate on economic and monetary policy perspectives. In 2005 the Chinese trade surplus was USD 102 billion; in 2006 it will be even greater, and by the end of 2006 China will have more than 1 000 billion USD in its currency reserves. Demands are being made from many quarters for a rapid change in the exchange rate, and in the medium term China prepared to listen to these demands. In view of the close interconnection of the financial markets, however, in my opinion I have argued in favour of a cautious change, because radical and swift measures could lead to incalculable consequences for the financial markets. The International Monetary Fund must monitor such developments and take timely action where necessary. At the IMF’s forthcoming annual meeting, China is due to receive more weight in the Fund, and in this development it is getting strong support from the United States. One might ask the question why the USA, with its enormous budget deficit, is so keen to support China. Perhaps this is because China, as was noted previously, with its exchange rate policy and its high currency reserves, now has a say in matters affecting the US dollar. How is this perceived in the Member States of the European Union, and what do the officials in the ECOFIN council have to say about this? The European Union is the most important trading partner for China, China is the second most important trading partner for the European Union. We therefore owe respect to the Chinese for the way in which they have partly fulfilled, and are trying to fulfil, the commitments they made when they joined the WTO, although there is still considerable room for improvement on copyright protection and especially on credit issues. The further opening of the banking and insurance markets, and the advances in the search for common standards, are visible steps forward. At the end of September it is hoped that talks in Australia will breathe new life into the Doha round. Here too the USA would be glad to see an increased Chinese influence. Which people will the European Union choose to accompany this process, in order to give the Chinese the feeling that Europe can work in partnership with China in developing common strategies?

Mr President, I need hardly say that I very much welcome the report on further consolidation measures in the financial-services industry, which was adopted by a large majority in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and I should also like to convey my sincere thanks to the rapporteur for our constructive cooperation. The consolidation of the banking sector among most of the EU Member States is not so far advanced as it is within some individual countries. In accordance with the Lisbon Strategy, the financial-services industry has to take the lead here, and it is aware of this and is willing to play its part. How is the European banking sector structured? Where do its strengths lie, and why has little consolidation taken place in Europe? I welcome the initial studies of these matters conducted by the Commission. Regardless of whether we are considering the financial-services industry, education systems, the linguistic landscape or regional differences, Europe’s strength has always lain in its diversity. In the realm of financial services, this has three main implications: firstly, a financial-services sector that is working for European business will necessarily comprise diverse operators, namely those whose size enables them to face up to international challenges and those that are mostly concerned with regional markets. Small and medium-sized enterprises are active in these selfsame regional markets, where they account for the bulk of Europe’s economic potential. This diversity must be preserved within the European Union, and I am pleased that we have addressed this point clearly in our report through the amendment tabled by Mrs Berès and others. Secondly, what does a pluralist banking structure mean in the European Union? It means nothing more than institutions in France, Spain, Hungary and so on being able to follow different business models with different commercial aims. Which model or aim succeeds is left to market forces. Perhaps this is just another of those areas where Member States can adopt diverse approaches rather than seeking the ideal way. Thirdly, European consumers differ in their cultures and lifestyles and will therefore demand different financial services too. Only a variety of products can guarantee effective and efficient financial services in Europe that are tailored to the needs of consumers and the economy. The hearing in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is also mentioned in this report. The report backs the European financial-services industry in its efforts to remove the real obstacles to cross-border consolidation. There has also been positive feedback from the European Central Bank.

 Madam President, I should like to start by giving my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Rosati, who, together with all the shadow rapporteurs and others, has been at pains to draw up a report on which a consensus can be achieved. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs supported this draft by an overwhelming majority – I would almost say unanimously. Naturally, it has also been endorsed by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. We shall naturally assess the amendments tabled critically, and so I am very grateful that the Commissioner, too, has criticised two or three aspects of these amendments. Sound public finances are the most important aspect of Economic and Monetary Union as a whole and beyond. These are the only way of effecting a lasting economic upturn in Europe. Unfortunately, this idea is not popular with all European governments, who often lack the political will to make budgetary reforms. They have to clearly observe the criteria laid down in the Stability and Growth Pact rather than repeatedly attempting to circumvent them. In 1997 – several of us were present at that time – these were termed ‘stability criteria’, as they lend stability to the financial area and economy in Europe. European governments should not now view these criteria as a scourge or obstacle to their development, therefore, but as a sustainable path to a healthy economy. Large budget deficits have an adverse effect on economic developments. Indeed, as we have just heard, there have been some changes in this regard. Increases in these deficits only perpetuate this spiral, and it is imperative that they be stopped. Naturally, we must increase expenditure on the correct channels: on innovation and on developments with a promising future; but this does not change the fact that there is still expenditure that needs to be included in macroeconomic calculations. In this connection, I welcome the independence of the European Central Bank – something that others have already made clear today – with regard to its interest-rate policy, which must continue to pursue price stability as its primary objective. The write-down in the case of special expenditure on innovation, such as in company accounting, that has been called for by some of my fellow Members, would open the way for further new debt and weaken the European economy dangerously in the long term. A long-term policy of balanced public finances is needed in the current euro countries and must also be made an indispensable requirement for all future accessions to the euro area. To do so does not require the creation of any new national bodies to monitor public finances, as stated in the amendments, however, as these would only result in an increase in bureaucracy and in a heterogeneous system in a single monetary area. The Stability and Growth Pact and the monetary policy of the European Central Bank provide a reliable, satisfactory framework, and all we need to do is to stick to it.

 Mr President, Mr Hökmark’s report and the debate in Committee got to the heart of the matter; the report, in particular, is an excellent one. The Commissioner’s contribution also gave great cause for hope. The reform of policy on State aid is enormously important to people at the local level, where the towns, boroughs and regions are the main sources of public investments. As has already been said, their municipal enterprises play an important part in guaranteeing the provision of services of general interest, and so it is important that the Commission should – as it has already agreed to do – announce how it proposes to implement the criteria set out in the ECJ’s ruling in the Altmark case. If legal disputes are to be avoided, those who will have to apply these criteria must have a clear idea of what the Commission’s policy is. The more concrete the Altmark criteria are, the more difficult they are to implement, and the individual public offices cannot be expected to get to grips with the fundamental principle and determine for themselves whether or not aid has been granted on the basis of the avoidance of overcompensation using market compensations; to do so would involve them in a quite unjustifiable amount of bureaucracy. The local offices could, though, be enabled to do that if – as has indeed already been announced – they had access to workable guidelines with which, for example, they could determine which market was relevant. I am glad that the Committee, under Mr Hökmark’s guidance, has turned its attention to the non-inclusion of public SMEs in the definition of SMEs, and I also welcome the conclusion it has come to regarding that. Public undertakings meet the public’s needs where they are, and the public regard them as their own property. By supporting communal public undertakings in their work rather than making it more difficult, the EU will go up even further in the public’s estimation, and so I would encourage the House to continue pressing for the definition of SME to include communal public undertakings.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this House had the opportunity to discuss this issue in the plenary on 25 October, and the debate on that occasion was a very matter-of-fact one, at which you, Commissioner, announced all the things that you intended to do. You have also done them, making use of the opportunities for dialogue with other organisations and mounting crisis exercises in Europe, the outcomes of which we shall probably learn about shortly. It is only natural – as has already been said – that debate should focus on the health of poultry and the need for that to be protected. I was recently in China, where, as we know, there are 20 billion head of poultry. The Chinese are absolutely terrified of the possibility that bird flu might spread, and they are also doing something about it, but the question arises of whether we Europeans, both in the past and now, have given states like China, Indonesia and Vietnam good enough advice to enable them to take action in the event of any bird flu epidemic. The Chinese have now tried to develop anti-bird flu vaccines and they are also working on something for human beings. I think it is splendid that they are now abandoning the old non-immunisation policy and pursuing one of well-ordered immunisation in specific regions or in the vicinity of hotspots. I, in my capacity as a veterinarian, have very frequently been called in, in Lower Saxony and elsewhere, to deal with outbreaks of animal diseases, and I know that the right way to go about a vaccination policy is with marker vaccines – I emphasise that they have to be marker vaccines if at all possible – and this is also, I believe, an approach that is in line with what the enthusiasts for animal welfare would have us do. For my final point, let me reiterate what I said as my final point on 25 October, which was that a pandemic is on the way in any case; the scientists do not know when. We should, of course, do everything possible to prevent panic breaking out, while also taking every possible step to prevent the virus being transmitted, mutating and infecting humans.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start with warm thanks to the Commissioner for the clarity of his statement, from which it would appear that the EU and its Member States are relatively well prepared. Your statement is a calm and matter-of-fact one, and, in that you focus on the protection of poultry generally and not just on the possibility of a pandemic, that will help us all to make progress. I myself worked for 15 years as a veterinarian, specialising in the poultry industry, with the Organisation of Animal Health, and could well have something to say about a lot of things, not least the vaccination of poultry. Not having enough time available to me, though, I do not propose to do so. On Monday, a number of Members of this House visited the Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin. It has to be said that its 160 experts, who are active around the world, are doing an excellent job of advising you and the Member States. There is, admittedly, as yet insufficient provision for worldwide cooperation, but the first steps are rightly being taken in that direction; there is a conference being held in Canada today, and the WHO has met in South-East Asia. Much more needs to be done to address this problem at the point where it starts and takes root. Secondly, Mr Bowis and others have already pointed out that a system of inoculation will not be enough to contain the pandemic that threatens us. Reference has also been made to the Spanish flu of 1918, which cost 50 million people their lives. What that means is that there is an urgent need for a change of approach where the production of vaccines is concerned, and it also goes without saying that we can work much more quickly with cell cultures such as MPS. Thirdly, what about anti-flu vaccines – who is to order them, who is to store them, who is to pay for them? As these medicines keep for five years, there certainly needs to be a plan drawn up. My fourth point is that no reference has been made in this debate to Africa. What will happen when migratory birds reach Africa? The people in Africa, like those in South-East Asia, live cheek by jowl with their birds, and they are at risk of infection. Who has responsibility for this? I am quite sure that we share it. Fifthly, I would like to thank those conservationists, ornithologists and hunters, along with all non-governmental organisations, who have assumed a heavy responsibility for monitoring migratory birds and have passed on their knowledge. The ultimate question is not whether a pandemic is on the way, but when. That is what should be the focus of our attention.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, basically everything has been said, but not by everyone and, more to the point, not by me. Firstly, I should like to offer the rapporteur, Othmar Karas, my warmest thanks. He has made the best of a bad job, and on that, I might perhaps be permitted to comment.  Today is the third time I have stood on this podium in order to speak on the Stability Pact. In 1997, Parliament had to give its opinion on the introduction of the euro and the Stability Pact associated with it at the time. We did so gladly, because we were convinced that the Stability Pact offered a basis of trust for the citizens. This time, as the rapporteur rightly said, the European Parliament has only a minor role in the whole procedure. Consultation means something different in my view. Monetary questions are questions of trust and this trust is shaken by the watering down of the Pact. The two so-called big countries – in what the rapporteur calls 'peer complicity' – set the entire watering down process in motion, as we have already heard here today. Big gestures, big overtures obviously no longer convince the citizens of Europe. The shattered remains of the Schröder and Eichel policy in Germany and the Chirac policy in France have drawn the euro into this completely negative discussion. The report formulated by the rapporteur is a desperate attempt to rescue some of the philosophy behind stability. We must stop exacerbating the crisis of confidence still further. The best solution would be if Mr Barroso, and Mr Juncker on behalf of ECOFIN, were to withdraw all changes to the Stability Pact in the light of recent developments.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a good day for the European Union, for policyholders, and for insurance undertakings as well, because today’s debate and tomorrow’s vote – which I assume will be unanimous – will dismantle the much-criticised bureaucratic obstacles and make European reinsurance more competitive on international markets. Supervision of direct insurers is regulated across Europe in a number of directives: the European Union has already enacted extensive and necessary instruments for the protection of policyholders with the loss insurance and life assurance directives and the solvency rules for insurance companies. These will now be complemented by the harmonised supervision of reinsurance. The directive on which the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs reports is therefore an important addition to supervision in this important service industry. The reinsurance directive, which is now successfully on its way after more than three years’ preparatory work, draws to a large extent on the systems of supervision that are already in place for direct insurance. As has already been pointed out, important differences between direct and reinsurance were also identified in close cooperation with the Council, the competent authorities of the Member States and reinsurance industry representatives and are taken into account in the draft directive. It includes in particular a uniform treatment of life and non-life reinsurance so far as solvency margins are concerned, an arrangement based on the prudent person approach for capital investments and a clear time limit of 36 months from the entry into force of the directive for the collaterals the supervisory authorities still require in the individual Member States. As has also already been mentioned, the harmonisation and liberalisation the directive seeks to introduce will further strengthen the competitive position of European reinsurance and Europe as a whole as a financial centre. At the same time, the administrative hurdles within the Community will be dismantled. When the directive is implemented, the tortuous national licensing systems within the EU will disappear. The home country’s supervisory authority will provide such supervision as is necessary. A reinsurer’s authorisation will then apply for the whole of the European Union. Next year or the year after will probably see an extensive rewriting of the rules for the whole insurance industry as a result either of motions to that effect or ‘Solvency 2’. An amendment that I originally moved has ensured that this reinsurance directive does not anticipate the political debate on ‘Solvency 2’. I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Skinner, for his close cooperation; we all hope that the next time such an important resource is debated there will be more time in the committees and longer to prepare.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I see that the presence of the acting President means that the MEPs’ team is one man up on the Commission’s. That is in any case quite astonishing on an evening like this. Mr Krahmer has described his report with great clarity and very comprehensively, and I do not propose to go through it in detail again. I just want to say that it is, ultimately, the amendments that have made this report, which we are sending on its way, the work of us all, for we told Mr Krahmer that our discussions with the Council and the Commission had resulted in agreement, thanks to the amendments which essentially constitute the heart of this report. I am sure that a large majority will tomorrow give its backing to this report, for the three major groups have endorsed it. This directive takes as its basis the used cars directive and has a preventive effect, enabling the automobile industry to guarantee recyclability in the future. It is a huge triumph if 95% of a car is capable of being recycled or reused, and a positive quantum leap if one thinks back to the first debates that we had back at the beginning of the 1990s. I am also very grateful to the automobile industry for helping to put this directive together, for communication with this industry – one of enormous importance for Europe – is vital if long-term competitiveness is to be guaranteed. I am also sure that those who at present export to us from South-East Asia, as well as those in China and elsewhere from whom we will be importing vehicles in future, will be obliged to abide by these rules and apply them. It will be difficult enough to implement and monitor these preventive measures there, but it will send an important message about how to continue to compete across the board with the European automobile industry.

 Mr President, Commissioner, one of the main problems encountered when applying European legislation on State aid to the provision of services of general interest is legal certainty, or rather legal uncertainty. It has not always been obvious to decision-makers in local authorities at city, municipality or district level whether compensation for special expenses connected with these services comes within the scope of State aid regulations. The dilemma these decision-makers face is whether these payments have to be declared to the Commission or approved by it. There are serious legal consequences if compensation is not declared when it should have been, yet if declarations are submitted unnecessarily in cases of doubt valuable time is lost during this procedure. Steps will now be taken to reduce this legal uncertainty, and this is something I wholeheartedly welcome and support. As has already been mentioned, the ruling by the European Court of Justice on the Altmark case is the legal basis that the Commission has used to put forward its proposal for an exemption decision. This proposal complies with the demand Parliament made in its resolution of 14 January 2004 on the Green Paper on services of general interest, and it is a sign that support exists for a control policy that focuses on cases that are key to effective competition in the internal market. Under this proposal, compensation that only has a very minor impact on the internal market will be exempt from State aid control procedures, which will mean a great deal more legal certainty for local stakeholders. Compensation for services of general economic interest that have only a minor impact on the internal market is frequently granted on a strictly limited and local basis, and is therefore a good example of an instance where exemption would be decided on. Provided that other criteria are complied with, such as providing a clear statement of responsibilities and adherence to the principle of transparency, such compensation will also benefit from the planned increase in legal certainty. The rapporteur has submitted an outstanding report, and ensured that it expressed the majority view by putting it to a vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. I hope that the House as a whole will view it in the same way.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, strengthening economic governance and clarifying the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact are important matters, not only in order to refocus attention on the Pact’s underlying ethos and to strengthen the foundation which lends stability to the monetary union, but also in order to avoid undermining the trust which the public placed in us in 1997 during the discussion on the introduction of the euro, a discussion which took place both in this House and elsewhere. The Stability and Growth Pact is a requirement for justice and sustainability. It must therefore remain in existence, and its direction and application must be preserved and strengthened in accordance with the spirit of the Treaty of Maastricht and the European Constitutional Treaty. The Stability Pact illustrates the simple economic and fundamental truth that today’s debts always end up being tomorrow’s taxes, to be borne by future generations. The Pact therefore rightly calls for an end to state indebtedness and for a budget that is balanced across the economic cycle. Under the Pact’s rules, as has already been noted, temporary deficits can and may be tolerated during economic upturns, but during the next economic upturn these new debts must then be cleared again. Against this background, the Commission communication rightly poses the question of long-term viability, and calls for better links between the essential features of economic policy and the Stability and Growth Pact. A critical view should however be taken with regard to an issue which is given much space in the communication, namely that of placing greater emphasis on the Commission’s recommendations on economic development. The Commission communication contains a total of five key proposals; due to a lack of time I can only evaluate one of them, the improved coordination and implementation of budgetary policy. The closer links between the Commission’s recommendations on the essential features of economic policy and the Stability and Growth Pact are to be welcomed, and have meant that the Commission has been able to stimulate competition among systems in the Europe of 25 and to make a major contribution to moving closer to the goals set in Lisbon. We should therefore lend our unreserved support to these renewed proposals for increased transparency and accountability in the Member States’ budgetary policies, and it must be especially in the interests of all participants in the monetary union to support the credibility of the Stability and Growth Pact by means of transparent data.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a really interesting, good debate – for the simple reason that, looking at the reports, we are combining two aspects that do not, at first, appear to be directly linked but which are related to ways of coping with the crisis and reviving the economy. I was shadow rapporteur in the Committee on Legal Affairs for the Weber report, on which I should first like to congratulate Mrs Weber most warmly. The Weber report is not about crisis management in the traditional sense but about simplifying company law and helping to cut red tape and eliminate burdens on companies. This, coming at this specific point in time, at the end of the parliamentary term, clearly proves and exemplifies the European Parliament’s handling of this particular issue and its attempts to further develop company law in the interests of companies – which I very much welcome. As this debate also presents the opportunity to say something about financial market legislation in general, it should be noted that the fact that we in Parliament are now achieving results and concluding our proceedings at first reading on the first financial market package also sends out a signal towards the end of this parliamentary term. I believe that this, too, is important. Nevertheless, I should also like to point out that the second package – which, of course, is still being prepared by the Commission at the moment – will unfortunately be too late for this parliamentary term. There are reasons for this. As you will remember, we have indeed discussed the regulation of certain areas of financial markets in the past, namely in the committees of this House and on various occasions in plenary, but this always met with massive opposition. There was opposition from the Council. The socialist UK Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, refused to acknowledge certain realities for a long time. There was also opposition from the Commission – which had been offering resistance on hedge funds and other sectors for a long time – and from within this House. When it came to launching legislative own-initiative reports, the Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs rejected this for a long time on account of an unnecessary dispute over competences. I am pleased that everyone has now seen the light. Commissioner McCreevy is regulating hedge funds, Mrs Berès is permitting own-initiative reports and Gordon Brown, too, has changed his mind. This is a positive development, one that my group and I very much welcome.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by saying that we, too, in principle welcome the European Commission’s proposal and this Green Paper. As previous speakers have said, there is no doubt that there is a ‘mass’ phenomenon in which relatively small losses affect a large number of people. The individual losses are small, but taken together the overall amount is large. We need an instrument to deal with this problem. In my opinion, it is right to consider something like this. Staying with the positives, I also very much welcome the fact that, in its Green Paper, the Directorate General for Health and Consumer Protection has also placed a definite emphasis on the issue of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. That is very different to the White Paper from the Directorate General for Competition, which was also debated in this House yesterday and which has so far completely ignored the possibility of out-of-court dispute resolution mechanisms. I think that the Directorate General for Health and Consumer Protection has come further in its Green Paper than the members of the Directorate General for Competition. However, I would like to make two things quite clear, which in my opinion should definitely be viewed as critical comments. In a few minutes at noon, Parliament will adopt my report on the White Paper from the Directorate General for Competition. With a huge majority in this House we will demand that the European Commission choose a horizontal approach in dealing with this issue. We must not end up with sectoral instruments: one for the area of consumer protection, one of the area of antitrust law, another one for the capital market, perhaps another one for the environment, perhaps another one for social affairs, all contradicting each other, all encroaching on the legal systems of the Member States and leading ultimately to legal confusion that can no longer be managed by any practitioner. We have often seen such examples in the past. I am just thinking about the debate on the Professional Qualifications Directive, which we later also combined in a single instrument because this fragmentation was no longer manageable. The Commission should not make the same mistake again in this case. It should advocate a horizontal approach right from the outset. That is the clear position of Parliament, as will become apparent in a few minutes. One last point: I very much welcome the fact that we have agreed that we do not want a claims industry based on the American model with a turnover of USD 240 billion a year from which ultimately only lawyers profit and the consumers get absolutely nothing. We want the genuine rule of law in Europe and we want to keep our traditional system and our understanding of the law.
 Klaus-Heiner Lehne,  
rapporteur. − (DE) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first may I thank the shadow rapporteurs, especially Mr Sánchez Presedo on behalf of the socialists and Mrs Bowles on behalf of the liberals, who worked very successfully with me on the compromise text being tabled today as a report on the Commission’s White Paper. We have managed this time to achieve a very large, cross-group majority and a really viable compromise, which can also be used as a guideline for future work by the European Commission and later, during the law-making process, by Parliament and the Council. We have made clear in this report – and rightly so – that, where competition rules are infringed, Parliament stands by the view that, according to the European tradition, it is primarily the task of the authorities – both the national competition authorities and the European competition authority – to take action and that this is not creating a second arm, as it were, on an equal footing with official action in the fight against cartels. We have deliberately chosen a different path in Europe from the US, with which the situation is often compared. There is political consensus in the House that we need a solution for so-called mass claims. If the illegal conduct of individuals damages a very large number of persons who suffer comparatively minor losses, then a separate solution is needed for such proceedings, for which normal procedural law is simply not effective enough. The creation of such an instrument is also part of providing access to law and further developing the internal market. On this we are agreed. There was also consensus that we do not want a litigation industry to develop in Europe as it has in America, with turnover of USD 240 billion, which is ultimately of no advantage to consumers and, as we all know from simply reading the relevant books, mainly profits American law firms. None of this has much to do with the rule of law, nor do we want it to. We agreed that the procedural torture instruments of the American system should not be adopted in Europe. This applies in particular to the taking of evidence and costs. That is a very important point. We also agreed that we were basically of the opinion that, from a point of view of principle, legislation at European level can only be an opt-in solution and that an opt-out solution would only be permissible here where the Member States already have a similar solution and national constitutional law so allows. An opt in is not allowed under every country’s national constitutional law and it also contradicts the principle of the adult consumer. As we insistently complain, the European Commission has completely forgotten to deal with the question of out-of-court settlements in its White Paper. The Directorate-General on Competition and the Commission have gone straight for litigation. However, as we have known for years from the debate in this House on legal policy, that is not always the ideal way forward and, as a rule, out-of-court settlement mechanisms are often much more suitable for resolving problems. Moreover, parallel work by the Directorate-General on Consumer Protection on the same issue has progressed much further. This Directorate-General used a broad margin for these alternative settlement instruments in its Green Paper, which is one consultation stage before this. We are convinced that the European Commission urgently needs to rework this question. One last point, which is also crucial: we do not want fragmentation of the law. Now competition law is going off and creating such an instrument. Consumer protection is coming along on the same issue. We know that at some point something similar will be considered in relation to capital market law, environmental law and social law. We consider it absolutely necessary for a horizontal approach to be considered as well and for us at least to support the procedural instruments which are more or less the same in all areas with a horizontal instrument. That is also of decisive importance.
 Klaus-Heiner Lehne,  
rapporteur. − (DE) 
Mr President, Commissioner, first may I thank my honourable friends for their very helpful contributions. I think that we all pulled together and achieved a good result. However, I also want to say quite clearly to the Commission, in order to avoid any misunderstanding: from Parliament’s point of view, there is no question of your tabling a bill that is probably already fit for nothing. Absolutely no question. We expect the Commission to take account of what we have decided today and for it to be included in the actual legislation proposed. The horizontal approach is not only an important aspect on the basis of the arguments which I expounded earlier; the Commissioner personally also addressed the question of the legal basis. With such an important project, an approach must be chosen which ultimately guarantees that Parliament is involved as a legislator on an equal footing. If an approach based purely on competition law is chosen, that would not be the case under the Treaty of Nice currently in force. This is also a very fundamental political argument in favour of why we consider a horizontal approach to be the right one. I think the Commission should consider this very seriously. Another decisive point in my opinion is that we still need something on the question of out-of-court settlements. You spoke earlier of convergence with the work of the Directorate-General on Competition. However, if one compares the Green Paper on consumer protection with the White Paper on competition, one does not necessarily get the impression that there is really any such convergence. The most blatant example is the different treatment – or to be more exact the lack of treatment – of out-of-court settlement mechanisms in the White Paper. There is still a series of other problems which we expect to be resolved. I just want to refer briefly to the question of access to the European Commission’s files. It is possible in all criminal proceedings in which compensation is being claimed to inspect the public prosecutor’s case files. Why does this not apply to the European Commission? It is beyond me. The same applies to the question of fixing penalties: this also needs to be taken into account from the point of view that it must be possible to claim compensation in future. Here too the Commission urgently needs to rework the text and table more specific texts and proposals than those included so far in the White Paper. May I say quite clearly from Parliament’s point of view, in order to avoid any misunderstanding: we expect more than what is contained in the White Paper and we also expect the Directorate-General on Competition as a whole to follow our suggestions, otherwise there will be resistance in this House.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, sometimes I do not believe what I hear. Mr Schulz, the initiative on regulation and on transparency rules for hedge funds and private equity comes from the Committee on Legal Affairs. In 2006, the members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats on the Committee on Legal Affairs began actively asking for rules to be put in place. The legislative own-initiative report which we commissioned did not come about because the chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, who we all know is a member of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, began a completely unnecessary dispute over authority. The result of this was that we spent months, if not years, in reaching an agreement and were then finally able to adopt the legislative own-initiative reports on this issue in September of last year, in the form of the Rasmussen and Lehne reports. The person who spoke out against regulation in this area in the Council was Gordon Brown. He is obviously not a member of the PPE-DE, but belongs to your group. In recent years, Mrs Merkel and Mr Rasmussen have always spoken in favour of regulation in these areas in all the debates, both in the European Council and the G8. The problem lies in the fact that the socialists in the European Union have always been a major obstacle to the inclusion of these non-regulated areas. Opinions have recently changed and that has resulted in us being in the position in which we now find ourselves. This is one of the historical facts in this area. I simply want to say that there is a big difference between the rhetoric which we are hearing now and the reality of recent months and years. Unfortunately, that is the case. Finally, I would like to mention a number of areas of common interest. Today, the atmosphere between the parliamentary groups during the preparation for the resolution on the Lisbon process in the steering group was exceptionally good. For this reason, we have come to an agreement in almost every area and produced a good resolution. We should not discuss this until we are blue in the face. Instead, we should make it clear that this is an area of common interest. The citizens of Europe expect us to act jointly in this crisis and not to oppose one another. (Applause)

 Madam President, thank you very much. I will be really brief. Firstly, of course, the socialists are not responsible for the crisis. No one in the Chamber has said that. We all know whose fault it is and this has been investigated in great detail. However, I have rightly pointed out that over many years, the socialists have been responsible for blocking the implementation of clear transparency rules relating to hedge funds and private equity and I have given examples of this. This is quite simply a fact. As far as the amendments which have been referred to are concerned, I would like to mention just one point, the subject of tax havens. We are in complete agreement on this. The question is simply at which point we vote in favour of it. Today we will be debating Amendment 25 on the resolution concerning the Lisbon Strategy, which covers precisely this subject. The group will vote in favour of this. Therefore, I have no problems with the questions that have been mentioned.
 Klaus-Heiner Lehne,  
rapporteur.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have two reports to advocate here, both of which originate from Parliament’s Committee on Legal Affairs. I should like to start with the one that is more important at this time, as it concerns a specific legislative procedure initiated by the Commission: the European private company (EPC). Indeed, this is the legislative core element, if one may describe it thus, of the Small Business Act.
 I wish to say a few words about the background. The idea for the European private company was already contained in Commissioner Bolkestein’s Action Plan on Company Law. For reasons that never made sense to me, the idea of the European private company was then erased, so to speak, from the action plan over the years, in the course of this Commission’s term of office, and was not pursued further by the Commission at that time. The European Parliament disagreed, however, and this was the background to its legislative own-initiative report under Rule 39 of the Rules of Procedure and Article 192 of the Treaty, which this House adopted by an overwhelming majority some time ago. Under these circumstances, the Commission felt compelled to reconsider the idea of the European private company, and has now proposed it within the framework of the Small Business Act – which is very much appreciated. This offer of a separate company form is particularly directed at Europe’s small and medium-sized enterprises. Up to now, only large companies have had their own company form, namely the European company. I believe that such a proposal was long overdue. As this is aimed at SMEs, and start-ups – that is, companies that arise from the idea of starting up a company rather than as a result of the transformation, division or merger of existing or other companies – must also be provided for, we also welcome the European Commission’s restraint with regard to the requirements imposed on the cross-border component. This has, I believe, also been expressed by Parliament in this report. We also think it right that all the issues concerning, in particular, capital and liability, have to be clarified in legislative terms at European level, as these are particular problems for SMEs. The present need for them to work with very disparate national legal forms means that they are in great need of advice, which is obviated by this new legal form. We also believe that we are in line with the case law of the European Court of Justice in the matter of whether the company’s seat must be identical to its registered office or seat of administration; that is, that only one company seat can be envisaged. I know that there is a minority opinion on the subject in this House, but the majority opinion in Parliament’s Committee on Legal Affairs – from which I assume plenary will take its lead tomorrow – is that there must definitely be the possibility of a separation and that a European company form cannot be disadvantaged in relation to national company forms, which have this possibility under the case law of the European Court of Justice. A major problem, which required lengthy negotiations, was the situation with regard to employee participation. We have had considerable difficulties with this in the past when dealing with other legal acts under company law. I need only mention the European company and the Directive on cross-border mergers. I believe that, thanks to the compromise amendments signed by the three largest political groups in this House, we have succeeded in finding a real solution to this problem; a solution which draws on the successful elements of previous legal acts in the European Union, which represents a compromise between the different legal situations in the Member States, and which also makes a contribution to protecting employees’ rights. My final comment concerns the 14th Directive, for which I am also rapporteur. The story is similar to that of the European company. Our aim is to use this legislative motion for a resolution to compel the Commission to make a tangible proposal, as we did in the case of the EPC, and indeed we expect the Commission to do so, so as to close one of the last gaps in company law and guarantee freedom of establishment for undertakings. My sincere thanks for your attention.
 Klaus-Heiner Lehne,  
rapporteur.
 – (DE) 
Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to make four comments. Firstly, with regard to the directive on the transfer of registered offices, I think that the Commission should abandon its argument, as it runs the risk of making itself a laughing stock among experts. The theory that transfers of company seats can be arranged such that a company is started up in a neighbouring country and then one’s own company merged with it under the Directive on mergers could scarcely be more bureaucratic. We are talking here about reducing bureaucracy and trying to make things easier for SMEs. This proposal just goes to prove how little sense it makes for the Commission to persist in refusing to present a proposal on the 14th Directive. This benefits no one but lawyers. My second point concerns participation. Mrs van den Burg is right: real SMEs are not affected in the slightest by the compromise we have presented. We are aiming only to avoid abuses and to record companies that are actually large companies and are more suited to the European company than to the European private company in terms of the number of employees. It is practically only abuses that are being recorded. My third point concerns the real-seat theory, to which only seven Member States remain committed – only seven! Last year, the largest Member State, Germany, abandoned this theory. The European Court of Justice does not advocate it, but allows it in exceptional cases, as proved by the Cartesio
 ruling. That ship has sailed; there is no point in continuing to argue about it. The fourth thing I want to say is that the argument on the part of left-wing Members – none of whom stayed for the debate earlier on – that the proposal should be rejected does not take account of the substance of the report – Mr Medina Ortega is absolutely right about this. The substance of the report actually takes care of all the criticism that has been presented. Therefore, I would suggest that the left-wing Members, too, consider rereading the report and the amendments and then discussing them once again with their group.
 Klaus-Heiner Lehne,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate is indeed taking place, if somewhat by chance, at exactly the right time. My report to all intents and purposes addresses the other side of the coin. Mr Rasmussen has had to deal in particular with the effects on the financial markets and the Committee on Legal Affairs with its expertise naturally concerned itself in particular with the aspects of company law and, where necessary, with the need to change European company law. We are all shaken by the events of recent days. The public, politicians and – I say this very clearly – the honest economy as well. The problem we see in practice at the moment is that profits are being privatised, but losses are being nationalised. It has almost become a joke in this saga that Mr Paulson, the US Finance Minister, who was himself once head of Goldman Sachs, now finds himself in the situation of having to take USD 700 billion in taxpayers’ money in order to eliminate and smooth out the havoc his own sector of industry has wreaked. It is really sad. There are more and more examples of the fact that in the public perception, the image of the conventional family enterprise taking care of its employees with its own liability, which it itself guarantees, is on the decline, while on the other hand, the impression continues to grow of us being partly governed at least in the economic sector by ineffectual top managers, by employees who are highly paid but who no longer bear any responsibility. I think that the emerging impression of our system of market economy is appalling and that it is politically necessary for us to take the appropriate steps to restore order and thus actually remove this appalling impression. The fact is that it affects not only the major investors, but now also small investors. It affects every taxpayer and all those who are dependent on government funds because more and more billions in public money have to be used to repair the damage. I admit – and the debate has clearly shown this, and it is also indisputable – that one aspect we initially had to address in particular – namely the hedge funds and private equity sector – is not a cause of the problems we are currently having to tackle. Here too, however – and the debate in the House has clearly shown this, as have the hearings on both committees – there are obviously definite shortcomings in the areas of harmonisation and regulation. It has rightly been stated that these sectors are also regulated by national regulations, some stronger, some weaker, according to the nations’ different traditions and according to which financial market regulations prevail there. At the same time, however, it has also become clear that we need further harmonisation and adjustment at European level in order to ensure that these sectors, which have now reached absolutely critical dimensions, also do not represent any risk for the financial markets. I would like to respond to just a few key words, which have already been addressed in the draft report – which incidentally had already been resolved in the Committee on Legal Affairs in June when nobody was talking about this crisis in which we currently find ourselves. I am thinking of the terms ‘stock lending’ and ‘short selling’. We now hear that a range of important financial market regulators have banned this, and for good reason. We did ask at the time, and are asking now, as well, that this at least be examined. Consequences have to be drawn from this and legislative proposals must also be made if need be. One of these is the issue of better identification of shareholders, issues of transparency, of the tightening of the regulations on transparency in view of the fact that enterprises as well as the managers of these enterprises ought to know to whom they actually belong in order that they, too, are able to act responsibly towards those who own them. It also entails reasonable checks being made on certain risks when credit is granted to ensure that sensible, necessary consequences can also be drawn in order that giant levers cannot be moved by relatively small means, which ultimately create an impact that gets completely out of control and brings adversity in its wake for the general public and for others. Incidentally, one piece of advice: in the meantime numerous proposals have been developed in the industry for practical codes, for voluntary regulation on how one should behave. The mere fact that these regulations have been developed, even if they are still only voluntary at present, thus accounts for the fact that the industry itself evidently accepts the need for some regulation. Hence it is entirely reasonable to take a look at, and think about, whether we are able to take action here as well. Asset flipping is another matter to which we must attend. Company law must tackle this issue because I am convinced that enterprises should not be able to be plundered. We are expecting a concrete proposal from the Commission. This is a report in accordance with Article 192, to which the Commission must respond. We hope it will do so soon.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, so great is the transparency of funds that the well-endowed rating agencies, the even better-endowed boards of banks and the more meagrely endowed regulatory authorities no longer knew what was going on. That is how transparent things are! The fact that we need to act here is self-evident and needs no further justification. Commissioner, you addressed the question of the position with regard to short sellers. It is not a matter of whether the short sellers themselves lose out at the end of the day. The point is what they set in motion and what damage it might have caused. It is really about the effects of their actions on others. That, indeed, is precisely why the regulators in numerous countries have reacted. As various Members have said, it is about ordinary people, about pensioners and taxpayers. I must re-emphasise that we are nationalising losses, and that cannot be right. My report, like Mr Rasmussen’s report, contains a large number of very specific proposals. In my case, they mainly relate to issues of company law. It is relatively easy to draw up and implement proposals on these issues. In essence, the only thing that need be done is to supplement the existing rules. Nor is it in any sense a matter of discriminating against some hedge funds or other. At the present time, we have a situation in Europe – and no one disputes this – in which these alternative financial instruments are regulated by national law but are regulated in very different ways in some instances. It makes perfect sense to incorporate them all into a European financial market and regulate them uniformly. To call for more specialists’ reports now, when we have already been discussing the matter, as Mr Rasmussen said, for three years, when we in this House already have specialists’ studies, when the Commission has been dealing with the matter and we have held hearings about it, is, I believe, pointless and would only waste time. There is truly a need to take real practical measures. The situation demands action. Let me make one more remark, which relates to government funds. I entirely agree with you. We need government funds, and in the long term we shall also need government funds from other countries, from countries outside the EU, because otherwise it will probably become impossible in the long run to fund infrastructure expenditure in Europe. That is a matter in which you surely have the support of the Committee on Legal Affairs too, although it is not directly connected with the subject we are discussing today. We have always backed initiatives that the Commission has taken in this domain, and we shall continue to do so.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the IAS system makes sense for big listed companies that operate worldwide. That is why, during Parliament’s last term, we decided, on the Legal Affairs Committee’s proposal, to adopt the IAS Regulation. The ultimate aim – as Alexander Radwan has said – was indeed to achieve convergence, at least with the USA and if possible worldwide. The system makes no sense in the case of small and medium-sized companies because, as a rule, they have no need of international financial markets, no need of Wall Street and the rest. For that reason alone, the necessity of developing IFRS for small and medium-sized companies is highly questionable. On top of that – and I think Commissioner McCreevy was entirely right here – the current proposal is for nothing more than a slimmed-down version of what are, by any measure, extremely complicated international standards, entirely unsuited to the structure of small and medium-sized companies in Europe. They are particularly ill-suited to family companies, which have been run by their owners for several generations; which have already written off property belonging to them; and in which the application of fair-value rules would simply encourage greed and, in the end, could very well jeopardise the companies’ chances of survival. On the other hand, we must be realistic. Ultimately, the question of accounting standards for SMEs in Europe will not be exempt from some form of pressure for harmonisation. Our demand is for comparability, at least within the Single Market. So I think it is important that we should seriously consider how to develop European alternatives to the proposals from London, with the aim of achieving greater standardisation in this area too – but standardisation that is sensible and appropriate for SMEs and geared to the long term, rather than short-term valuation. I have one further point to make about the IAS bodies. There is a real problem here, as Alexander Radwan has outlined. There may be a certain geographical balance but there is no balance in terms of economic weight. Europe is by far the largest bloc, the largest region in which the IAS rules apply. That is why we must have a commensurate say, and we simply cannot be compared with somewhere like Australia. Australia carries the same weight as a middle-sized EU country or, indeed, a big region like North Rhine-Westphalia. The balance needs to be improved in this respect.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am asking for the three words ‘independent impact assessment’ to be included after ‘better regulation’. That was the wording in the original draft but, for reasons I am unaware of, it seems to have fallen by the wayside. As far as I can determine, the oral amendment has the approval of the other groups.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the newly revised Lisbon Strategy has basically been successful since 2005. This is readily apparent from one fact: when one spoke in public about Lisbon in 2005, everyone knew that it was the Portuguese capital but no one associated it with a process at that time. Kyoto was already a process then, in respect of climate protection. It is now 2008, and thank goodness the world has changed. Now, when Lisbon is referred to in public speeches, it is of course still the Portuguese capital but it is increasingly associated with a political process, and I think this demonstrates a reasonable degree of success. I also believe that it was right to set new priorities aimed at boosting growth and employment, because that is one precondition for being able to proceed sensibly with sound environmental and social policies as the second and third pillars of the Lisbon Strategy. I furthermore believe that it was right to leave the guidelines unchanged, because they have on the whole been successful. I nevertheless wish to mention a few shortcomings. For example, I still see major shortcomings in the ongoing development of the internal market, which has supposedly been with us since the early 1990s but simply does not exist in many areas. We have no internal market in the insurance sector, and in company law, for instance, enterprises are unable to take full advantage of their right of establishment within the European Union. We still lack intellectual property rights and Europe has no rules on patents. There are no common rules on alternative financial instruments and we are still awaiting the internal market in healthcare. On the other hand, there has been a whole series of legislative proposals in other areas, above all geared to progress in the fields of social affairs, the environment and consumer rights. That is well and good, but a balance must be struck. I would therefore call on the Commission and the Council to pay particular attention to closing the loopholes in the internal market legislation.
 Klaus-Heiner Lehne (PPE-DE
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution drafted by the Steering Group focuses on three key areas: the internal market, where we are concerned in particular with the need to close certain gaps, and I need only quote the examples of the absence of a uniform patent law and the absence of an internal market in insurance; the labour market, where we are concerned in particular with security through flexibility; and monitoring and control, where we are concerned in particular with implementing the strategy in the Member States. This time we chose deliberately to focus not on energy and climate, because that was the key area in the past two years, and in strategic terms we have in fact achieved what we wanted to achieve with our resolutions, namely to ensure that the Commission and the Council concern themselves deeply with the subject, which is what they are doing. One aspect we continue to regard as important and which is addressed in the general part of the resolution is the whole complex of better legislation. In particular, we refer to the problems that still exist in regard to evaluating results and cutting back on red tape. Of course arguments also arose between the groups during the preparatory stage, nearly all of which were settled. In the end one decisive point of dispute remained. My Group stands by the integrated guidelines and, like the Commission, believes that we do not need to change the integrated guidelines at this point in time. Overall, we can regard what has been achieved in recent years as a success. When in 2005 we in a sense revived the Lisbon Strategy, everybody assumed Lisbon was merely the capital of a Member State, Portugal. Nobody connected its name with a concrete strategy. That was not the case, for example, of Kyoto, which stands not just for a town but also for a global strategy. We have made considerable progress in recent years in terms of our perception of what Lisbon stands for. We support the Commission’s position that growth and jobs are the key aspect and that progress in that area is of crucial importance. For only if we have growth and jobs can we conduct a good environmental and social policy.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we come today to the provisional end of a discussion that has lasted for 17 years. I recall that, when I was first elected to this House in 1994, we were already trying to get our heads around this issue. We did not reach a conclusion then. All we managed to do in the conciliation procedure was put the matter on ice. A few years ago the Commission presented a new proposal, which has again taken quite some time to deal with, but it can finally be brought to an end now, at least at first reading. What is being proposed here and what is on the table is essentially what the Commission has put forward, namely liberalisation of the market in spare parts, albeit with a five-year transitional period for Member States in which spare parts are covered by design protection. For 17 years I have been listening to arguments for and against. Most of them are unconvincing. Allow me to cite a number of examples. First of all, there was the argument that consumer prices would be lower if the repair clause were introduced. There is no empirical evidence at all for that claim – quite the contrary. Comparative data on spare-part prices in Britain, where the market is liberalised, and Germany, where it is not, show that, paradoxically, prices for spare parts are higher in Britain than in Germany. Besides, it is not rocket science: vehicle manufacturers must recoup their design costs somewhere. If they cannot recoup some of them from the sale of spare parts, it is logical that they will have to pass them on through the price of new cars, and so cars will become more expensive. In that case too, the consumer is the one who pays. The same applies, by the way, to insurance premiums. Some of the cost of buying new cars, as we know, is covered by insurance policies. If premiums rise, that does not help consumers either. One way or another, they always have to foot the bill. Nor am I really convinced by the argument that the motor industry needs design protection to fend off competitors from the Far East that are threatening its markets, for in no time at all we shall see how the industry finds other ways to protect its spare parts: patenting intelligent car bonnets and intelligent wing mirrors, protecting other parts through trade mark legislation by simply incorporating particular logos into them, imposing conditions of warranty and other practices. The safety argument, as our impact assessment has demonstrated, is not ultimately watertight either, because safety, as we well know, can be ensured by means of type testing. I cite these because I believe that all the arguments that have been advanced are ultimately spurious and have not provided clear answers to the fundamental question. When all is said and done, there remain two key arguments which I recognise. One of them is the copyright argument, which says that exemplary protection must be given in Europe to intellectual property rights, and indeed I take the view that what we are about to adopt here will probably send the wrong signal to China and India and that our task as Europeans is actually to defend the rights attaching to intellectual property. I shall come straight in with the counterargument, however. We have a single European market and – as Commissioner McCreevy quite rightly observed – a situation in which two-thirds of the Member States have liberalised their aftermarkets and therefore do not protect the design of spare parts, while the other third do. The fact is that the creation of a single market in Europe entails the creation of common legal rules, and it is not unusual in such cases to follow the majority principle. In my view there has always been a compromise solution, for which I canvassed together with Commissioner Monti back in the nineties. That was the idea of the compulsory licence, which would have meant that any manufacturer could reproduce parts subject to payment of a licence fee to the owner of the design rights. Incidentally, we have a very similar arrangement in the realm of copyright, so no one can tell me that it is not an option. It would have served both to protect the design and to create a market. Regrettably, it did not attract majority support in the House or in the Council. We were thus left to draw the conclusion that we should liberalise and that we should create a transitional period to protect Member States that needed some time to adapt. Then there remained the issue as to whether five or eight years’ grace should be allowed. My Group, like the Committee on Legal Affairs, opted for five years; I have heard that the Socialist Group favours eight years. The crux of the matter is that, when Parliament votes tomorrow on the question of whether five or eight years should appear in the text, it will be signalling that the Council needs to agree on a transitional period. I know from talks with the Slovenian Presidency that their proposals will tend to aim for a longer rather than a shorter grace period. I certainly wish the Slovenian Presidency good fortune in its efforts. There is one thing, I believe, that we should bear in mind for the second reading. Should the Council actually arrive at an agreement, we in Parliament should resolve not to complicate matters at second reading. The issue does not merit protracted wrangling, and it is high time it was brought to a conclusion. The present draft is our contribution to the pursuit of that aim.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to thank you most sincerely for your commitment to this matter. It has brought with it great progress in the development of this project in past months. I should say at this juncture that I regard this project as the most important in the entire legislative term, although it is actually a pre-legislative rather than a legislative project. Of course, we as Parliament do have an enormous interest – and this is also the key reason why this oral question was tabled again today – in the fact that we are very consciously keeping up the suspense and keeping the discussion going not only at the level of the working group we have set up and at committee level, but also here with you in plenary. It is therefore also important that we have put this on the agenda today. We also want to find something out from you – you are still not able to say much about the definite schedule – because from Parliament’s point of view it is also significant, of course, in view of the upcoming elections in 2009, for our strategy as to how we continue to deal with the Frame of Reference. Over the coming year there will be a preliminary draft, but there will not be a final text until April 2009. In any case it will be so late that it will presumably no longer be possible to deal with the content in depth in this legislative term and the next Parliament will therefore have to do so in the next term of office. I wish to emphasise very clearly once again that we think the Frame of Reference, if it is adopted by the Commission and inserted into the consultation document, must not to refer to subjects of contract law alone, and Parliament has continually made it clear by an outsize majority that this must go beyond the framework of pure contract law in order to have the desired effect. We also want specifically to be able to consider the option of whether we can subsequently solve the many problems we have in the internal market in the shape of an optional instrument for cross-border businesses. At the moment we have a situation in which we are having to live in a happy coexistence of the country of origin principle and country of destination principle alongside the many directives and European legislative decisions with up to 28 legal systems, all of which have also to be simultaneously applied – depending on the circumstances. This is not right in practice because nobody – no solicitor, judge or barrister – is in a position to know 28 European legal systems. Against this background one optional instrument could be an instrument that actually opens up the internal market, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as for the consumer, and throws open every kind of possibility in the internal market. All the activities of the Commission and Parliament should be aimed at keeping this option open so that a final decision can be made on this in the next legislative term.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the PPE-DE Group is content with the outcome of this process. This is primarily due to the fact that the rapporteur, by dint of consummate bargaining skill, great patience and dogged persistence, managed to negotiate and seal a compromise which the entire Committee on Legal Affairs was ultimately able to endorse. May I therefore express my very special thanks to our rapporteur. It was clearly evident from the outcome that patience had been the best policy. Rather than take snap decisions at a single reading, it was right to opt for further negotiations with the Council and the Commission, because this was precisely the sort of matter that lent itself to treatment at one reading with a view to resolving all the complex issues rather than burning the midnight oil two years hence at meetings of the Conciliation Committee, which would have had to discuss the same problems we are examining today. As I see it, Article 5 is the core of this regulation, and we are delighted that we have managed to alter the substance of Article 5 to reflect the original intention of the Rome Convention, namely to balance the interests of consumers with those of providers. Had the Commission’s proposal been approved, we know that it would have had quite serious repercussions on e-commerce and on small and medium-sized businesses, and this would have impacted adversely on the supply of goods and services to consumers. We have constantly criticised the fact that the Commission, in spite of the Interinstitutional Agreement of December 2003, has failed to carry out an impact assessment in this case. We confidently assume, however, that this is the last such omission and that the same mistake will not be repeated in future legislative proposals from the Commission. Lastly, I merely wish to observe that the whole debate about consumer contracts, about the country-of-destination principle and the country-of-origin principle and about the relationship between providers or suppliers and consumers has only reinforced Parliament’s repeated message that, in the long run, we need an optional instrument for the law of contract governing cross-border trade, and we are pleased that this requirement is set out in the recitals of the motion for a resolution before us.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from the perspective of the PPE-DE Group in the European Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs, I would like to make the following three points. Firstly, we very much welcome the fact that the European Commission has included a proposal for a European Company Statute in its legislative programme for next year. This is something which this House has wanted for a very long time, and so it is very welcome indeed. What we find regrettable is that the Commission has, in effect, been forced into this course of action after we made use of the legal instrument of Article 192 and opted to present a legislative own-initiative report, despite the fact that the Commission has been aware of this problem for a very long time. Indeed, it has been mentioned repeatedly in a whole series of company law programmes ever since the days of Commissioner Bolkestein. Secondly, we find it most regrettable that this year, the Commission suspended the process for the adoption of the Fourteenth Company Law Directive on the cross-border transfer of the registered office of limited companies. This is indeed a major problem. We expect the Commission to reconsider and include it in future legislative programmes. If this does not happen, may I make it clear here and now that we will again make use of Article 192 and force the Commission to bring forward a relevant legislative proposal. The Commissioner's notions that for the application of the Merger Directive, it would first be necessary to set up a company in another country in order to merge with it are bureaucratic and absurd. This is not a solution that we regard as acceptable. With a view to the next legislative term, at least, we would also like to see the Commission giving some thought to achieving progress in relation to copyright and perhaps commissioning a Green Paper on this issue.
 Klaus-Heiner Lehne,

(DE) 
Mr President, Commissioner, let me begin by thanking you sincerely for your remarks, which bring me neatly to my first point, namely the European private-company statute. I may say we are delighted that, after protracted difficulties, the Commission has finally been convinced of the need for this legislative draft, and that we can now expect to receive it. It is to the credit of Parliament that this was made possible by the heavy pressure we exerted. Be that as it may, we can only rejoice wholeheartedly at the outcome. I do, however, intend to address a second point to which today’s resolution also refers, and on which we are not satisfied with the way things have developed. I refer here to the 14th Company Law Directive on the transfer of the company’s registered office, the place where companies are registered. For many years the European Commission has had plans to close this loophole in company law. We have now learned that this has been more or less deleted from the legislative programme, at least as far as the European Commission is concerned, and that the loophole will therefore remain open. May I emphasise at this point that my political group at least – and, I believe, an overwhelming majority of the Legal Affairs Committee, to judge by the tenor of its deliberations in recent years, and of this House as a whole – has always taken the view that this loophole needs to be closed and that the 14th Company Law Directive is a necessity. This is not a matter of additional bureaucracy and new corporate obligations. It is simply about giving companies the opportunity promised them in the Treaty to move freely within the European Union and establish themselves in any Member State. We have heard that one of the reasons why the European Commission felt unable to move forward on this issue and to present a proposal was its view that the existing merger regulations and other provisions were adequate to guarantee corporate mobility. I can only say that, if a company cannot move its registered office within the single market unless it founds a new company in another country and then merges with it, the present rules are scarcely exemplary as a means of avoiding red tape or minimising costs. The ideal would be a sound piece of secondary legislation that guaranteed the right of companies to exercise in practice the freedom that the single market offers them in theory. One of the arguments advanced for the status quo 
is that past rulings of the European Court of Justice have greatly liberalised company law in any case. That is undoubtedly true, but the European Court delivers these rulings for the sole purpose of promoting the full application of primary law, simply because the legislative bodies responsible for the adoption of secondary law, namely Parliament and the Council – though we depend on the European Commission – are not able to enact sound secondary legislation that would actually guarantee the freedoms enshrined in the Treaty provisions establishing the single market. That is why Parliament is adhering to its position that the Commission’s monopoly on the right of initiative binds it to present a proposal for a 14th Company Law Directive in due course. We ask the Commission to reconsider whether the 14th Directive, which is already on file in the Commission’s offices, can be incorporated into the legislative programme in the coming years. If that does not happen, Parliament reserves the right – as our resolution expressly states – to invoke Article 192 of the Treaty and table a report on its own initiative with a view to requesting a legislative proposal. And while we are on the subject of company law, let me take this convenient opportunity to say a brief word about the Commission’s latest communication on the simplification of company law. The resolution does not deal directly with that communication, but there is a thematic connection between the two. I believe we in Parliament agree that we do not support any erosion of the substance of established Community law and practice – the acquis communautaire
 – as a consequence of simplification measures. In other words, there can be no question, in my view, of deleting entire directives. What we can support are measures designed to unburden companies, to minimise bureaucratic and statistical obligations, to relieve companies of the requirement to publish all the bits and pieces which appear in their balance sheets but which may actually be quite unimportant. I believe there is scope here to cooperate closely with the Commission in order to improve company law. One other thing that struck me when I read the Commission’s documentation on this subject was that there are certain laws we have enacted – one example being the Transparency Directive, adopted in the wake of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act – which contain some provisions that now beg the question of why they are not being reviewed as part of a simplification drive. I should also welcome further consideration of this matter by the Commission, since such a review would likewise help to improve company law.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I must say I am pleased that Commissioner McCreevy, in his answer to this oral question, did not reject the European Parliament’s suggestions. Over the past few years, there have been so many hearings and consultations about the European Private Company that I cannot understand why we need to have a third, a fourth, a fifth and perhaps even a sixth or however many more. The matter is closed. We had an initial proposal in the Commission’s action plan. That was approved, in the revised action plan, by the majority of stakeholders. The hearings in Parliament produced an unequivocal message. Parliament’s decisions could not have been clearer, and on that basis I cannot accept any further delays. Experts are generally agreed that there is a gap in the law in the Directive on the cross-border transfer of registered seat. The European Union offers freedom of movement of capital – that is, the option of moving one’s property or capital to a different location – but if I own a business, I do not currently have that option because I cannot decide freely where to base my business, or where to transfer it to, within the European Union. That is very clearly a gap in the law. The Commission, in its annual legislative programme, announced its intention of closing the gap. Currently we have a situation where the European Court of Justice is developing its own case-law in this area and tending towards Wild West-style deregulation, for the simple reason that the legislature is inert; it is doing nothing to address the areas where we lack harmonisation. It is high time that the legislature acted, instead of handing all responsibility over to the Court of Justice. One final point: the European Commission’s monopoly on initiative does not exist in a vacuum. Like any monopoly, it has to be seen in a context and, in this case, the context follows from the Treaty and the Interinstitutional Agreements. According to those texts, both the Council and the European Parliament have an indirect right of initiative. The Commission, in the Interinstitutional Agreements, has undertaken to respond to their proposals. That being so, I wish to make it very clear that if the Commission fails to deliver a substantive response on this issue within the stipulated time limit, I shall propose to the Committee on Legal Affairs that we take proceedings against it in the European Court for failure to act.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my Group, I would like to make just three comments on points of principle. The first concerns impact assessment for legislative proposals. I recognise that significant progress has been made since 1999, when Parliament took the initiative on this issue, and since 2003, when an interinstitutional agreement was adopted, which was negotiated by our Chairman, Mr Gargani. However, there are still deficits. Parliament is demanding – as it has done before in numerous resolutions – that impact assessments of legislative proposals be conducted on a more independent basis. I make no secret of the fact that to my mind, we should be thinking about whether we should adopt the US model of an independent agency which is established outside the Commission and undertakes impact assessments of legislation in line with a standardised procedure not only for the Commission but for all other institutions as well. However, another key point based on our experience in the Committee on Legal Affairs is that impact assessments are not actually being carried out as standard on every Commission proposal. I can cite two specific examples from the Directorate-General for Justice and one from the Internal Market Directorate-General that have remained in my memory. I also think that it is important to give serious consideration to the possibility of carrying out impact assessments in comitology procedures too, as it is often here that the bureaucracy arises as a result of the comitology decisions and the associated burdens. As to soft law, Mr Medina Ortega's report has my full backing. Indeed, in the Committee on Legal Affairs we increasingly have the impression that the European Commission is misusing the instrument of soft law in order to circumvent Parliament's codecision rights. It is not acceptable for the Commission to make decisions as a legislative body at the proposal of the Directorate-General for Competition on which it consults Parliament, yet this is not the case for recommendations relating to the internal market. As my final point, I would like to draw attention to the issue of simplification. We need an institutional agreement on simplification as a matter of urgency, as we have in other areas, in order to ensure that we have an efficient procedure. We do not want to open a Pandora's box and instead of simplifying matters, end up with even greater complexity.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too – just like Mrs Wallis – remember the last mandate of this Parliament, for this House has always had its problems with the rights management companies; I would refer the House back to the Echerer report, in which we demanded of the Commission a specific piece of legislation on their transparency and the regulation of them, to the Zimmerling report, in which this featured, and to the deliberations on the directive on copyright and related rights in the information society. For those reasons alone it is perfectly right and proper that the Commission should be giving thought to how this problem should be handled, for it is not tolerable, in the long run, that there should be twenty-seven monopolies in this field and no internal market, but nor do we want these twenty-seven monopolies to be replaced by a few oligopolies, and that much became abundantly clear from the deliberations we had in committee. I want, though, to take this opportunity to make it clear that rights management companies do not exist for their own sake alone; they are a sort of necessary evil, existing where they are needed, as mediators between those who create the product and those who use it. Where that is not required – and such a situation is indeed conceivable – no rights management company is needed. What I have learned, though, from many discussions and hearings – and not least from these companies lobbying activities – is that this business is much more complicated than we had originally thought. In the course of the process, a lot of stakeholders changed their minds; the big management companies suddenly decided that they were all for liberalisation, because they worked out that the market would give them the chance to form an oligopoly, while many users suddenly changed their minds and decided against all-out liberalisation, in which they saw more drawbacks than benefits for themselves. What is needed here, quite simply, is the very careful drafting of any proposal for legislation; it is self-evident that we have to do something about this, and that things cannot carry on the way they are, but our expectation is that the Commission should actually produce that proposal, and that we should then be able to get to grips with it with all the ways and means afforded by parliamentary debate. That is the crucial message that this report carries, and that is also what we expect of the Commission. My thanks go to the rapporteur and to the shadow rapporteurs.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can wholeheartedly endorse what Mrs Berès has just said, for the subject matter of both oral questions is, in principle, quite similar. The reason why the Takeovers Directive is the way it is is that the ‘one share – one vote’ principle does not exist in Europe, and that has to be spelled out plainly. Another reason why it is the way it is is that, back when the Takeovers Directive was being hammered out, it was not possible to secure the acceptance of the ‘one share, one vote’ principle. I was prepared to accept it at the time, but neither here in this House nor in the Council could the necessary majorities be found to support it. I think that those who speak in public debate read too much into the report that the Commission has now put forward on the implementation of the Takeovers Directive, for the report, in fact, says nothing more or less than that the directive has, by and large, been properly implemented by the Member States, which have availed themselves of the option provided by it, which is precisely the intention behind the legislation. Things will get interesting, though, only when the Commission does as the Takeovers Directive itself requires and, in 2011/2012, produces its first report on the use to which the Directive is put, for then we will have reached the point at which we will be able to arrive at conclusions as to whether what we have done with it – that is to say, setting a benchmark and leaving things to market forces – has or has not been successful, or whether it will then be necessary to consider further legislation, but that point will be reached only in 2011 or 2012, when we have the first definite report on the application of the directive; it has not been reached now. I might add that we – by which I mean this House and the Council as legislator – laid down, by a large majority, certain things on a wide variety of issues currently under discussion, including, back then, the Takeovers Directive, insisting, for example, that the so-called ‘break-through rule’ – which is, of course, the decisive benchmark – should apply to all pre-bid and post-bid defences, although there would, of course, be certain exceptions to it. We did not include those aspects that present no obstacles to takeovers, and we did this on the basis of simple accounting examples and the results of simple mathematical procedures, one of these being the so-called preference shares, which were exempted from the ‘breakthrough rule’ from the very outset. Why was this so? One reason why was that the owners of preference shares are paid more than are others; a second was that company law limits them to a maximum of 50% of capital, so that they can never, in fact, tie down more of the capital than can the actual ordinary shares, which carry with them an entitlement to vote. It was for similar reasons that we, at that time, exempted French shares with double voting rights from the breakthrough rule, one reason for this being that these were not voting shares of a particular class, that might be said to be guaranteed in the long term, but rather intended to reward long-term investment, with these voting rights being converted, after a certain period of time, into normal voting rights; the second being that, with the breakthrough rule, the reaching of 75% – which is, as a rule, the quorum at which the breakthrough can kick in – no longer raises the issue as to whether the shares are double-vote or ordinary. If I hold them, I always have a majority in the general meeting. That is the reason why we made an exception for these voting rights. We did, however, include multiple voting rights and limitations on voting rights in the breakthrough rule, since these are real obstacles to takeovers. Here, too, one finds the peculiar situation that there is a disparity between ownership on the one hand and control – that is to say, majority by number of votes – on the other, and we took the view that the application of the breakthrough rule to these would be justified in so far as companies or Member States avail themselves of this option. I just want to reiterate something to which Mrs Berès has referred, namely that we, in the Szejna report, forcefully put forward the view that market forces should, in the first instance, be allowed free rein, so that we could see how this directive proved itself in practice, and that we would decide whether further steps were needed when the Commission, in 2011/2012, had brought out the first report. Having now heard that the Commission is mulling over the idea of producing a recommendation on this subject, let me be quite frank in saying that I am less than enthusiastic about this, and that for two reasons, the first of which is that we, in this House, take an increasing sceptical view of recourse to this sort of ‘soft law’. Moreover, the Commission is also running the risk of this House adopting such a recommendation in the form of an own-initiative report, into which it would put something quite different to what the Commission, in its recommendation, has envisaged, and if that happens, the recommendation will be rendered worthless, for a recommendation is effective only if it can be taken as read that the legislator will be prepared, in subsequent proceedings, to support such a regulation, but if the legislator says ‘no’ to it, the recommendation is of no value. The second reason is that I am not wholly clear in my own mind as to what such a recommendation would be meant to accomplish. In Article 10 of the Takeovers Directive, we laid down comprehensive rules on transparency according to which all enterprises have to set out openly all the existing obstacles to a takeover. Those transparency rules are stringent, and I wonder just what the recommendation is meant to achieve over and above that. There is yet another reason for this question, and the wording of the Committee on Legal Affairs’ question alludes to it. We are of course interested to know what view the Commission takes of the development ushered in by the Advocate-General’s summing up in the Volkswagen case, when he, for the first time, had to deal, not with traditional golden shares, but with restrictions on voting and other rules, and he saw these as being contrary to the Treaty in much the same way as golden shares are. Do we actually need to legislate if the ECJ follows this ruling? Does it not mean that all obstacles fall away of themselves? It would be interesting to hear the Commission’s view of this.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Almunia has already said, this is an extremely important project. It is concerned with deepening the European internal market, and one aspect of this is giving owners the opportunity to exercise their rights across borders in this internal market. The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted this important project unanimously. We have come to an agreement with the Council whereby, if this House follows the vote of the Committee on Legal Affairs in plenary, the Council will do likewise, and thus we shall be able to achieve a result here at a single reading pursuant to the Interinstitutional Agreement of December 2003. The first crucial issue with which this Directive is concerned is that of the representation of shareholders at general meetings; that is, the exercise of voting rights not by the shareholders themselves but by intermediaries – representatives – or by means of proxy voting. There are widely differing rules for this in the EU, some of them highly restrictive. The compromise reached in the end makes representation possible in principle, but subject to a transparent procedure, and also gives the Member States the opportunity of prohibiting representation by national law in the event of conflicts of interest. A second important area is the issue of the right to ask questions. The problem here is that the traditions and, in particular, related legal consequences, rights of challenge and similar points vary greatly between Member States. The scale ranges from Member States where questions can be asked but do not need to be answered, to Member States where questions have to be answered correctly and, if they are not, resolutions adopted at general meetings can be declared null and void. A compromise has been reached on this that lays down the right of shareholders – owners – to ask questions in principle, but does enable Member States to make sensible adjustments and also limited restrictions to the right to ask questions in accordance with their own legal traditions, without calling this right into question in principle. As Commissioner Almunia mentioned, a number of issues could not be resolved definitively with this Directive. This is partly owing to legal systems. An example is the legal relationship between shareholder and representative. Indeed, this has no place in a Directive concerned with company law, as matters such as this belong in contract law, which is why the Council and Parliament subsequently agreed to deal with it in a separate recommendation, a separate legal act. The same goes for the subject of the languages used. In this regard, the co-rapporteur Mr Klinz from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs had made the – undoubtedly constructive – suggestion of providing for similar rules to those in the Transparency Directive. Here, too, however, we later decided – following the negotiations – that, in systematic terms, it would be better to regulate this within the framework of a recommendation than in this specific text. Consequently, this issue, too, will have to be resolved in the separate legal act. All in all, I should say that, from my point of view, we have managed to solve the multitude of problems that existed when we started dealing with this Directive. It is true that they have not all been solved one hundred per cent satisfactorily, there is no question about that – this is normal when one has to reach compromises. Ultimately, however, they have been solved in a way that enabled the solution to obtain unanimous support in both the Council and the Committee on Legal Affairs. I should like to express the warmest of thanks to my co-rapporteur, Mr Klinz, to the shadow rapporteurs from the two committees concerned – but particularly to Mr Medina from the Committee on Legal Affairs, with whom I enjoyed close cooperation – to the two Chairs, Mr Gargani and Mrs Berès, to the Austrian, Finnish and German Presidencies, which contributed significantly to the success of this project, and last but not least to the European Commission, whose help with overcoming the problems was very useful.

 Madam President, I should like to thank everyone who has contributed to and supported this very difficult project. Not everything has been resolved one hundred per cent satisfactorily, but that is inevitable with such a difficult compromise. Nevertheless, we have taken a significant step towards making it easier for European shareholders to exercise their ownership rights. In Europe, there are no large strides towards our ultimate goal, but only accumulations of small steps – and the issue of shareholders’ rights is no exception. I wish to conclude on this note, express my thanks and forgo the remainder of my speaking time.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me just start by giving you a brief summary of what we have achieved. I would remind you that it was about two and a half years ago that the Commission kicked off a new initiative, having come to the conclusion, following the Kok report, that the Lisbon Strategy needed to be got back on its feet again. We want this strategy, which, in the first half of the decade was in essence no more than a political objective without the least chance of becoming reality, to come at least closer to its objective in the decade’s second half. I would claim that it has done that. ‘Lisbon’ does not yet, admittedly, have quite the same ring to it as ‘Kyoto’, but every Member State is now coming up with its national plans. We in this House have come up with a structure for getting to grips with the Lisbon Strategy and trying to move it forward. The Commission, too, has set new priorities for it. We have held inter-parliamentary conferences here in this House, with an ever-increasing number of participants from the parliaments. All this shows that we are going in the right direction and that the attempt at resuscitating the strategy has been successful. Secondly, we have succeeded in making it clear that, although there may well be three pillars to the Lisbon Strategy, our ability to pursue a proper environmental and social policy is dependent on growth and job creation. We have also to make it plain that the Lisbon Strategy is also Europe’s response to globalisation. In the resolution – the subject-matter of which will obviously be different from what it was in former years – we will make it clear that there are a number of deficiencies in the internal market that have to be alleviated. There are many of them, but I would just like to point out two. One is that the further development of European patent law has still not been forthcoming, and on this front we expect the Commission to take some initiatives, such as it has already produced on the liberalisation of goods traffic in the internal market, which is an equally crucial matter. It is energy policy, though, on which the summit and the Commission’s – and this House’s – activities will primarily focus. Let me remind you of what happened last year, when the Heads of State or Government were not to be persuaded that energy policy really had claims on Europe’s concern and that a European approach to the subject was needed, when the view still prevailed that these things could be sorted out at the national level. That has changed. This time round, if energy policy is discussed at the summit, everyone will be working on the assumption that this is a task for Europe. In this resolution, we have said that renewable energies must, of course, be promoted in so far as possible, but we have also highlighted the continuing importance of nuclear power, which will be made inevitable in future by the problem of CO2 emissions, a problem addressed as a whole in this resolution as well, and also, of course, discussed in much greater depth in the parallel resolution on climate change. We have set ourselves very ambitious targets in respect of energy efficiency, and I do in fact think that – as the figures have already shown – a share of 30% in the world’s economic product combined with a share of only 15% in emissions is already an indication that Europe is leading the way where energy efficiency is concerned, but we can achieve far more and be an example to the world. Something else to which reference has been made was the remaining need for us to make the internal market in energy a reality. We know that an oligarchic and monopolistic structure continues to exist and that there is only one part of the European Union in which one can speak of a real internal market, while there are real deficits in large areas of the EU. I would also like to address the aspect of ‘better regulation’. Here, too, much has been achieved. Thinking back to the interinstitutional agreement of December 2003, that was certainly a breakthrough, but all that glisters is not gold. The Commission has still not yet complied with Parliament’s request – as articulated in over half a dozen resolutions – for an independent assessment of the impact of laws, yet this is something on which we insist. If the Commission does not swing into action soon, we will have to think up other ways and means whereby we can do it ourselves. What really is important now, as I see it, is proper benchmarking that makes it possible for us to review the reports from the Member States and say what we think is necessary in order that, through this benchmarking, the Lisbon Strategy goals be achieved even more effectively than they have been in the past.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not, of course, have any objection to this subject being debated; I am happy to see one. I would only ask, though, that the vote on it should be held this week, since the committees have come to an amicable agreement on this and the Council intends to agree to whatever we adopt in this House relatively rapidly and promptly. If we are to take this legislative report on Thursday afternoon, it would probably not be advisable to vote on it at the same time, and hence my request that the debate be scheduled either on Thursday morning or on Wednesday evening, since there are windows left on both days. If we do that, we could vote on Thursday at midday.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I feel particularly honoured to be able to see this topic discussed today, when you, Madam President, are chairing a sitting of this House for the first time. The action plan on company law already envisaged examination of which additional forms of company might be considered as subjects for legislation within the European Union. As a result of the studies carried out at that time, these questions were, in essence, left open. Now, the Commission, a number of years ago, invited discussion of the company law action plan and subjected it to a wholesale revision. This House made a full contribution to this debate, and, following on from it, decided to produce and discuss an own-initiative report on the European private company. Such is the background to this item on today’s agenda. We have considered this question carefully and organised in this House a hearing on the subject, which drove home the fact that there is a real need for that sort of European private company and for the Commission to initiate legislation to create it. Smaller industrial companies in particular – export-driven businesses that are at present obliged to set up subsidiaries and companies in other Member States and in accordance with those states’ laws on companies – would welcome with great enthusiasm the creation of a European legal form whereby they could organise their subsidiaries throughout the European Union. At present, they are in serious need of advice, which may well be good for the lawyers, but it does cost a lot of money, since there has to be, again and again, examination of individual cases to ascertain what rights and duties their directors and members of their supervisory boards actually have and what they have to do in order not to end up at odds with the law. I think they will be able to avoid that if they can be offered a single European legal form that regulates a number of core matters, in particular directors’ powers and questions of liability, in one way at the European level and thus offers something to businesses. There is, then, absolutely no question of additional bureaucracy, for companies can decide for themselves whether they want this legal form or not; it is simply something of which they can avail themselves, something that plugs a real hole in the law left over after we created the European Limited Company for bigger firms. Let me also say, by way of an aside, that the insufficient progress made in the past in the development of European company law is one explanation for the European Court of Justice’s rulings in such cases as Inspire Art
, and this is where we can help to provide and create an exemplary structure in the European Union. I believe that the Committee on Legal Affairs – which adopted this report by a large majority, or, indeed unanimously – has succeeded in finding a suitable compromise between the different approaches to the structure of such companies found in continental Europe on the one hand and in British legal thinking on the other, especially on the issue of equity, where we achieved a good compromise on the basis that equity ought, as a matter of principle, to exist, but without the obligation to make cash payments, which, as a means whereby registration may be made easier, is, in my view, a step in the right direction and also shows how it is possible for the Commission to submit a proposal with the Council then being able to find a rational compromise between the various legal traditions. What we in the Committee on Legal Affairs – and I think, after today’s vote, this House too – expect of the Commission is that it should, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty, with our Rules of Procedure, and with the interinstitutional agreement, stir itself into action and, within the foreseeable future, take definite steps to put a definite proposal for legislation before this House and the Council. As I draw to a close, I would like to mention another consideration that has had some input into the amendments, that being the debate on workers’ participation in decision-making. Let me make perfectly plain something that was not a bone of contention in our deliberations, namely that nobody is seeking to restrict workers’ rights in any way whatever. In so far as they are guaranteed at the national level, they are also to be guaranteed and maintained when this legislative project is put into effect. This is something on which there have been a number of amendments, which I do not regard as crucial, for they all have the same end in mind, that of protecting workers’ rights. One final comment – and yes, I do mean final, for I will then have used up my five minutes: I note with pleasure that the German Presidency of the Council has declared the European Private Company to be one of its priorities, and so I assume that the Council, too, will be as supportive of this as – I hope – an overwhelming majority in this House is about to be.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for two years now, I have been one of the two rapporteurs in the European Parliament's steering group for the Lisbon process. As you know, we launched the Lisbon process together in 2000, and, since then, we have worked tirelessly to point out, in declarations of the Heads of State or Government and in Parliamentary resolutions, that the development of the European patent system is one of the most important preconditions that will enable us to reach the goals defined by Lisbon. I was impressed by Commissioner McCreevy's emphasis on the importance of this matter. Our goal must be to achieve a simple, cost-effective patent, applicable throughout Europe if at all possible, which gives not only big business but, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises the opportunity to protect their innovations in the internal market: indeed, it is medium-sized enterprises that hold the greatest number of innovative patents. The decisive issue is that we must make changes in Europe's current fragmented patent landscape, with the aim of drastically reducing consultancy, procedural and translation costs, which are a particular burden on small and medium-sized enterprises. That is the decisive goal that we must achieve. Of course, people can already obtain protection for their inventions throughout Europe, but, in practice, they have to do so in all Member States, either directly through the national patent offices or indirectly through the European Patent Office, with the bundle of patents that has been mentioned. In the event of disputes or infringements they must, in theory, launch proceedings, incur legal costs and so on in all these countries. This must be resolved and made more viable and practicable, particularly for SMEs. The internal market needs to be developed further in this respect. Under your predecessor, Mr Bolkestein, an admirable proposal for a single European patent regulation to establish a Community patent was set in motion. However, when Article 308 is the legal basis and unanimity in the Council is required, it is difficult to reach agreement. In this particular case, agreement could not be reached in the dispute about languages: there are currently 20 official languages that the Council is demanding; after the next enlargement there will be 22. The industry is quite rightly saying that nobody needs that sort of patent: it is so exorbitantly expensive that it is of no use and practically no economic value. The competitiveness of the European patent would push us a long way back in global terms and not guarantee the necessary quality. A patent of this kind would only be of benefit to very big, rich businesses that could afford that kind of thing, and perhaps not even to them. For medium-sized businesses it would be completely unusable. Therefore, the Regulation is stuck fast, and the Council is not shifting. My suggestion of continuing with harmonisation, which you were so good as to include in the consultation, Commissioner, was also rejected by all parties, primarily following our experiences with the second reading of the Directive on computer-implemented inventions, which showed that there was a risk that legislation could be enacted that would not improve the current patent system, but would make it considerably worse. So, we have made no progress with harmonisation either. What, then, is left for us to do? What is left is that we must carry on and further develop the currently existing patent system. There are, however, institutional problems in this regard: on the one hand, the European Union's fully legitimate claim that the Member States should not legislate in areas that, at any rate, actually lie partly in its sphere of competence and belong to the internal market; and, on the other hand, the Member States' keenness to make progress. I take the position that we must try to link these two problems together to solve them. In my view, one conceivable option would be for the European Union to be involved in some way – to be decided by negotiations – in the European patent agreement and, in return, for the European Union to clear up the institutional concerns regarding the European Patent Litigation Agreement (EPLA). This could be one way in which we could improve the situation while agreement cannot be reached in the Council regarding a Community patent. With regard to the lobby's publicly expressed criticisms, in my view, the claim that the introduction of a single European patent court within the meaning of the EPLA would make it easier to patent software is, to put it mildly, nonsense. It is pure speculation for which there is no evidence – one of those matters comes under procedural law, and one under substantive law. Nor is the EPLA more expensive. It must be clear that apples are being compared with oranges here. If the EPLA is in place, it will not be necessary to pursue legal disputes in all the countries involved: one court, the second instance, so to speak, will reach a judgment that is equally binding on all signatory States. I am most grateful to Commissioner McCreevy for the way in which the consultation was conducted. I gather from the Commissioner's public comments that he, too, has obviously drawn the right conclusions from the results of the consultation. I should like to say, both personally and on behalf of the great majority of my group, that we share and support this position. There is no alternative. Otherwise, the grand project of developing the European patent system is doomed to failure.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue we are discussing today is one of the most important – I believe the
 most important – pre-legislative proposals on the EU agenda for this parliamentary term. It is all the more regrettable, then, that this issue, too, is being discussed just before midnight once again, whilst other supposedly ‘important’ issues receive prime-time slots in this House. Incidentally, this is further proof of the urgent need for parliamentary reform. Nevertheless, I should like to turn to the oral questions. I can count a total of six resolutions to date that Parliament has issued since the early 1990s, repeatedly and emphatically supporting the project to create a common frame of reference. Parliament has done this for the simple reason that, together with legal practitioners – EU lawyers and judges – we are of the opinion that further steps towards common principles of civil law are needed in order to render many European legislative provisions such as the e
-Commerce Directive feasible. In legal disputes, particularly those between consumers and traders concerning small amounts, it is practically impossible for lawyers and judges to apply 25 – or 26 if we include Scotland – different legal systems in the EU in parallel, especially given the strange juxtaposition of the country of origin and country of destination principles, as is the case with the e
-Commerce Directive, for example. That is why we need a higher common standard – I am quite happy to use a harmonised one. There is actually no disagreement about this – there is a broad consensus about it in this House. This is also the opinion of leading legal practitioners, and is one of the reasons the CCBE – Council of the Bars and Law Societies of the European Community – is planning to hold a conference in Rome this autumn, which offers its belated support to the project. It is therefore vital to us that we obtain not only the bare bones of a frame of reference, applying exclusively to issues of consumer contract law, but a framework including, in principle, all aspects of civil law. That is a crucial point as regards later decisions on all the options for what becomes of this frame of reference. This will, of course, depend primarily on the quality of this frame of reference. We should like all options to be kept open until the Commission presents the final consultation document, however, and to be able to take a decision on it afterwards, along with others. It is also important that we depart from the sectoral approach to civil legislation and seek a holistic approach. After all, the many inconsistencies currently existing in EU civil law can be attributed to the failure to follow this holistic approach, to see things as a whole; instead always considering only individual problems. Another prerequisite for a frame of reference is that, in principle, the network continues to function and is still operated, as the Commission has done up to now. As rapporteur on this issue for the Committee on Legal Affairs, I can say that all the political groups agree in principle on this subject, and that an overwhelming majority of this House is in favour – something I have seldom experienced elsewhere. Mrs Wallis of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, who cannot be here this evening, has explicitly asked me to reaffirm this on her behalf, too. As we know, the three Commissioners dealing with this issue – Commissioners Kyprianou, Frattini and McCreevy – are currently considering, or have recently been considering, how the work should be taken forward. The reason we have deliberately put this oral question – together with the corresponding resolution, which you may have been able to read already in draft form, and which will undoubtedly be adopted by a large majority in this House on Thursday – on today’s agenda is to emphasise clearly once more the strength of Parliament’s support for this project. We want this House’s resolutions to serve as a guideline for the Commission, too, in further developing and dealing with this issue. There has always been very close cooperation and mutual support between the Commission and Parliament on this issue up to now. We ask that it stays that way – in the interest of the development of the EU and in the interest of legislation in the EU, which must also be manageable and practicable for the man in the street. That is why this project must continue. We ask the Commission to maintain the strength of its support, and also to take the opportunity of its answer to this question to make that clear publicly here in plenary.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by expressing my special thanks to Mr Szenja, the rapporteur in the lead committee, for our close and fruitful cooperation. This is an extremely significant report, because it makes clear from the parliamentary perspective the priorities we still wish to pursue in implementing the rump of the old action plan on company law in this legislative term and shows how far we intend to push the Commission to present concrete proposals in the course of the present term. In the policy debate, I was not surprised to see that there was broad agreement, not only between the large political groups but among the smaller groups too, on the substance of the reports, which were adopted by large majorities in both the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and, subsequently, in the Committee on Legal Affairs. In the view of my group, this is also a compelling reason for us to reject all the amendments that have been tabled in the intervening period for the reading in plenary. The report is good as it stands and should not be watered down by amendments that may also scupper previous compromises. This is why we in the PPE-DE Group cannot support the amendments that are now on the table. Allow me to add a comment on the subject of ‘one share, one vote’. There were differences on this point, not only in the debate within the Committee on Economic Affairs but also in the Committee on Legal Affairs. At the time when we negotiated the Takeover Directive, we became aware of these differences. Even then, we managed to find a reasonable consensus. The consensus view is quite simply that we should wait first of all for any studies that have been commissioned and then wait for the evaluation of the Takeover Directive in 2012/2013. At the end of the next legislative term, a decision can be taken as to whether further proposals need to be made. This is a good example of a sound compromise. In conclusion let me reiterate my thanks to everyone involved. This is a good report that merits a large parliamentary majority.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must begin by apologising for the absence of Mr Gargani, who is unable to be present by reason of illness. Members of my own Group have asked me to stand in for him today as rapporteur and to say something about the content of this report. I will start by observing that this ruling by the Court of Justice came as no surprise – at any rate, not to me. There may well have been many who thought that things would not turn out this way, but I actually see this as no more than a logical conclusion, since we have for some time in the past seen the Commission adopt varying – sometimes widely divergent – approaches to legislative proposals relating to criminal law. Drawing on my practical experience in the field of business law, I just want to point out that many past directives proposed on the basis of legal bases in the first pillar – for example, those on money-laundering and market abuse, or the provisions on insider trading – have included at least elements of criminal law. It is in fact perfectly right and proper that the Court of Justice should, very often in the past, and even when the facts of the case were different, have worked on the principle that the issue of which legal basis should be decisive should be decided by reference to the objective of the proposal as a whole. It was therefore perfectly obvious that the Court of Justice should, in this case, decide on the basis of a specific example from environmental law that, here too, it is not possible to take legal acts that in fact belong together and split them up in such a way that certain aspects are taken to refer to a part of the Treaties other than the actual objective that was originally in mind, where this falls under the first pillar. The result, then, comes as no surprise to me. What, though, are the consequences now? In the first place, it does nothing to change the fact that criminal law is treated primarily as a matter for the Member States, for the national level, where Europe has powers only under exceptional circumstances. This being so, I too take the view that the European legislator – who may be able to make use of this instrument, but is not required to use it in a coercive manner – is well-advised, as a matter of principle, to refrain from legislation in matters of criminal law. In every specific situation, decisions must be reached on a case-by-case basis, on the basis of whether or not criminal law provisions are needed in order to achieve this objective, or whether it ought to be left to the Member States to decide these matters and regulate them. Caution, then, needs to be the order of the day for the legislator, whether that be Parliament or the Council, and that above all, I believe – and this is why the Treaties, from the outset, leave criminal law in the hands of the Member States – quite simply because the systems of criminal law in Europe are so very, very different, not only in terms of deciding what is a crime, but also in terms of how that crime should be punished. There are Member States in which the sentence is enforced in full; there are others in which, as a rule, only 50% is paid; others in which it is two-thirds; still others in which the courts order additional penalties of a punitive nature, which, in turn, do not exist in that form in other Member States. I do believe, then, that if Europe starts, where it is not necessary to do so, to lay down standard penalties for all manner of things, then the consequence of that will be unsystematic interventions in the criminal law systems of the Member States, and, since the usefulness of that is a matter of doubt, it is for that reason above all others that we should exercise a degree of self-restraint. I see the report that Mr Gargani has produced, and which has been adopted by the Committee, as putting that into effect, and see that as its essential substance. We are of course in favour of the idea that the Commission should now attempt to analyse, one by one, the proposals that need to be revised on the grounds that their division into two different legal acts no longer corresponds to the law as laid down by the Court of Justice, and should then come up with proposals as to how adjustments can be made. As for the amendments submitted in response to the Committee on Legal Affairs’ resolution, I am able to say, on behalf of my group, that some of these – particularly those tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe – are acceptable, while others are not. Please do not expect me to go into details, for I have agreed this with the rapporteur, but I can say in general terms that there were no fundamental differences within the Committee on Legal Affairs when it came to evaluating these issues. The problems lie more in the nuances, perhaps in the issue of how far one should actually go in individual cases, but otherwise, the committee was in general agreement on this. I thank the House most warmly for its attention.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will start by asking you to reject this motion as inadmissible. The immunity procedure is subject to Rule 7, which has the last word to say on the subject. Rule 7 (8) states that: ‘The report of the committee shall be placed at the head of the agenda of the first sitting following the day on which it was tabled.’ The Rule goes on to say that: ‘The proposal(s) for a decision contained in the report shall be put to the vote at the first voting time following the debate.’ That is a binding rule, the purpose of which is to speed up the immunity procedure, and if this motion were to be permitted, it would be virtually capable of annulling it. If you do not reject this motion as inadmissible, I would nevertheless ask that it be thrown out altogether on the grounds of irrelevance. The reason why it is irrelevant is that the resolution we, in the Committee on Legal Affairs, adopted was adopted unanimously, that this resolution is not a matter of dispute between the groups, and also that there is no doubt about the procedure that Rule 7 (8) lays down to deal with it. If you object to the substance of this motion, then all you have to do is to vote against it. If it then gets majority support, the result is automatically reversed. It therefore makes no sense that this matter be either adjourned or deferred, and so I ask that this motion for a resolution be voted on in the plenary tomorrow.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, further to Rule 168(2) of the Rules of Procedure, I have heard that three of our groups are having problems with this draft resolution, with the consequent risk of there being, on this important matter, which is of course to some degree connected with the debate and with the Members’ Statute, no majority – or at any rate, not a large one – whereas a large one is what we want. I therefore move that this proposal be sent back to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. If that cannot be done or if we cannot agree to it, I move that, as an alternative, the vote be deferred to the next plenary part-session. The first option, then, is to send it back, with, if that does not happen, the next plenary sitting as an alternative.
 Klaus-Heiner Lehne (PPE-DE
),

. – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to talk about three aspects, starting with the issue of simplification. There is no doubt that this House is, as a matter of principle, backing the Commission in its efforts at simplifying the lawmaking process, but I also want to make it clear that here, as in so many other instances, the devil is in the detail, and that we have to be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Let me give you an example. Looking at this document from the Commission, for example, I see that they want to simplify the whole body of commercial and company law; now I know, as one of the Legal Affairs Committee’s permanent rapporteurs on this area, that many of the directives and regulations we have enacted on this were the result of highly complex negotiations and compromises and that there is, in any proposal for simplification, the inherent risk of Pandora’s box being opened and of the compromises arrived at after much effort ending up being once more open to question. That means that simplification is an instrument that must be handled with great care. It is for that reason that I believe that it is very definitely advisable that we should give some thought, when simplifying just as much as when codifying, to the possibility of the three institutions adopting an inter-institutional agreement stating in clear terms how one goes about simplifying laws. A second point to which I should like the Commission to give some thought is the issue of what priorities simplification proposals should set. Directives are customarily addressed to the national legislatures rather than to the public, and the laws with which practitioners have to deal are those enacted at the national level. It follows that the simplification of directives should be no more than a secondary objective. The Commission should give priority to regulations, for the simple reason that regulations are directly applicable as law and have a direct effect on those members of the public who have recourse to law. The second issue has to do with impact assessment. I want once more to ram home the point that most of us in this House regard an independent element in the assessment of laws’ impact as vitally necessary. In a report it produced in December, this House called for an independent agency on the American model. For my part, I want to make it clear that this is not a conditio sine qua non 
for me; it is something we can talk about. What I do regard as indispensable, though, is the participation of an independent external element in the assessment of the impact laws have. It is not acceptable that the officials who make proposals are also and at the same time the ones who are responsible for gauging what impact those proposals will have, for the consequence of that is that the impact assessment ends up being no more and no less than part of the justification for them, and that is not what we want. It is for that reason, then, that I believe we have to hammer out something sensible with the Commission in relation to this issue. An inter-institutional agreement has been in place since December 2003, according to which the Commission is, in principle, responsible for the impact assessment. That also means, though, that it is exercising a responsibility with and on behalf of the legislature, that is to say, for Parliament and the Council, and so we believe that we in this House, too, should have – and do have – a right to be consulted as to how this impact assessment is carried out. I might add that that is also the reason why we, in the Conference of Presidents, initially delayed adopting a resolution on the follow-up administrative agreements, since these, of course, have to be renegotiated, not least in the light of the resolutions that we will be adopting on these four reports in May of this year. I would also like to say something about something that is very definitely a live issue. On 16 March, Advocate-General Sharpston delivered an opinion in the case of Spain versus the Council, in the conclusions to which she refers explicitly to the impact assessment, stating that the absence of any adequate impact assessment is an indication of the legal act having been adopted arbitrarily, and that demonstrates and confirms the Court of Justice’s increasing interest in this issue. Further to what Mr Doorn has had to say on the subject, I think it is crucial that decisions arrived at by way of comitology also need to have their impact assessed. There are a whole load of cases that we could take as examples, where the real bureaucratic madness lay in the comitological decisions rather than in the legislation itself, so, here too, there needs to be proper monitoring of what impact laws have. Last of all, let me turn to the third issue, that of stake holder consultation
, that is to say the process whereby the interested parties are listened to. In preparing legislation, the Commission has come to rely very heavily on Europe-wide organisations and associations. I have nothing against the European lobbying associations, but the processes whereby they arrive at decisions are sometimes more complex than those in the Council of Ministers, and what emerges from them is often consensus compacted into nonsense. I believe we need still other forms of consultative machinery in order to get the information directly from those interested parties who are working at their jobs and therefore have to deal with these issues. So, for example, the consultative machinery we came up with through the network currently engaged in developing European contract law, with which we defined a limited category of person to be consulted, could be a good example of how to improve these mechanisms.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have the impression that this debate has made it clear that the problem at the heart of our discussion here is regulatory impact assessments. In my opinion, it has absolutely nothing to do with democracy being replaced with technocracy. That is not what this is about. It goes without saying that the democratic institutions are still in control. The Commission makes decisions on proposals on its own responsibility, as, of course, do Parliament and the Council. This matter hinges on a vital point, namely that we are changing the procedures governing our support. Currently, the EU makes legislation on the basis of ‘learning by doing’. We decide on something, and something comes out of it in the end that has some effect or other. If we subsequently discover that the effect is undesirable, we have the problem that, thanks to the EU’s complex procedures, we cannot just quickly amend these laws, as national parliaments do, but need a complex procedure lasting many years to revise directives and amend regulations. Thus, different mechanisms are needed from those often existing at national level. We need to know what we are doing. What regulatory impact assessments do is give us support; we are informed of the consequences our actions will have by independent people, too. Even though, ultimately, the political decision remains ours to take, we still need this support. That is quite crucial when the Commission, the Council and Parliament have to take decisions on behalf of 470 million people in such a large economic area. For that reason, too, it is vital to have an independent element. I would appeal quite clearly once more to the Commission to work to ensure the introduction of this independent element within its own structures, too. If it does not, Parliament – if it takes itself seriously – will be forced to conduct its own independent impact assessments in each case. That is contrary to the spirit of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 2003. We should like the Commission to do this on its own initiative, so that we have sound bases for decision.

draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. – (DE) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I represent my honourable colleague Mr López-Istúriz White, who drafted the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs, and I shall make a few comments on that opinion on his behalf and on behalf of my group. I agree with the view of the main rapporteur, Mr Leinen, that the existing statute must certainly be regarded in principle as a total success and that it was entirely right and proper for us to make a clear distinction between party funding and the financing of parliamentary groups. We also owed it to the public to make that amendment. Political parties help to form the will of the people – in the European context, we should say ‘of the peoples’ – and that is why it is essential that the European institutions should establish the prerequisites and create the conditions for the proper functioning of these European parties. In this context, there are four things to which I attach particular importance.  Firstly, it is essential to create a sustainable permanent financial framework that enables parties to obtain long-term funding. The grants that are currently paid to the European parties do not provide an adequate basis for truly sustainable long-term planning of activities. Plans are tied at the present time to calendar years within the electoral term. Changes in party funding can also occur if new parties are created and the volume of funding then has to be adjusted. I am simply saying that the existing provisions do not let parties plan ahead with a sufficient degree of financial security and that, in these circumstances, changes are eminently desirable. Secondly, we must allow European parties to create financial reserves that are not lost from one year to the next. Mr Leinen likewise addressed this subject, which also featured in our deliberations in the Committee on Legal Affairs. His reference to the notorious December rush hit the nail on the head. We want sustainable long-term planning of party funding; we do not want a situation in which, in the run-up to Christmas, so to speak, money is splashed about because of the pressure to ‘use it or lose it’. In this context, it is also worth considering whether the 20% limit for transfers from one budgetary item to another should be rethought with a view to making it more flexible. European parties must have the freedom to respond to changing requirements that might stem, for example, from a crisis in the political arena by restructuring their resources more radically than the present statute permits. Fourthly, against this background I believe that the statute for European political parties should be amended to enable the European parties to act more effectively for the benefit of the entire population and to perform their role as driving forces in the process of political decision-making. At the same time, however, I cannot deny that the parties could do more by their own efforts to achieve this aim of bringing Europe closer to the people and involving its citizens in what is happening here in Europe. I personally do not believe that a European list of candidates, parallel to the national lists, would be a means of solving this problem. Party lists are an abstract concept, and seats are allocated to particular parties, and many people cannot identify with that. What we need is a far more personalised European electoral process, and there is a very simple way of doing that: if at least the two mass parties in Europe could each decide to campaign in the European elections with a chosen leader who would subsequently be their candidate for election as President of the Commission, the elections would become strongly personalised within a fairly short time, and people would identify far more closely with individual candidates and with political statements of intent, which alone could probably lead to a considerable increase in turnout at European elections. I hope that the political parties will have the courage to take this step.

rapporteur. – (DE) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to begin with a somewhat heretical remark. The important reports are discussed in this House shortly before midnight, and the esoteric drivel in the form of resolutions is discussed during the day at prime transmission time. If we are to talk about the question of parliamentary reform – and there is, of course, a proposal to this effect from the President of the House – I would say that, before we deliberate seriously on the curtailment of Members’ rights, we should talk about giving the plenary agenda a more logical structure in which important subjects are given their rightful place. This report is about European civil law. In simple terms, its aim is to have the Commission try to shape broad areas of European civil law by creating a common frame of reference in a particular field of activity in the first instance in such a way that it will affect the legislation of the Member States and of the European Union in the field of civil law for many generations to come. There is even something of a debate on whether the work we are considering here could ultimately lead to a uniform European code of civil law. Although I say that with all due caution, what we have here is nevertheless a truly significant and decisive project. This House has, for many years, been monitoring the efforts of the European Commission with regard to a code of European civil law and has expressed its approval and lent its support in numerous resolutions since 1989. That is also our intention in this proposal for a resolution. We have come to a very critical stage. At the present time, work is under way on the frame of reference and on the revision of the established body of Community law and practice in the realm of consumer protection. The reason why this stage is critical is that the present efforts will determine whether this work is ultimately crowned with success or whether it falls short of the desired outcome, and this depends very much on the quality of the substance that emerges from these present efforts. Parliament therefore takes the view that, although what the Commission has launched is right in principle, it requires improvement in several respects. For example, we have the impression that the cooperation between the research groups that drafting the common frame of reference on contract law and the practitioners on the network side is not functioning properly. We want to ensure that the practical experience brought into this project by the network specialists is considered by the research groups in an appropriate framework. This is something for which we in the Committee on Legal Affairs are pressing vigorously. Another important point is that a distinction must be made between business-to-business and business-to-consumer transactions. We want to protect consumers, but traders must also have broad scope to conclude contracts with each other, and this scope must not be restricted by excessive red tape. There is also a need to ensure that what is currently being developed within this frame of reference and will subsequently form a very considerable body of soft law, at least at the European level, and have an impact on all legislation in the field of civil law is not simply created without any involvement on the part of the legislative institutions, namely Parliament and the Council. It is not enough for Parliament and the Council to deliver their opinions on the drafting procedure; they must also be involved in the development of the substance of this frame of reference, because it will be they who adopt laws enshrining elements of the frame of reference and who must publicly justify the adoption of those laws. Against this background it is important that Parliament is also involved on the substantive side. From our perspective, this should involve two processes. Firstly, the Commission should keep Parliament constantly and comprehensively informed of progress in the formulation of the frame of reference and the improvement of the body of Community law and practice relating to consumer protection, and we should have the opportunity to pronounce ourselves at any time within a continuous process. The second process, for which we have already taken the first organisational steps in this House, is the establishment of a project group comprising the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs of both participating committees, a working party whose purpose would be to keep a close eye on the work of the Commission, the research groups and the network as well as providing political guidance on particular issues of legal policy, such as the issue of the demarcation line between business-to-business and business-to-consumer transactions. From our point of view, these are crucial matters which still require regulation and in which greater parliamentary involvement is both welcome and necessary. These are the key elements of the resolution on the table. Let me finish by saying that I believe this is the most significant project being undertaken by the European Commission and the other institutions in the course of the present legislative term. It is the most significant by far, which is why I would certainly expect us to try and bring it to a successful conclusion. It will also play an important part in determining whether the single European market continues to converge for the benefit of everyone – consumers and traders alike.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by seizing this opportunity to thank my co-rapporteur Mr Goebbels most warmly for the good cooperation in the steering group, in which we succeeded in producing, for the plenary and for the Conference of Presidents, a draft that is the logical continuation of what we came out with last year when the mid-term review was under consideration. As it did then, the House endorses the Commission’s strategy. We have, in particular, again made it clear that our ability to realise the other main objectives of the Lisbon Strategy in the way we want to is conditional upon growth and employment. This House has also played its part in setting priorities, three of which are mentioned in our resolution, namely population change, energy policy and innovation. My only complaint is about something that many speakers have already mentioned. The strategic approach is not our main problem; the strategic approach is the right one. Our problem is what happens at the end. To put it in quite practical and quite blunt terms, what I see as the most negative aspect is what we always see happening when the European Council gets its hands on this issue: it decides on a good and substantially sound strategy, presents it at a press conference, and it ends up being written about. The following day, or perhaps a couple of days later, the finance ministers turn up and take back what the European Council had resolved on. That is a fundamental strategic problem, and I have no idea how we are to get on top of it; it plays a considerable part in fostering the perception held by some members of the European public that European policy is dishonest and to increasing public despair with Europe. What must be spelled out at this summit is that we cannot apply double standards; on the contrary, policy as actually implemented must reflect the strategic guidelines. The last issue I would like to address is that of how the impact of laws is to be assessed – something also mentioned in our resolution. We would like to point out that we expect the impact assessment to include an independent factor, thus ensuring that the result really is neutral. This is part of ‘better lawmaking’, and this demand is addressed to the Commission.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the internal market is being tested; in the field of energy, in particular, it could even be said to be at risk. The promotion of national champions results in national monopolies, which means that there is no competition, and this also means that there is no more competition in the European internal market. This scenario is bad for consumers. European energy enterprises face the additional problem that, if they are not competing in Europe, they will also no longer be internationally competitive in future. That, too, aggravates the situation in Europe. Incidentally, it also aggravates the situation for all other enterprises, as they have to pay the high energy prices and thus also lose out in terms of international competitiveness. Although I explicitly support the efforts of the Commission and, in particular, the Commissioner on this issue, I believe that the Commission’s options are simply limited. The Commission is trying to present instruments of competition law, but the famous two-thirds rule in mergers law almost always applies in the field of energy, in particular – and, as a result, the Commission’s scope for intervention is minimal. I am aware that Commissioner Kroes is considering changing this, but to do so would require unanimity within the Council, and I do not believe that such unanimity will be possible in the present situation. That is why it is vital that the Council, too, concern itself with this problem. Governments can be expected to abide by the spirit as well as the letter of the Treaties and of European law. Ultimately, the fact is that we want to see an internal market in the field of energy enterprises, in particular. That is why I expect the Council to become involved with this issue. I should like to make one comment on takeovers law: newspaper reports in the past few days have alleged that European takeovers law is promoting this development. I consider that inappropriate. Member States can be expected to transpose takeovers law, but this is a case of relations between enterprises; it has nothing to do with the exertion of political influence. The exertion of political influence is not covered by decisions under takeovers law at European level, and should be avoided and prevented. It is vital that this issue be put openly on the table in the Council and that an appeal be made to all those responsible within the Council.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am actually here to represent my colleague Mr Gargani, who, as Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs, is the real draftsman of this question. Nevertheless, it is an honour for me to do so. Before I give detailed reasons for this question, I should like to say a few words about the background. The history of this issue, namely that of liberal professions, in particular legal professions – to whom this question relates – goes back several years. Parliament dealt with this issue in the previous parliamentary term on the basis of two questions for oral answer in the corresponding resolutions, particularly in the light of the activities of the Internal Market and Services Directorate General under Mario Monti, the former Commissioner for competition, and also in view of the study by the Vienna Institute for Advanced Studies that sparked off this whole debate. I do not wish to conceal the fact that the Committee on Legal Affairs actually always held a broad conviction – even across the political spectrum – that this Vienna study took a very biased approach, one biased towards economic aspects, and did not take sufficient account of the specific role of the liberal professions, particularly the legal professions, in administering justice. The Committee also feared – and this was borne out to some extent by the documents – that the Commission had not always drawn the correct conclusions from the documents of the Vienna study and, furthermore, was consciously conducting a policy that we doubted was the right course in the case of some particular issues. After all, liberal professions, with their particular importance, quite simply cannot be compared with the supermarket round the corner in terms of competition policy and competition law. Their origins are different, their importance to the functioning of society is different. Presenting another question for oral answer today, following the latest Commission interim report presented by Commissioner Kroes – an accompanying resolution will follow in the coming week – practically continues the tradition from the previous parliamentary term. I should like to make it crystal clear at this juncture that we, too, are of course well aware that antiquated customs should be dispensed with. We are no longer living in the Middle Ages, and the guild system is a thing of the past. Nonetheless, particular account must of course be taken of the distinguishing features of the liberal professions: in particular the legal professions, which are what interests the Committee on Legal Affairs. These features form part of the judicial system, and have to function. If the system does not function, the public suffers, being afforded insufficient legal protection, and this means that an intrinsic part of democracy, namely the rule of law, is also called into question. That is why the rules for the liberal professions have to be scrutinised very carefully and in great detail, and why we have to consider carefully what is needed in order to afford legal protection and access to justice for all citizens that is as effective and safe as possible, including in practice. Naturally, this should be done with particular regard to the case law of the European Court of Justice. I should now like to turn to a specific problem which has, of course, also been addressed in conjunction with this question, and which was one of the reasons that the Committee on Legal Affairs wanted a further debate on this issue today in plenary. That problem is the specific role of tariffs in the liberal legal professions, since, in many EU Member States, these have a special nature and importance, especially in connection with the rules for reimbursement of legal expenses, and also in situations in which companies providing legal-expenses insurance wish to make reimbursements themselves on behalf of their clients. Such things are virtually impossible without tariffs, and are also deeply rooted in the legal traditions of many Member States. As such, they should not be called into question without good cause, because they also represent a fundamental aspect of consumer protection. This should be made quite clear at this juncture. The case law of the European Court of Justice has taken great care when dealing with such issues in the past. Just recently – a few weeks ago – we saw a specific instance in which the Advocate General, too, attempted to show due care in such issues. It is very important to us that the Commission cease dealing with this fundamental issue – which is extremely important to the functioning of the legal professions in many Member States – in this way, as the Commission’s documents would suggest. The Commission cannot treat the liberal professions in the same way as it does supermarkets. These professions have a special importance and role. Some EU Member States have now abolished tariffs and, interestingly, this has meant an increase in prices for lawyers and consumers, for example – in some cases they are considerably higher, on average, than those in Member States who still have such a system. Particularly with regard to the price trend, this system has ensured that legal protection for consumers continues to be accessible and financially sustainable. We would now welcome a reply to our oral question from Commissioner Kroes, who has already had the opportunity to discuss this issue with us in committee, on behalf of the Commission. We shall then have the opportunity to respond to it, both in the context of the debate and, in the coming week, in the context of the resolution.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to explain what Mr Geremek has said. The very simple reason behind it is that the Cypriot constitution includes a provision on the suspension of the immunity of members of the national parliament that is not to be found in the constitutions of other Member States. In Cyprus, it is not the parliament that rules on suspension, but the Supreme Court. As Mr Matsakis is a Member of the European Parliament, though, it is clear that, in accordance with the protocol on privileges and immunities, it is of course not the Supreme Court of Cyprus that is competent to rule on his suspension, but this plenary, that is to say, those who are assembled here today. It was for this reason that the Committee on Legal Affairs, saving only one vote to the contrary, took the view that the proposal should be put to the House in its present form. I ask you to endorse it.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, while I am obliged to the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs, I particularly wish to put the spotlight on our own group’s shadow rapporteur, Mrs Kauppi, who has endeavoured in a quite splendid fashion to hammer out sensible compromises and reach a sound solution, thereby demonstrating expertise to an extraordinary degree. The work she has done on this leads me to hold her in the highest regard. Let me once again spell out something that became apparent from the debate in the Committee on Legal Affairs: nobody, that is no political group, wants software patents, although I cannot exclude the possibility of private individuals doing so. That, in any case, is not what this directive is about; it was in fact intended to prevent the law developing in Europe in the way it has in the USA. That is its purpose, a purpose that the Common Position fulfils. At the end of May, we received a position paper from the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Munich and Upper Bavaria. Rather like the Irish situation that Mr Crowley described earlier, the greatest concentration of small and medium-sized software developers in Germany is to be found in this area around Munich. They organised a hearing, the result of which left no doubt about the fact that they believe that the Common Position – capable of improvement though it is, of course – meets the conditions laid down and resolves the problems. In the Committee on Legal Affairs, we made a whole array of vital improvements to the Rocard report by way of 39 amendments, making some things clearer – such concepts as ‘interoperability’ and ‘technical definition’, for example – and creating options. What the Committee on Legal Affairs has produced, then, is a report characterised by moderation and making it possible to resolve any problems that still remain. Mr Rocard’s amendments, and those put forward by the other groups in this House go well beyond what is intended. A few months ago, we sat down together here and renewed our commitment to the Lisbon Process, at the heart of which – among other things – is a knowledge-based society in Europe. Having no raw materials, we have to rely on our brains, our knowledge, and the skills of our people. If we were to allow a situation, brought about by excessive amendments, in which most of Europe’s high-technology could no longer be patented, we would be jeopardising the means for future generations in this continent to earn a living, and so this position is indefensible and the overwhelming majority of my group will not countenance it. Let me touch on one other point, and a significant one, that being the issue of what people are calling motions to reject the Common Position. This is an option that our group will, this evening, have to consider, and two factors make it worth our while to do so. The first is that we gain nothing if, as a result of the Committee on Legal Affairs’ amendments, we have to endure a long conciliation procedure, only to see the directive lost at third reading by simple majority. Secondly, we do not want to end up with a directive that is so warped by Parliament’s amendments that it ends up being detrimental to the Lisbon process and to Europe itself. If that is what it is going to be like, then we would rather not have the directive at all. This issue, then, is one on which our group will be reaching a decision this evening.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say, first of all, how very grateful I am to Mrs Wallis for her report. Having said that, though, please permit me to say something quite fundamental. The Committee on Legal Affairs discusses immunity issues in camera
. As a rule, these are highly sensitive matters concerning individual Members personally. As I think it would be wise for this House to dispense with public debates on these immunity issues, I shall say nothing about the substance of this case, but will limit myself to stating that my group endorses the position taken by the rapporteur in her report. At the same time, I will point out that the same applies in the case of Mr Marchiani, on which Mr Speroni is the rapporteur, which we will be dealing with next; I am aware that, by doing so, I am contravening this House’s Rules of Procedure and so you are welcome to strike my intervention from the record. I would also ask that this debate be conducted briskly and with dispatch, as Mr Trichet has already been waiting here for over an hour, and we do, I think, have more important things to do than going on in public about Members’ private affairs.

deputising for the author
. – (DE) 
Mr President, Mr Gargani, for whom I am deputising, sends his apologies. He had to return to Italy on urgent family business. However, as we are very pressed here today, I shall not talk to you for eight minutes. I do not consider that this issue requires it. Allow me therefore to say a few words on the purpose of this issue. A few months ago, we sat together under the coordinators of the Committee on Legal Affairs and decided that, as we are having problems – and I use the word advisedly – with a whole series of proposals for legislation in the field of intellectual property rights, it might perhaps make perfect sense if Parliament as a whole were to address this question once more and take this opportunity to discuss this once again with the Commission and – at a later date perhaps – with the Council. There is no doubt whatever as to the crucial importance to the European economy of our introducing a permanent single patent in Europe. I recall our resolution on the Lisbon process. I recall the resolutions which we adopted on this and initiatives in previous years. We here always took the view – almost right across the political divide – that the European patent had a particular worth and is of crucial importance, including within the framework of the Lisbon process, if we are to be able to guarantee the competitiveness of the European economy with the economies of other regions of the world. However, I will not conceal the fact that some of us – and I in particular – were very concerned at developments in the Council. We know that the Council is considering creating a patent which must be translated into all the official languages of the European Union; however, this is as yet unfeasible because unanimity is required and the consent of all the Member States has not been forthcoming. Such a patent would be extremely expensive. It would not be competitive, nor – if it came about – could it ever be converted back into a normal, proper patent. Everyone knows that English is the language that matters and plays an absolutely dominant role in technology and in the granting of patents and that translations into other languages are basically superfluous, achieve nothing and just cost money. Once such a language regime has been created, there will be no getting away from it. That is the experience in the European Union and that is also the consequence of how legislation is usually passed here on such issues. Against this background, I am very concerned as to whether we can and will ultimately get a patent that really can meet the specifications that we have set, including within the framework of the Lisbon process. In addition, there is the fact that such an expensive patent would ultimately discriminate against medium-sized businesses, because the few large companies which exist – and they will be not only European but also, above all, non-European companies – will register their patents throughout the Community under this new European patent, while small and medium-sized enterprises – and they account for 70% or more of all patent holders – will be unable to do so because of the costs involved and will have to rely on small, inferior, national patents and regulations under the European Patent Convention. This second-class society in patent legislation cannot be what we want in the European Union. Given the de facto 
blockade in the Council and the risk that, if this blockade is lifted, an inferior patent, an inferior patent regulation will emerge, the question which arises is this: what does the Commission – which has the right of initiative and the monopoly on initiatives – propose in the way of possible new initiatives to kickstart this again and perhaps still attain the noble objective of the Lisbon resolutions up to the point at which we have a European patent. The second issue which concerns us and which played a considerable role in the report at the time by a 'green' colleague, Mrs Mercedes Echerer from Austria, is the question of collecting societies. We in the Committee on Legal Affairs addressed collecting societies on various occasions in the previous legislative period, both within the framework of directives in which they played a role, and in the Echerer own initiative report. We came more or less unanimously to the conclusion that it is necessary, when acknowledging the role of collecting societies, both in the decision-making processes of these companies and in fee structures, to achieve an adequate degree of transparency both for the benefit of users and in the interests of the holders of the intellectual property rights. We know that the Commission is considering this and has already carried out or is already carrying out a follow-up assessment with a view – and this was also announced in the Commission's legislative programme – to submitting a specific proposal for legislation during the course of this year. However, I now hear from the Commission that the question of whether there should be a recommendation or whether a directive is needed is still open. I would welcome information from the Commission as to what is happening. We know full well that the 'market' at issue here is not of the same order of size as in other cases, but it is nonetheless of importance to the development of the European single market that we clarify this question, ensure there is reasonable transparency in this sector and perhaps also take initiatives in order to facilitate the cross-border use of copyrights. There are at last thoughts and activities in this direction also. We would be interested in hearing what the Commission intends to do about this.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we can justifiably describe the text of the resolution before the House as balanced and as containing everything relevant to the Lisbon strategy. It also gives real impetus to the strategy’s revival. All three of its elements – growth and the labour market, welfare policy and the environment – have been addressed in a proper context, and my group has been particularly keen to stress the importance of making a clear connection between these two pillars. A proper environment and social policy is possible only if there is economic growth and a functioning labour market; there is a close and practical connection between the two, for the success of the one as a policy is conditional upon the other, and that this resolution makes this clear is crucially important. As the short time available to me prevents me from discussing all three of these points, there is one aspect to which I would like to give particular attention, and I regard it as being of fundamental importance. I refer to the implementation of the interinstitutional agreement of December 2003 on better lawmaking, which – as I have been observing for a year now – is not operating adequately. It is particularly unsatisfactory when it comes to scrutinising the impact of laws and to involving interested parties in the production of drafts within the Commission. One reason why we have had to have the debates we have had on, for example, the services directive and REACH is that the impact of legislation has been assessed either inadequately or not at all, and that the interested parties were not sufficiently involved in the process whereby they came into being. This is, I think, one of the priorities that this resolution addresses, and it is something that must change. Let me conclude with a couple of observations on the role played by the other groups in this House. I am grateful to the Socialist Group in the European Parliament for following the Liberals in now deciding to support this draft. They were not quite willing to do that in the Steering Group, but I am glad they have now decided to do so, for it needs a broad majority. It is vitally important that the Lisbon process should be supported by all. I do have something of a problem with the attitude of the Greens, who met separately in Luxembourg and decided to oppose it without even waiting for the result of the Steering Group’s deliberations. Surely, this is rather peculiar; perhaps the Greens should re-read the text and think about whether it might after all be better to vote in favour of it, or else they will find it difficult to explain their opposition.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like – with the agreement of my co-rapporteur, Mr Désir – to put an oral amendment that we think covers the topic better. Perhaps I shall just read it out, in English: after ‘demographic situation’ it reads:  ‘calls on the Commission and the Member States to develop the necessary comprehensive measures in order to support complementary financing
 schemes, as a way of supplementing existing national pension systems’.  (DE)
 What is new is the use of the term ‘complementary financing’.
 I ask the House to accept this oral amendment, which has been agreed by both the rapporteurs.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to begin with a brief comment on the political content of the speeches we have heard today, particularly that by Mr Schulz. I believe – and our current debate on the Lisbon strategy bears this out – that the Lisbon strategy has several pillars. There is absolutely no doubt that all the pillars are, in principle, equally important components of the strategy. On the other hand, it is a truism that proper social and environmental policies cannot be pursued without a functioning economy. The economy is, as it were, the key to the realisation of all our other good political intentions. Priorities must therefore be set accordingly, although the pillar structure must not be forgotten. I should perhaps mention in passing that there is no better social policy than the creation of jobs. That may be another truism, but it still needs to be said. Another gentle reminder might be in order, because the President of the Commission is constantly being taken to task over this matter. Both of the competent Vice-Presidents of the European Commission – the one who signed the paper in Lisbon and the one who signed the programme we are discussing today – are Socialists. It is perhaps appropriate to reiterate that in passing. This should mean that the dossier is in the best hands within the Commission, and I fail to see the point of forever dredging up this discussion on alleged differences that do not even exist. I also have a particular appeal to make in this matter, which is that the Commission must attach high priority in the framework of this legislative programme, as in other areas, to the implementation of its interinstitutional agreement with the Council and Parliament. This is vitally important. Among the reasons why things have not worked as well as they should in the past have been the lack of impact assessments of legislative proposals and the inadequate way in which the consultation of stakeholders has been conducted. I urge the President and Vice-President of the Commission, particularly in the course of their work over the coming months, to ensure that the interinstitutional agreement is consistently implemented in this context. In many areas, this will be the key to the success to which they and all of us aspire. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, I would like to say a few words on behalf of the legal policy experts in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. I want to sum them up under four headings. I am glad to see that your programme includes better regulation 
and impact assessment, which could be summed up as the business of estimating the cost of compliance with laws. I would like to make it quite clear that our Committee attaches particular importance to the text of this agreement being taken seriously and to you not merely signing affirmations, like the one your predecessor signed in December 2003. That means that proper consultation processes have to be gone through, and there also – quite crucially – has to be sufficient transparency and, in contrast to what has often, unfortunately, happened with Commission proposals, a real impact assessment rather than one that can be said to do no more than help to justify the proposal. We have our own expectations in this respect and are addressing them to the new Commission. Although I am glad you have addressed a number of aspects of the Company Law Action Plan that had already been put forward by the former Commission, I want to draw attention to two that we regard as important. One is the need for a proposal on the right to choose between the single-tier and two-tier systems of company law, and the second is that the ‘one share, one vote’ principle – which was the subject of very in-depth discussion during the previous legislative period – must be accepted. Turning to intellectual property rights, we welcome the Commission’s intention to present a proposal on the regulation of rights management societies. At the same time, though, we ask it to examine the rightness or otherwise of its strategy to date in relation to the European patent, with a view to finding out whether there is the danger, in view of the current state of discussions in the Council, of what comes out at the other end being a monstrosity that small and medium-sized businesses cannot afford. Perhaps we should wait for the Constitution and then produce a new proposal on a new legal basis and with new majorities, out of which something decent will emerge. Last but not least comes something of which I ask you not to lose sight. I believe that the most important proposal for the making of ‘soft law’ in the term of this Parliament will be the harmonisation of civil law. Groups of professors are currently working on a frame of reference for this, which will shape European civil law for over a century to come. I would ask you, Mr President of the Commission, to bear that, too, in mind.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Legal Affairs, too, is one of those with small demands to make on the Budget, for our share in it, on the management of which we are consulted, is probably in the order of a few thousandths of the whole. The point to which I want to draw attention is extraordinarily significant, quite simply because it is the only one, and it is that the Legal Affairs Committee’s remit includes the European Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance. The public often complain that proceedings in them often take a very long time and that decisions are taken only at a very late stage in them; this often happens when they deal with matters of great public importance. Let me make it quite clear that the reason for this is not to be found with the judges but elsewhere, namely in the inadequate capacity for translating documentation and forms. If we were, by means of this Budget, to succeed in making an appropriate contribution to adapting the ECJ’s equipment to current circumstances and requirements, that would be a great triumph, and one that would benefit the many members of the European public who have recourse to the law to resolve their disputes. Finally, there is no doubt that the ECJ plays an outstanding part in the further development and integration of Europe, and so I think it appropriate that it should be properly equipped to enable it to do justice to its task. If this Budget helps to do this, we in the Legal Affairs Committee will be content, for then an essential objective will have been achieved. Even if not everything can be completed this year, it will be a step in the right direction if there is continuous development towards this end. That concludes my statement on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee.

Madam President, three brief points are important in my eyes. Firstly, we have achieved a sound consensus on the need to subject all financial institutions, without exception, to regulation in future. The Commission is now able, little by little, to put forward proposals encompassing all actors – which is absolutely essential. Secondly, we should consider how to develop the European financial supervisory authorities thus necessitated and bring them under our control, and to significantly reduce our dependence – be it official or unofficial – on the regulatory institutions of the United States, since we know these to have been a spectacular failure. My third point is that I am concerned about financial developments in the euro area as a whole, as the spreads and indebtedness between the various countries of the euro area and the credit rating activities of these countries are growing apart rather than together. We should take every possible measure in this regard, and should require the individual countries to enforce discipline. My final point is that we need to ensure that the EU does not end up falling into debt. The EU Member States are deep enough in debt as it is. We do not need any more indebted institutions.

 I wish to give the following explanation of vote on behalf of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU) MEPs from Baden-Württemberg. We voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation despite having strong reservations. On the one hand, it is right to urge the automobile industry to make CO2
 reductions, which is why we voted in favour of the proposal. On the other, we wish to take this opportunity to make our reservations clear, which are illustrated by three points: 1. The proposed means for achieving the reductions do not make equal demands on all European manufacturers, but particularly affect manufacturers of large vehicles who are also innovators. This hits German manufacturers harder than other manufacturers in the EU. 2. There has still been no impact assessment. The first draft, which laid down an 80% (as opposed to the present 60%) slope for the limit-value curve, has been withdrawn. 3. The fines have been laid down arbitrarily, particularly in phase 4. This will lead to two different price levels for CO2
: the market price used on the stock market and a price laid down arbitrarily for the automobile industry.
 Kurt Joachim Lauk  (PPE-DE

 Madam President, first of all, we would observe that the markets in Europe that have been less subject to collapse have a clear regulatory environment in respect of legislation on the taxation of CO2
 and a clear regulatory environment in respect of what is expected of car makers. Mr Jouyet, if your Presidency were to succeed in obliging the Member States to create clear regulatory environments as quickly as possible, even the consumer would regain confidence. That would be the best possible aid for the motor industry. There is something else we should do. We should not, at this point, be talking about subsidies amounting to billions whilst, at the same time, threatening the motor industry with fines amounting to billions if targets are not met. That makes no sense. It provides a massive amount of uncertainty and makes vehicles more expensive for consumers. We need to proceed differently, put a vision in place and announce that, by the end of the 2020s, 20, 25 or 30% of cars should be emission-free. That would spark innovation and bring it to the fore, whilst also providing clarity to consumers about the future strategy of the motor industry in Europe.

 Mr President, I would like to make just two comments. Firstly, the euro has passed the test. Without the euro, in this financial crisis we would probably not have been spared speculation that would have gone against entire national economies in Europe. In that sense, then, the euro has passed the test. We would probably be facing serious difficulties – if not an absolute shambles – in Europe if we had not had the euro in this crisis. In my view, two things will be absolutely crucial in future. The euro can only remain stable and make progress against the dollar as a global reserve currency if two things are guaranteed: firstly, the ECB, which has proven itself in the crisis, must remain independent – as has already been argued – and, secondly, the Stability and Growth Pact must be expanded on. It is already extremely useful in its current form, but it also needs to be applied and protected.

 Madam President, the Rasmussen report is entitled ‘hedge funds and private equity’. If we look at the content of this report more closely, it has virtually nothing to do with hedge funds and private equity any more, but now rightly refers to the financial institutions and financial players as a whole. This is important. We have proposed a list of items for regulating the financial markets and eliminating the chaos in these markets. I am pleased that Mr Rasmussen largely adopted our position in the negotiations with us.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report was originally aimed at hedge funds and private equity, but now covers the entire financial system, which has completely collapsed. The present crisis is the hideous aftermath of a credit mania, specifically of the excessive expansion of debt. The Federal Reserve kept interest rates too low for too long and thereby essentially provided a credit subsidy. We have drawn up the report on the basis of the current situation and together with our fellow Members from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, we have reached an agreement with Mr Rasmussen, which encompasses the entire financial system. We are grateful that this has gone through virtually unanimously in the Committee on Economic Affairs. We can no longer rely on US standards and the setting of standards in the international financial system. We must create our own new, European options and we have proposed adopting a whole range of items and ending discussions on them. As a start we must include all the financial institutions working with leverage in the particular risk assessment. We then say that in the global financial system, risk-adjusted capital requirement must have the same status for all players. We should also be stipulating requirements for promoters of packages and syndicating packages, whereby they retain a chunk beyond these packages. The rating agencies – Mr Rasmussen and Mr Lehne have already pointed this out – must close the gaps in information and disclose conflicts of interest. We should consider whether or not we get the rating agencies to assume liability for their rating along the lines of the financial auditors. We must then also consider whether or not derivatives should be traded compulsorily on the Stock Exchange – possibly with the exception of interest rate swaps. We are also asking that the banks’ governing boards ensure that bankers’ bonuses take account not only of good performances, but also of any losses that may eventually occur. This therefore means that incentives for bankers apply in the good and the bad times and not just in the good times. Greed was and is a bad advisor on financial strategies. In recent years we in the ECB have had a reliable partner, who all in all has reacted grosso modo
 in a rather more reasonable and balanced manner than the Federal Reserve. This we can say with hindsight. In the euro area we are also in urgent need of European banking supervision for the euro area because we cannot carry on living with national supervision alone. This means that all in all we are assuming that institutions, or even voluntary associations, are being set up in Europe so that the subjects we are addressing can be better understood in order to prevent the next crisis of this magnitude.

 Mr President, first of all, may I comment on Mr Florenz’s report which, in my view, has summed up the current scientific consensus very well. Nonetheless, I voted against the report. The climate is an important issue, and I agree that we must take action here. However, the scientific consensus is only a provisional consensus, just as every scientific consensus of the past hundred years was short term in nature. In every case, we move on from them. The report before us does not offer us enough opportunities here. What is more, the specific measures outlined are one-sided. We must ensure that Europe does not forfeit any of its economic capacities. Europe cannot save the world on its own. Other countries need to be involved as a matter of urgency in addressing this global problem. That is the only way to implement the scientific consensus. We cannot bear this burden on our own. Against this background, what I feel is lacking in the report is the catalogue of measures which are required to mitigate climate change. We probably cannot stop it altogether. That being the case, I believe that measures that will permanently alter our industrial structures cannot be adopted on the basis of what is only a provisional scientific consensus.

Madam President, I voted against the Davies report because, as a result of the amendments adopted, we are still a long way from the optimum situation, which is to protect the environment, on the one hand, but also promote employment in Europe and not burden the consumer unduly with excessively high prices. In essence, the decisions that we have taken are at the expense of employment and the consumer. In technical terms, we have moved away from the integrated approach which would have been essential to create a situation in which everyone contributes to cutting CO2
 emissions, not only the car manufacturers but also the manufacturers of other vehicle components. We have abandoned that route. What is more, we have not included weight and we have not completed weight segmentation, which is important for European competitiveness, because it is the higher-weight vehicles that are at the forefront of innovation, the innovation that Europe needs. We have set timeframes which are difficult or expensive to achieve and we have taken the absurd step of not heeding the call for CO2
-based taxes in the Member States, which means that the old vehicles which pump out CO2
 are still on the market and on the road. That is why I have voted against the report.

 Mr President, it is a good thing that REACH takes, as its primary purpose, the protection of human life, of jobs and of the environment, but the way in which the protection of people and their environment is organised will have adverse effects on Europe, resulting in a massive build-up of bureaucracy, several thousand pages worth of superfluous regulations, and, in the long term, the relocation of jobs and a consequent reduction in the active workforce. I do not see this as something that we, in Europe, should be voting for. Less employment and more bureaucracy make for the sort of Europe that we do not want. The decision was made difficult by the fact that the Compromise 191 with which we were presented was preferable to the alternative that was already on the table, and, that being so, I have neither voted to adopt this poor compromise nor opted for outright rejection. It is for that reason that I have abstained from voting.
 Kurt Joachim Lauk,

 Mr President, allow me to begin by saying that – as can be seen from the report – we generally endorse what the European Central Bank has done over the past year. It is particularly important that the independence of the ECB has been, and remains, secure. It has proven to be the case that the Bank’s moderate interest rates policy has contributed to the invigoration of the economy, even though that same policy has very often been criticised in recent years. That being the case, we believe that it would be absolutely right to raise the current level of interest rates, which is very low in historical terms, a little, if the situation so requires it, in order to control inflationary trends. We also welcome the ECB’s comments with regard to the necessary structural reforms in the Member States that it is constantly calling for. It is quite right to do this, as inflation would hit those on middle and lower incomes particularly hard. Higher inflation would make these people poorer. We are opposed to that. We also welcome the clear statement by the President of the ECB in relation to the development of European stock exchanges. It is imperative that we ensure that European stock exchanges are consolidated within Europe and are not simply taken over from abroad – from the US, for example. That is the only way that we can prevent the US Securities and Exchange Commission regulations and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act being implemented in Europe via the back door. We have sound and transparent market regulations in Europe that are suited to our European situation, and they should not be undermined. As regards the report, we have resolutely advocated that the ECB does not become politicised. We, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, are thus very clear in our rejection of the publication of ECB voting results. Doing so would lead to politicisation, because voting results would then be discussed. We are also opposed to a publicly debated nomination process, as qualified candidates would be discussed to death. We thus do not feel that we can support these two elements, as they would mean politicisation of the ECB. We would, on the other hand, like to point out that, if the ECB becomes a market operator in the areas of settlement and the clearing of payments and instalments within the framework of TARGET 2, it must also subject itself to appropriate corporate governance. Corporate governance of this nature still has to be developed. The independence of the ECB will then be ensured and that will result in a stable economic policy that will call for structural reforms in Europe.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I am convinced that you will get a majority in this House to back a ports directive for Europe if the directive you put before us is well thought-out and really does promote transparency and competitiveness in Europe in this area. This directive, though, is not suited to that task and so I suggest that you withdraw it. You must have realised, in the course of this debate, what agreement, across the party boundaries, you have prompted in this House on this subject. You must surely realise that this draft directive, lacking as it does sufficient underpinning, is ill-prepared for debate. Even though Mr Jarzembowski has done a splendid job, there is little chance of this House improving a bad directive when one is put before it. The Commission also needs to get used to the idea that this House cannot be used as a repair workshop for bad directives. What makes this draft directive scarcely fit for consideration is the fact that important aspects of it are unclear; its definition of markets certainly is. Is it meant to mean competition within ports, among the ports themselves or something that involves both the ports and the traffic that they share in their hinterland? No impact assessment has been carried out, nor is it at all clear what benefit the consumer is supposed to derive from all this. More competition ought, by rights, to reduce handling costs, yet, from what we know, handling costs in Europe are less than half what they are in Singapore or Dubai anyway, which adds up to a good deal lower. The intention is that they should stay that way, yet this proposal opens the door to the possibility of their being increased. Will this directive really get more service providers into ports? I ask you to reconsider it, to withdraw it and put a better one before us. If it is thought through properly, you will get a majority for transparency and competition in Europe.

 On Thursday 17 November 2005, the plenary in Strasbourg will be voting on Guido Sacconi’s report, ‘REACH: establishing a European Chemicals Agency – Persistent Organic Pollutants’ (A6-0315/2005
). It is my firm conviction that, although the fundamental objective of this Regulation is to be welcomed, its implementation will be faulty and will eventually handicap the EU in competing on global markets. The fact is that it piles excessive rules and regulations upon businesses – whether they be large, medium-sized or small. It follows that the Regulation is inimical to growth and employment and makes Europe much less attractive as a place for the chemical industry to do business. In the final vote, then, I shall be voting against the report. I believe that we should send the proposal – in the form in which it stands before us now – back to the Commission from which it originated.

 Mr President, I would like to make a number of comments on the European Central Bank’s annual report. Perhaps I might begin with the general observation that the report is agreeably presented and is worth reading. What is particularly pleasing is that various sections are clearly distinguished from each other, and that complex financial matters are discussed in readily accessible language. This makes it possible for the subject matter to reach a wider audience. If I may turn to the substance of the report, I will start by saying – and I am glad that the President of the ECB is here to hear me say this – that the Bank has, overall, acted throughout a difficult year with a great deal of acumen. In the first half of the year, there was evidence of slight growth, with inflation expected in the medium and longer term, whilst the opposite happened in the second six months. Mid-year, the ECB was generally successful in resisting the temptation to raise interest rates, opting instead to keep them stable. Last year was not only a year in which we experienced price stability, but also one of ten in which the global economy grew by an average of 3.7%. The only sad thing is that Europe has cut itself off from this growth. As the ECB itself points out, poor economic growth is not least the result of the Member States’ failure to make the structural reforms that are necessary, and cannot therefore be blamed on the ECB, which, contrariwise, points out that the Member States need to shoulder more responsibility in this respect. This makes it very important to note that the ECB has in fact delivered itself of a number of brief but clear and notable statements on the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact. While the debate on this subject is at an end, and we do not have to have a re-run of it today, we should be clear in our own minds about the consequences. As a result of the new agreement, the criteria have lost their rigour, and this weakens the ECB. As a result of responsibility for stability having been returned to the Member States, its job has become more difficult in three areas in particular: it has become immensely more difficult to maintain discipline in the Member States, firstly as regards the size of the national budgets, secondly in terms of the way in which the state’s functions and outgoings are structured, and, thirdly, as regards the structure of tax revenue. What that means is that the greater laxity with which the Stability and Growth Pact is applied has enabled the Member States to achieve a de facto
 renationalisation of responsibility and hence, in fact, to make it more difficult for the Bank to do its job. The ECB advocates the use of the preventive mechanism. It is very much an indictment of the Member States that they were unable, in good times, to strengthen the preventive mechanism; that is now a matter of necessity. While the Bank is in favour of this, it also warns against the corrective aspect of the Pact being weakened. It is for that reason that we have to consider the issue of enlargement. The ECB guaranteed that the integration of the ten new Member States would proceed without a hitch. Estonia, Lithuania and Slovenia have been part of the European exchange rate mechanism since 28 June 2004, and were joined on 2 May 2005 by Latvia, Malta and Cyprus. One explicit demand that we make of the ECB is that, reform of the Stability and Growth Pact notwithstanding, the Maastricht criteria should continue to apply unchanged when countries join the single currency in future, and that there be no laxity in insisting on them. When countries join the single currency in future, the situation that we had with Greece and its statistics must be avoided. Our final request of the ECB is that its information policy, which is generally good, be further improved, for there is room for improvement. We welcome the publication of statistical information and the increased regularity with which it appears. Dialogue with the Bank is good, although one might well admit in private that there is plenty of room for improvement and that it could happen on a more regular basis. We do, however, urge the Bank to follow the US Federal Reserve’s example and publish something along the lines of its Beige Book 
in future. Let me conclude by saying that last year saw the ECB taking a great stride towards the clearing of payments and the settlement of securities. The Target II system is up and running, facilitating automated real-time high-speed fund transfers across Europe, and hence opening up the way to universal real-time settlement in the Central Bank’s currency. This would in turn open up the possibility of a single system in Europe rather than a patchwork. The ECB has shown boldness in taking the necessary steps to this end. This report is complete in itself, and so I ask that it be adopted as it stands and the amendments that have been submitted rejected.

 I reaffirm my belief that Bulgaria and Romania should become members of the EU. Before this takes place, though, they must meet certain criteria, which must continue to apply. The Council has refused to adjust the Financial Perspective, even though the Interinstitutional Agreement requires this to be done in the event of enlargement. I regard this as an unacceptable encroachment upon Parliament’s budgetary rights. The Commission’s latest progress reports confirm that both countries have a great deal of ground to cover before they meet the accession criteria, in particular with regard to the fight against corruption and the establishment of a judiciary operating under the rule of law. It is for this reason that I particularly welcome the efforts undertaken by the new Romanian Government, which is resolutely pushing ahead with reforms in order to overcome the delays caused by its predecessor. It would be premature to take a decision on the matter at this time, in view of the fact that both countries are still a remarkably long way from meeting the accession criteria, as well as of the collapse of the trilogue on adjustments to the Financial Perspective. In my opinion, it would have been more appropriate to delay the decision on accession until the Commission has presented its next progress report. The fact that we are still 20 months away from the envisaged date of accession would have been further justification for such a delay. I regret that we do not feel able to vote in favour of accession at this time.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Central Bank’s annual report for 2003 is in a new format, one that is clearer and easier to understand, with more details and greater transparency, including on the critical aspects of current policy. The report thus makes the ECB’s policies more accessible to the readers, that is, the public, so we see the ECB as having done a good job of work with the whole thing. Mr Lipietz’s original report contains some criticisms of the ECB, and with these we do not agree. Let me begin with interest rate policy, one general criticism of which we regard as misplaced. We know that interest rate policy is a balancing act, but, as whole, 2003 saw the ECB continuing to do a good job of keeping things on an even keel; the economy is growing, the euro is stable, and interest rates are low in real terms. There is a second criticism that we do not endorse, in that we take the view that the ECB’s responsibilities are clearly and well set out, these being, primarily, price stability and moderate rates of inflation. When those are in place, the important conditions for economic growth and employment are created, and, although that is of course not enough, we should not make the ECB responsible for full employment or economic growth; to do so would be to lay far too great a burden on it. These matters are for the national governments to deal with. Mr Trichet pointed out that this is where Budget policy is important, and the national governments have failed to discharge their responsibilities in this respect. We cannot correct that by overburdening the ECB. We also share the view, expressed by Mr Trichet, that the votes of individual members of the Governing Council should not be published. To do so would politicise the ECB, and would do Europe’s present economic development no good. When we have made a success of putting the Lisbon agenda into practice, then the position will be a different one, and we will be able to discuss the subject again. While we are in favour of the ECB doing as the Federal Reserve does and publishing a Grey Book every year, we also would like to see the publication, at the due time, of summary minutes without individual votes; the matter should then be left there. To sum up, we should allow the ECB the freedom to act in the manner laid down in the Maastricht Treaty on European Union. The Lipietz report was successfully rewritten by the adoption, in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, of the amendments tabled on these points, and so we still wonder why the rapporteur has not dissociated himself from it. We regard the report, as it stands, as balanced and good, and in this form we endorse it. We do not believe that it needs to be amended.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, many Members have raised the subject of participation. I do not wish to go more deeply into this now, but I do want to point out in this connection that our Member States’ company law also has the function of defending the interests of public policy, such as creditor protection, security of the legal system and consumer protection, a function that is safeguarded in the Member States by administration of preventive justice, for example by means of form and register provisions. There are major differences between Member States in this regard. The decisions of the Committee on Legal Affairs take account of this in many places – which is to be warmly welcomed – by leaving Member States’ options open. Ultimately, however, these things are counteracted, or at least can be counteracted, unless we do something about the fact that the registered office and the actual seat – that is, the actual place of business of the company – are allowed to differ, as this ultimately renders these safeguards meaningless. The company can locate its registered office practically at will, and thus evade the requirements of the country where it really does business. In my opinion, Member States thereby de facto
 – although not de jure
 – lose a great deal of sovereignty over their company law and its regulatory function, as these can be invalidated. I wish to add that this will – or rather could – also jeopardise the reputation of the European private company, at least in the Member States with stricter requirements of their own. One could suggest that we wait and see what happens and then make the necessary adjustments, and I would agree with them if this development were not reinforced by the procedures and the unanimity. That is my greatest concern. There is no reason for this course of action. The case-law of the European Court of Justice is only a stopgap measure because we do not have a directive on the transfer of company seats; but, in the form currently envisaged, this European private company would basically reinforce this disintegration – enshrining it in Community law once and for all. For this reason, I would ask the Council to reconsider this issue very carefully.

Madam President, as we have now been debating this guideline in the institutions for six years, I would therefore like to make a few comments. Firstly, I would say that this should not be taken as a criticism, but this lengthy period shows how European legislators have dealt very earnestly with this complicated subject and how close consumer protection lies to our hearts in Europe. I am confident that the legislative procedure will be finalised with today’s vote, which is also my intention, despite all the differences on the subject at various points. I want to expressly put on record that in my view all the joint amendments now available without exception improve the Council’s text, the joint position. They certainly also hark back for the most part to my own proposals. To clarify matters, I wish to say that we have wanted to reach an agreement, and in order to come to an agreement, on Article 16(2) as well, which until recently had actually been disputed merely on account of the wording, we have decided to approve the proposal by the Socialists and Liberals in order to resolve this issue amicably, just as we have also withdrawn a few other amendments for the sake of harmony. I also wish to thank the Commission, the Council and Members expressly (we have had intensive, even heated discussions) for the cooperative and enjoyable teamwork. As regards the remaining proposals, I would emphasise the statement that in my view they are merely an additional improvement to the joint position and would in no way compromise consumer protection and the benefit this would have from the directive, because it is also a high priority for us. I wish to conclude by expressing the hope that the positive expectations arising from the directive will also be met. (Applause)

Mr President, Commissioner Kuneva, ladies and gentlemen, obtaining credit is a different matter from purchasing goods. The legal complexity of the transaction is far greater, and established national financing practices and legal traditions play a far greater part. Accordingly, public trust is often crucial in matters relating to consumer credit. Against this backdrop, harmonisation of the law on consumer credit has its limits and should be done cautiously and gradually. As the weaker party to the contract, the consumer must undoubtedly receive legal protection, but at the same time the guiding principles in this field, as in the law of obligations in general, must be freedom of contract and the personal responsibility of grown-up people, not prescription and paternalism. National legislators must have enough discretion to guarantee consumer protection flexibly in their own countries and to deal quickly with awkward new developments in the sphere of consumer protection. A body of legal provisions alone does not ensure that consumers are actually protected. Impact assessments would have been essential, given that consumer credit affects hundreds of millions of people. Legislation should be based on typical case scenarios and not on exceptions. In this respect, I must first of all thank the European Parliament as a whole for rejecting the Commission’s totally unacceptable initial proposal and for amending it substantially and decisively at first reading. Secondly, I welcome wholeheartedly the new approach adopted by the Commission in its amended proposal dating from 2005, whereby only specific fundamental elements would ultimately be harmonised. I must, however, criticise the Council’s common position. Instead of focusing on a sound practicable European solution, the representatives of the Member States have been introducing their own specific rules, defending them and compiling a litany of them in the compromise. The result is a set of provisions that create far too much red tape. That is no good to consumers. Swamping consumers with information does not help them. It generates considerable additional costs, which have a disproportionately strong impact on small amounts of credit. Accordingly, my aim from the outset was to try to streamline the rules and give national legislators more leeway. In this context I would like to thank my honourable colleagues, because all the votes in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection went in that same direction, and all the decisions of this House seem set to do likewise. Let me just cite two key examples, namely the substantial improvements and slimmed-down provisions regarding overdraft facilities and the emerging arrangement on Article 16 in respect of compensation for early repayment. In spite of these improvements, however, I believe that the emerging majority is only prepared to go halfway, no doubt partly influenced by the absence of consent in the Council and by the desire to bring the legislative project to a conclusion. I nevertheless consider it imperative that additional improvements be made if the proposal is to be judged favourably in its entirety. I wish to mention two other points that are important to me and to seek your approval once more. Firstly, the threshold at which the directive starts to apply should be raised to EUR 500. I am well aware that the value of that amount varies throughout Europe. The point, however, is not that the directive should only apply once the EUR 500 threshold has been crossed but that national legislators should retain the option of applying their own provisions from the first euro rather than being bound to restrict their action to credit of 500 euros or more. Secondly, consumers should have the option of waiving the prescribed explanations regarding pre-contractual information, one reason being that these explanations could hamper the internal market. I do believe it ought to be enough to provide the consumer with a copy of the terms of the contract in advance in order to satisfy the pre-contractual information requirement – which is, incidentally, what the Commission envisaged in its own proposal. That would limit the stacks of paperwork. Unless these changes are made, I fear that the desirable aims underlying this directive, namely to open up the single market to consumers in Europe and give them a wider range of products and options, will not be achieved.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it has emerged clearly in the debate that we have a common aim. In particular, I can unreservedly endorse what the Commissioner said in her introductory remarks. The only question is whether the draft that is now on the table can actually achieve our common objectives. I believe there are a number of defensible opinions on this issue. The uniform annual percentage rate of charges certainly represents unmitigated progress, as does the common uniform right of withdrawal. Let me re-emphasise, however, that consumer protection is best served if we consider the whole picture, as the Commissioner rightly indicated, rather than tacking together all the provisions that apply anywhere in Europe. More statutory provisions do not mean greater protection of consumers. On the subject of interest-rate differentials in Europe, I must point out that I should have welcomed the presentation of an analysis of the extent to which these differentials might be due to divergent legal provisions and complexities in particular countries and whether it might be the case that interest rates are lower where legal rules are simpler. I do not know the answer, but the question ought to have been examined. Competition and general consumer education also serve to enhance consumer protection, but excessively convoluted rules do not. Let me say a brief word on the trialogue. I certainly held the view that we should thrash out our differences here in Parliament. Far be it from me to thwart an agreement. Nevertheless, since we always argue for transparency, particularly in the Council but in other forums too, I do not think it right that an informal body should hold these discussions behind closed doors. Instead, each institution should initially express its opinion, motions should be tabled, and a solution should then be found on that basis. Let me repeat once again that the draft has been considerably improved in the course of more than six years of deliberations – I want to make that abundantly clear – and Parliament has played a crucial part in the improvement process. I also see this to some extent as an endorsement of my own work. In my opinion, however, the draft is simply not good enough. Be that as it may, it will enter into force. I have no hesitation in thanking my fellow Members, the Commission and indeed the Council – which, in point of fact, has always provided very straight answers and detailed information – for their contribution to the performance of what has generally been a thoroughly gratifying and pleasant task.

 Madam President, that was an interesting debate. We now move on to a very different subject area. We will see if we can achieve an outcome sooner or later. There is a saying which, I presume, is understood throughout Europe, namely that money does not bring happiness, but it does bring peace of mind. In that spirit, let me start by wishing all our citizens in Europe peace of mind. However, if you are owed money by another person, if someone owes you money from a sale, damages or similar, this often gives cause for concern rather than peace of mind. Will the debtor evade his commitments? Will he conceal his money or his assets, perhaps at an even later hour than our debate this evening? All Member States have procedures which aim to prevent this from occurring. They include attachments, injunctions, arrest and seizure: there are many different terms. Procedures vary very widely and the situation is extremely complicated, and there is of course the language issue as well. Anyone wishing to make use of Member States’ various cross-border procedures may well find that the horse has bolted, or as we say in Germany, the hare is already on the other side of the hill. In other words, the debtor has had time to hide his assets. This is now a widespread problem across Europe’s borders, and it is becoming increasingly pressing given that we are all aiming for a single payment area with cash-free transactions. That means that the opportunities to hide assets on the other side of the hill are steadily growing. That is why the Commission has taken the initiative and, I would emphasise, is quite right to do so. It has presented a very good Green Paper which is comprehensive and detailed, albeit with some points which will undoubtedly require further clarification. That is still ahead of us and is the purpose of the hearing. At this stage, the European Parliament cannot deal with all aspects in detail, and neither can I, so I shall simply mention some of the key points. First of all, although this can really be taken for granted, the report is only about the attachment of bank accounts and temporarily freezing bank deposits. It is not about final settlement. Secondly, it is only about financial assets held in bank accounts. It does not deal with injunctions or the attachment of other assets. That raises the question of whether our purposes would really be served through the harmonisation of 27 different systems. In my view, that would be an extremely unwieldy approach and would take forever to achieve. It encroaches on so many other areas that it would not be helpful. The right approach is what the Commission has in mind: an independent and additional European procedure, preferably in the form of a regulation, to exist in parallel to the national provisions, which would remain in force. I should also mention the ‘Brussels I’ Regulation at this juncture. The Regulation which already exists is not adequate. The creditor must not only demonstrate credibly and summarily that he has a claim but must also demonstrate the risk. Our particular concern, which I share, is to protect the creditor. What I do not want, under any circumstances, is a situation in which creditors or third parties suffer harm precisely because we have a European regulation. That would reverberate on Europe itself. In some cases, attachment without just cause can destroy a person’s livelihood. I would simply like to mention the main points: that a creditor may be liable for damages arising for the debtor, that the creditor should be obliged to institute the main proceedings within a fixed time limit, that the creditor may be required to provide security, that the debtor should be entitled to appeal, that a procedure should not be selected which takes an eternity but which is broadly in line with the previous proceedings, that there should be provisions preventing too much money being frozen for the benefit of the creditor, and that the debtor must be guaranteed the wherewithal to live on. There is the problem of trust accounts. If there is to be any possibility of attachment here – and I will leave that open – they certainly need to be specially protected. The same applies to joint accounts, although this is not the same thing; in fact, the two are not directly related. The point is that it is also important to protect third parties, and special protection measures are required for any third parties involved. I would just mention that standardised formal notices would be useful for banking communications and, in this connection, would like to conclude by saying that studies comparing the laws in force as well as detailed analyses are undoubtedly required. I would also, and specifically, like to thank the Commission for these comprehensive analyses and studies, and also thank all my colleagues. We worked together very well. I assume that there will be a broad consensus in favour of the report.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to start by thanking Mrs Patrie for her good cooperation and work on this report. From our perspective, I believe we could have fully supported the outcome of the committee's work. Consumer protection is extremely important, especially to the PPE-DE Group. I have three minutes, so let me say a few key words: first of all, it is absolutely right, as Mrs Wallis has also just said, that there is a need to review the joined-up thinking – the coherence – of the various Directives as part of the ‘better law-making’ agenda, and to some extent to consolidate the common elements with a view to a systematic review. In this context, however, we do not want to see any expansion towards a consumer contract law, and the efforts must also be coordinated very closely with the work on the common frame of reference (CFR), which must be taken into consideration. What is also important, from our perspective, is absolute coherence with the provisions of Rome I, i.e. the applicable provisions in private international law. As regards the individual Directives, I broadly endorse the minimum harmonisation approach – and what Mrs Patrie has said – but this does not exclude the possibility that individual areas should be conclusively regulated where possible. However, a cautious approach should be adopted here, taking account of the cultural characteristics and circumstances in the individual Member States; otherwise, overregulation will be the result. I would just like to draw attention to Amendment 4 tabled by the Socialist Group, which states that in the framework of harmonisation no regulatory provision may be abolished in a Member State. This would mean that if harmonisation takes place – in other words, if everything is added together at the end – then the outcome will be the opposite of what you, Commissioner, have quite rightly called for, namely clear and simple legislation that works for everyone. Instead, the outcome could be overregulation, and that is not what we want. More generally, the Commission has raised a number of sometimes very serious questions about the individual Directives, which require very careful review and to which we have responded individually. In particular, we reject class actions: we do not want US conditions in Europe. We also reject producers' liability or the restriction of freedom of contract if individually negotiated clauses or the price is to be reviewed in the framework of the standard terms and conditions of business and the abuse clauses. I just want to point out that an integrated approach is crucial. Consumers are not only consumers; they are also entrepreneurs, company employees – could I just ask how much time I have left, I was not listening before: I thought I had three minutes, so I am being quite quick – and they also have an interest in the welfare of their companies. A holistic view is therefore essential. I am sure the Commission takes the same view. We cannot only ever look at this issue from one perspective. Consumers are not well-served if they are presented with comprehensive legislation that ultimately destroys the opportunities for the economy and their own businesses. On that note, I would like to reiterate my thanks to everyone involved in the deliberations on this issue.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the mortgage credit market continues to be divided up along national lines. Why is this so? Is it because of difficulties with language, because of the different financial cultures, the legal framework, or is it because people have confidences in lenders with which they are familiar and which are on their doorstep? What the Commission is proposing to do is to examine the possibility of harmonising the legal framework in order to increase the volume of cross-border lending and borrowing. Such an inquiry is to be welcomed. Even more to be welcomed is the statement in the Green Paper to the effect that extensive studies are still regarded as necessary before proposals for regulations can be made, and the Green Paper’s own emphasis on the difficulty of the matter in hand. Legal differences in the Member States are not to be found in one area alone, although they certainly are present in mortgage law, but – as both Commissioner McCreevy and Mr Medina Ortega have just pointed out – they affect many aspects of the law, among them land registration, the practices of notaries, the law in relation to forced sales, the law of contract and the protection of consumers, all of which areas of the law are interconnected. In some of them, the European Union has no power to enact regulations, and harmonisation from the centre in one area could have seriously detrimental effects at the national level, doing, in fact, more harm than good. What is unreservedly to be welcomed, though, is further promotion of the refinancing markets, and so I want to say an unreserved ‘yes’ to this being investigated and analysed and to the efforts at achieving integration, albeit primarily through convergence. While I do not want to exclude the possibility of Europe-wide regulation, we do take a rather sceptical view of European legislation as a consequence of its capacity for destroying functioning markets. Extensive studies are, in any case, still needed. We also, perhaps, need to face up to the fact that this is where we reach the outer limit of what can be standardised in Europe through legislation at the European level. I do not think this House’s role as legislator is without its problematic aspects, since it, when the Commission itself says that more extensive investigations are needed, must, to some degree, stay its hand and should not be precipitate in calling for legislative initiatives – and, indeed, has not done that. I endorse the essence of the report.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have just two minutes – enough time for a few bullet points. Following the public debate, one could get the impression that freedom to provide services was something that this directive had invented, but it does in fact have the force of law. The problem is that it is a law by which many countries do not abide; instead, they have erected barriers and use every kind of chicanery to frustrate it. All that in fact needs to be done is for this protectionism, which is what this chicanery is all about, to be done away with, and this directive provides us with the appropriate legal means to do that. The political and economic integration of Europe in the services sector, which accounts for 70% of GDP, will be of benefit to all. It is not, however, of crucial importance to the big global players or in terms of shareholder value, and on that point I would refer back to what was said by President Barroso and by Mr Watson. The big global players do not need the directive, for they have branches and agencies everywhere, through which they can offer their services, but it certainly is crucial to small and medium-sized businesses. It also offers benefits to private individuals in the shape of more choice and freedom, especially to workers, in that it will bring more employment, and employment – that is to say, more jobs – is the best kind of social policy. Some are now using a Commissioner who is no longer here to defend himself as a pretext for conjuring with terms like free-market liberal, free-market radical and neo-liberal, all of which is a load of scaremongering that gets us nowhere. What matters is the text, for it is with that that the crucial progress will be made. I, too, would have liked to see rather more – that is to say, fewer derogations – emerging from the votes in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and in the Legal Affairs Committee, which I represent here today. There are a few things, though, that I do regard as decisive. Firstly, nothing is being done to make the present situation worse. Secondly, progress is an absolute certainty; the only question is whether it might perhaps not be enough. Thirdly, nobody is being prevented from taking the next steps later, when the time is ripe. It may indeed be that that time will come sooner than we think.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the brief two minutes available to me, I shall have to focus on only a few points. I will start with a general comment on the package as a whole. Europe, with what will soon be a population of 500 million people, constitutes a considerable economic area, and it is right that we should be forerunners in giving this area a single binding legal framework in the field of environmental protection. Europe is not, however, some isolated part of the world and there is no intention that it should become one; on the contrary, it has to compete with other major industrial areas, and it is of no benefit to our objectives, of which the protection of the environment is one, no matter how good our intentions, if, in future, production is removed to other parts of the world with the potential for making their environmental problems even worse, for we would be no less affected by them while sustaining considerable economic damage as well. The economic damage to which I have referred affects by no means only the production of chemicals, but rather all goods in the production of which chemicals are used, and they are certainly not few in number. This aspect is also relevant to one important topic in the Regulation, that being the protection of intellectual property and of confidential data, which loomed particularly large in the Legal Affairs Committee, and about which I should like, briefly, to say something. The Commission proposal as it stands at present does not take adequate account of this and does not go far enough. Commission Verheugen did mention it earlier on, and, on the assumption that I did not misunderstand him, I think he got it broadly right. The fact is that guaranteed mutuality is completely absent. If European businesses disclose a lot of data, outsiders can see them and infer things from them; the reverse is not the case, and it is because that state of affairs goes against the idea of globally fair competition that the Legal Affairs Committee decided to adopt a series of amendments to take that into account. Some of them found their way into the overall package, notably the ones relating to the extension of deadlines, to which Mr Sacconi made brief reference earlier. Amendments aimed at improving the confidentiality of data – specifically Amendments 43, 45, 46 und 48 – did not make it, and I would like to take the opportunity to ask that they be incorporated now.

 Madam President, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, the ‘peanuts’ have meant that, in my small village of 450 inhabitants, it has been full steam ahead with work on bridging the broadband gap. I believe that, in three to four months’ time at the latest, we will have it. Mrs Stavreva, thank you very much for your report. It is very good. Ladies and gentlemen, I have been able to work in this lofty Chamber on the development of agriculture for 15 years, helping to shape it, irrespective of farm size and legal form.

 Mr President, MON 810 was approved in the European Union in 1998. This approval is not mandatory for Member States and each Member State is free to decide whether to accept this approval, to apply it or to issue a ban on the cultivation of this maize. I assume that this is the basis for the latest ruling in the Federal Republic of Germany on this issue. In this regard, may I say that MON 810 was approved in Germany in 2005, then in 2007 sowing of the seeds was stopped and in December 2007 Monsanto submitted a plan for the general monitoring of its cultivation. It was subsequently approved again in 2008 and then, a few days ago, it was prohibited. Mrs Frassoni has stated that many Member States have rejected the cultivation of this maize. There are precisely four States – France, Austria, Hungary and Luxembourg – and now Germany has joined them, so there are five out of the 27 Member States. This is purely a national decision on the basis of subsidiarity and therefore we should not burden Parliament with it.

 Mr President, Commissioners, I do not have anything to add about the content, as enough has been said in this regard. I should like to thank the rapporteur, who showed good staying power in the trialogue. This report has been a long haul. As we know, the European Court of Justice issued a judgment, which was followed by clean, fair discussion. We had opportunity to discuss this at length and, as rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has shown that a satisfactory solution can be achieved in a short space of time even as part of a first reading agreement. I have crossed swords with him a fair few times since 1994, but our teamwork has always been fair, and I should like to thank him once again for his work.

 Madam President, goodness knows that two minutes is very little time in which to deal with one year’s conscientious work on this health check. There are just a few points I would like to make. To remind you: in November 2007, the Commission indicated 8% modulation plus 45% degression. A figure of 4% progressive modulation, that is to say modulation depending on farm size in the Goepel report, was indicated. We then heard 8% basic modulation and 9% progressive modulation for a total of 17% as an offer proposed by the Commission and we have recently reached a figure of 5% during voting in committee. It was important to us that all modulation resources should remain in the region and should be used, irrespective of the size of the farm or its legal form. Commissioner, you called for more flexibility for the Member States during the system changeover. This would mean more opportunities to introduce further decoupling and a move away from historical reference values. In principle I agree with this. Debates within the committee have shown that this is not advisable in all areas, as should be remembered in relation to the area of crops in particular as we move away from smaller market organisations. New challenges and increasing global mobility in the markets require new, flexible mechanisms. In the dairy sector, we have also succeeded in redefining Article 68 so as to support disadvantaged regions. Finally we come to milk, the most complicated matter in this evaluation. Because it is so complicated, I would have preferred us to have dealt with this complex of dairy-related issues with options and complementary measures as a complex report when quotas are abolished in 2010 or 2011. However, the milk fund is sizable and will provide additional support to dairy farmers, particularly in disadvantaged areas. The promotion of investments for dairy farmers without a tied quota throughout the EU should not be scoffed at, as it would reduce the purchasing pressure experienced by businesses. I have one last personal point: I would like to thank my team for their success in bringing this package to a conclusion by the end of my active period as a Member of Parliament under the French Presidency. (Applause)

Mr President, allow me to read out the wording: 'points to the potentially heightened risks involved in long-distance transport of live animals and, in this context, takes the view that more frequent thorough inspections should be conducted in order to ensure that only completely healthy animals are transported and believes that consideration should be given to the question whether the transport of animals for slaughter or fattening' – and this is the difference – 'can be limited to a maximum journey time of nine hours'.

Mr President, the Commission is planning the successful introduction of the health check in the agricultural sector for 2009. As rapporteur on the own-initiative report, I am assuming that with tomorrow’s vote, the Commission will have a much better idea of Parliament’s position on this matter and I expect that this position will be taken into account in the legislative proposal we are expecting in May. I welcome the fact that the Commission is making a special effort to promote the concept of quality in agricultural production, particularly with its confirmation of what is referred to as the 2009 Green Paper. We are of the opinion that the value added through high-quality standards will become an increasingly important starting point for our farmers, even with regard to increasing competition from imports. I have also noted that the Commission will be putting forward new proposals on the subjects of food safety, animal welfare and health, together with better supervision and better rules. I appeal to the Commission to be reasonable. Our farmers cannot be confronted with more regulations if, at the same time, imports from third countries are not subject to these regulations. Mr President, the Commission intends to put forward a raft of proposals in 2009 for reducing the administrative burden that will change nothing in the level of demand for existing regulations or the political specifications. I very much hope that this will apply to our farmers, particularly with regard to the cross-compliance rules. I believe an important subject is missing in the annual policy strategy, and this is the issue of food supply. The Commission has often used the term but our citizens must have a secure undertaking as to how they can organise continued supply.

Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the first round of parliamentary discussions on what is referred to as the health check of the common agricultural policy will conclude tomorrow. This health check is not a fundamental reform of the common agricultural policy. It should further update the existing policy where appropriate, based on the experience gained since 2003, and adapt it to changed circumstances. The Commission should take very serious note of our position. It is a good basis for the upcoming negotiations on the legislative package, as well as for the budget review after 2013. We in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have supported the continuation of the reform towards greater personal responsibility and market orientation while at the same time emphasising the aspects of food safety and of social and environmental responsibility – particularly with regard to current market development and the new challenges of climate policy – more strongly than we have done in the past. We also want greater flexibility for the Member States when changing the system – in other words, more opportunities to introduce further decoupling and the loosening of historical reference levels. The debates in our committee have also revealed, however, that this is not sensible in all sectors, at least not before 2013. For livestock premiums or for states with full decoupling, but which have a strong livestock sector, a sudden change of system would result in negative structural interruptions in view of the current market situation. The same appears to be true with some of the smaller market regulations in the plant sector, such as, for example, the market regulations for potato starch, dry green fodder or rice, on which a regionally significant processing industry depends and has invested a great deal in recent years and has to service this with high interest rates. The committee voted in favour of the introduction of a new, flexible instrument to promote dedicated environmental and region-specific production or particular sectors – in other words, Article 69 – and we have at the same time demanded that new measures be devised to protect the land against environmental crises and crises that are increasingly to be expected in view of the changing climate and increasing cross-linkage of agricultural markets. A new form of public-private risk management should also be tested with this instrument, which is urgently needed in view of other instruments being returned and the new imponderables. A few brief words on degression and modulation: our farmers expect planning to be reliable and it is simply inappropriate to once again curtail and redeploy between 8 and 53% of direct income aid with a compulsory 5% modulation only four years after implementation of the last reform. By any understanding of the financing of the development of rural areas, confidence is being destroyed here and structural interruptions provoked. These proposals specifically concern full-time farms and those that have improved their competitiveness in recent years through mergers into legal entities. We have put forward proposals, however, for how the general policy targets and the economic requirements can be aligned with each other. We have to break new ground in the interest of sustainability and competitiveness. Above all we are grateful to all those who have cooperated on this own-initiative report and I would like to thank my colleagues and fellow Members across all the Groups in the Committee on Agriculture.

Mr President, with this discussion the sport of figure skating comes to mind. When judging figure skating, we discard the highest and lowest marks and then award the score. If I therefore remove the far right and far left views in this House, we shall then have a result with which we are all very satisfied and with which we can all live very happily. Thank you very much for your support and cooperation. I would emphasise this once again beyond the limits of the groups. I am looking forward to what will be exciting cooperation on the legislative package.

Mr President, very briefly, I would like to list what I regard as the most important points arising from this work programme. Undoubtedly a key theme for 2008 is the Health Check for the common agricultural policy. The 2003 CAP reform should be reviewed and simplified, we all agree on that, and to that extent I hope, as rapporteur, that the important contributions that we in Parliament make to this own-initiative report will be taken into account in the ensuing legislative proposal. This Health Check must help us find the right path towards a common agricultural policy for the post-2013 period. A further project is the planned Green Paper on Agricultural Product Quality. Quality must become an even greater focus in agriculture, and this applies to farm imports from third countries as well, which must conform to the same standards as those applicable to EU producers. I am particularly keen on an initiative to promote the consumption of fruit in schools. This is something which we in the PPE-DE Group have been championing for some time, and we are gratified that the Commission intends to take up this initiative. Other key issues for 2008 such as the Milk Package, the 2008-2009 Budget Review, the Action Plan on EU Animal Health Strategy and the Review of Support for Less Favoured Areas will certainly make sure that there is no scope for any boredom in Parliament!

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I do not know if it was such a good idea to mention the 20% reserve now, in the last major chapter, as we are discussing voluntary modulation, and that is the real purpose of this debate. We can of course discuss all the other aspects, but perhaps not just now. The Commissioner is quite right in saying that it is not the first time that we have discussed the pros and cons of voluntary modulation in this House. Since our last debate, not much has changed in terms of the legislative proposal. It is true that the Council and the Commission have sent us clear signals that they are willing to accommodate our concerns, but, until this is definite, we must reiterate our clear signal that we reject this proposal in its present form. The total disregard for Parliament’s political and budgetary codecision powers with regard to the final agreement in the Council is a further demonstration that, not only do the other institutions fail to take us seriously in important matters of principle, they fail to notice us at all. This has to change, Constitution or no Constitution. Until the Council and the Commission make us a firm offer, therefore, we should be united in rejecting this proposal. This is the only way to achieve results, and I believe that, if we do so, this issue will help to strengthen the role of the EP and, in particular, to support European farmers. At this point, I should like to reiterate my thanks to all the members of my committee for having joined me on this path thus far. I should also like to extend the warmest of thanks to the members of the Committee on Budgets and the representatives of all the political groups for supporting the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on its difficult path. On behalf of many, I should like to give particular mention to Mr Mulder and Mr Bösch, who have made a vital contribution to determining the position of this House. I would appeal to my fellow Members to unite in voting against the Commission proposal tomorrow. Let us join with the Council and the Commission to seek ways of achieving a better solution. I would remind the House, however, that rejecting the proposal is a precondition for spurring the Council in particular, but also the Commission, into action. I hope for your unqualified support, therefore. I should like to address the following remark of a procedural nature to the President. The second report on voluntary modulation confirms the first report, which also rejected the Commission proposal, and the matter was thus referred back to committee pursuant to Rule 52(3) of the Rules of Procedure. If we reject the Commission proposal again tomorrow, and the Commission does not withdraw its proposal – which I am assuming it will not – we shall also have to vote on the draft legislative resolution.

 Mr President, Commissioner, let me take this opportunity to once more express warm thanks to all my fellow Members from all the groups who have supported me in creating a framework worthy of this debate, which is of such great importance to this House and to Europe’s farmers. You, Mr President, by your wise and astute decision, have ensured that Members from all groups will get the chance to speak, albeit at a rather later hour. Following a decision by the Council – which, as is so often the case with agriculture debates, is notably absent today – the Commission submitted a proposal according to which 20% of agricultural direct payments would be shifted from the first pillar of CAP to the second, from which they could be spent without mandatory co-funding. That is a concession by the majority on the Council and, whether it wishes to or not, on the part of the Commission, as part of the budget compromise reached in December 2005. The Commissioner has confirmed as much. This House has already expressed strong misgivings about this in the interinstitutional agreement on the Financial Perspective. When I say that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development firmly rejected this proposal, I mean that it did so with only three dissenting votes, and its rejection of the draft legislation was indeed unanimous. This is not just about differences of opinion where specific policies are concerned; it is also about where Parliament, as an institution, should stand in the forthcoming debates on the reorientation of the Community budget. As part of the Budget compromise, all the institutions agreed that all the Community’s outgoings, among them the post-2013 agricultural expenditure in particular, should be subject to review, and that this House will play a full part in this process from an early stage. Now, though, we see the Council adopting, through the back door, an extensive remodelling of agricultural funding, and this House has no option but to kill it off, for there was no prior consultation with us. Instead, the Council has decided to proceed with such an extensive reallocation of resources that there will be such limited scope for debate in 2008-2009 that serious discussion will scarcely be on the cards. This is something that we in this House cannot tolerate if we are to be taken seriously in future, and the proposal is, moreover, questionable in terms of financial policy. What is worthy of note on the agricultural policy side is that there is no impact assessment accompanying the proposal. On the contrary, the impression is given that a short-term reduction of 20% in direct payments would not cause farmers any problems. Taken together with the cuts resulting from mandatory modulation and those generally expected after the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, what this means, for those Member States that want to apply this voluntary modulation, is a reduction in payments of something like one-third over against what they were in 2003. Far from supporting structural change in agriculture, that amounts to a flagrant structural violation that would put the viability of many thousands of farms in rural areas at risk. It is generally agreed that what our farmers need is the security to plan ahead. In the absence of any impact assessment on the part of either the Council or the Commission, we caused evaluations to be carried out, and these confirm, not only that there will be massive distortion of competition and illegal discrimination against the farmers concerned, but also that modulation does nothing to serve the objects of the Community in rural areas, but rather jeopardises them to a considerable degree. To date, the Council has offered no response whatever to the legitimate concerns of Europe’s farmers, and there has as yet been no discussion of the potential consequences. This sort of behaviour is not at all what we are used to in the European Union and is also quite obviously inappropriate. Since, moreover, the transferred Community funds are not to be spent in accordance with a strategy laid down at Community level, we find ourselves in the paradoxical situation in which the renationalisation of agriculture policy is being paid for entirely from Community funds, particularly when one considers the way the Council is thinking ahead; I would ask you to take a look and see what happens at the next meeting on 14 November, this very week. We all want to strengthen rural areas. We have put forward proposals for solutions to their financial problems that are worthy of discussion; the Böge report is just one of them. The Council, though, preferred not to give these proposals any closer attention, so let us not reach out a hand to help it after all that we have done already. If there has to be a paradigm shift in agriculture policy, then let that happen only after a transparent and open debate in which Parliament, too, can have a decisive part to play, for this proposal is wide of the mark – legally, in terms of its substance, and as policy – and solves none of the problems that rural areas have. If we want our contribution to future debates on the valuation of the agricultural budget to be taken at all seriously, then we should firmly and forthrightly reject this proposal. I hope that the Council’s response to the vote in this House will be to embark on a more in-depth discussion of the matters at issue. My colleagues in the committee, and I myself, are willing to join them in this, but the Council must make a move. It has to be said, though, that it probably does not entertain very high hopes at the present time.

 Mr President, according to the agenda, we were supposed to be able to have, and conclude, a debate about both Mr Mulder’s report and my own this morning, before having the opportunity to vote on them. We now have exactly 18 minutes until voting time. It is completely unfair to our farmers and agriculturalists to begin a debate of this nature and then perhaps conclude such an important subject as the 20% voluntary modulation – in other words, a policy whereby one-fifth of the existing direct payments to farmers are to be transferred or reduced – with some form of contingency vote this afternoon. I request that this debate be postponed until November. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf is right in the sense that we tabled the amendment on the understanding that at least 50% of the restoration fund would be deployed. Instead, the Commission has proposed a minimum of 10%, with each Member State being entitled to increase this amount without limit and at its own discretion, and so our group believes that this is no longer an issue. I ask the House to reject this amendment.

 Mr President, it will not take me long to explain the priorities for European agriculture that concern us in 2005. They have to do with rural development and how it is to be funded. The Commission has presented us with its proposals on the subject, and we are working on them. In principle, the Commission’s approach is to be welcomed; only recently, Commissioner Fischer Boel gave us to understand that the proposals on rural development had to be – and were – in line with the Lisbon process. That is something we in this House will take on board. At the same time, rural development is also and especially a matter of funding, and we have to keep a very close eye on the work of the temporary committee on the 2007 – 2013 Financial Perspective as far as this matter is concerned. Unless we know what the financial facts and possibilities are, there is no point in us discussing what and how much Lisbon will do about rural development. With regard to the WTO, the 2003 agricultural reforms have increased our margin for negotiation in the agriculture sector; now we have to use it, while adopting a defensive stance in order to maintain the European model of agriculture. If one disregards the issue of its implementation at national level, which is a cause of concern to quite a few of us in this House, the 2003 agriculture reform left a number of issues outstanding. The markets in sugar, fruit and vegetables are ripe for reform, as is the wine sector. In all these sectors, we should wait and see what practical proposals the new Commission comes up with; nothing is to be gained by poking around in the dark. No doubt Commissioner Fischer Boel is perfectly well acquainted with the aspects that matter to this House, and it remains to be seen to what extent her proposals will take our concerns into account. I ask you, Mr President of the Commission, to give some thought to renewable energies, which I believe provide a good alternative source of income for our farmers if there is proper support for them.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the harmonisation of the very highly divergent regulations applicable to civil aviation in Europe, particularly to the hours that flight crew work, is urgently needed. At this time of the year, millions of Europeans are once more setting off on their holidays, and doing so by air. There has been an explosive increase in air travel over the last 20 years in Europe, and, as air travel now knows practically no national boundaries, it is an anachronism that very different regulations should apply to air safety from one country to another. The object of this regulation is to at least make these rules more closely approximate, and that is an aim that is, as far as I am aware, supported by all the groups in this House, so we can content ourselves with making changes in a few areas, for example to the rules that put crew on freight flights at a disadvantage, where changes really do have to be made. We must not, however, make the mistake of adding features that deal only with social security and labour law to a technical regulation that is meant to serve the interests of safety in the air; mixing these together would make the regulation’s direction less clear and tend to weaken it. Nor must we try to interfere in collective agreements between unions and employers, which are subject to labour law; such collective agreements cannot be the subject of action on the part of the state, not even action by the European Union. If we do not lose sight of the fact that the regulation is intended to do no more than make air travel safer, then I am sure that passengers will, in future, be able to expect comparable technical safety standards, irrespective of the airport in the European Union at which they embark on their flight. For that reason alone, this regulation is deserving of support. I am most grateful for the sound work done by Mr Stockmann, the rapporteur.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there are many ways of tackling the lasting effects of the unforeseen financial and economic crisis. This revision package, this legislative measure within the European Economic Recovery Plan, was conceived as a good – albeit not quite sufficient – response to this temporary, though exceptionally critical, situation. It responds, amongst other things, to the request for greater simplification of procedures and increased flexibility in the application of the existing rules under the Structural Funds Regulation that has been repeatedly put forward by the European Parliament in recent years. I should like to emphasise that it is also to be welcomed that an amendment to Article 7 – ‘Eligibility of Expenditure’ – is to enable EU Member States and regions to invest in energy-efficiency and renewable-energy measures in housing with the support of the EU Structural Funds, and that this measure is not only intended for low-income households. The relevant amendment rightly eliminates the reference to ‘low-income households’, therefore, and instead imposes a ceiling of 4% of the total European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) allocation for each Member State for such expenditure. This is just one of the many improvements proposed. In short, bringing this overall package to fruition would accelerate expenditure and thus make available further liquidity from the ERDF, European Social Fund (ESF), Cohesion Fund and Structural Funds for the implementation of the necessary objectives, and would simplify rules allowing for a speedy implementation of programmes. In my opinion, this represents an effective, albeit as yet insufficient, contribution to dealing with the current crisis.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mr van Nistelrooij on the Green Paper and the future form of cohesion policy is certainly one of the most important reports produced by the Committee on Regional Development in recent years. We agree with the fundamental concept of the Green Paper, which states that the purpose of territorial cohesion is to ensure the polycentric development of the EU as a whole, the sustainable development of the territories with their different features and characteristics and, at the same time, the preservation of their diversity. A more comprehensive system offering gradual help for transition regions which exceed the threshold of 75% of gross domestic product must be established in the next programming period, so that these regions have a clear status and can develop in greater security. Mrs Krehl’s report on the obstacles to the use of Structural Funds rightly lists the major problems faced by applicants in claiming Structural Funds, such as excessive bureaucracy, too many complex regulations or the slow and cumbersome centrally managed administration in the Member States. Many recommendations are made to the Commission about the effective measures which need to be taken to remove these obstacles. I would like to single out two of these measures and reinforce them. Firstly, project leaders must currently keep project documents for a period of 10 years in order to be able to produce them for inspection by the Commission. This regulation imposes an excessive bureaucratic burden on small projects in particular. It is right that this period should now be reduced to three years. Secondly, the evaluation criteria used by the Commission for innovative projects are causing significant problems. The same criteria should not be applied to innovative projects as to other projects. It is essential that a different process is used in this case.

 Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Kirilov’s report primarily concerns changes to the three Structural Funds Regulations 2007-2013 with the aim of improving cash flow and liquidity in the Member States. This is one measure for combating the economic crisis which we can support unconditionally. Member States are now required to make full use, for example, of the opportunities for supporting investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy in housing and the new investment opportunities in housing in general. These planned measures will contribute to accelerating, simplifying and increasing the flexibility of the use of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds. I must emphasise that these measures do not conflict with free competition, social standards and the implementation of environmental and climate protection regulations within the Community. It is now the responsibility of the Member States to guarantee the co-financing of the money provided by the European Structural Funds in order to be able to make full use of it. The demand in the report for increased simplicity in the administration and implementation of the funds is to be welcomed and supported. Commissioners, we are looking forward to further proposals on this subject from the Commission in 2009. It is important to emphasise the significance for a successful economic recovery of measures to support employment and business. However, Member States should be urged to make extensive use of the Structural Funds for promoting or creating jobs in small and medium-sized businesses. The committee has taken full account of our amendments. We must support this report unreservedly. Congratulations, Mr Kirilov.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking in my capacity as rapporteur for the Social Fund, the 2002 Solidarity Fund and the expanded and improved version from 2006. This report, which the European Parliament adopted by a huge majority, has been on ice for over two years, because it is being blocked by the Council, despite the fact that citizens are calling increasingly loudly for European solidarity against the background of the ever more frequent occurrence of natural disasters. The Solidarity Fund, which was hastily cobbled together following the devastating floods of 2002 to provide urgently needed assistance, was an instrument that promised immediate aid in the event of disaster. Over time, however, it has emerged that – as you quite rightly said, Commissioner – that the currently available instrument makes it extremely difficult, if not downright impossible, to respond appropriately to large-scale crises at EU level. Moreover, the current threshold for mobilising the fund is, as you said, Mrs Hübner, extremely high, which means that the derogations are getting out of hand. The revised version of the Disaster Relief Fund, however, provides a clear response to this. The European Parliament therefore feels that it is even more important for this effective instrument to be made available to the people affected by disasters, hence, once again, the specific question: why can the Council not reach a common position on an issue that is so vital to suffering citizens of the European Union? Which Member States support the improved Treaty, and which reject it? You in the Commission have indicated that it might be a possibility at the start of 2009. We hope so, but we also want to push for it once again here, because one cannot simply disregard the vote of this Parliament as the various Presidencies have done previously.

 Mr President, it is unusual to be given the floor again under the ‘catch the eye’ procedure, but I just wanted to reiterate at the end of the debate that the criticisms expressed this evening are for the most part not directed at the Commission at all. The Commission has continually helped us in drafting the revisions to this Treaty, and it has always been on Parliament’s side in the efforts to implement them. It is the Council that is at fault, and we wanted to phrase this question so that we could express our criticisms to the Council. The fact that it is not present shows contempt for Parliament, and we should not put up with being fobbed off like this. Mrs Hübner, you have our full support in all your dealings with the Council attempting to get this revised fund off the ground.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, including the topic of water in all policy areas and developing a comprehensive plan for dealing with the subject is a real challenge that must be tackled successfully, as this debate has already very clearly shown. All political levels – national, regional and local – should be included in this process. As a rapporteur for the Solidarity Fund and in view of the fact that this Parliament made its stand as long ago as May 2006, I again urge the Council to make a quick decision on the suggestion for a regulation on the EU Solidarity Fund, in order to complete the setting of criteria and measures eligible for funding by including the incidence of drought, so that damage caused by natural disasters can be dealt with effectively, flexibly and more appropriately. However, my call is also to regional and local authorities to make the most of the opportunities that the structural fund offers to invest in infrastructure with regard to both efficient use of water and prevention of adverse effects when protecting water resources. The fact that this always involves a second call – to citizens both urban and rural – to take water conservation measures more seriously hardly needs to be emphasised here; it goes without saying. I would like to thank the rapporteur.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a signatory of some amendments on behalf of the PPE-DE Group and as a member and Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Regional Development, I would like to take the opportunity to present my views on the Solidarity Fund and its revision, as rapporteur of the European Parliament. Since the report on the Commission’s draft instrument on the new Solidarity Fund was adopted in Parliament by an overwhelming majority in May 2006, this draft has been with the Council, where a majority of the Member States reject the new Fund in its amended form. None of the intervening Council presidencies has included the new Solidarity Fund in its work programme. On the contrary, the revised version is being blocked in the Council by the Finance Ministers. Accordingly, the new Fund, designed to cover the period from 2007 to 2013, is not in force. Unfortunately, until further notice we only have the old Fund, which has been in existence in its present form since September 2002 and which was cobbled together hurriedly at the time. In tough negotiations and hard bargaining here in Parliament in 2006, we managed to work out compromises designed to make the Solidarity Fund a faster, more effective and, above all, more clearly defined emergency aid instrument. Now the Council wants to bury this revised version once and for all. I fail to comprehend how we, as a community based on solidarity, can turn our backs in this way, because of the sensitivities of some Member States, on an emergency instrument whose name celebrates the concept of solidarity. We improved that instrument. We extended it. I cannot grasp why those who have already benefited from the Fund are now withholding their approval. For this reason I make an urgent appeal to the Council to reconsider its decision and finally adopt the revised version. We are a community based on solidarity, Mr President, and no one knows when or where the next disaster will occur. It will then be your responsibility … (The President cut off the speaker.)

Mr President, surely there is scarcely anyone here in Parliament who harbours any real doubts about the success of the PEACE programme in terms of both its tangible contribution to economic and social cohesion and its contribution to enhanced local involvement through active citizenship and the participation of civil society in peace-building. The report, drafted on the initiative of the Committee on Regional Development, rightly emphasises the valuable experience that has been amassed through this unique and highly innovative structural programme as well as highlighting the things that could be done better in future, the challenges that remain to be met and the conclusions that can be drawn. As someone who is closely involved with the regional policy of the EU, I am keenly aware of the need to develop cross-border activities and strongly support cooperation between local chambers of commerce, public institutions and voluntary organisations on both sides of national borders. I need hardly tell you that my group and I unreservedly endorse this report.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this good own-initiative report produced by Mrs Sudre pursues two basic aims, namely to evaluate the conclusions and recommendations contained in the communication from the Commission and to provide a basis – and I believe it provides an excellent basis – for discussion of the prospects for our outermost regions. Even if the rapporteur takes the view that the Commission’s review paints an excessively rosy picture, or at least a partial picture, we should nevertheless be proud that European aid has allowed such advances to be made in our outermost regions. On the one hand, that does not in any way imply a reduction of assistance to these regions, the provision of which is, of course, a legal obligation under the EC Treaty. On the other hand, we know that nurturing the particular assets of the outermost regions is the only suitable way to ensure that these regions generate their own sustainable development. As the rapporteur rightly summed it up, this is not only a matter of preserving, safeguarding and protecting but rather of attracting, generating appeal and continuing to cooperate closely. The report rightly urges, for example, that the discussion on the future of the support strategy for the outermost regions should not only focus on challenges such as climate change, demographic change, migration management, agriculture and maritime policy but should also take account of the need to adopt positions in respect of other Community policies. The new generation of European programmes must also mark the start of a necessary process of diversifying the economies of the outermost regions and must not be confined to merely maintaining the present state of development, which has largely been achieved with the aid of the EU. In the light of these considerations we should give the report our unqualified support.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, new technologies are gaining ever greater weight in Europe’s cultural industry. Particular attention must therefore be given to protecting intellectual property. The task of the European Union, and of the Member States, should be to provide the necessary resources to ensure that intellectual property rights are respected and protected. Combating piracy is particularly important in this regard. All those involved should be aware of their rights and obligations regarding a common solution to this task. In its report, our committee has argued in favour of awareness-raising and education campaigns, particularly with regard to consumers. Preparatory and education measures explaining the value of intellectual property should start among young people in schools. In this context I should like to emphasise once again the committee’s opinion that criminalising consumers who are not seeking to make a profit is not the right solution to combating digital piracy. We have repeatedly emphasised that free information structures such as the World Wide Web are of great significance to the European creative sector and that we have to strike a balance between the openness of the Internet and the protection of intellectual property. In this context, Mr President, allow me one final comment on the revised version of Amendment 22a tabled by 40 Members. My group – the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats – has clearly stated that it is prepared to support the first part of the amendment, and to emphatically reject the second part of this amendment.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that the Fourth Report on Economic and Social Cohesion is of major political significance certainly does not need to be repeatedly underlined here. I agree with the rapporteur on all the basic issues and congratulate him on his good work. He rightly emphasises that the anticipated new challenges can be dealt with only if cohesion policy remains a Community policy, which is anyway in accordance with the Treaty. His report clearly rejects, therefore, all attempts to renationalise this policy. The prerequisite, however, is a balanced cohesion budget for the EU. Yes, adequate resources must be available in order to safeguard the harmonious development of all regions in the EU and deal with the new challenges. A different view exists, however, regarding the choice of wording in the report on the demand for financial resources for cohesion policy post-2013. Like many of my colleagues, I do not feel it is right that at this early stage, in 2008, the report should contain anticipatory demands for more financial resources for the future, not least in view of the fact that we are quite rightly facing criticism that we do not always draw down, on time, all the funding which is already available. The Committee has therefore found good compromise wording which, however, only applies to the text of the resolution and not to the recitals. So we should not include any conflicting statements in the recitals, but should remain consistent with the wording 'adequate resources for a balanced cohesion policy'. Ultimately, this is about credibility: in the past, cohesion policy has been able to achieve sustainable successes and can do so in future too if it is adequately resourced, without our calling for more financial resources at this stage. Commissioner, you referred in your introductory statement to adequate financial resources to deal with future challenges. That is a good formula.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the purpose of the European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation is to implement and administer cross-border, supranational and interregional cooperation measures. It is no exaggeration to say that this new network is intended to improve the quality of people’s everyday lives, to make our businesses more competitive, to extend the scope of our research and education centres and, last but not least, to preserve our environment. There is no compelling need for the EU to provide financial support for EGTC measures. This instrument will enable regional and local authorities to form cross-border alliances with their own legal personality – a significant innovation in terms of the scope for territorial cooperation. The EGTC offers a unique opportunity to generate synergetic effects that transcend the institutional framework and to guarantee better, coordinated investments and uniform and efficient use of resources. On 5 July 2006, as we know, this instrument was created by virtue of a European Parliament and Council Regulation. By 1 August 2007, all Member States were to have enacted supplementary legal and/or administrative provisions. The fact that only five or six Member States have adopted national rules gives us cause for serious concern. The losers will be the potential committed participants who want to foster cross-border cooperation with their good ideas and innovative projects. To that extent, the questionnaire was warranted, and we also urgently await information on this matter from the Council.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in this century it is surely not difficult to convince anyone that general and vocational education can no longer be confined to school and the immediate post-school years but has to be updated and extended throughout people’s working lives. Changing demographic trends, for example, provide sufficient evidence of this requirement. In this context, Mrs Pack’s excellent report puts forward a host of good ideas and very successfully conveys the need to create a culture of learning, particularly among adults. To this end she lists a number of measures that should be taken at various levels. Adult education is, of course, primarily a task for the Member States. For this reason the EU cannot prescribe action; instead, we must make suggestions and request, encourage and invite the Member States to offer a range of measures that will bring more people into adult education. Like the rapporteur, I firmly believe – and I say this as vice-chairman of the Committee on Regional Development – that many Member States are not fully aware of the significance and use of the European Social Fund and other structural funds as instruments in the pursuit of lifelong learning. They should monitor the structural funds with this objective in mind as well as ensuring that more resources are made available for those whose need of lifelong learning is greatest. In short, the report calls clearly on the Member States to make active use of instruments such as the European Social Fund and on the Commission to reinforce specific programmes in the field of adult education.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this excellent report by our colleague Mr Vakalis links in seamlessly to the three reports on natural disasters adopted by Parliament last year and is an important addition to them, for these previous reports did not deal with the issue of earthquakes. We know, however, that many countries and regions – especially in southern Europe and the Mediterranean region — have a high risk of earthquakes. I therefore endorse the rapporteur's call for the Commission to draw up a communication evaluating the hazards posed by earthquakes and proposing the counter- and follow-up measures necessary to address them, as it recently did in the case of floods. The question of financing is key, of course, and as the rapporteur on the Solidarity Fund, I cannot understand why the Council is still dragging its feet on – indeed, has in effect shelved – the adaptation of the Solidarity Fund, which this House has endorsed. Immediate action is required here to ensure that this solidarity and funding instrument is available in future so that the damage caused by natural disasters, including earthquakes, can be remedied quickly, efficiently and flexibly. Without this flexibility, particularly in terms of the timetables and measures for funding, it has been shown in the past that the needs of earthquake victims have been virtually ignored. We must consider – as the previous speaker has said – that the Solidarity Fund that is currently still in place has only been used once in relation to earthquake damage. However, earthquakes are just as much natural disasters as floods, forest fires and storms. There are other forms of financing, in addition to direct funding, which should be used as well, however, such as regional state subsidies or loans from the European Investment Fund. This is the only way to ensure that appropriate resources are available to tackle earthquakes. The report makes a good contribution to this process.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s White Paper and Mr Schmitt’s excellent report feature both the educative function of PE in schools and the role of sport in social integration and fostering good health. Awareness of all aspects of this in society should now be increased. Alongside what we have learned from the European Year of Education through Sport and from the Lifelong Learning, Youth and Europe for Citizens programmes, it is now time to devise initiatives to make the most, in our times, of the various forms of physical activity comprising sport, both in schools, clubs and associations, and as spontaneous, informal physical activity. In an era when we do very little physical activity, sport has much greater significance for us than it did for our parents and grandparents. In a time when children prefer to play computer games, there is a growing need to promote active, healthy lifestyles for children and young people. Unfortunately, there are many signs that, in many schools, even the time available for PE often fails to correspond to the reality on the ground – that is, implementation sometimes fails to meet with legal obligations. It seems that a reality check is necessary in many schools in this regard. I also support the rapporteur when he calls on the Commission to draw up guidelines on the application of the State aid rules to public sports facilities – naturally, fully respecting the principle of subsidiarity – together with the national and European umbrella organisations for sports. We need clarity on what type of state support is regarded as acceptable and lawful and which aspects can be integrated with one another, possibly including the strengthening of investment in physical education, and with regard to the financing, if necessary with assistance from European funds within the framework of the Structural Funds, of the modernisation and provision of schools.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, thank you to the whole budget team for their good work. Please allow me a few remarks from the point of view of the Committee on Regional Development. In its estimates, the Commission evaluated the need for finance and, in harmony with the threshold values of the Interinstitutional Agreement and the terms of the financial perspective, took into account the likely applications for the current period. Thus, logically, the commitments within the framework of the Structural Funds for 2008 increase by 0.9%, and payments by 3.2%, while monies for the Cohesion Fund increase by 14.4% for commitments and 36% for payments. Since the Commission is, in fact, the only institution that has unrestricted access to the required information in connection with overall financial requirement, our Committee was guided by the Commission’s proposal and also unanimously and immediately corrected unjustified amendments undertaken by the Council in its draft budget. Above and beyond our amendments, we also simplified the administration and made the use of the funds more efficient, particularly against a background of the Lisbon and Göteborg goals. We focused on the unique status of small and medium-sized enterprises and traditional small business activities such as research and development. Not least, we considered it important to make special mention of the JEREMIE and JESSICA initiatives, to mention but two of the many key points in regional policy. We also support the Commission in facing the future demographic challenges in Europe, particularly that in some regions and even in entire Member States, population ageing has become a major problem due to declining birth rates. Family values must be promoted, for example by helping young women to balance family and career responsibilities. This is forward-looking policy, which must also be reflected in the key areas of regional policy.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, education has played, and continues to play, a key role in the development of the European economy and the personal development of young people. I fully agree with this and many other statements made in the report, and I would like to express my thanks and appreciation to the rapporteur. It is also correct to say that education systems are effective when the resources deployed produce the best possible results. These objectives are pursued by all the EU Member States, in fact, but comparative studies often reveal some interesting facts about the outcomes. For that reason, pointers and appeals to the Member States, as set out in the report, are more than justified from a European perspective, even though we have no direct powers in respect of the content and structure of education. The causes of such divergent outcomes can be found in the variations in educational quality and intensity, which result in different levels of performance and therefore also to unequal life chances for our young people. In my view, it is essential, as a matter of urgency, to make it clear, time and again, that today's generation of school students will be entering an international competition for training places after completing their education. Equal opportunities for all thus pose a challenge for Member States which they must meet in order to ensure that young people receive the best possible education that equips them with the intellectual skills they need in order to flourish. However, equality of opportunity always has to do with quality and performance as well. This, in turn, merits a greater focus on quality and performance in the education system. In this context, it should not just be about educational equality for everyone, but about giving everyone an equal start, followed up by the best possible education which takes account of individual talents and differences in physical and intellectual abilities.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it has been made clear several times in today’s debate that the recent natural disasters in Member States of the EU, and not only in Greece, have shown that besides the measures which must be taken at national level, there is an urgent need for better crisis response mechanisms for the European Union as a whole. As the rapporteur for the Solidarity Fund, I am mystified as to why the Council has so far dissented from debating the revised version of the 2002 solidarity instrument, which was adopted one and a half years ago by the Commission and European Parliament. This new revised version is a more flexible and straightforward instrument for the provision of assistance: if it is not mobilised now under the Portuguese Presidency, in the wake of these recent disasters, when will it be mobilised? Europe’s citizens are quite rightly asking themselves: why is the EU not capable of acting more swiftly? How much is the much-vaunted solidarity among Member States worth? The answer to that question is determined by crisis situations like this one, in my view. The version of the Solidarity Fund adopted by the European Parliament in 2006 is a strong and flexible instrument which serves the interests of the EU, and its deployment will enable those living in eligible areas to benefit from effective assistance and support based on solidarity. This fund is not only a mechanism for restoring normality and functionality, infrastructure and economic and social life; it also – and this is important for the EU – sends out a clear political signal from the EU to citizens who find themselves in an acute crisis. It is not about endowing the fund with more money. That is not a contentious issue; a nominal budget line of one billion euros should be maintained. In light of recent events, however, I appeal to the Council – and the Portuguese Presidency in particular – to make this revised solidarity instrument's entry into force a priority.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, whenever we debate matters relating to housing policy we should be faithful to our principles of subsidiarity and proximity to the citizen; as we all know, the powers accorded to the EU under the Treaty are very limited, and we should not try to interfere with that through the back door, but, as regards eligibility for grants for accommodation under the ERDF Regulation in the 2007-2013 planning period, I would like to argue in favour of their being given for the reconstruction of the high-rise estates to be found in Eastern Europe and in the eastern parts of Germany. Many Europeans live on estates made up of blocks of largely industrially-constructed housing that were put up between the 1960s and the 1980s. The eastward enlargement of the EU gave particular importance to a European strategy for the sustainable development of this type of housing; whilst, in western European countries, the future of large-scale estates lies mainly in the performance of social functions, the main task in eastern European states is the repair and modernisation of the stock of prefabricated buildings in order to make the flats in them fit to be rented out, while, at the same time, the structural change of the housing sector from state-regulated institutions allocating accommodation to private-sector or community-based enterprises operating on the market is only just beginning. In this respect, the ongoing development of large-scale urban housing in the countries of Eastern Europe is primarily a task for the technical experts and housing professionals; in Germany, however, the problem is a new and different one, and one that – Europe-wide democratic change being what it is – will reach other countries sooner or later, in that, as there are fewer people available to live in them, properties are standing empty, and this is happening not only with old properties but also new ones, not only with housing stock in the inner cities but also that on the urban fringes, and that is one reason why a programme has been developed for the provinces of eastern Germany, the object of which is to promote not only the demolition of accommodation for which there has for some time been no demand, but also the restoration of the remaining housing stock in order to adapt urban structures and housing stock to the decrease in demand. It is for this reason – for this reason! – that the future of mass housing must become more important as an area for European policy-making.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take just one important area from my colleague Francesco Musotto’s very good report, an area whose importance not only for the islands concerned but for the EU as a whole should not be underestimated, namely the problem of illegal immigration. This problem of illegal immigration must in my opinion be tackled more effectively, having as it does a highly disproportionate effect on the EU’s islands in the Mediterranean. Even though progress has already been made with the measures the EU has taken – with the development of an integrated border management system and the establishment of a community code on the rules governing the movement of persons across any kind of borders, for example – the immigration figures nevertheless show that those measures are still not enough. Even though the competence for measures clearly lies with the Member States and will have to remain with them in future, the islands cannot be made to carry the excessive burden alone simply because of their geographical position, because what is at first sight a Spanish, Italian or Greek problem subsequently becomes a problem for the whole of Europe and therefore also calls for a response at Community level. Solidarity in action is what is required here and must be made reality. In this connection, the creation of a European coastguard to monitor the EU’s external borders would certainly be no panacea for this island problem, but this proposal of Mr Musotto’s does deserve to be examined to see whether it could be one of many measures to combat illegal immigration and protect the islands and the EU as a whole.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the recommendation in relation to the Common Position incorporates numerous amendments made by this House at first reading. Although, as Mrs Gröner has just said, the budget for the period from 2007 to 2013 provides EUR 885 million for the ‘Youth in Action’ programme on the basis of the Interinstitutional Agreement on the Financial Perspective for the same period, I would nevertheless like to remind the House that the amount envisaged in the Commission’s original proposal was EUR 913 million, and, this House having demanded an increase to EUR 1.1 billion, we have now, in the Common Position, ended up with EUR 885 million. While that may well not reflect what we aspired to, it does give us the security to plan ahead for the coming years, and it is good that we can adopt it in this form today or tomorrow. ‘Youth in Action’ is primarily aimed at young people between the ages of 15 and 28, although some projects are open to 13-year olds and 30-year olds. My group is glad that this House has been able to take the initiative in highlighting such important aspects of the Common Position as, for example, young people’s participation in democratic life, the promotion of such fundamental values as human dignity, human rights, tolerance and non-discrimination, protection for participants by means of proper insurance – which is a very important consideration – the European Youth Weeks, seminars and structured dialogues involving young people, exchange schemes for young people in Europe and the neighbouring countries and, not least, EUR 2 million in financial support for the European Youth Forum. While thanking Mrs Gröner, I would also like to say that we hope that the unamended Common Position of the Council will meet with widespread support from this House tomorrow.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start with a word of thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Takkula, for this very fine report on ‘Europe for Citizens’. Now that the overall amount has been reduced to EUR 190 million from the EUR 235 million that this House and the Commission originally agreed on, that is the amount with which, for lack of any understanding on the Council’s part, we are obliged to manage. We support the rapporteur’s two amendments, one of which aims for a 2% decrease, and the other at an increase by the same amount. We are particularly glad to see that the new Action 4, which has to do with memorials, keeps alive the memory not only of the crimes committed by the Nazi regime but also of those committed under Stalin. I would, however, Commissioner, like to address one other problem, one that has been raised by those who benefit from the programmes and by those who run them. This House wishes to point out that its resolution of 5 April 2006 referred to both conferences and seminars, and the bilateral seminars – working parties and meetings of experts – are essential components of the partnership effort in terms of qualifying the programmes and those who work on them, and grants should be available for them in the same way that they are for multilateral conferences. Furthermore, this House takes it as read that the Commission will, in the course of the applications procedure, accord equal treatment to local authorities and civil society organisations, and the object of that is that the Commission should be prevented from doing as had originally been planned and imposing additional requirements – such as guarantees and special bank sureties – on too many other social organisations, which they would find it difficult, indeed impossible, to meet.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by expressing my appreciation and congratulations to Mrs Krehl for this, an important component of cohesion policy for the coming years. After all, it is the task of the strategic guidelines to supplement the Regulation governing the Structural Funds and to support the national and regional authorities in programme planning. Consequently, these guidelines contain the political priorities for the investments to be made. The new strategic guidelines rightly focus more than before on growth and jobs, with the emphasis on knowledge and information society, entrepreneurship and employment. In other words, the priority here is the Lisbon Strategy, but I should like to emphasise that this is pursued never as an end in itself, but rather – within the framework of cohesion policy – always with a view to achieving the objective of strengthening economic cohesion and of pan-European competitiveness. In so doing, these guidelines must also take account of the promotion of investment in individual businesses by means of subsidies designed especially for SMEs. Concern must still be expressed about the considerable administrative burden in the field of European structural policy, which, unfortunately, is not significantly reduced by the requirements set out in these guidelines. I should also like to emphasise that we must not only make intelligent, efficient, targeted use of the scant resources at our disposal, but also attach great importance to private cofinancing at project level. Unfortunately, public–private partnerships are still used much too rarely in connection with the Structural Funds, particularly because of a large number of unresolved legal issues. We must now do our utmost, as quickly as possible, to enable countries to submit their operational programmes soon, and particularly to afford them a smooth transition to the new aid period.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur I would like to look mainly at the European Regional Development Fund. At first reading, the European Parliament adopted a large number of amendments, appreciably changing the Commission proposal, especially in the areas of strengthening the urban dimension, greater protection for the environment and cultural heritage, non-discrimination and the treatment of persons with disabilities, most of which is also brought out in the Hatzidakis report. The possibility of using ERDF aid to assist with the construction of social housing was also accepted. The Common Position, which was unanimously adopted by the Council, is therefore a satisfactory compromise. The majority of the amendments adopted by the European Parliament were either taken over in full or in part, or the principle of them was accepted. One of the most important changes, which also reflect the outcome of the December 2005 summit on the Financial Perspective, must surely be the eligibility of non-recoverable VAT where there is private cofinancing. To avoid double standards – and that is one of Parliament’s successes – in the coming period this support will apply for all Member States. My group therefore believes that, in view of the urgency, not only the ERDF Regulation but the whole package of Structural Funds regulations should be adopted as punctually as possible so that there can be no further delay in preparing the operational programmes that are so important for us in the regions and the projects in the regions can begin promptly. In view of the fact that Parliament has emerged from the negotiations with great success, we recommend acceptance of the Common Position without further amendment.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a month ago, at the plenary part-session in May, against the backdrop of ever more frequent natural disasters, especially floods, we adopted at first reading the report on the new Solidarity Fund for the period from 2007 to 2013, for which I was the rapporteur. During that debate, as has been the case today, the desire for European solidarity emerged loud and clear. That fund, I firmly believe, will also make a vital contribution, in the event of direct damage, to ensuring that the Union can act in a more effective and targeted manner in areas in which the public expect the European Union to take action. In the spring of this year came further evidence that floods do not stop at national borders in Europe. At ever briefer intervals we have been paying the price for irresponsible building, inadequate precautions and a lack of overflow areas. On this occasion, such defects were most glaring on the lower reaches of the Danube. Yes, the problems are man-made to a great extent. What is lacking is a binding legal framework as well as a certain degree of management for flood prevention and the will to implement what has already been agreed. The report compiled by Mr Seeber provides a good basis for a European regulatory framework, provided – as you indeed re-emphasised, Commissioner – that the subsidiarity principle is strictly applied. Important decisions such as the level of protection and the right choice of safeguards can only be taken by the Member States themselves. To put it plainly, the Member States must be granted the right, even after the entry into force of this proposed directive, to continue presenting EU-relevant data and forwarding them to Brussels in the customary manner in order to avoid the creation of any new bureaucracy, which would serve no practical purpose. The report in its present form is good and should therefore be adopted by a large majority.
 Rolf Berend (PPE-DE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, faced with the ever more frequent occurrence of natural disasters – for example the many forest fires and floods, not least in the summer of 2005 – there is an ever-growing demand for European solidarity. The solidarity fund set up in the aftermath of the devastating floods in 2002 and designed to run until 2006 is intended to give the European Union greater freedom to act in the event of major disasters or crisis situations, thereby playing a substantial part in enabling the EU to do more and target its efforts better in those areas in which the public expect the European Union to act. As you, Commissioner, mentioned earlier, it was extremely difficult, not to say sometimes and in some situations impossible, to use the existing instruments at EU level as a means of responding appropriately to major crises, not all of which, it has to be said, were of natural origin. One can take as examples of this industrial accidents – such as the wreck of the tanker Prestige
, or the bomb attack on Madrid in March 2004. In addition, the current threshold for the mobilisation of the solidarity fund is set extremely high, so that exceptional conditions and arrangements abounded. The new solidarity fund regulation now rightly makes provision for the extension of its scope, in other words, no longer limiting major crisis situations to natural disasters, but extending the category to include industrial and technological calamities, except where the ‘polluter pays’ principle is applicable or where the damage can be covered by insurance. There is also a need for immediate action in the event of public health crises and when terrorists strike, although – and this is the crux of the matter – the budget must remain unchanged. The definition of a ‘major disaster’ has also been revised, so that a disaster is regarded as major if it causes damage estimated at in excess of EUR 1 billion or over 0.5% of the gross national income of the State concerned. One is talking here about damage in the public sphere rather than to private property or damage covered by insurance. As has been said, the threshold was formerly fixed at EUR 3 billion or 0.6% of gross national income, which threshold values had been proposed by the Commission and by this House, but not accepted by the Council. Finally, it is also intended that a new political criterion be introduced to enable the Commission, should extraordinary circumstances in a specific part of the territory of an eligible state sufficiently warrant it, to declare a disaster situation to be major, even if the quantitative criteria have not been fulfilled – a criterion that is likely to apply to acts of terrorism. It needs to be emphasised that the European Union’s solidarity fund is not a means for taking preventive action, but that it instead responds to disaster situations. That, for example, excludes the possibility of the fund being used to provide protection in advance of pandemics or to facilitate other preventive action. The solidarity fund cannot engage in preventive health care, nor is it meant to; health policy remains a matter for the nation states, and by that is meant specifically the deployment of vaccines and medicines in the initial response to disasters, medical and psychological emergency care and measures to deal with the risk of contagious disease, for example as a consequence of flooding. As before, the fund’s financial assets amount to a virtual budget of 1 billion marks, the significance of ‘virtual’ being that these funds can be drawn on only in the event of a disaster, and must first be mobilised by the Commission and Parliament; it follows that they cannot be transferred elsewhere. I would like to conclude by extending warm thanks to all who have worked with me on this report – to the Bureau, to my colleagues, and to the Members of this House, irrespective of whatever groups they belong to, with hearty thanks to the Commission, too, for its good cooperation.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by saying a word of thanks to Mrs Krehl for her sound report and excellent cooperation on this issue. The economic disparities between the regions of the EU will only increase in the coming programming period – particularly as a result of the forthcoming enlargements – with no increase in Structural Fund appropriations – if we did not know that before today, we do now. In the light of this, it is now necessary to use the scant resources available in an intelligent and efficient manner, always bearing in mind that cohesion policy cannot solve all the structural problems or be a substitute for the efforts of the Member States. I endorse the critical appraisal of earmarking, for example, which puts us in fetters. There is a danger that the regions will not have the flexibility they need in developing the programmes to meet their local and regional requirements. I should like to emphasise the particular consideration for the urban dimension, of which the Commission’s proposal takes insufficient account. Owing to their economic and social disparities, conurbations are in particular need of increased assistance. The use of private cofinancing to aid the implementation of all the programmes is very important. This needs to be emphasised time and again, particularly at a time when public funds are scarce – and this opinion is in fact shared by the majority of all the members of our Committee. It is essential to promote private cofinancing at project level. Public-private partnerships are, unfortunately, too little used in connection with the Structural Funds, since they raise a host of legal questions that have to be resolved. A welcome development is that the negotiations on the Financial Perspective succeeded in largely harmonising the different standards within the framework of cohesion policy for the old and new Member States.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, despite the demands made by the Őry report, I am firmly convinced that both the transitional periods and freedom of movement can be maintained by those Member States that think it necessary to do so. If a country, with an eye to its own labour market and its economy, thinks it needs to continue to regulate access to the labour market, then it is perfectly entitled to do so. Here too, the ‘pacta sunt servanda
’ rule applies, and neither the Commission nor this House – perhaps not even a majority in the latter – should venture to exert pressure by making appeals to one country or another. To do so would be, as I see it, to misuse a highly volatile issue to whip up sentiment. Where this issue is concerned, I find myself unable to put Germany and Austria in the same bracket as Spain and Portugal. Germany is on the dividing line, and the conditions prevailing in it are quite different from those in the countries of Southern Europe. There is in this House so much talk of subsidiarity, yet suddenly, where the free movement of workers is concerned, Brussels and Strasbourg claim to know better than those on the ground in Germany or Austria. A few months ago, in its coalition agreement, the German Government reiterated its commitment to the transitional periods, and it did so not in jest, but on the basis of facts that have to be treated with respect. My country must continue to regulate access to the labour market for at least the next three years. What arrangements are to apply to the following two, must then be discussed on the basis of the new situation, and action then taken. By way of conclusion, let me point out that it was with this very problem in mind that there were great popular misgivings about the eastward enlargement, and yet we were always able to say: ‘There is nothing to fear; these issues have been regulated by treaty for five or seven years.’

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the EU is indeed going through a rough patch at the present time. Following the rejection of the Constitutional Treaty in France and the Netherlands, European citizens have become increasingly sceptical towards the EU’s institutions and rapid EU enlargement. The programme ‘Citizens for Europe’ is intended to promote active European citizenship and to reduce dissatisfaction and alienation. My group actively supports the programme’s main objectives: promoting European values and achievements and preserving cultural diversity, in order to foster cohesion among Europeans. This programme is one of the tools that could help the EU to achieve these objectives, by means of town-twinning activities, citizens’ projects, building up European networks in the civil-society sector, and adult-education centres. Furthermore, as we have heard, the importance of ‘active European remembrance’ should not be underestimated in this regard, namely the preservation of memorial sites relating to Nazi and Stalinist deportation and mass extermination. Memorial sites for the victims of the crimes perpetrated by these totalitarian regimes, whose impact was felt throughout Europe, have been included in the programme and are to receive funding; both of which have the support of my group. The proposed total budget is to be EUR 235 million within the framework of the Financial Perspective for 2007–2013. In view of the ambitious objectives of ‘Citizens for Europe’, this funding does not, of course, reflect the programme’s real importance as a tool for making citizens aware of their European identity and common values on the one hand, and the strengthening of and support for European integration on the other.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we know, the European Communities Treaty established free movement of persons, goods and capital within the EU, and so it would hardly be possible to call for the free choice of location to be banned outright, since that would harm European businesses by making them immobile. What is needed, though, is the introduction of something to accompany the principles of free circulation, which must remain within the cohesion policy framework, and the reforms of the structural funds and of the law on subsidies present themselves as opportunities for doing this. What that means is that it is urgently necessary that the Commission should, in awarding subsidies and also funding from the Structural Funds, ensure that the granting of such aid should be conditional upon medium-term guarantees of permanence and employment. That is indeed something that Europe must deal with. What Mr Hutchinson’s report – albeit not without its being the subject of lively debate in the Committee – makes clear is that the companies receiving the aid are obliged to implement the policy of economic, social and territorial cohesion. Put in plain terms, that means that the consistent way to put the proposal made by the Commission with reference to the Structural Funds is to specify that companies that fail to comply with the conditions attached to public aid, should be required to repay it, without, however, being allowed under any circumstances to receive public subsidy for the new locations and to be barred from support from structural funds or in the form of State aid for a period of at least five years – although seven would be better – from the date of relocation. This report is intended to stress the need for every necessary step to be taken to prevent the offering, under European regional policy, of incentives for business relocations that result in job losses. Mr Hutchinson’s report, in its present form, is an even-handed one and deserves to be endorsed.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Hökmark, for his outstanding report. As we heard, this House, in an own-initiative report a few weeks ago, spoke out in favour of State aid for disadvantaged regions being continued until 2013. As the support businesses get from State aid is among the factors that influence them when making decisions about investment in a given area, it has an essential contribution to make to economic growth and the creation of jobs in that area. The EC Treaty includes a fundamental prohibition of State aid where it has a detrimental effect on the internal market by potentially distorting competition, but an exception is made for certain types of State aid, such as that given to promote the economic development of Europe’s disadvantaged regions. As a member of the Committee for Regional Development, I am firmly of the conviction that direct State aid has a key role to play in regional development and plays an important part in achieving our primary cohesion goals. The scope given to aid by Article 87(3)(a) of the EC Treaty in conjunction with the guidelines for regional aid have, in the past, enabled the regions concerned to attract businesses and thereby actively contribute to their own regeneration. Were such support is no longer possible, these regions’ convergence process would be jeopardised by the lack of any competitive advantage against not only regions without developmental disadvantages but also regions in the new Member States in receipt of the maximum amounts of aid. This is particularly the case for regions bordering on the new Member States. The reduction of bureaucracy is an important part of the law on aid and, like the increase in de minimis
 aid, makes an important contribution to making the legal environment more welcoming to businesses.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, one of the factors that influence businesses when they are deciding whether or not to invest in a particular region is the extent to which they will receive support in the form of State aid. This aid therefore also contributes to economic growth and job creation in the region in question. It is entirely natural that most State aid is granted in the European Union’s neediest regions, since it helps to reduce regional disparities, similarly to the Structural Funds. The priority should therefore be to use State aid in convergence regions, pursuant to Article 87(3)(a). The same Article must also, however, apply to regions affected by the statistical effect, as demanded in the Third Progress Report on economic and social cohesion, and it must continue to apply until the end of the programming period in 2013. The obligation to maintain investment within the relevant regions must remain in place for at least five years – I repeat, five years – after the investment. Seven years would have been preferable, but five years is the absolute minimum needed in order to prevent ‘investment hopping’ wherever possible. This five-year period should be enforced in the case of both large companies and SMEs, in order to avoid State aid being used as an incentive to relocate jobs to other areas of the EU, and as a source of funding for large-scale redundancies and plant closures. If State aid is used, monitored and analysed correctly, it can be a useful tool to boost growth and job creation.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the ‘Youth in Action’ programme that the Commission has put forward, to which our committee’s rapporteur, in her even-handed report, has proposed various improvements for us to vote on, has demonstrated its suitability as a means of adding value to youth policy throughout Europe. The new youth programme has been made significantly simpler than its predecessor, with, for example, a flexible and less bureaucratic procedure for applying for funding, which is what this House has always argued for. Moreover, the programme is now funded by only one budget line rather than four, as was formerly the case. My group is at one with the rapporteur as regards the adjustment of age limits for participants, ensuring the exclusion of discrimination, and both the equal participation of disadvantaged young people and the involvement of young people in the evaluation and ongoing monitoring of the programme’s objectives. The extension of the programme to more countries, the greater importance of European cooperation in youth work and the more generous age limits make it necessary for the financial framework to be increased to – as has already been said – EUR 1.128 billion, but I would like to emphasise that in this we are being consistent with the Böge report. Turning to the weighting of the actions, my group endorses the proposed indicative levels for the minimum funding of Actions 1 to 5. As the Commissioner emphasised, the report entrenches the possibility of staging youth seminars and the European youth weeks, thereby making them a component of European youth policy. I congratulate the rapporteur and thank her for the good cooperation.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as the rapporteur has already – and rightly – said, even though there is no provision in the Treaties for the EU to have any direct power over or responsibility for the conduct of an urban policy, the European Parliament has always argued the case for one at European level. I would just like to remind the House that it was this Parliament that campaigned for URBAN as a Community initiative and, in due course, made a successful job of implementing it. For the sake of simplification, the existing URBAN dimension is now to be integrated into the mainstream programmes for the coming planning period for 2007 to 2013. That can definitely be advantageous provided that the URBAN dimension’s successful continuity is ensured. There is no doubt that urban areas are – as the rapporteur has highlighted – economic motors and key elements in regional development created within the EU. The fact that over 80% of economic activity goes on in towns and cities is as indispensable justification for the principle of partnership as one of the key elements in cohesion policy. Urban and rural policy are dependent on each other; it is for that reason that they may not, in any one territory, be considered in isolation, even though there are extreme differences between rural and urban zones in the ten new Member States. What is remarkable about the cities of the central and eastern European states is the decline in their population, the phenomenon of emigration brought about by the decline of industry, and this is a process that the Eastern European states will have to master in exactly the same way as did the towns and cities of the former East Germany: as a consequence of the socialist era. This is where the Urban Dimension’s city policy, among others, could – indeed, must – have an effect. That is why the rapporteur’s balanced report deserves to be endorsed and its conclusions need to be followed up.

 Mr President, unless I am misinformed, I have had Mr Galeote’s three minutes added to my speaking time, but I shall defer to the services’ judgment on that; in any case, I do not need all three of them, but I would be glad to lay claim to some of them. I, of course, take a completely different view of Mr Guellec’s splendid own-initiative report from that of Mr Allister, who spoke before me, for Mr Guellec is right to emphasise territorial cohesion as one of the EU’s strategic goals in terms of the promotion of harmonious and balanced development throughout its territory. It is in this respect, as he also rightly points out, that the EU marks itself out as something more than just a free trade zone, and quite right too. The eastward enlargement brought a new and significant dimension to the challenge of cohesion, as the EU had never before had to face such a marked increase in disparities. It is true to say that the new, enlarged EU is now characterised by a great deal of geographical and cultural diversity, and this is what distinguishes it from comparable major economic areas such as the USA, Japan or Mercosur. As such diversity does, however, constitute one of the EU’s great growth factors, it needs to be maintained as European integration proceeds. This means that the policies that affect the EU’s spatial and urban structure must promote its territorial continuity, without – let me emphasise – standardising local and regional identities, as these have a vital role to play in enriching the quality of life for the public as a whole. If I may express this in more precise terms, the territory that now comes into being does not abolish national, regional or local areas. On the contrary, the object of spatial planning at European level is to make the best possible use of every specificity as a source of growth. The rapporteur is right to say that the EU does not as yet possess any competence for spatial planning, for no provision is made for it in the treaties, even though it is a thorny issue for the Member States. I am persuaded that the reduction in the number of goals for the coming planning period will make the new regional cohesion policy more coherent. The new regional cohesion policy, with fewer targets to meet in the next planning period, must – and will – gain new dynamism in facing up to the challenges that await it, so that the objective of territorial cohesion, too, will be achieved, and, indeed, if need be, independently of the budget funding provided for regional and cohesion policy, which we still hope will be substantial enough to enable us to perform the tasks set us. With this end in mind, we must, on the one hand, focus on the Community’s strategic guidelines for cohesion, while also taking territorial specificities into account, and, while I am on that subject, I have to say that I take a rather sceptical view of the rapporteur’s proposals, according to which, alongside GDP, new territorial criteria and indicators need to be created in order to evaluate a region’s development and the obstacles to it. We have learned from previous planning periods that this is where we face the great risk of such additional criteria, when brought into play by one or other party, all too easily degenerating into a wish list that can no longer be objectively evaluated. It is indeed the case that economic, social and territorial cohesion make interconnection not only between the regional, state and European levels, but also between the Community’s various policy areas necessary. It is the regions, however, that will in future remain the appropriate territorial level for the implementation of cohesion policy, in line with the principles of subsidiarity and decentralisation. It is with this in mind that both Parliament and the Commission have – and rightly – favoured explicit decentralisation and concentration along the lines of ‘one fund, one programme’, and so I am led to take what is actually an optimistic view of the next planning period.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group endorses the idea contained in the Fava report that the ERDF should concentrate on investments, infrastructures and further development initiatives in selected areas that are a priority for the Community, as it continues to be the case that the whole Community can expect to derive considerable additional benefit from investments of this kind. In essence, the report, as adopted by the Committee, adds muscle to those of the Regulation’s provisions that deal with scope, aid and the rules for eligibility of expenditure. Generally, albeit not entirely or in every single detail, the way the Committee voted reflects the position taken by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and we agree with the Commission and with Mr Fava, the rapporteur, on the substance of the three objectives, these being convergence, regional competitiveness and employment, as well as European territorial cooperation. We also endorse the proposal for the proportionate distribution of financial resources. The emphasis on the regions most likely to benefit from support, albeit not to the detriment of those affected by the statistical effect, is the logical consequence of Article 160 of the European Communities Treaty. There are two points to which I should like to draw particular attention, the first being the continuing need for the option of public-private partnerships to be open, which would mean the cofinancing rate being calculated also by reference to private resources. There is in fact no reason why the Commission should not agree to this. My second point is that, if we fail to reach agreement in due time, in the context of the Financial Perspective, on the amount of funds to be made available, the regions most deserving of support would, in accordance with the treaty’s requirement for cohesion, have to receive special treatment. What that means is that under no circumstances must any cuts be merely linear, for this would definitely be to the detriment of the convergence regions and would run counter to the European cohesion policy guidelines. Perhaps, though, the British Presidency will manage to fit structural policy into the Budget in such a way that no cuts would be possible.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the second-largest entry in the Financial Perspective is for expenditure on economic and social cohesion. Being concerned with regional policy, I am at one with the rapporteur – whom I congratulate on this excellent report – in believing that the EU’s ability to cope with the past and forthcoming enlargements and to reduce regional disparities is absolutely dependent on a strong and well-funded European regional policy being in place. On the other hand, though, EU structural policy must be equipped with sufficient resources to make it possible, in future, for adequate support to be offered to less developed regions and to those with particular socio-economic problems, including those in the old EU Member States. While it is of course the Commission proposal that best complies with the guidelines for the EU’s regional policy in the forthcoming planning period, which aim at the reduction of disparities between one region and another, we regard Mr Böge’s proposal as an acceptable compromise in comparison with both it and the quite unacceptable demand made by the six net contributors. Under no circumstances must cuts in the Budget fall hardest upon regional policy. The allocation proposed in the Commission’s draft regulations for cohesion funds for the individual targets is acceptable only if there is an increase of 1.14% in total resources. If cuts are made along the lines envisaged by the Böge report or, indeed, the Council regulation, resources must be more concentrated on resolving the grave problems in the regions most deserving of support. There must be no across-the-board cuts, that is to say cuts made without affecting the relative allocations, for these would unilaterally impose burdens on the convergence regions in the EU’s old Member States.

 It is my firm belief that Bulgaria and Romania should become members of the EU. Before this takes place, though, they must meet certain criteria, which must continue to apply. The Council has refused to adjust the Financial Perspective, even though the Interinstitutional Agreement requires this to be done in the event of enlargement. I regard this as an unacceptable encroachment upon Parliament’s budgetary rights. The Commission’s latest progress reports confirm that both countries have a great deal of ground to cover before they meet the accession criteria, in particular with regard to the fight against corruption and the establishment of a judiciary operating under the rule of law. It would be premature to take a decision on the matter at this time, in view of the fact that both countries are still a remarkably long way from meeting the accession criteria, as well as of the collapse of the trilogue on adjustments to the Financial Perspective. It would have been more appropriate to delay the decision on accession until the Commission has presented its next progress report. The fact that we are still 20 months away from the envisaged date of accession would have been further justification for such a delay. I regret that I do not feel able to vote in favour of accession at this time.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we do not have the money we want or need to spend on regional policy, and so we must do a good job of sharing out the money we do have in a prudent and correct fashion. Money is of course the main issue at stake with regard to regional policy, but other key issues include setting political objectives and reducing disparities within individual EU regions, with the latter having acquired particular significance since enlargement. The question we should be asking is whether we want a coherent EU that is capable of developing more rapidly, or an EU where the differences are more pronounced and where the economic and political integration of the poorer regions proceeds at an even slower rate. Putting it bluntly, unless more money is earmarked for the Structural Funds following enlargement, the new Member States will always be tempted to block decisions to drive integration forward. To put it another way, the amount of funding allocated to the EU’s structural policy must allow adequate support to be provided, both now and in the future, to less developed regions that have particular social and economic problems, whether such regions are situated in the current EU or in new Member States. As I have already said, this means that funding must be distributed fairly and channelled towards solving the most serious problems. Although on the whole we agree with the Commission’s proposals for distributing funds between the various objectives, they can of course apply only if the total amount of funding is on the scale proposed by the Commission. If funds were to be distributed in this way and cuts made to total funding, as proposed by certain Member States, this would have an extremely harmful impact on the priority convergence regions in the old EU Member States. This is something we could not and will not stand for.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, speaking on behalf of the Regional Policy Committee, I too would like to express my gratitude – both to the rapporteur and to the Commissioner – for the good cooperation over the past five years. As far as Structural Funds and regional policy are concerned, there are three prominent aspects of the 2005 Budget procedure to be noted. The first is that 2005 is the first complete financial year for the Europe of Twenty-Five. Secondly, and in consequence of that, it is only right that the overall funds available in the preliminary draft Budget for regional policy were increased, the payment appropriations to a greater extent than the commitment appropriations, where the increase was more modest. Thirdly, the way in which the funds have been appropriated makes it clear that, in the case of eight new Member States, there is a continuing transition from the pre-accession instruments to support being given from the Cohesion Fund. The Council has made cuts in the preliminary draft Budget that we regard as unacceptable. In the Budget procedure, the Committee on Regional Development has done no more than avail itself of its right to use amendments as a means of restoring the amounts cut by the Council – with reference, of course, to the Budget expenditure as a whole. To sum up, every one of the amendments we called for and adopted provides only for the restoration of the Budget line to what it was in the preliminary draft Budget, thereby preventing the regional policy budget from being cut.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it gives me particular pleasure that we have succeeded in drawing up and adopting a new support programme for European films for the culture and economy of the European Union and worldwide within a short space of time – just six months – and before the end of this legislative period. This was only possible because there has been exceptionally good cooperation, for which I would like to express my warmest thanks. Thank you very much, Commissioner. The Commission’s proposal on the establishment of the MEDIA Mundus programme was an excellent one. There was excellent cooperation with the Czech Presidency and cooperation in the Committee on Culture and Education was best of all. Only as a result of this was it possible to achieve this goal in such a short time. The promotion of European films through the MEDIA programme has been very successful in the European Union for some 15 years. Ninety per cent of all European films shown outside their country of origin are promoted by the MEDIA programme. So far, however, the programme has only promoted projects within Europe, and this promotion programme is no longer adequate at a time of globalisation of the markets and new technologies. There are new opportunities, but also new challenges. The MEDIA Mundus programme we are discussing today is a fantastic response. It is a response to the opportunities offered to the European film industry by new markets outside Europe. It is also a response to the need and the opportunities to use the promotion of films and films themselves to support and drive forward intercultural dialogue. That is why I should like to express my thanks that the pilot MEDIA Mundus projects were launched. EUR 7 million were made available. It became clear that there was huge demand. Training, marketing and distribution in global networks were supported by the pilot projects and, in particular, the emerging audiovisual markets of the world – India, Brazil, South Korea, Canada – have submitted outstanding projects. In this regard, with the vote of the Committee on Culture and Education we gladly vote in favour of the proposal. I should like to ask the entire Parliament for a ‘yes’ vote to support this programme for the coming years with an appropriate amount of funding to achieve the objective of supporting the promotion of European films as global ambassadors for our cultural values. This is my last speech in the European Parliament. I feel very lucky to have been able to complete the programme with your support and should like to pass on my own message. Where future work is concerned, please remember that cultural goods in Europe should not be simply economic goods but must remain both cultural and economic goods. I should especially like to thank all my colleagues on the Committee on Culture and Education, in the secretariats, and you, Commissioner, and your Director General at the helm, Gregory Paulger, for ten years of excellent cooperation in the audiovisual field. Many thanks.
 Ruth Hieronymi,  
rapporteur. − (DE)
 Mr President, I thank you for the supportive and constructive debate. I am certain that, with this impetus, the MEDIA Mundus programme, which has rightly been addressed today, will not only enjoy great success but will also be able to mobilise additional support in the coming years. Anyone who deplores the lack of or insufficient European culture in the world, which they have every reason to do, can only welcome the MEDIA Mundus programme and vote in favour of it enthusiastically. It is an excellent example of how we can bring our cultural message to the world. That is why I would earnestly request that you convey this message to our governments with vigour. Promoting European culture collaboratively does not mean less national identity for all our countries and Member States in the European Union. Rather, it strengthens their particular national identity and brings our European culture together so that we may be a more effective ambassador in the world. On that note, I would like to thank you all. I invite all of you who would like to discuss how we could go about this to the Members’ bar.

 On behalf of the 40 signatories, I have withdrawn Amendment 132 to the Trautmann report because it was not possible to reach a compromise on strengthening the basic right to protection of intellectual property during the European Parliament's deliberations on the Telecoms Framework Directive. The aim of Amendment 132 was to develop new ways of achieving a more balanced relationship between the basic right to free access to information and the Internet, on the one hand, and the basic right to protection of intellectual property in response to the dramatic rise in piracy on the Internet, on the other. The PPE-DE Group withdrew its support for this amendment after the left-wing groups (PSE, Verts/ALE, GUE/NGL) linked their support for the del Castillo Vera report (creation of the European Electronic Communications Market Authority) to this issue.
 Ruth Hieronymi  (PPE-DE

Madam President, many thanks to all the rapporteurs for their work, which was truly excellent. Let me, however, deal with two specific points. The European Union is not only an economic community but is also pledged to uphold common values, and that is why the protection of private data is a vital concern. At the same time, however, technical progress and the protection of cultural and creative works must not be regarded as conflicting aims. Both will be key factors in our future competitiveness. That is why I, along with many other Members who have addressed the House today, am appealing earnestly for a strengthening of the position of holders of rights, in other words those who want to have their copyrights protected. No one else needs this protection, hence the introduction of models for cooperation with Internet service providers. A step in this direction reflects technological convergence as well as convergence in the reinforcement of copyright.

Mr President, I too, would first like to thank Mrs Hall for her extremely ambitious efforts to achieve a timely result for this difficult report. She did it! The report was difficult because it had to establish rules for the special case of Europe-wide mobile satellite services before the Telecom package was revised. It is to Parliament’s credit, and most especially to the credit of its rapporteur, that we have succeeded in finding ways to make a preliminary ruling like this, which nevertheless makes a sufficient degree of transparency possible and actually links exceptional decisions to exceptional circumstances. I am very glad about this, therefore, and can say on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education that we support the result that has been achieved, because it includes three points that are important in our committee’s view: firstly, the decision respects the competence of the Member States to decide how to allocate frequencies. Secondly, the decision is also linked to the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, and thirdly, this will also strengthen media pluralism and cultural diversity within these services. All we can do now is hope – and this is our wish – that this work is also worthwhile and that there really will be pan-European mobile satellite services, as this decision leads us to expect.
 Ruth Hieronymi  (PPE-DE

Madam President, I should just like to rule out any misunderstandings once and for all. This report is not about barring anyone in any way from access to the Internet. The Committee on Culture and Education has unanimously rejected this. It is about achieving a balanced relationship between open access to the Internet and the protection of intellectual property, and here we do indeed still have a large number of tasks to resolve and instruments to find that take account of both objectives. I should therefore like to specifically ask for this approach to be followed in the votes, too.
 Ruth Hieronymi,  
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group
. – (DE) 
Madam President, first of all, I should like to thank Mr Graça Moura most sincerely on behalf of my group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, for his excellent report. Thank you, too, to the Commission for presenting this communication on the European agenda for culture. It can count on Parliament’s support for culture as a horizontal task, for increasing artists’ mobility, for increasing regional cooperation and for strengthening international cooperation. However, we also note the absence of something on this agenda. This is a subject we discussed in detail a little while ago. The cultural industries and their growing significance also mean that the economic aspects are becoming considerably stronger than has been the case in the past. The agenda for culture is not only about issues of better cooperation on the cultural agenda or of increased funding, but also of the legal framework. In that regard, it is indeed true even within the European Union that, if culture is in competition with internal market law or competition law, it always draws the short straw in case of doubt. You will all remember the Lévai report: the Commissioner for the Internal Market and Services described collective management societies for online music as obstacles to competition on the internal market. Here culture clearly draws the shorter straw and is in a weaker position than European internal market law. Hence the urgent need, and tomorrow Parliament will decide the same way as the Committee on Culture and Education. The Unesco Convention must be applied not only to securing cultural diversity with regard to third countries, but also as a matter of the utmost urgency in our own European law. Our heartfelt plea to the Commissioner, therefore, is that we have just one time slot, and therefore need a proposal quickly for strengthening cultural diversity in European internal market law.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are discussing a pre-negotiated common position of Parliament and the Council on the revision of the Directive concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities. We can view this as a great success for Parliament, the Council and the Commission, so I would like to start by expressing my warmest thanks to my parliamentary colleagues from all political groups and from all the committees involved, especially the shadow rapporteurs from the Committee on Culture and Education, Henri Weber, Ignasi Guardans Cambó and Helga Trüpel. They have done much to make it possible for us to present a success, a joint result, today. My thanks also go to Commissioner Reding – Commissioner of the Year 2007, congratulations! – who tabled the proposal for the revision of the Directive with great resolution and willingness to cooperate, in equal measure, and worked on it with us. I would also like to thank the Council, specifically the German Presidency, under whose leadership it proved possible to achieve the common position, and the current Portuguese Presidency, which stalwartly defended the common position achieved, thereby enabling us to debate it today and vote on it tomorrow. ‘Television without frontiers’ is crucial for freedom of information and pluralism of the media in Europe. We therefore greatly welcome the fact that we have been able to update this Directive just in time. On the basis of the country of origin principle, we have achieved joint objectives for traditional and new forms of television, regardless of platform. For traditional TV, this mainly encompasses the right to short-term reporting Europe-wide, safeguards on better access for the disabled, better controls on advertising aimed at children, and independent national media supervision. However, we have also improved the financial bases for commercial broadcasting, not by increasing advertising – that still stands at a maximum of 12 minutes per hour – but by introducing more flexible rules. We have taken the difficult step of allowing product placement so that private TV broadcasters, in competition with Google and other rivals, will be able to offer free-to-air TV services in future. It was the European Parliament which worked to achieve adequate transparency directives here. For modern TV on the Internet, the principle which will apply after tomorrow’s decision and its ensuing implementation at national level is that TV will remain an economic and cultural product regardless of the technology used. That is the European model which we have safeguarded with this Directive for audiovisual media services, as it will be known in future. TV on the internet and mobile TV should also have a future in Europe, not only as an economic product but also as a core guarantee of freedom of information and media pluralism. That is why it is so important to have initiated this modernised Directive just in time. ‘Just in time’ means that the forthcoming negotiations on the telecoms package, which have now begun, as well as the deliberations on online content can take place against the backdrop of this clarified legal framework for traditional and new audiovisual media services. That is why I would ask you for your support in tomorrow’s vote so that we secure a broad majority in favour of progress in our European media policy.

 Mr President, I shall speak very briefly, since I have only a point about the translation to make. In order to avoid misunderstandings in the translation of the term ‘production aid’ and to relate it explicitly to the German original term Produktionshilfen, 
I ask for a linguistic clarification to the effect that, where the words ‘production aid’ are used in the text, they should, in the English version, be replaced by the term ‘production props’, and rendered in the French one by aide matérielle à la production
, and in German by Produktionshilfen.
 Ruth Hieronymi (PPE-DE

rapporteur
. – (DE)
 Madam President, I want first of all – Commissioner – to thank the Commission, and also the Council under both Austrian and Finnish Presidency for the outstanding way in which it cooperated with this House, but very particularly my fellow rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, who made it possible for the Committee on Culture and Education, the lead committee, to work so very well with the Committees on the Internal Market, the Economy, Industry, Civil Liberties and Gender Equality. Our common objective was and remains to keep television, a mass audiovisual medium, both an economic and cultural good in the future, for, in a shared internal market extending across Europe, freedom of information and diversity of opinion cannot be left to the market alone, and so it is vital that we should, today, proceed to revise the television directive, which covers analogue television services, but lacks as yet the legal certainty and clarity appropriate to the new digital services. It is the express wish of this House and of its committees that television and similar services should in future be evaluated on the basis of their content, and without reference to their technological platform. What is crucial is the primary purpose of the audiovisual mass medium in which content for information, education and entertainment purposes is produced and complied subject to editorial responsibility and then broadcast to the general public and transmitted via electronic networks, which means that these are clearly distinguished from the other services of the information society and in particular from those covered by the directive on electronic commerce. It is this legal clarity that the new audiovisual services need, and, by being taken into consideration in this directive, that is what they are getting; it is only when the primary purpose of this directive is fulfilled that it actually becomes effective, so let me reiterate, and make it abundantly clear, that this directive does not cover those emails that are private or not public, any more than it covers the electronic editions of newspapers, for they have nothing to do with its primary purpose. In the European Union, the country of origin principle is the foundation upon which the freedom of the media rests, and that same principle is very definitely present in this new directive, although it was also necessary to take account of the concerns of those Member States who see it being open to misuse or being circumvented or who fear that it will be. This, now, is where this House’s compromise is a very even-handed one, in that it takes account of both points of view with the end in mind of making the best possible use of the Lisbon process and hence of the economic strengths of the new electronic media. This means that we have achieved broad agreement on the scope and the country-of-origin principle, not to mention on such other matters as the joint regulation and self-regulation of the protection of young people and consumers, the right to short-term reporting, the promotion of European content and of better access for disabled people. It will become clear from the debate that we take a different line on advertising; like the Commission, I am in favour, not of more advertising – 12 minutes – but of greater flexibility. Even so, I had the painful experience of having to agree to a compromise on product placement. I very much hope that we will be able, by means of better labelling, to achieve a maximum of legal certainty and clarity for the consumers. Overall, though, the revision of the EU’s television directive is a real fitness programme for forward-looking European television, and I warmly invite you to give it your support. (Applause)

 Mr President, today finds us debating MEDIA 2007, the third generation support programme for the European film industry. I want to extend the warmest thanks to the members of the Committee on Culture and Education and to the advisory committees for their excellent cooperation, and particularly too to Commissioner Reding and her staff, who, together with this House, have tried to do everything they could to help the European audio-visual industry develop further and be a success. It was exactly a year ago today, on 25 October 2005, that we in this House adopted this draft programme by a broad majority. We had wanted to adopt the programme in good time – and by that I mean early – so that it could be available to Europe’s film-makers with effect from 1 January 2007, but the European Council was not, alas, far-sighted enough to stick to this timetable, and required us, in the first instance, to go through some difficult financial negotiations. The MEDIA 2007 programme is structured in the same way as its successful predecessors, MEDIA and MEDIA PLUS, covering training, development and sales in the audiovisual sector, but not production, which is a matter for the Member States to deal with. What makes the MEDIA programme so extraordinarily important is the fact that the audio-visual sector is, as we are all aware, one of the fastest growing economic sectors not only in Europe, but throughout the world. If Europe wants to keep up, it has to get on the right track. The MEDIA programme represents a response to two core problems with the European audio-visual market, the first of which is its fragmentation, which is attributable primarily to our cultural, linguistic and national diversity; while that is a treasure, and one of the most important treasures Europe possesses, it also presents great challenges in terms of market development. Secondly, the audio-visual market in Europe suffers from chronic under-capitalisation. The MEDIA programme does a good job of responding to those challenges. The MEDIA programme helped fund 90% of all films produced for export within Europe, and every euro invested through it brings another twenty in follow-up investment, and so it was very definitely right that the Commission, and Commissioner Reding in particular, should push as they did for adequate funding for this on the part of the European Union, and proposed that this should amount to the sum of one billion euros. It is unfortunate that the Council could not, in the course of negotiations, be prevailed upon to accept this sum, which was reduced to EUR 671 million, so we have managed to maintain the status quo without achieving any further development. The new programme does, nevertheless, incorporate three priorities. The first is digitisation, the second enhanced cooperation at every level, and the third improved access to financial institutions specialising in the funding of films. All I can say to all that is that we are speaking out strongly in favour of a quick start for the programme, of its successful implementation and of what we hope will be adequate funding next time round.

 Mr President, I too, speaking on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, would like to extend warm thanks to all Members concerned, and particularly to Mr Böge, the rapporteur, for the work they have put in, which has an effect on programmes in the fields of lifelong learning, youth, culture, media and the citizens’ Europe. If you believe the pious utterances of politicians in every one of our 25 Member States, these programmes are part of the European Union’s most important field of action, but when it comes to making available the funding that young people need, the 25 governments keep out of sight and make swingeing cuts, particularly to important investments in our young people’s futures. It is for that reason that I want to tell the Commission and this house how grateful the Culture Committee is to them for not merely talking but also acting and, in their proposals, sketching out appropriate dimensions for these programmes. Let me give you just two examples to show why I am talking about the number of young people and not just about the financial aspects. The first example is Erasmus – the student exchange – and both institutions suggested that 285 000 exchange students per annum is a workable figure, only for the 25 governments – in the person of the Council – to make a drastic cut of over 50% in that number and reduce it to 140 000. The cut made to Leonardo – the training programme – was from 150 000 to 36 000. It is for that reason that I am very appreciative of all those Members who helped to ensure that what emerged at the end of deliberations at least bore Parliament's stamp and that the sums of EUR 800 million for lifelong learning and EUR 300 million for other programmes achieved some sort of credibility in this area.

 Mr President, I should like to express my sincere thanks and congratulations to the Commissioner on the presentation of the draft revision of the Television without Frontiers Directive. Over recent years, Parliament has campaigned continuously for this and called for equivalent content to be subject to equivalent legislation, even in the digital age. In this respect, the Commissioner’s proposal is, in my view, a ‘fitness programme’ for the introduction of digital television in Europe. My questions today relate to just two issues. Firstly, the Commissioner has said that she intends to provide for increased self-control and co-regulation. Could she elaborate on this for us? Secondly, what are the consequences of product placement for public service broadcasting in Europe? Are there any implications as regards financial aid?
 Ruth Hieronymi (PPE-DE

(DE)
 Mr President, here in this House, we have a lot to say about issues relating to technology. What we are talking about now, though, is broadcasting. Broadcasting is not just technology; it is fundamental to three areas in our society that should be important to us: culture, social cohesion and the development of democracy. That is why it is not enough to talk only about technology. Technology is very important; being the engine of the digital revolution in broadcasting, it is also the engine for the creation of urgently-needed jobs with good prospects. It is for that reason, though, that broadcasting is both a cultural and an economic asset. I appeal to the Commission, as a matter of urgency, to take broadcasting’s ambivalence and duality more seriously than it has done in its previous papers and communications. It is for that reason that I welcome the resolution from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and very much hope that we will, in future, be able to develop cooperation between it and the Committee for Culture and Education. The resolution is a very good basis on which to do that, and I urge the Commission to take it seriously if it really does want to accomplish the changeover in the next few years. There is a pressing need for policy goals setting out how this is to be done, not only in terms of the technology involved, but also of cultural, social and democratic cooperation. If you really do want to empower the Member States to do that, then issues of subsidies and of European competition law need to be resolved as a matter of urgency. It will be apparent to the House that we take this resolution very seriously, and we urge the Commission, for the public’s sake, to do likewise.

 Mr President, Commissioner, MEDIA 2007 represents the third generation of the MEDIA programme of support for the European film industry, which has a great and twofold objective, in that we want to help promote European culture across all borders, while at the same time promoting the creation of jobs with a significant future in the audiovisual sector. MEDIA 2007 is a joint effort, and so I very warmly thank the Commission – and you, Commissioner Reding, in particular – for the excellent cooperation, and your staff as well. I also wish to thank the Luxembourg and British Presidencies for their good cooperation and particularly, of course, the members of the Committee on Culture and Education and all the committees that advised us. The first thing to be said about MEDIA 2007 is that the programme is as urgently needed as ever it was, for European films are still outnumbered in Europe, with an average of 70% of the films shown in our cinemas still being of American origin. There are three essential reasons why this is so; the first is that cultural and linguistic diversity in Europe, while being our great asset, also makes for highly fragmented audiovisual markets, which – and this is the second reason – are largely characterised by small and medium-sized enterprises, which – thirdly – suffer from chronic under-capitalisation. All these considerations means that the MEDIA programme will be urgently needed over the next seven years. At the same time, it is evident that MEDIA is a highly successful programme, in that nine out of ten films shown outside their country of origin were supported by it. What now remains to be done is to increase European cinema’s overall market share, and that is why this third programme is to have the same priorities as before: training, development, distribution and promotion. Production itself remains a matter for the Member States. What changes does the programme propose to make? One is a substantial increase in funding. Let me say that I am particularly grateful to the Commissioner for having, from the very outset, been firm in demanding an increase to EUR 1.055 billion. You can be sure – as can the Council – that this House as a whole will not be prepared to go below that amount, which represents the minimum that is needed for the audiovisual sector over the next seven years. Apart from that, what else has changed? In every area, digitalisation is a priority; it is the technology of the future, which must, over the coming years, be made use of and developed. Secondly, there is a need for more cooperation at every level. Among other things, the European Union’s participation in the European Audiovisual Observatory will be of value, as will closer cooperation with Eurimages, but there is also a need for the networks to be strengthened. Let me close by saying something about the amendments that remain to be considered, particularly the amendments on the protection of juveniles tabled by the Union for a Europe of the Nations Group. Protection of the young is something of which we are all in favour, but it is not something that the film programme primarily exists to do; there are other programmes to do that, and so, on this point, we cannot agree to what you ask. My warmest thanks, though, to the House as a whole; we have shared in putting this programme together, and that is the best foundation for its future success.

 Mr President, the television directive is indeed one that gives the public a direct experience of the benefits of Europe and the European Union. Protection of young people, protection of consumers’ interests, cultural diversity, European content and European productions – all these things are of value and the ‘television without frontiers’ directive guarantees them to viewers in all the European Union’s Member States. I am very grateful to Mr Weber for highlighting the success of this and demanding those things that we need if it is to be continued. As we are all aware, people not only have a television at home, but are also, and increasingly, able to receive programmes over the Internet or via their computers and mobile phones. It is not acceptable that the same transmissions should be subject to different regulations depending on where they are broadcast from, and so it is indeed the case that this directive urgently needs to be revised. In a couple of weeks’ time, the Commission and the British Presidency will be holding a major conference on this subject in Liverpool. I strongly urge not only the Commission and the Member States, but also businesses and broadcasters, to be ready and willing to really carry forward this directive. In particular, I urge, firstly, that the digital divide be reduced, for we need access to all media. Secondly, the television directive’s objectives – ensuring cultural diversity, the dual system, protection of young people and consumers – need to be guaranteed appropriately in the new media. It is for that reason that this report enjoys broad support from this House.

 Mr President, I would like to start by extending, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, warm thanks to our rapporteur Mr Böge, who has had the courage to set out unambiguous priorities in his draft report, one – and an explicit one – being in the sphere of education and training, which are key factors in growth, social integration and competitiveness. Nor has he limited himself to sounding off on the subject, for he has added almost a billion euros to this draft Budget for the great educational programmes Erasmus and Leonardo and for youth exchanges. Although Mr Böge also put the case for an increase for culture, the amount of this falls lamentably short of the amount that is desirable as a matter of urgency. Regrettable though this is in view of the frequent invocation of the soul of Europe, I would like, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, to ask the House to back these proposals tomorrow with a large majority. Now that the Council has, in the referenda, been sent a clear signal from the public, I call upon it to get its priorities right by accepting what Parliament has proposed through its rapporteur and, in the European Budget, taking public participation particularly seriously, as well as education and culture. Before the referenda, 72% of the public described themselves as inadequately or not at all informed. It is for that reason that the Council must learn its lesson where the financial situation is concerned.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is because the European Union is an economic and values-based community that we require – and, in the treaties, have hitherto ensured – not only a working internal market, but also, at the same time, and with equal status, the safeguarding of cultural diversity. The safeguarding of cultural diversity in the European Union is not something undertaken in opposition to the Member States; on the contrary, it explicitly signifies the safeguarding of cultural diversity within them. If though, we are to safeguard that cultural diversity around the world, we can only do so together – within the European Union and within UNESCO. We demand that the Member States and the Commission should do three things in respect of the negotiations. Firstly, the UNESCO negotiations should be concluded in good time for the next rounds of negotiations on international trade law within the WTO and GATS. The reason why October 2005 is so crucial is that we would otherwise be put at a disadvantage in terms of trade law, and there is the risk of UNESCO being too late in producing a legal instrument. Secondly, we need an effective instrument. By effective, I mean that it really does ensure equality, and ‘equality of arms’ for the legal instruments in business and cultural law. Thirdly, the European Union needs to take cultural diversity seriously in its own lawmaking, which means that it must not, in the services directive, be absorbed into business law. Instead, audiovisual services must be taken out of the draft services directive if we are not to lose credibility in the eyes of UNESCO or become less capable of negotiating with it. (Applause)

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I very much welcome the draft report by Mr Schnellhardt and would like to thank him for his fine work. After the numerous crises in recent years in connection with products of animal origin that pose a risk to human and animal health, a comprehensive statutory regulation is essential. A revision of the current regulation was necessary. Now, as before, we need to ensure a high degree of safety. Although we essentially support the report, there are a few points which give me cause for concern. Many points in the regulation have been made less stringent and thus make trade in animal by-products somewhat easier. Let me give some examples of what I am talking about. It is permitted to use certain Category 1 material in pet food. Category 2 or 3 material may, irrespective of the risk associated with it, be disposed of more easily, under official supervision, if there are only small quantities of waste per week. The risk associated with animal by-products of any category is only partly determined by its quantity. It remains the case that it is the European Commission that will enact the implementing regulation and, like its predecessor, the draft contains a lot of authorisations for the Commission. This means that the Commission can lay down comprehensive and fundamental regulations for handling animal by-products in the comitology procedure, with the result that Parliament – as is unfortunately often the case – is excluded.

 I have abstained from voting on the climate change report. This does not mean that I believe the entire report to be bad. However, it did combine correct scientific data and false polemics. All the work done by the committee was one-sided and the wide range of scientific opinion was not reflected. It is not possible to produce a balanced report on this basis. Unfortunately this type of approach has become more common in the run-up to the European elections.

 I voted against the Catania report. I am astounded that the House’s services even declared this report admissible in its present form. It persistently infringes the principle of subsidiarity. In terms of its content, virtually everything is worthy of criticism. The nation-states must not let themselves be incapacitated or disempowered when it comes to fundamental rights. This represents an attempt to push through, to the detriment of the majority, minority rights that cannot be implemented at national level. A positive attitude to abortion is inconceivable to me. The actual subject, human rights and their implementation over the last four years, is not mentioned.

 I rejected this report. The demands it makes go way beyond what I understand by transparency. I consider even the publication of MEPs’ attendance registers and voting lists dangerous without extensive additional channels of explanation. I have a high attendance record and am therefore above suspicion. It is important to preserve legal protection of personality for MEPs, too. Europe could increase transparency by publishing public meetings of the Council and the Commission to begin with, before forcing MEPs to lay themselves bare. In addition, there must be confidentiality among the institutions during difficult negotiation phases.

 I fully support the efforts to reduce the contribution to climate change that is probably made by human beings. Nevertheless, we did not support the compromise on the EU Emissions Trading Scheme that has been negotiated. Legislating in a great hurry is unacceptable and undemocratic. The extremely fast legislative procedure and the fact that the Council documents were presented only a few days ago meant that, in my opinion, a professional examination of the documents, and thus proper legislation, was impossible. This is all the more unacceptable considering that this legislation imposes a high financial burden on the European public. According to several studies, the climate action and renewable energy package costs approximately EUR 70 to 100 billion, and there is the threat of whole industries moving to other parts of the world. I could not approve a package of this scope in a fast-tracked procedure. Legislative proposals as important as this must evolve in the course of a well-ordered procedure with several readings.

 I voted in favour despite having strong reservations. On the one hand, it is right to urge the automobile industry to make CO2
 reductions. On the other, we wish to express strong reservations (see point 3, in particular). 1. The proposal does not make equal demands on all European manufacturers, but particularly affects manufacturers of large vehicles, who are also innovators. This concerns German manufacturers, in particular. 2. There has been no impact assessment. The first draft, which laid down an 80% (as opposed to the present 60%) slope for the limit-value curve, has been withdrawn. 3. Fines have been laid down arbitrarily, particularly in phase 4. This will lead to two different price levels for CO2
: the market price used on the stock market and a price laid down arbitrarily for the automobile industry.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mrs Grossetête on her draft report on variations to the terms of marketing authorisations for medicinal products. I must make two brief comments on what previous speakers have said. As I see it, new medicinal products represent an opportunity to treat and cure health conditions, and the risk is proportionate. In addition, in the Federal Republic of Germany, for example, active ingredients already exist in many pharmaceutical forms and under many names without any increase in risk. The main focus of this Regulation, however, is the simplification of variations; that is, of the partial extension or variation of the pharmaceutical form of a medicinal product. Current practice is extremely cumbersome and entails a great deal of bureaucracy for companies, and the competent authorities are occupied with relatively inefficient measures. Therefore, the amendment creates a rare win-win situation. The report significantly improves safety and reliability in the internal market. In addition, thanks to the work in committee, numerous other interests have been taken into account that further expedite or simplify the procedure. For example, sufficient account has been taken of the issue of national authorisations, thus avoiding a duplication of effort. Due account has also been taken of the interests of Germany and German pharmaceutical companies. The draft has been aligned with omnibus proposal EU/2008/0032. The extension of marketing authorisations under other names has been expressly simplified. It has been made easier to supplement or extend product characteristics. I am as satisfied and positive today about the report by Mrs Grossetête as I was critical about the Jørgensen report yesterday evening. The Grossetête report goes in the right direction: towards the Lisbon process objective of becoming the most efficient knowledge-based area in the world. I support this report.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, climate protection is the aim of us all. There are different methods, however, and they are not always recognisable at first glance. I have no objections to green procurement in cases where it makes sense. I reject this directive, anyway, aware though I am that my doing so will change little in terms of the overall outcome in Parliament. Nonetheless, I shall explain the reasons for my decision. A first reading agreement on an important co-decision issue such as this, where more than a technical adjustment is at stake, undermines democracy. The fact is that the rapporteur, whose work I very much value, does not represent Parliament’s vote but only that of a committee and it is on this basis that he deals with the Council and the Commission. Parliament is ultimately excluded. Secondly, the directive has been amended by the compromises to such an extent that it is more or less without content, yet entails considerable bureaucratic expenditure for local authorities. Bureaucracy is not free of charge, but it is often pointless. We are in this case contributing needlessly to further dissatisfaction with Europe on the part of Europeans and our local authorities. Since many substantial parts of the directive have been toned down, I would have wanted the Council and the Commission to withdraw the whole thing. All the issues that are still relevant have already been regulated in the European context, or else no regulation is necessary or the issue concerned would have been better resolved on the basis of subsidiarity. Withdrawal would have sent out a signal that together we are taking the removal of bureaucracy seriously. In my area there are, for example, very many local authorities that already make the relevant decisions via the EMAS system. The money expended in this way would have done a hundred times more for climate protection if it had been spent on methods for insulating public buildings. For me, the question arises as to whether the directive is being pursued for its own sake or in order to bring about action. Most Europeans will not understand either approach.

I voted against this report in the final vote because I take the struggle against climate change seriously and cannot subscribe to dogmatic and apocalyptic formulations that would spread alarm among the people of Europe. The report presents scientific findings with a 60–70 % probability as proven facts. If I were one of the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse in John’s Book of Revelation, I would rather be sitting on the white horse than on the pale one. Climate change is a sensitive issue that cannot be reduced to slogans.

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Sacconi, ladies and gentlemen, my Group supports the motion for a resolution. At the same time, I would like to thank Mr Sacconi for his work. REACH, as you have just said, is intended to be the world’s best, most dynamic and most advanced chemicals legislation; that is precisely how we envisage it in our Lisbon Process. That is why it is also important now that implementation should proceed with the same dynamism and at the same pace. We can also help to eliminate a great deal of red tape by streamlining structures and speeding up procedures. It is the wish of all parties that animal experiments remain a last resort and that the number of animal experiments be sharply reduced. Vertebrates and primates enjoy special protection. It is imperative that the validation of alternative and non-animal tests be speeded up and simplified. In order to save time, there must be scope for decisions on individual cases, for example. Accordingly, implementation must involve the pre-selection of test methods, ranked by quality; in other words, the method that seems to have the greatest likelihood of success would be validated first. It is important that phase-in periods be shortened and that the number of stages in the phase-in process be reduced, that Directors-General be involved in the decision-making process, that our agencies be more closely interlinked, that procedures be transparent and that information, including information to Parliament, be imparted without delay. I am very hopeful at the present time, partly because of the content of the letter you wrote to us, Mr Verheugen, along with Commissioners Dimas and Potočnik, that we can make rapid progress in this matter and that REACH really will prove in practice to be the world’s most dynamic chemicals legislation.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Schlyter has just said, 10 thousand tonnes is a very large amount. Just to give you an idea of the scale, it is enough to poison approximately 4 million people a day. About a year ago, we discussed the dossier at first reading. Sufficient regulation of metallic mercury compounds and mercury has been arranged. It has been ensured that this material does not return to the European Union. Safe storage has also been sufficiently evaluated. The actual restrictions make sense given mercury’s increasing toxicity, although I would have liked to see more far-reaching restrictions in many areas. The compromise works very well, and at this point I would like to congratulate Mr Papadimoulis on his work. It does not meet all expectations, but it does meet a great many of them. As a former local and regional politician, I also have a great deal of sympathy for our Spanish Members, who have to find a solution to the Almadén problem that will be workable for everyone. The compromise is so worthwhile, however, that we must not allow it to miscarry because of this issue. There ought to be enough time before tomorrow’s vote for the Commission to make an appropriate statement of some kind. It is important to accept the compromise now, because otherwise, there is a risk that we will not reach agreement in this parliamentary term. I would like to mention one further matter: the mercury strategy is not yet complete. The Commission’s two panels of experts continue to rate amalgam as safe. I cannot agree with this opinion.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, may I express my thanks to Mrs Willmott for the fair and constructive nature of our cooperation in committee. The report reflects the high priority attached to health and safety at work in the 27 Member States of the European Union. The key safeguards are emphasised and weighted. The cost of accident prevention and safety is high, but let me stress unequivocally that good health is priceless. The important points are that the provisions should be transposed and applied in all Member States and that the European Union should help Member States to transpose the rules and should offer them advice rather than meting out punishments. I believe that particular attention should be focused on small and medium-sized enterprises, which need assistance in this field if they are to remain competitive. In this respect we call on the Commission to create the appropriate basic conditions for SMEs in cases where these conditions do not yet exist and to improve them where they do exist. The protection afforded to employees must not depend on the country in which they work or the size of their company. In the brief time at my disposal I only wish to list a few points of particular importance, such as better protection against hepatitis and AIDS and the continued systematic removal of asbestos from workplaces, however complex and expensive that may be. I believe we must focus on hepatitis B and especially on those people who run a high occupational risk of infection by hepatitis viruses, in other words medics, paramedics, carers and first aiders. In the realm of first aid, efforts must also cover those people in many Member States who, in addition to their daytime jobs, perform unpaid voluntary work with the emergency services. I believe it was very important that the report stuck rigidly to the subject and avoided citing examples, which might well have engendered prejudgement of many issues. Thank you for our fruitful cooperation. The EPP-ED Group endorses the report.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, many thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Liese, for his good report, and to Mr Jarzembowski. I believe that, overall, the compromises are very workable. Politics often depends on symbols, and we are sending a clear signal here: it is the first legislative proposal since the Spring Summit. Thus we are beginning actively to implement climate protection. The seven key points of this report – the commencement of emissions trading, the reference period, the number of permits, the use of the proceeds, exceptions for smaller aircraft and the method of calculation – have, in my view, been sufficiently and reliably addressed in the compromises. I do not wish for any derogations, although I do believe a special additional arrangement for the outermost regions is required, so that these areas are not disadvantaged. I believe that the proposal is very good and that competition has been sufficiently acknowledged. We should not forget: even if 100% of the allowances are auctioned – purely theoretically, as we have just heard – that is a sum of EUR 2 billion, definitely a manageable sum for the airlines, which will, no doubt, have an effect on the setting of prices. However, I do not envisage any problems with this, including in connection with the large number of flights. I should like to see the EU push further ahead with this in the context of climate protection, and I hope that we can convince all the other major competing airlines to join this agreement.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the action programme on health and the prevention of cardiovascular disease are very closely related subjects. I would like first of all to offer Mr Trakatellis my sincere congratulations on his tireless fight for this programme. Prevention is better than cure. Prevention means longer life, better life, better quality of life, less medical care, less sickness, lower sickness costs. I am sure we would have liked more resources than 20 cents per head of population per year. We are however modest and conduct many action programmes for little money. We can only set priorities of course, and I must make it absolutely clear that we are talking here about prevention, about educating people, and not about treatment, which after all is a subsidiary matter and the responsibility of the nation states. Prevention means stopping diseases from occurring in the first place, especially in the area of cardiovascular diseases, involving heart attacks and strokes, of tumour diseases and their causes, as with lung cancer and smoking, of unhealthy lifestyles such as the wrong kind of food or even doping in sport, of accidents and accident prevention, and of research and statistics, where the aim is to detect and understand diseases better in order to develop better guidelines for treatment. I will now reply to the oral question from Mr Ouzký, to whom I also express my thanks here. Much can be done to prevent cardiovascular disease by changing one’s lifestyle: exercise, health, sport, balanced nutrition and ultimately also avoiding trans fatty acids. We also need a catchy slogan for cardiovascular prevention, so that people know what is at stake. We could say, for example, ‘Save your heart, save your life’ or in German ‘Herzlos kannst du nicht leben
’. EUR 325 million for prevention over five years is not much. I visited a German heart hospital this morning. There, 200 million were invested in just one year!

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this measuring devices directive is intended to remove around 30 tonnes of mercury from circulation, not very much but nevertheless an appreciable quantity. The dangers of mercury are well known, its neurotoxicity undisputed. Where human health is at risk, I believe the strict principle of substitution applies. Where mercury is absolutely necessary and there are no alternatives, it can be retained under strict conditions. Exceptions are therefore permitted only where there are no significant risks or where no alternatives are yet available. The exceptions include sphygmomanometers for special applications and old measuring instruments, and it goes without saying that the number of old measuring instruments will continue to fall of its own accord. I believe the transitional period of two years for barometers is quite sufficient. The decisive thing for me is the harmonisation of the internal market, which is taken a step further here. I approve the common position.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, mercury is everywhere: for example, it crosses the placental barrier. Mercury is a metal that is liquid at room temperature and readily evaporates. The limit value for metallic, inorganic mercury in blood is 25 micrograms, and that for organic mercury compounds is 100 micrograms. I shall not go into the effects of mercury poisoning here. I am sure you are all familiar with Minamoto in Japan. The issue here is not only the economic pros and cons for our Community, therefore, but also the protection of the health of our fellow citizens and the protection of an intact environment. The report by Mr Papadimoulis, whom I thank for this work, will mean that there is an end to the export of mercury compounds from Europe and that the EU starts work on the safe storage of the existing material. At the same time, it makes sense for all mercury compounds to be covered by the export ban where a substitute is available, which is the case for almost all uses. In addition, as far as we know, we as exporters of a hazardous substance are not able – and, pursuant to our WTO commitments, not entitled – to demand that the recipients make the mercury traceable, which means that the whereabouts of the mercury are unclear and that there is a very definite possibility that it could return to the Community. I consider Article 175 of the common treaties applicable to this Regulation. The tightening of the rules, the shortening of the deadlines and the inclusion of mercury compounds in the export and import provisions are both appropriate and toxicologically consistent. I am sure there is still room for negotiation to reach agreement on the deadlines. With regard to the final storage of mercury, attention is being paid to research, as it has not proved possible thus far to find a reliable storage method for this in use on an industrial scale anywhere in the world. The quantities involved run into the thousands of tonnes. I endorse the report in the original version presented by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.

We have succeeded in getting the crucial improvements on which we had decided accepted, those being the clarification of reprocessing, where the Commission has promised us a directive specifically relating to the subject; clarification of the position of software, of databases and the phasing out and labelling of carcinogenic and mutagenic substances. I now have two comments of a technical nature. First, there is an amendment to paragraph (4), in which, contrary to what had been agreed, part of a sentence had not been deleted. In English, this reads as follows:  ‘and a correlation table between those provisions and this Directive’  (DE)

 My reason for rejecting the Howitt report is that the most essential characteristic of Corporate Social Responsibility is voluntarism rather than dirigisme. Mandatory social and environmental reporting goes against the Lisbon Strategy and militates against the reduction of bureaucracy to such an extent that I find myself unable to support it.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, health knows no frontiers, or at least, one hopes that that is the case. In exactly the same way health services should not stop at borders either, in other words, they should be of high quality and available to every citizen of the EU wherever he or she may be. We are now at the beginning of a debate rather than the end of one, so a vigorous debate is desirable and will get us where we want to go; health is not a commodity, and the internal market is, after all, no more than the space within which these services are provided. These services need to be subject to special rules, with questions relating to the guarantee of quality provided, patients’ safety, the safety of medicines and of medical products, to redress in the event of faulty or failed procedures, and to centres of excellence being examined in depth. The patient, who is to be protected, is the subject of particular concern, being, in cases of doubt, the weaker party, and often, indeed, the one who is at the mercy of others. We are, as matter of principle, in favour of patient mobility and of the mobility of service providers, but reimbursement, which is a quite essential element in the cross-border trade in medical services, is subsidiary, and this has to be made plain right now, even though things are only at an early stage. I do not, at present, see any chance of a European health insurance fund, and do not indeed think one is germane to our purpose, on the grounds that all the 27 national systems have their own problems, and, here too, where reimbursement is concerned, we are talking not about an open market, but rather about state-run and dirigiste systems. In my own country, which has an extraordinarily complex system of payment to beneficiaries, such an opening-up would raise at once the discrimination against the country’s own nationals, since the benefits paid are capped rather than open-ended. It think it still appropriate that primary responsibility for this dossier should remain with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety rather than with the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Mrs Jackson and to Mr Blokland for the good work they have done. Waste – of which the 27 EU Member States produce 1.3 billion tonnes per annum – is a core issue rather than a marginal one. As I see it, it is easy to define the goals but difficult to achieve them. Preventing waste must be first on the list, and, if the amount of waste generated is to remain stable until 2012 and decrease thereafter, a number of steps will have to be taken, among them an eco-design product directive, more responsibility on the part of manufacturers, the traceability of hazardous substances and a properly thought-out recycling system. It is more important to recycle waste than to reprocess it, just as in medicine, it is more important to rehabilitate people than to give them a disability pension. These things hang together perfectly. No quarter is being given in the arguments about this. In my own country, the municipal service-providers’ association has over EUR 60 billion in turnover and precious little love of open competition, of which I take a positive view, seeing it as benefiting both customers and the environment. We need only to lay down the ground rules for this competition, not the details of it. It is the portability of waste that needs to be regulated by reference to the materials and the risks involved, not the issue of who should transport it. My thinking on this subject revolves round the future tasks of recycling and product design, for it is here that I see Europe having the chance of building a future on technology and the protection of the environment. I am all in favour of an open internal market of the kind on which we in the Committee on the Environment have agreed; it is absurd to believe that more and more new and restrictive measures will get Europe any further along the path mapped out by the Lisbon Strategy. I also believe that municipal service providers stand a good chance when they compete in a growing market.

My compliments to Mr Sacconi on his work. As the previous speakers have demonstrated, the text may be voluminous, but it remains open to a very broad interpretation. This proposal bears the clear imprint of Parliament. There has been a marked change in the world of chemicals and the faith in their safety since Seveso and Bhopal. The fact that all the previous speakers welcome the compromise only with reservations is proof that it is relatively balanced. Now, however, the Council and the Commission are called upon to start up a functional, powerful Agency as quickly as possible. This will cost money and generate red tape. The Agency is the key to the functioning of REACH. The recruitment of sufficient numbers of the relevant experts represents a challenge. The Agency must work quickly, accurately and without making mistakes so as to improve the reputation of REACH as a model for other states and associations of states. In my opinion, the issue of intellectual property has been sufficiently regulated. We shall have to monitor carefully whether we can live with the present form of substitution in the long run, and we shall have to monitor just as carefully the strain the legislative procedure puts on small and medium-sized enterprises. Only when all aspects are equally successful will REACH have met the requirements arising from the Lisbon process. REACH must not degenerate into a typecase that is still not full even after two or three decades; Europe will have to be judged on its implementability. With regard to the overlapping fields, I would make a plea for the deletion of medical devices, as these rules are congruous and adequate in themselves, and leaving medical devices in would mean incalculable delays in the authorisation of medicinal products. We shall consider in due course whether the present function of REACH is adequate, and whether the rules are too strict or too lax. We must not use comitology to withdraw from involvement in further developments, but rather must monitor application regularly and with a critical eye.

 The fact that I reject the report on Bulgaria has nothing to do with any refusal on my part to acknowledge that the country belongs to the European community of states or to rejoice in the imminent arrival of new Members of this House. What it does have to do with is the fact that the report is, in my view, seriously flawed as regards the way in which it discusses nuclear power or its too muted calls to the Commission for the safeguard clauses to be carefully reviewed and, if necessary, applied in good time.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by giving my sincere thanks to Mr Schlyter for his report, which shows great commitment. PFOS, a halogenated hydrocarbon, is toxic to humans, and also both carcinogenic and mutagenic. There are no scientific limit values for this category of substances, only empirical threshold values. These substances are not biodegradable, they are fat soluble and, once produced, they persist almost indefinitely. In addition, once they have been absorbed by the human body, it is virtually impossible for it to eliminate them. It is highly likely that PFOA has a very similar or identical effect in medical and toxicological terms, even though the body of scientific data on this does not yet have any conclusive evidential value. REACH will probably apply to this, and the substitution principle will play a decisive role, although, personally, I always have reservations about this. For all my enthusiasm for the economy and for value added, as a Christian I do not want to balance value added against human life. I am alarmed by the values of these chemicals measured in both marine and freshwater fish. Now – rightly and with a clear conscience – we are going further than the original proposal of the Commission and the Council. The threshold value has been lowered massively by almost two powers of ten. The number of derogations for chromium plating has been reduced significantly. Logically, the derogation for fire-fighting foams has been deleted, as unlimited quantities of these can be released into the environment. The derogation for closed systems has been deleted, as it is scarcely possible to prove that these are sealed. On the whole, I should like to express my thanks for the constructive cooperation I have enjoyed, and above all for the speed at which this issue has been dealt with, since we were able to reach a workable compromise in less than three months.

 I voted against this report, not because I wish to denigrate Mr Hegy's work, but because subsidiarity is being treated with contempt and the EU and its institutions are interfering in national matters. I do not think that this is justified. This tendency for Europe to continually interfere in the daily lives of its citizens, even when it is not necessary, is one of the primary reasons why people are becoming so disenchanted with Europe.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to join the chorus of good wishes to Mr Bowis, who has proved once more that, for him, health policy is a passion rather than a duty. Successful policy and successful psychotherapy have one thing in common: both require a great deal of openness, honesty, patience and commitment. We are discussing here an issue that is interesting and widespread yet largely neglected in the European Community: mental health. The WHO defines health as a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing. It is also realistic to achieve these three objectives in this order. When dealing with mental health, we note a dramatic increase in psychological illnesses in the Union. There is a wide palette of symptoms, causes, diagnoses and therapies in terms of both pathogenicity and molecular biology: depression, schizophrenia, borderline psychosis, bulimia, anorexia, phobias, neuroses and mania, to name but a few. I do not wish to go into detail on toxicological and environmental causes here – that would be a whole dossier in itself. I would like to show some possible ways in which we, the European Union, could help in the field of prevention, ways in which we could reduce the burden of suffering of those with mental ill health, could recognise the early stages of the illness in time and could thus prevent the onset. I should like to give just a few statistics. One in four will fall ill; there are 58 000 suicides and ten times as many attempted suicides each year. We see suicide as something difficult, demonic, impossible to grasp, and feel obliged to prevent it. Suffering from a psychological disorder means being stigmatised, whilst psychological illness often involves feelings of inferiority, and the history of Europe has often seen psychiatric institutions misused for political purposes. We have the opportunity to call on our national governments to do more than before. This call does not mean we are interfering in subsidiarity, but that we want to suggest action points and demonstrate a pan-European approach for enhancing human dignity and reducing discrimination, for example healthy families within which children can grow up and equal opportunities throughout the Union, both within Europe and within the Member States. Our strategy must comprise comprehensive treatment close to patients’ home areas. The treatment must be holistic: that is, must involve both body, mind and social environment. Compulsory treatment can be considered only as a last resort, and abuse of alcohol and both legal and illegal drugs is to be validated and included in this global approach. The focus here is on prevention. Today, with this report, we are opening a new chapter, and it is to be hoped that it will soon be enlarged upon in a White Paper.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my compliments to Mr Adamou on his excellent and detailed report, which is very good in terms of content. We have founded the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the ECDC, in Stockholm in good time to ensure that we are equipped for our coming tasks. When it comes to the possibility of an influenza pandemic, the European added value of which we are all so fond is clear to see: joint planning, joint crisis management, joint coordination, joint logistics and joint travel restrictions are being implemented, and joint virostatics, joint vaccines and joint stockpiling are needed. We have solidarity in cases of disaster: Europe is called upon in cases of disaster, and joint action and cooperation have priority over subsidiarity. In this connection, we urgently require an open, honest and rapid exchange of information within the Member States, and the ECDC and the Commission need to collect and monitor this data. I should also like to take this opportunity to thank the Commission. I am very sparing with my words of thanks, which makes them all the more significant. Many thanks for so quickly agreeing to make EUR 100 000 million available for aid both here and in the developing world. I should also like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Regional Development for their willingness to include the pandemic as part of the Solidarity Fund. We all hope that the pandemic will remain a fictional, theoretical exercise, and will never occur, but I am optimistic that we are well prepared for the possibility of an outbreak.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by expressing my thanks to Mrs Klass for her good work in connection with both readings of this draft directive. I wish her well in maintaining her resilient stance. We are largely in agreement in committee on the thrust of our aims, as you know, and we shall defend them resolutely against the Council and the Commission. The groundwater directive is ultimately about prevention and rehabilitation, and I personally find the preventive approach more appealing. It goes without saying that all the people of Europe should have access to groundwater of sufficiently high quality. What should groundwater comprise apart from water? Nothing, in my view, apart from naturally occurring minerals and dissolved substances. The quality of water is not the same throughout Europe. On geological grounds alone, that could never be the case, nor is it desirable or necessary, but at the end of the day we want high-quality water with no adverse impact on public health to be available to all Europeans. Up to 80% of drinking water is obtained from groundwater in various countries, such as Germany and Austria and much of southern England. The availability of pure groundwater will be a determinant factor in future corporate location decisions. Failure to protect water and to keep it clean from the outset means accepting a wide range of extra expenses and long-term contamination of water resources. I believe the proposed directive is consistent with the Water Framework Directive and the Nitrates Directive, as is only right and proper. For nitrates and pesticides, however, we have no need to make any further exceptions, since, as Mr Florenz also said, responsible farmers are able to live with the existing limits. I support the draft directive.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me first express my thanks to Mr Seeber for his commendable treatment of this draft directive. We all know how many reasons there are for these increasingly horrific flood disasters. Fortunately, not all of us have had to experience such disasters. Eighty per cent of our European rivers cross borders and are thus international watercourses, which means that we can all benefit from a set of European rules. At the same time, we have to emphasise that subsidiarity is a very basic principle and must not be infringed. I am therefore torn between these two positions. Flood prevention is a classic example of solidarity. I live by the lower stretches of a river, and I know what it means when there are no flood defences upstream, when there are no compensation areas, detention basins or the like, when the upper reaches are constantly being penned in, with the accompanying increase in the speed of flow. The draft directive guarantees a minimum level of protection of common interests and a degree of solidarity – through the Solidarity Fund, for example, which actually disbursed some 100 million euros to Romania, Bulgaria and the Tyrol in 2005. I believe that the draft takes subsidiarity into consideration, albeit insufficiently. It could go a bit further in this direction. Needless to say, subsidiarity does not mean that the Member States are released from their responsibilities. The three-step approach we have outlined is logical: assessment of cross-border risks, compiling of flood maps and preparation of contingency plans for effective risk management. Even if there were no revision clause, I should be happy to see us discuss after the first five years whether the European approach has actually delivered the desired benefits.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, warmest congratulations to Mrs Roth-Behrendt, best wishes for her recovery and many thanks for her excellent report and the good negotiations with Council and Commission. I am very confident that we will reach agreement here with the first reading. It affords an excellent guarantee of consumer protection. We fully support the stricter measures the rapporteur calls for. We consider the rules provided by Parliament, namely TSE checks for cattle over 30 months slaughtered for human consumption and for all cattle over 24 months that have died or been sent for emergency slaughter, to be sufficient and correct. This measure will save the small Land
 of Schleswig-Holstein alone 4 to 5 million euros a year without prejudicing the safety of consumers. The adaptation to the World Organisation for Animal Health’s three risk categories is also logical and necessary. The definition of active and passive surveillance categories safeguards epidemiological monitoring and preserves its quality. I believe the limited ban on feeding animal proteins to ruminants is correct, even if not totally adequate. Nature did not envisage ruminants eating animal proteins, except for calves in the form of mother’s milk. The argument that cleaned proteins from fishmeal are no different may well have a scientific basis, but in my opinion it is not correct. From an ethical point of view, I find the feeding of fishmeal problematical and undesirable. Periods of up to eight years in doubtful cases are sufficient for the ban on the sale of animals from third countries. The abolition of zero tolerance for the presence of animal proteins in feed as a result of accidental contamination is a quite crucial and logical step forward. In my country, zero tolerance resulted in tens of thousands of tonnes of sugar beet having to be destroyed because animal protein was found in it when it was delivered. The up to 0.5% protein admixtures that will now be tolerated come predominantly from small animals that were killed in the process of harvesting or had died in the fields long before and are certainly free from TSE. The new limit here is a real step forward towards sensible legislation. I agree to the proposal, but cannot refrain from making one small remark in conclusion, namely that life for Parliament would surely be even better and even more democratic if there were less or no comitology.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, congratulations to Mrs Scheele on her report, which, with the amendments added, amounts to a fine dossier, and many thanks to Mrs Poli Bortone, who has certainly put a lot of work into a report that is complex and comprehensive without, alas, being in line with my way of thinking. What has to be borne in mind here, both as a matter of principle and of policy, is that the Council and the Commission have played from what is still a position of excessive strength vis-à-vis Parliament, which has now been forced to give its agreement for fear of even greater damage being done. The powers-that-be in the administrative community constituted by the Council and the Commission have got their way against the political will of a majority in this House, and a good draft, amended at first reading, has been well and truly filleted. While I have no objection to nutrient profiles, a dossier needs to be put together in accordance with certain principles; for a start, there are no concrete proposals – what one might term the pre-production model – from the Commission. The expert knowledge of medical specialists, nutritionists and psychologists needs to be drawn on, and their opinions need to be balanced against one another. I wonder what added value this is going to bring to Europe; I want to be told about the chances of this being implemented, and about how SMEs are meant to survive. I also ask myself whether protecting consumers should not mean something more than treating them like children, but should – and can – also involve helping them to reach their own decisions. Looked at from the scientific angle, it has to be said that one can expect the effect of this on the way Europeans – particularly children – eat and consume to be virtually non-existent, but, even so, we will have created a new bureaucratic monster to persuade our citizens of Europe’s usefulness. We will swallow this particular toad – the nutrient profile for which will probably describe it as ‘too slimy’ – but I hope it will be the last of its kind.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this year, World Health Day is devoted to health workers. There are 35 million health workers worldwide, approximately 4 million of whom are in Germany, and well in excess of 12 million in the EU. These figures alone show that the South of our planet has far from satisfactory provision. There is a clear divide between the developed and the developing world as regards people’s chances of receiving health-care services. In the short term, it would be entirely appropriate to provide twice or several times as many resources as emergency assistance. What is indispensable, however, is an increase in human resources – in both Europe and the developing world. Given the short time available, I should like to discuss just the conditions in Europe. The previous speakers have already commented on the developing world, and they have my full support. I should like to select four European issues. Firstly, the ageing of our society brings with it new challenges, new illnesses, new treatment procedures and a growing need for nursing and care that we are already losing the ability to fully cover. Secondly, an improvement in the skills and quality of the health professions in Europe is needed if we are to meet the excellence criteria we set ourselves. A dramatic increase in the training figures in all fields of the health service is needed if we are to meet these demands. Thirdly, we need to enhance our cooperation within the Union. Although health policy plays a subordinate role, positive intervention is called for on our part. Health policy must not be reduced to monetary aspects – even if these words are sure to make the ears of my colleagues in Berlin burn. Fourthly, we need to preserve the health of health workers by means of reasonable working hours and workloads and reduce cases of exhaustion. In this connection, I would appeal to the Commission to adopt Parliament’s position on the Working Time Directive.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by giving my sincere thanks to Mr Bushill-Matthews for his excellent report. I would say to Commissioner Špidla that, personally, I would gladly live for 120 years. I need to reach 116 to break even on my pension scheme. I am surprised that the Green Paper on demographic change does not take greater account of health aspects. The problems of an ageing society are not limited to economic aspects. New syndromes are coming to the fore, as can already be seen: dementia – be it Alzheimer’s disease or subcortical dementia – vascular disease, from coronary heart disease to renal insufficiency, metabolic diseases – diabetes, first and foremost – arthritis of the spine and the large joints, and osteoporosis, to name but a few. This makes it all the more a question of prevention, of ensuring good living conditions for all before treatment and, if treatment should be necessary, of ensuring that this is as good as possible for all Europeans. It is a case of maintaining both quality of life and mobility. We need social reorientation in order to meet these challenges. Retirement now comprises one third of the human lifespan. We need meaningful employment, social tasks, fulfilling tasks for older people, barrier-free living, new forms of housing, and, if necessary, excellent nursing care and medical care. However, I would take issue with the implicit and unreflective assumption in the Green Paper that a decline in population would have exclusively negative consequences for the established social system. I should therefore like to see the following issues addressed: the extent to which the negative consequences of a population decline may be addressed by innovation, higher rates of employment and modernisation of social protection; whether there may also be positive aspects to the decline in population, for example on issues relating to the environment, traffic congestion and land development; and whether a ‘Pareto optimum’ for Europe’s population size may ultimately be established.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to extend my sincere thanks to Mr Trakatellis for the excellent cooperation and his excellent report. The three common core EU policy objectives in the fields of health and consumer protection are clearly brought out: to protect the public from risks and hazards over which the individual has no control and which cannot be effectively or completely dealt with by individual Member States. The focus is quite clear. Strengthening people’s ability to make decisions affecting their health – in this connection, a Commission initiative aimed at reducing the restrictions in the pharmaceutical industry’s information policy is also commendable. Thirdly, the incorporation of health policy into the other areas of Community policy. In the field of health, this report introduces three new core subjects that relate to the new challenges of our time: the response to threats – taking as an example the epidemics that are at present very much in our minds with bird flu. Secondly, the prevention of diseases and patterns of behaviour – citing here only smoking, obesity, addictions and lack of exercise as examples. Thirdly, the necessary cooperation between national health authorities, where there is surely still room for improvement at many levels. I see no undermining of subsidiarity here, but on the contrary greater cooperation, effects of synergy and a strengthening of subsidiarity. I believe the separation into consumer protection and health protection to be important and correct, since they are two fields of policy with different bases in law, which means they also entail different EU powers within the Community. Personally, I find all that we are wanting to do with 1.5 billion in seven years astonishing. I hope that a lot of it will be achieved. Let us only bear in mind that statutory social insurance has a turnover of EUR 180 billion a year in the Federal Republic of Germany alone. I support Amendment 64 on expanding the financial framework. I believe it is the minimum if we are to do any meaningful work at all. Compared to what the Community spends in seven years on subsidising the cultivation of tobacco, this amount is still vanishingly small. It amounts to only about one fifth of tobacco subsidies. We certainly cannot satisfy every desire of Europe’s citizens and institutions in a framework programme. We have tried to be as fair and balanced as possible. I see this as a great opportunity to take Europe a bit further into the midst of the citizens again through joint public relations work.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start with warm thanks to Mr Matsakis for his good, constructive and frank cooperation on this report, which is by way of preparation for legislation, so that we are pointing the way forward whilst not yet taking any final decisions. The legislative measures must follow later.  It has by now become a matter of common knowledge that mercury is highly toxic, and that is of course reason enough why it needs to be taken out of circulation. So, then, by aiming for an export ban from 2010 onwards and for the secure storage of mercury that has been taken out of circulation, we are sending the first vital indications of the direction in which we need to go. It is already evident that the principle of substitution applies here, and that is made all the more important by the fact that mercury is not bio-degradable and so it is permanently in circulation; every single microgram of it will keep on coming back to human beings through the food chain. People living by the sea who frequently eat fish already have in their tissues concentrations of mercury in excess of the permissible threshold values. Unfortunate though it is that nothing can at present be done to change that, and that no direct consequences result from it, it does, in terms of environmental medicine, indicate the need for an absolute ban.  As things currently stand, I am also less than satisfied with the wording relating to dental amalgam, which remains strongly suspected of playing a part in a range of conditions, of which I shall cite as examples immune deficiencies, Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis, Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and damage to the unborn child in the womb. Even if the experts have not yet arrived at their final judgment on this, I see the tendency and the risk as being beyond doubt, so what is needed above all else is prevention and care before we think about experimenting on live subjects. I will not be recommending amalgam and mercury products to the people and patients entrusted to my care and will do my utmost to ensure that mercury is taken out of circulation – as far as possible and as soon as possible.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I am much obliged to Mr Maaten for the good work he has done and for the negotiations conducted by the delegation from this House in the run-up to the third reading. I should like to confine myself to a few of the medical aspects of the directive. Bathing water is not free from germs, but low in germs. In principle, bathing water should be of drinking-water quality, as many bathers and swimmers do end up drinking it. In southern Germany, for example, we have one of the largest drinking-water reservoirs in the whole of Europe in the shape of Lake Constance. It must be mentioned, however, that even drinking water is not completely free from germs, but only low in germs, and that many germs – albeit of varying pathogenicity – are present throughout our daily lives. The degree of protection we have now achieved with this directive is not perfect, of course, but is an initial step in the right direction. After all, the limit values of 330 intestinal enterococchi for inland waters and 185 for coastal waters that have now been agreed – for the ‘sufficient’ category – represent a reduction in health risk to bathers from 12% to 8%, and ‘health risk’ does not necessarily mean illness. The same goes for E. coli
 bacteria, with counts of 900 and 500 for the ‘sufficient’ and ‘excellent quality’ categories, respectively. In my view, standardised laboratory methods should be as much a matter of course as uniform sampling quality. The main concern as far as I am concerned should be that the public be informed sufficiently and in good time and that the ‘excellent quality’ designation be achieved in all our waters. A further aim – subject to strict scientific provisos at first – must be to control the viral load of the waters. This is progressively gaining in importance: there has been a rapid increase in the number of people falling ill in Europe as a result of enteroviruses and noroviruses. If only for this reason, we can expect a further revision of the directive in the not-too-distant future. I support the directive.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Blokland deserves our warm thanks for this good, thorough and careful report for second reading. The basic problem with batteries and accumulators has nothing to do with the energy they produce, but rather with the materials that they contain – cadmium, lead and mercury. It is a matter of general knowledge that these components are toxic and do the environment no good at all. As I see it, the first priority is recycling rather than management; the next is that they be replaced by less toxic contents wherever this is technically possible. This alteration now further renders harmless, reduces and, to some degree, prohibits these materials and their percentages by weight in batteries of whatever kind. This I regard as the great benefit of this directive. It has to be admitted that the collection quotas are very high, and the demands made on industry, the general public and the trade very considerable. This is a challenge, and it is one that I regard in an extremely positive light; it will involve putting into practice a learning programme that will get our fellow human beings treating the environment better and becoming more aware of it. Even if it proves impossible to achieve the high quotas everywhere and always, the requirement is evidence of how the European Union leads the world in its awareness of the environment and in the way it treats it. The debate as to whether it makes more sense to define collection targets in terms of weight or number of items strikes me as purely academic. I have no objection to the joint legal basis using Articles 95 and 175 of the Treaties, or to the Council’s Common Position. Looking at the big picture, the fundamental question that presents itself to my mind is whether the promotion of research and of modern technologies will, over the coming years, enable us to replace many of our conventional batteries with such alternatives as fuel cells. If it does, then this directive, like the materials we have problems with, will have a limited lifespan.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what we are discussing is something that at first sight appears simple and logical, but which, on closer examination, results in significant problems, up to and including the protection afforded by patents being undermined or rendered ineffective. I am today speaking on behalf of my colleague Mrs Weisgerber, who is unable to be here for personal reasons. This House goes beyond the Commission proposal in demanding the extension of compulsory licensing not only to needy WTO members, but also to over 40 other states equally in need of help. While there is agreement across group boundaries that the group of eligible countries should be expanded as a political indication of willingness to help countries that are not members of the WTO, it is equally possible to find this objectionable. Even though we have gone to a great deal of trouble to seek – and, it is to be hoped, to find – a fair balance between the claims of the poorer countries on this planet and the licence-holders’ justifiable interest in protecting their patents, there is still a great deal of uncertainty. Who, in the final analysis, is in a position to monitor the re-labelling or repackaging of medicines and to prevent their being reimported into the European Union – the Member States at national level, the Commission, the importing countries, the industry or the drugs business? Are we not, by doing this, giving people a licence to create considerable problems for us at a later date? With the situation that we can currently observe, with people making great profits from the illegal trade in medicines across every border and by every route – ranging from the Internet to across the traditional shop counter – I have to say that I have misgivings. I will be taking the liberty of asking the Council and the Commission, at regular intervals, how the figures stand and how many compulsory licences have been applied for, and I look forward to receiving accurate data in response. I understand that the British Presidency of the Council wants to notch this up as a success for itself. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats endorses the proposal on generic medicines for developing countries.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I ought really, according to the German working time directive, to have been on a rest break for the past six hours and 26 minutes, but the debate is nevertheless a very interesting one. As a fellow-Member of the same group, I would like to thank the rapporteur most warmly for the outstanding work she has done. The message that this Common Position carries from us to the world at large is a positive one. We are showing ourselves to be taking the Kyoto Protocol’s targets seriously, and endeavouring to be an example to the rest of the world in this respect – an example of how to pursue ambitious climate targets and make less use of f-gases. I would, however, have been glad if this House’s Legal Affairs Committee had done as it needed to do and produced its opinion in good time, in order that we might have a few pointers on the legal position. I am myself in favour of the dual legal basis using Articles 95 and 175, as described in the Common Position – not, I have to say, out of any antipathy towards the environment, but because I would like to see the whole of the European market, and Europe’s environment too, maintained and developed in accordance with the same high standards. If we are to have a common legal basis, I see Article 95 as a good starting point, for it enables us to find more common ground than we would if we followed Article 175 and left too many options open to the individual Member States. I also think it problematic that the derogation in Article 175 gives the public the impression that we are not acting together in this area.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt about the need for a regulation on medicinal products for paediatric use. I should like to start by giving my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Grossetête, for her deeply committed speech, and also for her fair discussion of the matter. Of course, by the end of the debate it is difficult to introduce new points of view, so I should just like to make my point symbolically. 120 seconds’ speaking time in this House is very little in view of the significance of this milestone in European pharmaceutical legislation; but a great deal – as I know from many years’ personal experience as a chief emergency physician – when it comes to saving children’s lives. We can also see this 120 seconds as a symbol that it is time for Europe to at last roll out an appropriate regulation for paediatric medicinal products. I should very much like to see a consensus at first reading, so that our European community can be restored to a respectable competitive position on the important international market in pharmaceutical research and manufacture. I support the proposal for a uniform extension of patent protection. Mrs Grossetête, and now Commissioner Verheugen as well, have convinced me that this is the right, simple, and practicable way to go. We have included a revision clause entitling us to make improvements for the eventuality that the profits are as exorbitant as we suspect they will be. We have to take great care when discussing this issue, as it concerns children – the most precious things we have – and human lives, on the one hand, and economic interests on the other. These two things cannot be weighed against each other.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Cabrnoch on his report, which is a very good one. Benchmarking, and the dissemination of the best practice resulting from it, is very much to be welcomed as an approach, particularly in the healthcare sector. It is an approach codified and institutionalised by the open method of coordination incorporated into the Lisbon Strategy, a method which requires the participation of the Member States in line with the Commission’s timetables. The best-case scenario is that this makes the whole process more dynamic. In the worst-case scenario, the result is an avalanche of data, with which the authorities concerned cannot cope. It is unfortunate that we do not yet have the experiential data, collected over many years, that would enable us to carry out accurate assessments of this very complex area. Their absence seems to be a fact of life, particularly in the healthcare sector. If the people on whose work the system depends are to be won over to the idea of inner-European exchange in the health sector, I think the open method of coordination needs, in the first instance, to be introduced carefully and progressively. Under no circumstances must data be collected in such massive quantities that the authorities would then be unable to process it. The dynamics of the process as a whole would seem to make a mandatory timetable by far the most sensible option, although computerised data collection cannot be started everywhere at the same time. In the health sector, I regard the cautious and progressive introduction of statistical returns, hand in hand with in-depth feedback from the personnel involved, as the right way ahead. It must be possible, for the sake of efficiency and the long-term acceptance of the open method of coordination, to create an ideally efficient portfolio of data by doing away with the less important returns.

 We reaffirm our belief that Bulgaria and Romania should become members of the EU. Before this takes place, though, they must meet certain criteria, which must continue to apply. The Council has refused to adjust the Financial Perspective, even though the Interinstitutional Agreement requires that this be done in the event of enlargement. We regard this as an unacceptable encroachment upon Parliament’s budgetary rights. The Commission’s latest progress reports confirm that both countries have a great deal of ground to cover before they meet the accession criteria, in particular with regard to the fight against corruption and the establishment of a judiciary operating under the rule of law. It is for this reason that we particularly welcome the efforts undertaken by the new Romanian Government, which is resolutely pushing ahead with reforms in order to overcome the delays caused by its predecessor. It would be premature to take a decision on the matter at this time, in view of the fact that both countries are still a remarkably long way from meeting the accession criteria, as well as of the collapse of the trilogue on adjustments to the Financial Perspective. In our opinion, it would have been more appropriate to delay the decision on accession until the Commission has presented its next progress report. The fact that we are still 20 months away from the envisaged date of accession would have been further justification for such a delay. We regret that we do not feel able to vote in favour of accession at this time.
