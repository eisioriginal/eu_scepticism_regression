 Madam President, I think we are forgetting that it was this Parliament which first took up the campaign for an EU-wide ban on the cruel trade in seal products. In 2006 a written declaration calling for this ban was overwhelmingly backed by Members – receiving 425 signatures – with studies by veterinary experts clearly showing that seals are killed with terrible suffering, often skinned whilst still conscious. The public no longer tolerate the trade and we as their representatives have the power to end it. Moreover, our vote tomorrow will be a decisive step forward in the global campaign to ban the trade. The USA has had a ban for many years. Mexico has banned the trade. In Europe we already have national bans in Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Italy; Germany and the UK are considering ways to ban the trade. Bans are now in place in Russia. Hong Kong is planning a ban. This is a political issue that now has its time. After a 40-year campaign against the trade, Europe has the chance to introduce a ban in all 27 states. For the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection it is not the first time we have taken up citizens’ concern to end the cruel trade. Parliament has the power to deliver for citizens and the Internal Market Committee was determined to go for a strong ban whilst securing exemption for traditional Inuit hunting. The committee rejected the Commission’s mixed proposal for a partial ban and labelling; the committee rejected Mrs Wallis’s proposal for a labelling option only. Why? Because citizens would have condemned this half-hearted gesture which would have allowed the cruel slaughter to continue. The public have demonstrated in numerous polls across European countries that they want an end to the trade: 75% of people polled in the UK want an end; 80% in Austria, over 90% in France and the Netherlands. Even in those countries in the EU where a small amount of traditional seal hunting takes place, the trade is not supported by the public, with 70% against in Sweden. A clear majority of Canadians do not support their country’s hunt. Furthermore 86% of Canadian people polled believed the EU should be free to choose to ban these products. I have here a letter from a Canadian senator written to President Pöttering saying: ‘Your vote to ban the trade in seal products will help the vast majority of Canadians who watched in admiration as the Russian Federation ended its bloody seal slaughter last month to force their politicians to look beyond political expediency to what is right and to end this inhumane hunt once and for all. On behalf of the majority of Canadians who are opposed to the hunt, thank you for the leadership you are taking on this issue. It is much appreciated.’ This year 50 000 seals have been slaughtered in the Canadian hunt compared to 220 000 last year. That means that we as citizens now have the opportunity to ban this cruel trade. I know that this will be applauded by the citizens of Europe. I hope that Parliament will tomorrow vote to back the Internal Market Committee’s proposal for a ban in seal trade products.

 Mr President, I know Commissioner Kuneva is here, and I very much welcome the opportunity at this last session of Parliament’s mandate – even at this very late hour – to have an exchange of views on the Commission’s consumer rights proposal. We have produced a working document and you will recall that the IMCO Committee working group, led by myself as chair and rapporteur, made a decision not to rush this proposal without taking full consideration of all its implications, in particular since it has been described as the most far-reaching change in approach to consumer law in Europe. The committee, I believe, has very diligently carried out its work with a public hearing, several exchanges of views, a presentation suggested by Mr Harbour on the impact assessment, and an online consultation with has received around 100 responses from organisations across Europe in just three weeks. We also held an exchange of views with representatives from the 27 national parliaments to which the Commissioner was also invited. Commissioner, I know that you and your staff are fully aware that this is a controversial proposal that merits further examination in a number of areas. We appreciate the drive to improve consumers’ rights in the internal market. We also agree that there is a need to improve the functioning of the business-to-consumer internal market by removing barriers to cross-border trade, but there is also a need to reassure our consumers that they can continue to expect a high level of protection. During our deliberations, debate and consultations with stakeholders, we received numerous representations concerned about the lack of clarity and certainty in this proposal. We encouraged consumer organisations and business stakeholders to initiate their own dialogue on how we can make this proposal work, and I know that the Commissioner has received a jointly drafted letter from business and consumer organisations which has been copied to all MEPs. I would like to quote from that. They say, ‘we attach great importance to the legal clarity and quality of the proposal, as well as to the need to know what consequences and changes it would bring about compared with the current situation. We believe there is a high degree of uncertainty about the scope and the consequences of this proposal in particular in relation to its impact on national legal orders.’ Their concerns are clear. We need to be clear in our final proposal. Are we asking consumers to give up some of the rights they have under national law? If so, what does the consumer get in return? And if we are not asking them to surrender certain contract law rights, such as the right to reject in UK and Irish law, then is business still not faced with 27 different sets of consumer rules, the abolition of which was a key objective in the first place? My colleagues and I believe that our first priority is to evaluate what this proposal will do for consumers and business in real practical terms. That is why tonight’s oral questions identify some key issues that we would like to work with you on, and that we need to make sure are addressed, in order to produce a workable set of rules that benefit all stakeholders. Our questions therefore focus on the details of specific areas where we would like to see further work. Some members of the working group were concerned at perceived flaws in the impact assessment and want to see more evidence of the costs of legal fragmentation if we do not act. They also want more information on the economic impact of the proposal, not only on the impact of the information requirements. In short, we would like the Commission to take some time in the intervening election period before Parliament is reconstituted in July to undertake the following work (this is all contained in the Oral Question): an analysis of the practical and legal implications of the proposal on consumer rights in each Member State; a clarification of the relationship between the fully harmonised provisions in the directive and the general remedies available in national contract law; a clarification of the interplay of the draft proposal with existing Community legislation, in particular the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, E-Commerce Directive, Services Directive, the Rome I Regulation and, of course, the proposed CFR. We want some further evidence in the impact assessment to help us analyse and demonstrate the benefits and costs of this proposal and any alternative approaches that could be put forward. We want you to help us, and we will work with you, to ensure that we support a dialogue between stakeholders on what measures are necessary to bring mutual practical benefits for business and consumers alike. Commissioner, I believe it is possible to produce a workable practical proposal that is supported by all stakeholders. I pledge to you that the Members of this House wish to continue to work with you to ensure that we deliver that, and that we can at some point in time vote through this Parliament a new consumer rights directive.

 It is not fair that composers of songs or the designer who does the artwork for the CD get protection of their rights for their life plus 70 years, while the performer currently only has 50 years from publication. The term has not kept up with life expectancy, meaning that musicians lose the benefit for their work just as they retire and most need the income. Talented musicians are being short-changed by the current system. 38 000 performers asked for our support to redress this discrimination. This is about the equalisation of rights for ordinary working musicians. I regret that there have been many false claims about this legislation. At a time of economic downturn we need to support our creative industries and artists who contribute to our GDP, jobs, growth and global exports. This law will do much to help poor musicians who deserve to be treated equally. I hope the Council and Commission can accept the Parliament vote to bring in this law before the end of this parliamentary term.

 I abstained on this report because it does not give enough of a guarantee on the protection of the integrity and funding of Britain's National Health Service, nor will it provide certainty or clarity for the minority of patients who can afford to travel to take up healthcare in another EU Member State. The Tory MEPs in the European Parliament have one objective in mind with their proposal to reintroduce their discredited health voucher system by the European back door; under their proposals the wealthy few would get vouchers to take NHS money out of the UK for private treatment in the rest of Europe. People paying their taxes expect to see their money invested in the NHS to pay for healthcare at home, not being diverted to other EU health systems. It is no surprise that, only recently, Tory MEP Dan Hannan advocated a privatised approach to healthcare. In a recent debate on cross-border health payments between Britain and Ireland, the Tory shadow health minister Andrew Lansley said that NHS resources are always precious and attacked the payment of GBP 180 million of NHS money to Ireland. However, the Tories have failed to back our proposal for a clear prior authorisation system, which is crucial to protect precious NHS resources and NHS services.

– Mr President, I know the Commissioner is aware that tomorrow 4 000 consumers will go to the High Court in the UK to seek compensation for severe allergic reactions, hospitalisation and death as the result of the use of a chemical in sofas and household goods, which has now been banned in the EU. France, Sweden and Poland have reported similar cases and injuries. Across Europe there are potentially many thousands of consumers who have suffered severe injuries as a result of this toxic chemical. I believe that citizens support European intervention when it is seen to give real help to consumers to tackle real problems. Real help in such cases means giving them the right to take action collectively, wherever they buy goods and services. So our committee launched an online consultation on the Commission proposal for consumer rights. We received many responses, many of which – from businesses and consumers – highlighted the need for effective access to cross-border remedies and redress. There are, I believe, enough cases like the toxic sofa case with enough compelling evidence to prove that a range of options for collective redress is needed, not only to improve access to justice, but equally to deter illegal or unfair business practices. Of course in our committee we want consumers to have access to cheap, affordable means, such as ADR, but I believe today’s debate is first and foremost about identifying practical ways to give real help to our consumers and citizens, to ensure they get a fair deal, real redress and real remedies.

 Mr President, it is clear that, following last year’s toy safety scares and recalls in the run-up to Christmas, our current toy safety law drafted in 1988 cannot deal with the new risks and threats to children’s safety. Twenty years on, 80% of toys in the EU and 95% in my own country are imported from third countries, predominantly China. Twenty years on, we are better informed about the risks and hazards of certain chemicals and substances. Twenty years on, the design of toys has changed, with toys containing powerful magnets and more electronic components, using lasers and emitting more noise. That is why the toy safety scares and recalls were a wake-up call for Europe to radically review, update and strengthen the standards of our toy safety law. Our new law will do more to reassure parents that the toys on our shelves are safer: not safe, but safer. Importers, not just manufacturers, will be responsible for ensuring the toys they bring into Europe meet our tough new standards. The fact is that manufacturers are banned from using harmful substances in toys such as lead, CMRs and fragrances which can provoke or trigger allergies in children. We have toughened up the rules on choking and suffocation risks. We have introduced clear and more effective warnings on toys. The law will only work, though, if it is enforced, and that is why it is good that we are giving more power in this law to 27 Member States’ enforcement bodies to demand all the necessary information they need for any operator in the supply chain and, where necessary, to conduct raids on premises. In addition, all the EU’s enforcement bodies are legally obliged to cooperate and share information to tackle the risk of unsafe toys. My congratulations, therefore, to Mrs Thyssen. Thanks to the good cooperation with the Commission and the French presidency we have done three things. We have met our deadline in the EP resolution last year of voting in a new toy safety law before Christmas 2008. I believe that if we wait any longer the legislation would not be any better. We can give parents confidence that toys on sale in the EU will be safer in future, and we are also sending out today a strong message to manufacturers, brand owners and importers that they must meet our high safety standards or there will be no place for their products on our shelves. By voting for this law, we say clearly that we are not prepared to tolerate toxic toys and dangerous toys in Europe.

 – Madam President, this timeshare law is long overdue. The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection first held a hearing on this in 2001, exposing all the problems in the market. We are, of course, very pleased that we have come to the point today where we are now delivering for consumers. We are extending the law to cover all timeshare-like products, especially the problematic discount holiday clubs. We are covering resale and exchange and giving consumers better protection and better rights. Critically, I believe consumers will have the same rights whether they are buying in Varna on the Black Sea or Valencia on the Costa Blanca. With this law, consumers must be given the key information on the standard information sheet – including all fees and charges – and, if the company fails to provide it, the law extends the right of withdrawal to three months. Failure to inform the consumer of the right of withdrawal extends the right of withdrawal to one year. These really are good rights for consumers. They will turn our traders into responsible traders and we will have informed and protected consumers, which means we can drive out of the market the dodgy dealers and the scam merchants. Today we have demonstrated that, when consumers complain, Parliament’s Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection not only answers, but we act and we deliver. Commissioner, I would ask you to follow up, as you always do, on enforcement issues. We must now use the new cross-border enforcement network to tackle the continuing problems that consumers have and to make sure we reduce the number of complaints that turn up on timeshare in European consumer centres right across the 27 Member States.

 Mr President, many speakers stress the fact that all patients, whether they travel or stay at home, are entitled to high-quality, safe health care. Let us not forget that one of the biggest demographic challenges we have is an ageing population who will inevitably want health care in their own locality. So we need clarity to respect the right of patients to access health services, and at the same time we need to respect the Treaty provision stating that the organisation of health services, especially financing, is a competence of the Member States. We must recognise that 27 states have different systems, different funding systems. I regret that the directive is not clear on this point, but I have confidence that our rapporteurs can clarify these issues: if we want to keep out the lawyers we must have clarity, not just to avoid patients going to court, but to avoid them going to court on cross-border medical negligence issues. So we need to have more innovation in our approach. The ideal mix, I believe, is to have patient mobility and to encourage Member States to buy in expert services, not just to treat one patient but to treat groups suffering from the same condition. This could be more cost-efficient, and could enable patients to stay close to family and friends.

 Madam President, I would like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Weisgerber, and the shadows for producing this report and negotiating a very good agreement with the Council and the Commission, while preserving Parliament’s priorities. At a time when petrol prices in Europe have doubled and citizens in Europe and people around the world are ever more concerned about the effects of climate change, it is clear that we need new hope for future fuels. This European-wide law on hydrogen-powered cars can pave the way for full-scale production of these cars and provide European drivers with real alternatives in the not too distant future. Sales of alternative-fuel vehicles, for example, in the United Kingdom alone have grown from just a few hundred in the year 2000 to over 16 000 last year. Sales of electric cars and other alternatives have soared, but hydrogen cars are only on the cusp of large-scale production. I believe that this new law will boost the development of these vehicles, while ensuring they are reliable and safe. With the help of the law, mass production is now predicted to start in Europe by 2015, with around 5% of total EU road stock set to be hydrogen-powered by 2025. The environmental benefits of hydrogen cars will depend on the energy source used to produce the hydrogen. They can directly tackle air pollution caused by petrol and will reduce our dependence on oil, but they will only help tackle global warming if hydrogen is produced in a sustainable way. That is why I strongly back Mrs Weisgerber’s negotiated amendments to ensure hydrogen fuel is produced sustainably and, as far as possible, from renewable energy. It is important to stress that hydrogen-powered cars can be just as safe as those that run on petrol and, in the event of an accident, emergency crews need to know what they are dealing with. That is why Mrs Weisgerber has ensured that vehicles will be readily identifiable by emergency services. This legislation does what only the European Union can do in a strong internal market. It ensures a European-sized market for goods with common rules and high safety requirements. It is this market that is capable of producing the hydrogen cars of the future and I believe this law today, when we vote for it, is crucial to achieving that goal.

I would like to thank Mr Mladenov, our Committee rapporteur. This report on aspects of motor vehicle insurance is a good example of how Europe is delivering practical and pragmatic benefits of EU membership for its citizens. With 1.2 million road accidents in Europe every year, regrettably some citizens will be victims of a car accident, as a driver, passenger or pedestrian. Yet many people are not aware that EU law exists to help resolve insurance claims without having to deal with a foreign insurance company in a foreign language. This EU law exists to enable citizens to go home and get the claim settled quickly and easily in their own language. The 4th Motor Insurance Directive also ensures assistance for accident victims by setting up information centres in each Member State. As the law does not currently provide for compulsory cover for legal costs, citizens should consider the option of taking out legal protection insurance. Of course, as the Parliament's rapporteur on mediation, I hope parties will use alternative dispute resolution to find a settlement to conflicts while avoiding the costs and delays of court proceedings. It is with concrete, practical measures like this law that we can demonstrate Europe's value to our citizens.

Madam President, I want to take the opportunity as Chair of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) to thank Mr Harbour and the shadows for producing what I hope this Parliament will consider a balanced and workable proposal on universal services. I want to draw the attention of this House to one provision – an amendment I made and backed by the committee – to make the introduction of the 116000 missing child hotline a legal obligation on all Member States. The Commissioner will be aware that a recent report has shown that, a full 18 months after its introduction in 2007, only seven Member States have assigned the missing child hotline. The voluntary approach is clearly not working. Across Europe every year approximately 130 000 children go missing. These statistics show that this is an area where Europe can help, must act and must identify, track down and recover missing children. Therefore I urge the European Commission and the Member States to support this provision, to speed up the implementation of the missing child hotline and give a major boost to Europe’s efforts for an EU-wide missing children amber alert system.

 Madam President, I should like to give an example of where the Charter on the Rights of Energy Consumers can make a real difference. A small community organisation in Manchester asked for my help in resolving a complaint with its energy supplier. For five years the company was reading the meter but failing to send any bills. In March 2008, the group received an invoice for five years’ electricity use totalling GBP 7 540.37, pushing them into debt. Ensuring consumers are aware of their rights – in this case the simple right to receive a regular bill – is fundamental to putting consumers in control of their energy consumption. At a time when every consumer in every country across Europe is facing soaring energy bills, we must give consumers the information and tools to manage their bills, cut their use and costs and, at the same time, contribute to cutting CO2
 emissions. I urge the Commission to be bold in taking forward a charter of rights, working with regulators, Member States and companies to proactively promote and publicise these rights, and to abandon the notion of a watered-down checklist, which will not deliver a fair deal for consumers faced with today’s complex energy challenges and prices. If we can have a charter of rights for air passengers, why can we not have one for energy consumers? Commissioner, I should like you to answer that question.
 Arlene McCarthy  (PSE

 Mr President, as chair of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection with responsibility for customs policy, I certainly welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate to mark 40 years of the Customs Union. The IMCO Committee, as has already been said, attaches great importance to our customs work, because it is the pragmatic and practical face of the European Union’s work. Without doubt the Customs Union has helped increase the competitiveness of EU business by simplifying and getting rid of unnecessary rules for business and legitimate traders. 175 million customs declarations are handled annually, with an average customs clearance taking only two minutes. But there is still more to do. SMEs need more help to minimise the difficulties they face when trading in Europe. Paperless customs, centralised clearance and a single window will facilitate and support our SMEs, but it must of course be rigorously pursued by Member States if we are to reap the benefits. This is also an opportunity to step up and reinforce our commitment to fighting the influx and flood of pirated and counterfeit goods. Fake goods and fake medicines not only undermine EU business, they are a grave and ever-present threat to our consumers’ health and safety, an issue which the Consumer Protection Committee is deeply concerned about. So, working with third countries and in particular China, we want to improve the interception of dangerous and illegal goods; but ultimately we need to make our Customs Union work better. Member States are called upon this evening to take their responsibilities more seriously for implementation and enforcement and to back this up with serious resources. Commissioner, you can continue to rely on us in the IMCO Committee to work with you to improve the Customs Union as a cornerstone of the internal market and of course as a central element for the functioning and success of the EU economy. We must ensure that our 27 Member States work together more closely: that they liaise, share information and make Europe work better and more smoothly for legitimate business; and that we do crack down on the serious and growing problem of counterfeit and pirated goods entering our market.

 Mr President, the clear objective of this oral question is to get action and redress for the thousands of small businesses across the EU which are being defrauded daily out of millions of euros by sham European ‘directory companies’. This Parliament has received hundreds of petitions and a mass of correspondence to our constituency offices from businesses who have fallen victim to these prolific scams against small businesses. We must, of course, recognise that these scams have been in existence for over 40 years, according to the legitimate directory publishers represented by the EADP. But this is without doubt a scam which requires a European response. As an example, the structure of the Maiwolf holding company, which owns the European City Guide and other such companies, is a complex web of European scam companies registered, operating and domiciled in several Member States of the EU and in the EEA countries Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Despite legal action and fines issued by courts in several Member States, it continues to operate, making a mockery of EU cooperation on law enforcement. Indeed it took seven years through the courts for the company to be shut down in Barcelona, only for it to immediately restart trading in Valencia. Maiwolf Holding is a hub of a web of companies operating scams not just at EU level but at global level and continuing – I am afraid – to escape the long arm of the law. By responding to the European City Guide, businesses were led to believe that they were simply responding to an information request or updating or correcting their data. They were led to believe it was a free service, and then suddenly they found themselves slapped with an invoice for thousands of euros which, if mentioned at all, had only appeared in very fine print in a confusing and misleading manner. The same Maiwolf holding company apparently also owns the debt collection companies which then proceed to harass, bully and threaten businesses to pay up. A website, ‘Stop the European City Guide’, that campaigns against the City Guide fraud, was also subject to legal threats and their ISP had to shut them down, although I am pleased to say that they are currently up and running again. Many of the activities of this fraudulent company are clearly in breach of the Misleading Advertising Directive of 1984. We need better and more coordinated enforcement to close the loopholes or gaps which are exploited by such companies. I can inform the presidency that my committee will review the implementation and transposition of the Misleading Advertising Directive and, of course, the new Unfair Commercial Practices Directive. We are particularly interested in the example of Austria’s transposition of the Misleading Advertising Directive whereby businesses cannot be bound by a contract unless they have clearly and explicitly signed up to its terms and conditions. This is a model, Presidency, which I hope you will follow in discussions with the other Member States. Small businesses, of course, are not helped by the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive as it does not cover business-to-business transactions – even for small businesses. Member States must make better use of the cross-border enforcement network to put these cowboy businesses out of business and out of operation once and for all. I certainly share with my colleagues here the sense of frustration of the many small businesses who for years, not months, have continued to suffer harassment and financial loss. If we believe, as we say we do, that small businesses are the backbone of the EU economy, then it is time to stand up for them, to defend their rights and to defend them against these fraudulent practices. I certainly welcome Commissioner Kuneva’s interest and her commitment to monitoring their activities, but monitoring alone does not get results and does not actively target these companies. It is unacceptable, I believe, that the business complaints have fallen on apparently deaf ears and that the sole trader behind the City Guide has been allowed to continue to peddle his fraudulent practices without facing the full force of European law. So I am calling today on the Member States to urgently take action, to recognise the serious and damaging consequences of allowing this fraudster to continue to rip off our businesses. I want the Member States, and indeed the presidency, today during our debate, to commit to taking action, not just to debate the issues we have known about for many years. So I urge the presidency to answer these questions and to work together with us to find a resolution for the businesses who continue to suffer from this fraud.

 Mr President, I just want to echo my colleagues. We have to stop passing the buck on this issue. We must stop allowing these companies to ‘catch me if you can’. That is the game they are playing with this. I am not leaving the plenary, Minister, without some commitment to action. Mr Harbour gave you some ideas, but what I want you to do is to raise specific things that I did actually raise in my intervention at the beginning. I want you to raise at the Council working group the Austrian model where, under the Misleading Advertising Directive, they already ban these practices. Not all Member States do it. You could ask other Member States to follow suit, take the Austrian model and ban these practices by introducing amendments in their national legislation. I also want you to ask the Council to agree that we have cross-border enforcement networks for consumers. I want you to instruct them to accept, investigate and act on the directory companies in the context of the cross-border enforcement network. That, I believe, will enable us to have some action across the border and to stop these people escaping the long arm of the law. So, please, if I could have that from you, I think we can all go away somewhat happier.

 Mr President, there are no amendments to the common position. That is thanks to the excellent work between the Parliament, Council and Commission and the work particularly of my shadows, Mrs Wallis and Mr Gauzès of the PPE-DE Group, who took a very strong line with the Council and Commission. I think it has been over a year since we agreed this proposal but it is the mediation experts and professionals in this sector whose response to the Parliament’s first ever online consultation convinced us of the merits of this law. I know that they will now welcome today’s vote in bringing these proposals into legislation. Too often we see cases where a marriage or a relationship involving children goes wrong and constituents end up with years of court procedures and massive legal fees. One of my constituents with a Greek partner amassed legal bills and had to go through the court system for three years to get her children back. Mediation can therefore be a valuable tool for citizens to achieve access to justice and potentially reduce the cost of dispute resolution without the often acrimonious process of going to trial. It has the added benefit of freeing up court time for cases that require a court judgment. This new law should assist people across Europe in getting quick, affordable access to justice. I therefore urge Members to support the second reading and open up new avenues of redress and remedies for citizens across the EU. (Applause)

 Madam President, I, too, want to commend to Members the excellent work that has been carried out by our rapporteurs for the goods package, Mr Brie, Ms Schaldemose and Mr Stubb, who, I think, are all legislative virgins. I think it is the first report they have done in this Parliament and, I have to say, they have done a very good job, together with staff. We have to thank the Commissioner himself, who has demonstrated commitment and dedication to this issue, and the Council and the Presidency again, which have made all this happen. I think we have managed to achieve an agreement which will free up circulation of safe products on the internal market, while introducing a tougher regime to detect dangerous goods and prevent them from coming onto the market and obviously maintaining tough rules, which we already have in place for food safety, medical equipment and blood products. With the adoption of this package, business and SMEs will find it easier, as Mr Stubb said, to sell their products – common household goods, bicycles, ladders, tanks, containers etc. – while consumers should reap the benefit of a wider choice of high-quality and safe products. But we have said very clearly that free movement of goods must not compromise safety. On the contrary, our rapporteurs have sought to strengthen the safety and enforcement regime with essential requirements in this package, by making it clear that all products placed on the market, including imports from third countries, must comply with the law, whether it is a Toy Safety Directive or the Directive on electrical equipment; by making it clear that all economic operators are legally responsible – and, indeed, liable – for placing products on the market and for the accuracy of the information they provide; by strengthening the current CE marking system to help consumer knowledge and confidence in products; and by increasing the coordination and cooperation of the market surveillance authorities, in particular to react faster in emergency cases to detect and withdraw unsafe products. I go back to the example of toys. While I would stress that US toy safety legislation on testing requirements and standards is weaker than the European Union’s, and their problems with defective toys were greater, nonetheless the recalls for the same product occurred in July in the US and it took Member States until September to take action to withdraw defective toy products from the market in the EU. That is why the changes that have been made by our rapporteurs for swifter action are, indeed, essential. If we are to engender consumer confidence, then we must ensure that there are no loopholes for defective or dangerous products. I think that the message this Parliament will give today by voting through these new measures is that we want goods to move freely, we want to increase competition and consumer choice, but we will not compromise on safety and, therefore, we have stepped up enforcement surveillance and given the CE mark the legal protection it deserves, to ensure that importers and manufacturers can be legally prosecuted if they fail in their duty of responsibility to protect the consumer. So, Commissioner, I want to thank you for the constructive and intensive work that you have carried out. We welcome the fact that you have now brought forward the new Toy Safety Directive. It is only one of many directives covered by this package of laws that we are putting through today and, as chair of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I therefore want to ask you to address some of the key future issues to enhance consumer confidence and to ensure consumer safety and awareness. I have two products here today. One is a toy seal; one is an electric kettle. One has no CE mark and one has a CE mark, so the former is probably not covered by the Toy Safety Directive and the latter, we assume, is covered by the Electrical Equipment Directive. However, consumers are confused. They believe that this also means that this kettle is safe. It does not mean it is safe. It means it conforms to the Directive on electrical equipment, and that is why, today, we are putting to you three requests: to examine the concept of a supplementary marking to enhance consumer information on product safety, to carry out an in-depth study in order to clarify the feasibility, the possible benefits and the potential drawbacks for such a marking for all stakeholders, including business and consumers, and to examine the possibilities for reinforcing the credibility of the CE marking through measures for stronger customs control inside and outside the European Union, to make sure we end the consumer confusion as regards the CE marking.

 Madam President, I wanted to intervene after the vote on the Lechner report. I did not want to interrupt the voting, but I merely wanted to thank the PPE-DE Group for supporting the common position so that we now have a very strong majority, which will be a very good signal to both consumers and businesses that we intend to open up the market and protect consumers. Madam President, I know that you have taken a very active role in this dossier and I think it is a credit to all the parties that we just got a tremendous majority in the end after many doubts and reservations.

 Mr President, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and previously the Committee on Legal Affairs, have always recognised the potential benefits, to both businesses and consumers, of developing an internal market and consumer credit. I was present during the gestation of this legislation and hope to be there tomorrow for the final delivery, as it were, of the new consumer credit baby! The last five years of discussion and debate have demonstrated fundamental differences between the Commission and Parliament, and more specifically between the Member States, on the best way to achieve this, and I firmly believe there are lessons to be learned from that. All proposals – even a modified Commission proposal – have to undergo a rigorous impact assessment to enable all parties and stakeholders to evaluate the merits of the proposals and to engender consumer confidence and business confidence. It is regrettable that neither the Commission nor the Council was prepared to do this at the time. However, our job today is to address the new text, which is a vast improvement on the original proposal. It focuses on the essential elements and components for starting to open the market and for protecting the consumer. Its benefits include enabling consumers to compare offers of credit, obliging lenders to assess the credit-worthiness of the consumer – which will be important in the fight against debt across the EU – and obliging lenders to provide explanations and, as a result of our amendments, all creditors will now be responsible for providing comprehensive and standard information in a simplified format. I welcome the 14-day withdrawal right and the right to early repayment, which are good elements for engendering consumer confidence and encouraging them to look beyond their home market for credit offers. This is not just about opening the market, and the fact that we now have free movement of labour and people across 27 EU Member States gives this law new significance. For example, a Polish plumber working in France or Germany and borrowing from a credit institution there can now obviously compare the different offers on APR in the knowledge that he has the standard information enabling him to take the right decision. Finally, I welcome the fact that the Commission, by exempting credit unions from this law, is not strangling small Community providers with red tape. I also welcome the Member State flexibility there is now. This has, for example, enabled a high level of protection to be maintained for consumers in the UK, which will now retain the right to joint and several liability for credit cards. There is therefore enough flexibility in this proposal to make it work, and I would urge Members to lend it their support. As chair of the Committee, I think that our work does not finish here ...

 Mr President, the objective of tonight’s debate and the Commissioner’s statement must, of course, be to send a very strong signal to consumers and to China – and those who supply toys from other third countries – that we are determined to rid our markets of toxic toys. We have seen that numerous toy recalls in the run-up to Christmas mean that we have to keep up pressure for action. And I want to add, Commissioner, that in recent raids in my own region – in Manchester – over 20 000 illegal and counterfeit toys were seized, with a value of EUR 150 000. They were clearly destined to fill the gaps as a result of the toy recalls. Therefore, we need the legitimate toy suppliers and manufacturers to meet the highest safety standards if children are not to be put at risk by dangerous counterfeit toys. So, let me be clear, as chair of Parliament’s Consumer Protection Committee, what we are calling for you to do with our support, Commissioner. We want an urgent review of Europe’s toy safety laws, to tackle the problems of new problems from third countries, Chinese imports and, of course, new and dangerous toy designs, such as magnets, which have emerged since the original directive of 1995. It is out of date, and it does need to be reviewed. We need to fill that law with stronger, intelligence-led enforcement and surveillance, to make sure we crack down on poor producers. Commissioner, I personally give you my support, and I will continue to do that, to go as far as banning dangerous toy imports from China if necessary. But it has to be said that your action has got results; we have now seen 93 bans from China itself and, since July, 184 more investigations, which means that we are seeing less dangerous toys leaving China’s borders. We need to step up that action and give you support; but importers, too, must bear the responsibility for the import of dangerous toy products, and I therefore welcome the supply chain review to close the gaps left by manufacturers. Commissioner, we are not prepared to make any compromises on toy safety; warnings may not be enough. We can see, for example in the US, that we have bans for under-threes on some toys and we have warnings for over-six-year-olds; they complain that they are importing our dangerous toys from the European market, so perhaps we need to follow the US model in this area. So let us get swift and effective measures to restore the confidence of our consumers in the toy market. I pledge, Commissioner, that my committee will work with you to achieve that.

 Mr President, as the Commissioner is aware, we have had several discussions around the general problem of the safety of services. I very much welcome the Commissioner’s willingness to look seriously at how we can improve the situation for consumers. I believe there is a serious consumer-protection gap on the provision of services. If a consumer travelling on business or on holiday in the EU books a hotel, can he or she be sure that safety measures are in place to prevent fire or the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning or, indeed, whether the swimming pool is safe for children to swim in? Yet, as we have seen with toys and products, we are prepared to protect our consumers. When they are accessing or purchasing a service in the internal market, consumer protection does not seem to be there in the same way. Yet many consumers assume that, when they stay in a hotel, there are adequate and very basic safety standards there. And, of course, as we have seen, they are inadequate. I do not believe it is rocket science to install fire sprinklers or carbon monoxide detectors. I think fires and deaths are preventable if the right standards and systems are in place. Frankly, I think it is too late – and not good enough – to revoke a licence after children have died, when in fact they should never have had the licence in the first place. We want to help the Commissioner take action to drive up standards, to cut fire risks and deaths and protect the consumer, so yes, let us think about how we can best achieve this. Mr Harbour’s proposal around an EU rating system is certainly something we may want to look at, but that is something, I believe, that the consumer needs to have easy access to, and I believe the tour operators’ hotel systems should actually put that out for the consumer, so I can then decide I do not wish to go to the hotel or the villa that does not have a safe swimming pool, does not have fire sprinklers or does not have carbon monoxide detectors. I believe we can do better for our citizens: we can prevent deaths. I think tonight we have launched the debate, but I do believe – and I think it can be seen from the interventions – that it is the beginning of a campaign for safer services, for the very basic minimum standards to be protected, and I hope that we can make further progress in this area in the not too distant future.

 Mr President, Mr Rübig has accused me twice now of bringing a firearm into the Chamber. I want to clarify that this was agreed to by the security services, and the presidency was aware of it. Up until this vote it was not a firearm. Now that the House has voted that it is a firearm, I am prepared to hand it over to the authorities!
 Arlene McCarthy  (PSE
). – 
 Mr President, I am speaking as a concerned MEP, and not as committee chairwoman. I believe that, with this new law on weapons, we can demonstrate to our citizens that Europe can act to tackle the problem of illegal guns. We have tough laws in Britain, but without this EU law guns will continue to find their way onto the streets of cities like Manchester and Liverpool. Colleagues, this is a 9 mm Smith &amp; Wesson copy – a convertible weapon designed to fire blanks or CS gas pellets – which, when converted, fires live ammunition. Do not panic – it is not loaded, it is convertible, not converted. A gun like this tragically killed a 12-year-old Manchester girl, Kamilah Peniston. Mothers Against Violence, mothers who have lost children to gun crime, ask me where these guns are coming from and what we are doing here to stop the illegal smuggling of these deadly weapons. Greater Manchester Police tell me that 46% of all guns seized last year were converted weapons. Converted weapons are now a cheap, popular choice for criminals, and they are a growing problem in Europe – not just in the UK. Therefore, I thank Commissioner Verheugen, Ms Kallenbach our rapporteur, Mr Alvaro and 25 of the Member States for supporting my amendments to crack down and tighten controls on these convertible weapons. Putting them under the same control system as real hand guns will make it much more difficult for criminal gangs to get their hands on them, and it will cut the smuggling of these weapons, which are banned in Britain. The Association of Chief Police Officers in the UK fully supports this law and its requirements for convertible and deactivated weapons, for marking, for traceability and for controls on weapons’ sales by distance communication, including the internet. Following the recent tragic shooting in Finland and the attempted shooting at a school in Germany, it is clear that we need stricter EU-wide standards of gun control. This is Europe being pragmatic and taking practical action to protect our citizens. The tragic and senseless gun deaths of young people in my region – 15-year-old Jessie James, 11-year-old Rhys Jones and 12-year-old Kamilah Peniston – are a deeply sensitive issue. Their lives were taken from them. We, here in Europe, owe it to them and their families to ensure that we take these guns off the streets.
 Arlene McCarthy  (PSE
). – 
 Mr President, I have to answer that question because it just shows that Mr Rübig does not understand the legislation in front of him. Because it is not defined as a firearm, you do not need a permit: anybody off the street can buy it – a criminal can buy it. So Mr Rübig should get his facts right before he intervenes. I rise, though, on a point of order, concerning an accusation made by Ms Goudin and I wish to correct the record of the Minutes. No shadow has been excluded from this trialogue. The IND/DEM Group was invited, it appointed a rapporteur 18 months ago, it did not turn up to any meetings in committee or to any hearings, and it did not turn up to any trialogues. Ms Goudin knows very well that she was only appointed two weeks ago to take over from the shadow rapporteur, who did not turn up. I will defend the work of our rapporteur, shadows and the committee because we take our issues seriously, we do a serious job and the IND/DEM Group should take its work seriously as well.

 Mr President, as chair of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I welcome today’s important debate as a first step in reviewing Europe’s consumer policy and, I believe, in renewing our commitment to our consumers. We are very grateful for the work that our rapporteur, Ms Patrie, has carried out. As has been mentioned several times, this is a timely debate, given announcements made in the summer and again this week for a recall of dangerous products from China that were sold bearing the CE mark – fooling our consumers into believing that such products are safe and meet EU standards. The focus of our debate today and the central objective of our consumer policy must be the protection of consumer safety and health – particularly as regards vulnerable consumers and children. We have to ensure that consumers have rights and remedies when something goes wrong. I want to use this debate to stress the importance of enforcement, as Ms Thyssen has. The fact is that we have laws on our statute books, but Member States are not demonstrating sufficient commitment to transposing these laws. Long delays are denying consumers their rights. Where consumer laws have been transposed, enforcement is often patchy and haphazard. The RAPEX report, in the case of the notification of dangerous products, shows that not all Member States are participating in the notification system. There is an increased awareness of product safety by both business and national authorities, but more action, Commissioner, is required. Recalling dangerous Chinese toy imports can only be the last resort. We have a general product safety law, we have a toy safety law but we need to step up enforcement and inspection regimes. This is the only way to ensure that consumers have genuine and effective protection. That is why, Commissioner, I want to encourage you to set up a consumer scoreboard as a tool to report on Member States’ activities in the consumer protection field and to help us, as elected representatives, to follow up on weak enforcement and delayed transposition. Finally, Commissioner, I want to thank you for coming to me directly, as chair, to discuss the issue of the safety of toys. I want to pledge the support of our committee to work with you to crack down on the import of dangerous toy products, to get tougher controls at our borders to intercept these products, to obtain stronger national inspection and enforcement regimes, to ensure that products do not get on the shelves in our shops and, of course, to have joint action with the US to force China to raise its production standards to meet EU safety standards. This review, I believe, is a chance for the EU to demonstrate our commitment to European consumers and to offer the highest standards possible – and, indeed, for Europe to be a beacon of consumer protection for the rest of the world.
 Arlene McCarthy  (PSE

 Mr President, as chairwoman of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection I would like to congratulate Mr Toubon, particularly on the way he has worked to achieve a consensus among all the groups for a set of recommendations on the review of the internal market, which I trust the Commission will take on board as well as today’s debate. I want to stress some of the proposals which I believe are key in engaging citizens in the progress and development of the internal market and in boosting confidence in particular. More involvement of national parliaments to better reflect the diverse views of Member States and their citizens is a very important proposal. Equally important is the inclusion of social and environmental dimensions of the internal market, and of course the internal market needs to continue to deliver more choice, better quality and competitive prices for our consumers and small businesses. Reducing administrative burdens and boosting innovation, while protecting our intellectual property, will enable us to compete in the global arena. Consumer confidence in the internal market can only work when citizens are able to see the benefits and enjoy the rights and opportunities they have as members of the EU. Therefore, I hope that we will go beyond simply protecting our consumers to making sure we have remedies for them when things go wrong. In that regard, I would like to raise the very important work that is being done by the SOLVIT network and the European consumer centres. These informal, practical networks provide quick solutions to very complex problems in what is perceived by our citizens as a bureaucratic environment. One of the reasons why they do not want to shop across the border is because they do not trust that they will have a remedy when something goes wrong. The Commission should therefore strengthen these networks as an essential element of the review process. I think, Commissioner, we share the same objectives: to achieve an internal market that is relevant and responsive to all – 
you said that in your introductory comments –
 and I think that we want now to work together with you to ensure that our citizens continue to achieve the level of access to the internal market, the benefits and indeed the protection with remedies and redress.

 Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the coordinators of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection for supporting my work as chairwoman in bringing forward the first detailed piece of work the committee has undertaken on transposition and implementation of internal market legislation, in this case to examine the effectiveness of public procurement law. The report is a culmination of months of extensive research and informal consultation with Member States, public procurement practitioners and specialists, and staff in the Commission. It has been greatly assisted by the Internal Market Committee’s secretarial staff, to whom I also express my thanks. We held a workshop to look at best practice, putting the spotlight on public procurement and demonstrating Parliament’s commitment to better regulation while improving businesses’ experience of EU law and demonstrating the benefits for the citizen. Why did we decide to look at public procurement legislation? A series of negative press articles from 2003 to 2006 seemed to suggest that the internal market was failing because of a lack of regard for EU procurement rules, in particular the rules on non-discrimination on grounds of nationality. Concerns were also expressed that the number of illegal direct awards was rising. The public procurement market, estimated to be around 16% of the EU’s GDP and worth some EUR 1.7 trillion, is clearly of enormous economic significance for growth and job creation across the EU. An increasing amount of public procurement is carried out by our local authorities offering potential for more jobs at local level, in particular for SMEs. Our analysis led us to the view that there are, indeed, a number of problems with the correct application of EU public procurement law, including cases of cross-border discrimination. A significant number of Commission infringement cases deal with matters of public procurement, and we could have drawn up a report naming and shaming bad practices or naming the Member States, five of which have still, in 2007, not implemented the Public Procurement Directives. To have done so would have guaranteed us media headlines. However, we believe that, on balance, the opening of the public procurement market across the EU is contributing positively to the health of the internal market and helping the EU to meet the Lisbon goals. Therefore, we chose instead to focus in a constructive way on actions that would improve the record of Member States in tackling persistent – and, indeed, emerging – transposition and implementation problems. The report therefore recommends that the Commission propose an action plan strongly encouraging Member States to tackle the problems. We ask for collaborative practices between Member States and the Commission, including informal information sharing at an early stage. We stress the role of informal dispute settlement, alongside formal remedies. We are asking the Commission to publish guidelines on the application of social criteria, once its study in this area is complete, and we want to see more exchange of best practice in public procurement with, for example, systematic training of procurement professionals and coordination of the work of European networks for the exchange of best practice. We are recommending adoption of all optional elements of the new directive, such as e-auctions, and we want to see set up national advisory agencies to assist contracting authorities as well as tenderers. We recognise that the Commission needs sufficient human resources in this area to deal with the problems, and we are also calling for better data collection in public procurement, which we know is a very difficult area because of the sheer volume involved and the varying national accounting systems. We want political commitment from the Member States, in particular, to accelerate the correct transposition and implementation of this legislation. A current hot issue is in-house service provision and the applicability of the public procurement rules to public-public partnerships. The committee decided there is not currently sufficient ECJ case-law following the Teckal case to provide legal clarity on what public authorities should do. However, we urge the Commission to continue its work in this area to resolve the issues and get legal clarity. I remind colleagues that we recently adopted Mrs Weiler’s report, which makes very good recommendations on public-public partnerships. Finally, there is a clear relationship between this report and the future of the single market. Indeed, the Commission is expected to report back on future policy in the autumn. I would like to thank all colleagues for their input into this debate and all those who have contributed at our workshop and in many other ways. I look forward to strong support from the Commission for what I believe is a positive and a practical report to improve this important sector of the internal market.

 Mr President, I am sorry Mr Booth has gone because I would like to tell him that I am a music lover and perhaps next time he could perform a Euro-rap when my report is up! As the Commissioner is aware, the defence procurement market accounts for a large share of EU public procurement, estimated at about EUR 80 billion out of a combined Member State defence budget of EUR 170 billion, and that is why we are tabling this question today: defence procurement is still being awarded within mostly fragmented national markets. The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, therefore, takes note of the Commission’s interpretative communication on the application of Article 296 of the Treaty in the field of defence procurement, adopted on 7 December 2006. This helped clarify the existing legal framework. However, we also further note efforts by the Commission to propose new legislation, which should substantially contribute to creating a more competitive environment for the European defence industry and its suppliers. Therefore, we want to ask the Commissioner the following questions. What progress is being made on the draft directive on the procurement of defence equipment not subject to the derogations of Article 296? What are the subsequent steps planned by the Commission in this area? How does the Commission evaluate, from the perspective of a fair and efficient working of the internal market, the situation within the European defence industry, where in different Member States a significant number of highly skilled jobs appear to be at risk? What impact does it expect the directive to have on the sector, and what is the Commission’s strategy to induce Member States to cooperate more closely on defence procurement issues, to improve transparency and gradually open up their national defence procurement markets in order to establish a well-performing and competitive environment for this sensitive sector? We should also like to know what conclusions can be drawn from the code of conduct that was established in 2006, and how the Commission understands the future relationship between a potential directive and the code of conduct.

 Madam President, in fact Mr Stevenson is right: eight years ago Labour MEPs were calling for an end to the cruel trade in cat and dog fur. Commissioner, you will probably remember that the late Phillip Whitehead, the former chairman of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, asked you as a Commission to take action. On 30 December last year, I received a petition on behalf of concerned citizens signed by over a quarter of a million people calling for us to bring in that ban. We have acted, but I believe that it is the citizens, in their determination, and animal welfare campaigners who should take the credit for this new law and for helping us to persuade you, Commissioner, to give us the legal power to ban it. There is plenty of evidence of the inhuman treatment of cats and dogs bred for fur. Animal welfare organisations have been contacting my office and welcoming the law. Their only criticism is that it has taken us too long. But this law is also about protecting consumers who have unwittingly been deceived into buying clothes, toys and household products made from cat and dog fur. I would say that people power can win the day over bureaucracy and legal barriers. I want to stress to the Commission and to the Member States that the committee’s negotiating team wanted the EU to adopt the highest international standards and best practices in ensuring we ban this obscene trade and that cat and dog fur products do not end up in the shops by the back door. So can I just be very clear: we insist no loopholes are created by not possible derogations, exceptional derogations. That is the language of the agreement we made with the Commission and the Member States. We insist on a report back on how the ban is being implemented and action if it is not working. We expect Member States to take their responsibilities seriously in both implementing and enforcing the ban. There must be tough and dissuasive penalties to deter the cat and dog fur traders. In short, a ban must mean a ban in principle and in practice –
 not a restriction enabling continuation of the trade by the back door.

 Mr President, as chair of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection I have got one minute to speak, and if I were speaking here on my mobile phone for one minute, as an ordinary consumer, I would still be paying excessive costs for making the call. Of course this law will change all of that. Consumers will see the cost of calls halved. They will receive automatic information on the cost of making and receiving calls and they will benefit from an automatic Eurotariff. The IMCO Committee first raised this issue in 2005 when in a hearing we responded to consumer complaints on excessive charging and now in 2007 this Parliament has shown it can deliver for consumers. So this is good news and we want this to come in as early as possible. We want consumers to continue to benefit from this, even after the three years when the law will lapse, but consumers should be aware that the costs of using their mobile phone for internet access or texting is still excessive. Commissioner, we would ask you to act in this area. The industry itself should move to reduce these prices. We have shown that we will act here on behalf of consumers if they are being ripped off. I hope the industry will take this message seriously.
 Arlene McCarthy (PSE

 Mr President, on a point of order, I have to object to the way the questions are being handled. Members take the time to draft questions, submit them six to eight weeks in advance, and then you do not take those questions because you give the floor to other Members who wander in, look at the list and may have a fleeting interest in the question. You have taken up time with two questioners or people who have not taken the time to question the Commissioner properly. I object to that on the basis that I have taken the time to draft proper questions and I would like an answer from the Commissioner so that I can also follow up with the press on those issues. In future Members will not want to table questions if this is the way you intend to conduct Question Time.

.  While the European Parliamentary Labour Party very much supports the work of the rapporteur Mr Zingaretti on the proposal for Criminal Sanctions for the Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights, we continue to have serious reservations on the Commission proposal to rush to extend criminal sanctions to first pillar legislation before the completion of current hearings at the ECJ. Moreover some of the proposals passed today concerning the definitions of intentional infringement and commercial scale threaten to remove the discretion of trained and qualified national judges to take the circumstances of each individual case into account. Such decisions are best left to national courts and national judges who have a wealth of experience in dealing with such cases. The text as voted by Parliament runs the risk of potentially putting innocent consumers in prison, while at the same time creating loopholes for individual criminals engaged in organised and serious crime. The compromise which the rapporteur agreed will lead to legal uncertainty and remove an essential power of discretion from judges and national courts. For this reason the Labour MEPs have voted against this

 Mr President, just a little bit of respect for a rapporteur from my colleagues would be appreciated! I shall be very brief. It was not possible to schedule a debate on this report; there are no amendments; we are voting because we want to now open discussions with the Council and the Commission. I also wanted to say that this is not the last word, and we reserve the right to reopen some of these compromises if necessary with the Council and the Commission to ensure that mediation truly works for our citizens and that we achieve our objectives. We can now move to the vote.

 Mr President, I should just like to bring to the attention of the House a technical amendment that we should make pursuant to Rule 155. In the Commission’s proposal there was a technical omission under Article 2, dealing with the transposition of the proposal. The exact date for the transposition in the Member States is missing. Therefore I propose under Rule 155 to add ‘[18 months after the date of publication]’ as the date for transposition. This should be specified. I should like to propose that to Members as a technical amendment.
 Arlene McCarthy (PSE
). – 
 Mr President, today, as Chair of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I am immensely proud of the work and commitment of both our rapporteur and the members of the committee in enabling Europe to finally give the go-ahead to open up the market in services. It was the MEPs and Parliament who found the compromise to save the services law from national deadlock and paralysis in Council. In the British press, surprisingly, Parliament has been praised for coalescing as ‘a serious and effective institution’. The article goes on to say that the key to the services law’s success has been forged here in Strasbourg. I agree with the journalist who says that it is time to pay more attention to the European Parliament. I want to thank the Council and the Commission for paying attention to Parliament’s right of regulatory scrutiny in the new procedures and accepting our three amendments. This has been the single most controversial but also the most important piece of legislation in the EU. Despite our ideological and national differences, we MEPs have managed to find a way to open up the market, to boost jobs and growth and give our citizens the trust and confidence to use and access those services across Europe. The law has been controversial in cutting red tape and bureaucracy for business, but we need to ensure high quality standards and choice for consumers, while safeguarding employees’ conditions and health and safety. Parliament listened to people’s concerns and fears, so that the freedom to provide services is not the freedom to undermine consumer or employee rights. Each Member State must now ensure free access to its territory and it must be equally clear that the right to maintain national rules, to protect public policy, public health, security or the environment, must not mean that legitimate protection turns into negative protectionism. It must be justifiable and proportionate and must not discriminate against other operators. Let us look to the future. The litmus test will be whether we can deliver and open up the market for businesses and give the benefits to our consumers. We cannot shout about the benefits if we do not deliver. Our work is not yet done. We must continue to work together as three institutions to make good on our commitment to deliver. Certainly I, as Chair of the Internal Market Committee, stand ready to make good on our commitment to assist the Commission and the Council in making sure we respect the rights of consumers and employees and deliver for business across Europe.

 Mr President, I am not the author of the question but the Chairperson of the committee that is taking the question forward on behalf of Members. I want to stress that the members of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection took a unanimous decision to table this oral question to ask the Commissioner for an update regarding the ongoing infringement proceedings against nine Member States concerning restrictions imposed on sports betting markets. The committee would like the Commission to tell us in particular what progress has been made on the infringement proceedings launched on 4 April 2006 and what future steps are planned in this area. Is the Commissioner considering a legal framework for online gambling? As we are on the brink of agreeing the Services Directive, we are well aware of the need for Member States to fulfil their Treaty obligations under Article 49 as regards the free movement of services. The Commissioner will be aware of the committee’s decision to remove gambling services from the Services Directive, not least because of the complexity of the gambling market. However, the freedom to provide services has in the case of the gambling sector clashed with national law in a number of Member States, which have introduced restrictive laws limiting the cross-border supply of online betting and gambling services. We support the Commission in ensuring that these laws are compatible with Article 49, while respecting the rights of Member States to protect the public interest, as long as the rules are necessary, proportionate and non-discriminatory, i.e. not discriminating against other EU operators. It is hypocritical, on public interest grounds, for a Member State to prevent other EU online operators from entering a national market, while at the same time allowing its own national online market to grow considerably while not applying those public interest rules. That is the issue we hope the Commission will address. I would like to take the debate in a different direction. I believe that we need an EU response to the challenge of the global online gambling market. This is a market set to grow to a value of EUR 20 billion by 2010. In 2003, in the EU-25 commercial gaming industries, lotteries and casinos and betting services were worth some EUR 51.5 billion and there are some 2300 worldwide online casino sites. In the UK, for example, during the World Cup football matches, 30% of those making online bets on UK services were women. It crosses all classes and all generations. The rapid growth of online services and remote gambling and betting services has de facto already erased national boundaries. However, let us not follow the US model of pulling up the drawbridge by enacting the 2006 Bush legislation – the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act, making it a crime for banks to process or transfer funds via online betting sites. This is simply protectionism hiding behind a smokescreen of the so-called protection of consumers against gambling excesses. In reality, it is a law to stop foreign operators from competing or undermining the US casino and gambling market, while the States of Nevada and Las Vegas continue to develop their own online and remote gambling services. I believe it would be good if the Commissioner, on behalf of the 25 Member States, would engage in the campaign to get an international agreement on standards and rules in regulating eGambling. This is one way to minimise the differences between not only the international community but also the EU Member States, to ensure in the end that all states opt in to high standards both for operators and consumers. The objective would be to ensure that we develop standards to protect vulnerable consumers, in particular young adults and minors, to engender a sense of social responsibility from good operators and investors and to ensure that gambling is not used as a source of crime or financing criminal activities. The internet genie is out of the bottle: some 3.3 million EU citizens are regular online gamblers. This is a market that will grow. The EU should therefore be part of a wider international campaign for good and high standards. We need greater international cooperation to curb problem gambling and more research into the extent of participation in remote gambling. The study commissioned by the European Commission on gambling services in the internal market highlights the need to find common international standards and regulatory requirements that will protect EU citizens while allowing the market to operate. I hope the Commissioner will feel encouraged by tonight’s debate to continue with infringement proceedings. However, in reality, it is a thankless task, which takes years to resolve, often not with a satisfactory conclusion, and I believe the best way forward is for the EU now to be a leader, driving good and high common international standards that can help minimise the differences, protect consumers and force the operators to be socially responsible.

 Mr President, the committee and the political groups requested that we vote on compromise amendment 4 first, as it is the amendment that was agreed with the Council and the Commission in the trialogue. It respects our rules in Parliament on the new comitology procedure. That would mean, therefore, that amendment 2 will fall, when you take compromise amendment 4 first. In view of the statement given by Commissioner Frattini during the debate on Monday and his commitment to look at the effects of this regulation and the civil justice laws for parties domiciled in third countries, in particular the States of the European Economic Area, the groups have agreed not to insist on Amendment 1. Therefore we will be voting as groups against that amendment. I hope that avoids any confusion during the vote.

 Mr President, Commissioner, almost 12 months ago we first gave our approval to the European payment order, a new law to assist in simplified debt recovery for businesses and citizens owed money in another EU Member State. Today, a year later, the committee’s view has not changed. We believe that we need this pragmatic and practical EU law, in particular to ensure that businesses and citizens have an affordable system to recover those debts owed to them. Why? Because until this law comes into force, recovery of debts from another EU State is a costly legal process. In some cases, money spent on lawyers and administrative costs exceeds the amount owed to the individual. More significantly, studies and experience show that companies which do not get their debts paid are at risk of collapsing, with knock-on effects not just in terms of job losses, but also for other SMEs in the supply chain. Out of between 30 and 40 billion invoices in Europe each year, as many as 1 billion default and turn into debt cases. Interim Justicia carried out a survey on payment practices in 16 European countries some 10 years ago. The average delay then was just 14 days. By the end of 2003, however, this had not declined, but risen to 16 days. According to a World Bank study, ‘Doing Business in 2004: Understanding Regulation’, the Nordic countries have the most efficient and effective legal systems of the countries surveyed. They take the least time to reach a solution while keeping costs low. Italy is one of the countries with the longest delays worldwide. The explanation it is said lies in the lax appeal process, which allows proceedings to be disrupted at any point during a trial. Spain, by contrast, has one of the most complex legal systems, which generates higher costs and leads to longer court proceedings. My own Member State, the UK, has some three systems operating for payments, again creating confusion for businesses or the public. Extensive differences in legal regulation of overdue payment recovery therefore lead to uncertainties, especially in EU trade, and the additional costs prevent the EU’s aim of equal opportunities for market access for both local and EU operating companies. It is clear that a lack of enforcement systems for payments undermines the internal market and business confidence and that, as a result, SMEs have continued to experience cash flow problems caused by late payments. The European payment order will also apply to individual citizens who work or live in another Member State and who can also take advantage of this new law. Of course, the high and expanding volume of trade within the EU and the increased movement of people raise the likelihood that more and more businesses may become involved in cross-border litigation. There is a risk that citizens may not be inclined to assert their rights because of the obstacles they face, particularly in dealing with the legal system in another Member State and with unfamiliar procedures and unknown costs. It is essential, therefore, that the EU provide for a judicial area where private individuals and businesses can have access to justice and redress in the case of an uncontested claim. This procedural law will help facilitate that access. The payment order introduces a practical EU-level instrument for obtaining an enforceable decision and I believe in this way we can demonstrate to citizens that the EU is delivering a practical tool to assist them with redress and remedies. I want to put on record my thanks to members of the committee, in particular the shadows, Mr Wieland, who is here this evening, and Mrs Wallis, who cannot be here. They have not only supported my approach but have made useful and constructive proposals for amendments at every stage of the procedure. The committee consulted with key protagonists and we believe we focused on the core issues. Both my shadows were concerned to ensure that the forms and the annex, the bones of the proposal, were simple enough for businesses to be able to fill them out with minimum bureaucracy. Only time and experience will tell if this has been achieved. That is why, under the new comitology procedures, Parliament needs to be consulted and informed of any changes the Commission would like to make to the system. I would also like to thank the British Presidency, in particular the Minister Baroness Ashton, who was instrumental in helping us to make progress on the clear drafting of this law. So now, Commissioner, at second reading we are down to the last few details. Mrs Wallis is concerned that the Commission should seriously address the potential discrimination affecting citizens and businesses where EEA members can participate in the single market, but cannot be a party to the EPO. I hope the Commission will address this issue. The forms should be user-friendly and simple and we would therefore like the Commission to take on board our amendment in this area. Finally, since we started this process a year ago and since the Commission’s original proposal, we now have a new institutional agreement, with effect from July 2006. The committee and Parliament insist that the new regulatory scrutiny procedure and rule should be respected in this legislation and on the payment order. Commissioner, let me say how much we have appreciated the cooperation of your departments in this area. I hope that, together with the Finnish Presidency, we can sign off the European payment order and begin the process of putting it into law across all the Member States of the EU, so that businesses and citizens can be confident of operating in the internal market in the knowledge that the failure to pay a debt does not end up in endless court proceedings with no outcome. Thanks to the European Union, there is now a simple and user-friendly system for speedy payment of debts which, I believe, will drive forward the internal market for SMEs and boost the EU economy.

 Commissioner, I have a personal dilemma: I represent a country that is pro-enlargement but a region that is urging me to vote against Bulgarian membership. Why? Because my constituent, Michael Shields, is serving a ten-year sentence for a violent attack of which he continues to maintain he is innocent. The Bulgarian criminal justice system has not given Michael a fair trial. His only recourse is to take his case to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. When new defence evidence came forward, it was ignored by the Bulgarian authorities; when another Liverpool man confessed to the crime, it was disregarded by the Bulgarians. I urge the Bulgarian authorities to restore our faith in their criminal justice system. I urge the Commissioner to ask the authorities to take up the offer of assistance by the UK to interview witnesses and examine pre- and post-trial evidence that was rejected in his appeal. Any EU Member States, including mine, can make mistakes. The true test of a democracy is the will to redress any potential wrongs and ensure that real justice is served. Commissioner, I will send you a copy of this independent documentary, which shows that my constituent did not have a fair trial and that there was a severe problem with the police investigation.

 Mr President, as Chair of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection I very much welcome this joint debate on better regulation and the opportunity to discuss with the Council and the Commission how we can improve the regulatory experience for consumers, citizens and businesses that are at the sharp end of making sense of implementing EU laws. The confidence and trust of citizens, consumers and business in the EU itself is linked to their experience and perception of EU laws and the impact they have on their daily lives. I want to focus on improving better regulation for the internal market and ensuring that we achieve a sense of purpose in our law-making for consumers in the internal market. The internal market accounts for almost one third of the Community acquis
. Good-quality, effective and simple legislation in the internal market should open up opportunities for cross-border trade and give consumers increased choice, while protecting environmental, social and consumer rights. At the same time, getting legislation right in the internal market is critical to achieving the Lisbon goals of jobs, growth and competitiveness. I believe that the internal market will benefit most from a joint and coordinated approach by all three institutions to improving the entire regulatory cycle. That means that we also need to think of the consequences of the midnight deals and compromises that we make, and consider whether they are going to confuse or clarify laws for end users. That starts, in my view, with good, clear drafting of laws, high-quality impact assessments and effective, comprehensive and transparent stakeholder consultation. The Member States too must take their responsibilities seriously and ensure good and correct implementation of internal market laws. They must resist the temptation often to gold-plate or add on national requirements. Although transposition rates are improving, as shown in the internal market scoreboards, there is still room for much improvement. That is why we are asking for a fast-track infringement procedure for test cases in the internal market. We need to learn from the failures and mistakes of EU laws. That is why we would like to see both ex ante
 and, in particular, ex post
 impact assessments or evaluations of where we went wrong. Has this legislation achieved its objective or, on the contrary, has it led to distortion and fragmentation of the internal market? Some believe that the impact assessments should be handed over to an external body. I do not share that approach, as I believe that the internal market laws should be the responsibility of Commission officials as part of the discipline of effective policy-making. However, the Internal Market Committee insists that all legislative proposals be accompanied by a quality impact assessment, a summary and a better regulation checklist on internal market proposals. Of course alternative regulation is a subject of much scepticism. While the interinstitutional agreement provides for this non-legislative option, we insist with respect to internal market laws that Parliament is both informed of and consulted on such alternative approaches. They are justified by impact assessments. Equally, we must have redress for the consumer and sanctions if these alternative regulations fail to deliver benefits for the consumer in the internal market. I want to stress the work of the Internal Market Committee as an active partner in the better regulation process. I know that Commissioners often say that Parliament does not take its role seriously. We were the first committee to commission our own impact assessment, under Mr Whitehead’s chairmanship, for amendments on the Toubon report on nominal quantities for pre-packed products. On the pyrotechnics proposal we are conducting an impact assessment on amendments proposed by our rapporteur. We will look at a cost/benefit analysis of his amendments to that proposal. We are conducting a hearing on the impact of public procurement laws on the internal market. EU public procurement accounts for 16% of EU GDP, yet the 1992 package of laws, as demonstrated in a number of ECJ cases, has not achieved the desired opening of the market. Let us be clear. It is the consumer, the citizen and businesses that pay the price when laws are not effective. Bad drafting leads to legal uncertainty, poor or confused transposition and at the end of the line is a confused businessman or consumer who loses confidence in the internal market. The ECJ, after years of deliberation, becomes the arbiter of better legislation. That is not the right way forward. Finally, I want to quote the cases of SOLVIT, which I believe is an excellent initiative of the Commission. A qualified doctor tried for a number of years to register as a doctor in Spain. He spent a large sum of money on legal fees, had lost confidence in the internal market, yet the SOLVIT system intervened and helped him within ten weeks to get registration in Spain as a doctor. That doctor said: ‘SOLVIT has restored my confidence in the internal market’. So, the reality is that good laws that are well drafted, easy to implement, easy to enforce and police, are the key to restoring confidence in the internal market. I hope that today’s debate is the beginning of a process of close cooperation, sharing best practice between the institutions in a close partnership of equals, to build and restore that confidence that the doctor I mentioned was asking us to achieve for him as a consumer in the internal market. (Applause)

.  As Chair of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee, I welcome today's historic vote to open up the market in services across Europe. This is the final piece in the jigsaw of establishing the internal market. For too long, small and medium-sized enterprises have been prevented by ludicrous red tape from doing business in other EU Member States. With more than 53 cases before the European Court of Justice, where businesses are arguing for their right under the Treaty to provide services across Europe, it is time for us to set down rules for the operation of the service market. Parliament has listened to people's concerns and fears and ensured that the freedom to provide services is not the freedom to undermine citizens' employment terms and conditions and their rights as consumers. We want to end protectionism but protect working people and consumers. We were happy to vote for and support a compromise which delivered this critical balance of interests for citizens across the EU.
 Arlene McCarthy (PSE

 Mr President, my predecessor, Mr Philip Whitehead MEP, would have been proud to have spoken on behalf of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection. He would have been proud of the work done by our rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt, and all the Members who have worked so hard to improve and amend the Commission proposal. He would have wanted to have been here to witness the mature and responsible way in which this Parliament is building a consensus on behalf of our citizens for the opening of the market on services. If we get it right, we can open up the market, boost jobs and growth across the EU and help Europe compete globally with the booming services market in India and China. The Bolkestein proposal was flawed because it failed to recognise that if you want the public to support the opening-up of the market you have to convince them of the benefits and reassure them that it will not undermine working or consumer rights. If you want to encourage citizens to support change and reform, you have to explain to them what is in it for them, for their own life prospects. It is Parliament which is speaking for the citizen and taking up the issues of all our citizens, businesses, consumers, workers and the unemployed. So let us make it simple. We need to end the ludicrous discriminatory practices that are stopping our businesses from getting a foothold in the European market. Why should a business have to apply to join a local chamber of commerce, only to be told there is a five-year waiting list? Why should a business have to set up four offices and pay a EUR 500 000 deposit? The black economy is thriving in Europe in the services sector because these complex and costly barriers are encouraging businesses to engage in undeclared and illegal work. Let us make them legal with these rules. Let us get rid of protectionism, but protect consumers and working rights. I believe consumers can see the benefit of choice and competition if they can be sure that if something goes wrong they can have a speedy remedy in a local court and they do not have to chase down a bad provider to Lisbon, Paris, Warsaw or London to have their rights recognised. This is what we are trying to achieve in these compromises. Those working in the service sector need the guarantee that their employment rights are protected. This is not about old or new Europe. This is not about left or right. Citizens are looking to us to make the right choice: to get rid of crippling protectionism in the single market in services and protect working and consumer rights. I believe that if we get it right it will be a victory for parliamentary democracy and a boost to jobs and growth for future generations of Europeans. Finally, I would like to ask the Commission to look at ensuring that these single points of delivery, these one-stop-shops that are so vital to delivering, monitoring and supervising the kind of services we want. It should look at setting up an EU trust mark or an EU quality assurance scheme to give the consumer the trust and the confidence to use these services which respect consumers’ rights and working rights.

 It was my predecessor, Philip Whitehead, who tabled this question on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and I know that he would have wanted to ensure that we support the SOLVIT system and encourage the Commission to refine and develop the problem-solving network on behalf of EU citizens and consumers. That is why we have tabled a number of questions to the Commissioner to assist in further developing and supporting the SOLVIT network. I want to share with you the view of a United Kingdom citizen living in the Netherlands who used the SOLVIT system. He said, ‘SOLVIT is a great service and it should really shout louder about its achievements’. The positive achievements and experiences of our citizens translate into positive attitudes towards Europe, and I believe that our duty as legislators has to be to ensure that the laws we pass are implemented in a way that gives our citizens and consumers the benefits of working, living or doing business in the internal market. When errors or problems arise in the implementation of EU laws, not only are citizens denied their rights, but the very credibility of the EU as a law-making institution is undermined. SOLVIT is a means of righting these wrongs and assisting national administrations in ensuring the correct implementation and transposition of the legislation that we pass together in the European Union. At the same time, it has the potential to be the customer service face, or the front desk, of the EU law-making process. It can influence people’s perceptions of the EU. I have referred constituency cases to the SOLVIT network and have been impressed with how the issues have been handled and with the prompt responses to our questions. One of my constituents had difficulty in having a blue disabled badge issued in Germany: Mrs Nuttall was informed that she had to be a resident in Germany. SOLVIT stepped in and contacted the local German authority, which then issued her with a temporary blue disabled parking badge – again, that was the EU delivering for citizens. As is indicated in our question, the committee certainly believes that the online problem-solving network can find pragmatic and rapid solutions, which do not have to end up in the courts or as infringement cases. Clearly, however, SOLVIT needs more resources and support, and needs to promote itself and its availability to the public. It needs to make its services better known to libraries, to consumer watchdogs and, of course, to my fellow MEPs, as well as to local authorities, which are often in breach of EU law. I believe, as does my constituent, that a revamp of the website is needed, with, where possible, real-life cases that have been solved by SOLVIT. Mr Meehan has said to me that the SOLVIT system could benefit from joint cooperation with Europe Direct. Often he has contacted Europe Direct with questions only to find that it is the SOLVIT staff that have the technical and legal expertise to answer the questions that the public and his citizens need answered. There could well be a strong role for the SOLVIT network in assisting with the implementation of the Services Directive. It could assist in aiding market access for businesses, by supporting the role of the single point of contact for businesses to get into the single market in services, known as the ‘one-stop shop’. The committee certainly wants to see SOLVIT strengthened. We want to see it better resourced, both in the Commission and at Member State level, and we want to see SOLVIT as a trouble-shooter for citizens and consumers throughout the EU. Commissioner, I hope you will take up the issues in the committee’s question.

 Mr President, I should like to thank my colleagues from the various political groups who have worked so hard and effectively to achieve today’s first-reading compromise package with the Council and the Commission: in particular, Mrs Wallis, Mr Wieland, Mr Lehne, and Mrs Berger from my own political group. The UK Presidency has been very cooperative and has taken on board many of Parliament’s amendments, which allows us now to vote on this first reading package of the general enacting terms of the European payment order. That will now help us to speed up and simplify cross-border payments for business. It will also assist debt recovery. In short, we know that companies that do not get paid are at risk of collapsing, with knock-on effects for staff and suppliers. A lack of enforcement systems for payment undermines the internal market and business confidence. There are, however, some outstanding technical issues involved in drawing up the annexes and finalising our recitals that need to be resolved with the Austrian Presidency. In addition, Mrs Wallis has asked us to look at a technical legal issue related to the ‘cross-border’ definition. I look forward to working with the Austrian Presidency and finalising this very pragmatic law that will assist businesses and citizens in recovering debts, and to a full plenary debate with the Council and Commission and a vote in the New Year. I urge Members, therefore, to vote for the agreed negotiated package that is before us today at first reading.

 As ever, the Commission never really answers the question because it was a 3½-year run of resources. I have to say we are not just talking about Commission resources; we are talking about millions of pounds spent on lawyers’ fees by people involved in this action. I have to ask the question again: does the Commission believe that is proportionate to the outcome of having achieved that one extra package will go to an operator other than Sky, with no guarantee that will be a free-to-air provider. It may well be another cable operator and, potentially, that will have a cost to the consumer. Will the Commission now, more importantly, allow this current agreement to run without interfering, so that we see whether it delivers for the public interest and allow the football clubs, particularly, to be able to have legal certainty in managing their own resources, especially when investing in community finance in their local areas?

 Mr President, I would like to thank you and the Office of the President for responding to the request from the Kashmiri community in my constituency, and indeed the Kashmiri Mayor of Manchester, Afzal Khan, to send condolences and aid to the victims of the earthquake. The death toll is rising; at least two million people are homeless with winter just weeks away. A terrible tragedy requires dramatic and speedy action and a generosity of financing and support to meet the aims and match the funding that we gave to the victims of the tsunami crisis as well. DM Digital Television, a TV company in my region, has been contacted by frantic relatives from across Europe seeking urgent help for orphans. I would ask the Commission to prioritise assistance to children and to orphans, to assist families and relatives in Europe and the UK to adopt orphans if they wish to, and to get assistance from the government and immigration authorities to enable this to go ahead. I would also ask for urgent medical attention to be provided. I would ask the Commission and the EU to act on this request as urgently as possible to assist those children and those orphans in need.

 Mr President, when we first discussed the issue of corporate governance following the high-level group's report, it was in the context of Enron and the WorldCom scandals. Experts from the EU accounting industry said that 'it could never happen in Europe', but then we had Parmalat, which had an audit committee – as did Enron – made up of eminent independent professors. The problem was that they did not show any independence of mind in challenging culpable business partners and the executive board. Prescriptive audit committees were never the answer under this proposal, which is more about changing audit culture and practice. Thanks to the pragmatism of our rapporteur, Bert Doorn, and good cooperation with the Commission and Presidency, we now have a flexible EU instrument that will raise the quality and consistency of audits across Europe while also respecting the good domestic company law provisions already in place. A principles-based threats and safeguards approach will lead to a much more effective and robust EU regime. This will prove much better than the Sarbanes-Oxley rules-based system which may make it easier to lock someone up but does not improve the ethics, independence and public supervision of auditing structures. It was sensible to remove the prescriptive obligation for mandatory audit committees and replace it with a proposal to assign those functions to a body that meets audit standards and objectives and can implement the requirements in a transparent way. I also welcome compromises around the issue of audit partner rotation and the issue of non-audit work. However, we have to deal with the issue of comitology. The Commission and successive Presidencies, including the United Kingdom Presidency, have stepped up their efforts to achieve better regulation by improving the quality of EU laws and transposition and implementation. Parliament has to be involved in this better regulation agenda and must have the right as co-legislator to ensure that the expert laws voted through this House can be scrutinised and monitored. It also has a role in transposition and implementation. I welcome the initiative by the Presidency and the offers to take forward the reform of the 1999 comitology procedures to ensure we can play a role in the better regulation and regulatory process, and I look forward to amendments to be put forward by Parliament being accepted in this area so that we can genuinely can play our role in the cooperation process.

 We have the opportunity to lead the world with good patent law, but are we up to the task? The legal framework is clear: Article 52 of the European Patent Convention states that software as such cannot be patented. All of us believe that we must set clear limits to patentability. We simply do not agree on how best to do that. We need to tighten up the law and ensure that examination practised does not permit the patenting of software or business methods. However, let us not forget that it is our inventiveness and capacity for innovation in software and dependent technologies that can help Europe to meet its objective of being the world’s most competitive economy by 2010. At a time when our traditional industries are migrating to China and the Far East, we have to rely on our inventiveness to earn our living. The revenue secured by patents and by licensing out our inventions to our global competitors gives us a return on the investment and assists us in creating jobs and growth. SMEs that are inventors argue that without patent protection they are in no position to negotiate with big business or protect themselves from larger companies ripping off their inventions. They need patent protection that is affordable and enforceable against industry giants. But we must also ensure that small software developers are not faced with a minefield of trivial patents. They must be able to innovate, write and develop lines of code and produce software processes without violating or breaking patent law. There are a number of amendments that could solve this problem so we can have a balanced, workable EU law which will not permit backdoor patenting but will ensure that, in an increasingly cut-throat and global arena, Europe’s most inventive companies can have access to patents and challenge US dominance in this field. Mr Crowley said that we could find ourselves in the perverse situation of paying out licence fees to US and Japanese companies for the very patents and innovations that we have invented. In fact, add India to that list. In its new Patents Act of 2005, India now allows embedded systems to be patentable. Are we seriously saying that here in Europe we value our inventiveness less than those countries new to innovation and inventions?

 Mr President, I too would like to add my congratulations to Mrs Bresso for ensuring particularly that we get this law to ban unfair commercial practices on the statute books at first reading. Many of my constituents have written to me as the victims of bullying and aggressive door-to-door salesmen. I believe this law heralds the beginning of the end of the con merchants and the dodgy dealers who dupe and mislead our consumers. Thank you to Mrs Bresso for adding to the list of banned practices the bogus prize draws and scam lotteries –
 a scourge that is plaguing my constituents and relieving them of large amounts of their hard-earned cash and pensions. One of my constituents paid out GBP 1 300 to a claims agent for transfer charges and tax to claim his non-existent EUR 630 000 winnings from the fake lottery La Primitiva
. Many of my elderly pensioners are being targeted by another bogus prize draw that promises winnings on return of a cheque paid for administrative costs. From premium rate telephone scams to property investment schemes; from door-to-door dodgy dealers offering building services, to the bogus lotteries and prize draws; the consumers in my country are being cheated out of GBP 1 billion a year. That is a lot of money lost to the economy. This law must protect the vulnerable consumer. It must ban unfair practices. I welcome this new law on behalf of my constituents. I believe it is a great model of how we can deliver on behalf of citizens and consumers in a relevant and practical way.

 Mr President, I welcome the proposals in the Mastenbroek report. As cross-border traffic and abuse of content on the Internet grows, Europe needs to step up its efforts to protect children from harmful and offensive content. It needs to act on the explosion of Internet paedophilia websites. However, more needs to be done by Europe not only as regards reporting and closing down sites but also in assisting law enforcement agencies to track and prosecute offenders and to identify the victims. I want to see the EU continuing its support for projects on identification of victims of Internet child abuse. Children who are the subject of abusing images carry their feelings of pain, guilt and suffering for the rest of their lives. Their images are on the net being traded by paedophiles on a daily basis. Out of a suspected 60 000 individuals portrayed in current abuse images, only 250 identifications have been recorded. New technologies, such as photo-messaging and digital cameras, make it easier for child abuse images to be produced and shared on the Internet. Let us hope that today’s report opens up new channels for action at EU level so that we can tackle and close down the criminal and offensive material and prevent the abuse of children.

On Friday we received the very tragic news that he had been executed.

– Mr President, I would like to thank our chair, Paolo Costa, not only for producing this report but also for his work as chair of the committee over the past parliamentary period. We are very indebted to his hard work. This report is a microcosm of Paolo Costa’s work, because it is a report that clearly shows that the wisdom of Solomon, allied to the diplomatic skills of the United Nations, is often needed when dealing with such technical details like ‘use it or lose it on the slot’. Our chair has been a very good Solomon and a very good United Nations diplomat during his time. But yet again the civil aviation industry has demonstrated its ability to be disunited on this important issue, with big airlines clamouring for a suspension while low-cost airlines and airports are demanding no suspension. What concerns me is that the big airlines, backed up by their various alliances, will not be satisfied with one suspension but will demand others and, knowing the unhealthy, undemocratic influence that some of them have both in this and national parliaments, I believe today is a mere start of a process, sadly not the end. My group will support the compromise proposed by our rapporteur and endorsed by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, but I stress that this suspension, as my colleague Georg Jarzembowski often says of the ‘use it or lose it’ clause, is a one-off for one period and does not represent a green light for further suspensions. If the Commission feels that further suspensions are needed, then they must be made part of a revised regulation, fully involving this Parliament and fully respecting the rights of this Parliament. It is ‘yes’ to debate, it is ‘yes’ to cooperation, but it is ‘no’ to comitology. I recognise the perilous state that the aviation industry and airlines in particular face. I also understand that slots are not just about take-off and landings. They have become capital collateral on airlines’ financial books and our rapporteur is right when he states that this aspect needs to be revisited in the future. Suspension of ‘use it or lose it’ will not affect London Heathrow, Frankfurt, Paris Charles de Gaulle or Amsterdam Schiphol, but it will affect regional airports serving those hubs, because it is those routes the airlines will suspend. What airlines need to remember is that there are other stakeholders, not just them, that will be affected by this suspension. Because the economic situation is not good and because we recognise the nonsense of flying empty aircraft, we will support our rapporteur on this occasion, but I hope our caveats to this have been duly noted for future reference, not only in this Chamber, but by the wider aviation industry as a whole. Finally, as the Socialist coordinator, can I thank all my team, but also my fellow coordinators from other groups for the sterling work and the cooperation that we have shared with each other during the last five years. I also extend those thanks to Commissioner Tajani and his team in the time that he has been in the Transport Commissioner’s seat.

 I am disappointed at the Parliament’s position on the revision of Europe-wide rules on animal testing. In the end I decided to abstain on the final report. While I fully support the provisions on developing and pushing forward the use of alternatives to animal testing and the thematic biannual review of the use of primates, both of which I see as crucial in moving our research away from its reliance on animals, particularly primates, overall Parliament’s position has weakened many of the important animal welfare provisions proposed by the Commission. The fear that has prevailed over the Parliament is that the research industry will leave the EU if too many demands are placed on our research establishments. However I believe that there are some demands that are essential if we in Europe are to ensure high levels of animal protection and I fear that today’s result goes against this thinking. Two crucial issues for me were to move Europe away from the use of wild-caught monkeys for breeding purposes and the absolute need for authorisation of all experiments involving animals, thereby cementing our commitment to the replacement and reduction of animals in experiments. Sadly the European Parliament missed the opportunity to take a strong line on animal protection today.

 I congratulate the rapporteur and the European Commission for their courage in trying to prioritise rail freight throughout the EU. Personally I would have liked a more radical proposal, one that would have put in place a strategy that included priority pathways on certain routes and a recognition from the rest of the railway industry that rail freight is important, needs developing and must be supported. Two areas are stifling rail freight in Europe. Firstly, the real lack of interoperability, particularly in signalling; and secondly, the Railway industry itself – in particular, passenger operators and infrastructure providers who collude with each other to ensure that rail freight is placed at the bottom of the pile when it comes to pathing and timetabling. At least this report is a start in ending that comfortable marriage of convenience that exists and giving rail freight operators at least a chance in developing their business. If we allow the status quo to remain, there will be no rail freight left in twenty years’ time. We must act now to make rail freight viable, attractive and competitive, or we will never be able to get freight off the road.

 I will be supporting this report because we have accepted Amendments 48 and 49 and rejected Amendment 93 in regard to recreational fishing. To include recreational fishing in a Member State fishing quota is for me unacceptable. If we are seriously saying that recreational fishing is destroying our fish stocks, then in my mind they are missing a fundamental issue as far as dwindling fish stocks are concerned. That issue is overfishing by industrial fishing concerns in their factory fishing vessels. They are the ones who we require to be compliant with the CFP and not recreational fishermen pursuing their hobby.

 Mr President, first of all I would like to thank both rapporteurs for their work on this difficult dossier. It is clear that this package, and in particular the issue of lifting cabotage restrictions, has divided opinion along national lines, but I think what we have before us now is an agreement that we can support. I had serious concerns about full cabotage delivered in one move without any levelling-up of social costs, or indeed running costs, for individual hauliers. Such a move, I believe, would have had a detrimental effect on the road haulage business, not only in my own country but in other Member States as well. Therefore the compromise introducing temporary cabotage is not only sensible, it is a solution that will be workable, allowing three domestic journeys after one international one. Temporary cabotage also allows us to end the environmental nonsense of HGVs travelling hundreds of kilometres empty, without distorting domestic markets. Finally, I am also happy to support the new enforcement measures that have been introduced via the Ţicău report. This has to go hand in hand with further market opening, and will allow Member States to practise tough and efficient enforcement measures.

 Mr President, I would like to thank both rapporteurs for their work in this important area and also the Commissioner for his support. Passenger rights have always been a priority of the Socialist Group, and this proposal completes the set, following on from passenger rights in aviation and rail transport. It is vital that we all remember that the users of transport are the most important stakeholders – a fact often forgotten by some transport companies. Now, for the first time, we will have a set of basic rights for bus, coach and ferry users that will ensure proper liability for cancellation and delays, lost or damaged luggage, as well as death in the event of accidents. Perhaps more importantly, we will have a series of fundamental rights for people with reduced mobility and special needs that will put an end to the victimisation endured by these people at the hands of transport companies over many years. No longer will transport operators be able to exclude people with reduced mobility from their vehicles; no longer will people with reduced mobility have fewer rights than able-bodied people; no longer should people with reduced mobility be excluded from the public transport network. Who has delivered this? Not a national or regional parliament, but the European Parliament. It is the European Parliament that has put transport users at the top of our transport priorities. This is the European Parliament putting people first, and that is something that, as Socialists, we can strongly support.

 I support this report and would use this opportunity to reinforce the view that there has to be an integrated approach to cohesion policy. This integration, however, should be an instrument for delivering benefits not a measure that could be restrictive, and this element needs to be carefully monitored. Urban cohesion is essential in delivering sustainable economic and social progress. In that regard I would highlight the role of transport and the provision of modern transport infrastructure as essential in delivering cohesion policy in the urban areas.

– Madam President, my contribution today will be one that highlights the need for investment: investment in jobs; investment in our environment; and investment in all our economies. In that regard, investment in our transport infrastructure and, in particular, in our railway infrastructure, is crucial, not only in providing us with a world-class rail network but also in protecting and creating jobs and social cohesion. Let us prioritise the electrification of our rail network, giving us both transport and environmental gains. Let us invest in our TENS transport network. Let us have a recovery plan with substance and with action, and not just words. Doing nothing and letting the markets decide has failed. The time for concerted European action is now based on putting people first and vested interests last. We on this side of the House are not prepared to play Pontius Pilate, washing our hands of the problem. We want to act and we want to act decisively.

 and other shipping disasters. This package is a testament to the work of Parliament, the Commission and also, if belatedly, the Council. For me, the significance of this package will be felt for many years to come. It is a testament also to the work of all our rapporteurs and MEPs who, over the years, have pushed for such legislation. This package is a victory for this Parliament, for Members from all the political groups, particularly on the Committee on Transport, although I hope Members would allow me to make special mention at this time of Mrs Miguélez Ramos and the late Mr Willi Piecyk.

– Mr President, I will speak on the El Khadraoui report. I would like to thank the rapporteur and his staff for all their hard work and for finding a compromise when, at times, it looked impossible. There are a number of points that need to be made in this debate. Firstly, this is the start of a process, not the end, and contained within the compromise is the right of Member States to introduce congestion charging or not. I also want to remind honourable Members, particularly from the PPE-DE Group, that this Chamber has consistently demanded from the Commission a proposal and strategy to internalise external costs in all modes of transport – but in particular road transport – and this has indeed been highlighted as our roads become more congested and global warming more severe. There is also a need to see a more balanced road sector that is not only economically sustainable, but also environmentally sustainable, and one that recognises that it has to pay a fair price for the costs it creates – be these environmental or infrastructure costs. We cannot have a ‘do-nothing’ attitude, although I note that this phrase has become synonymous with the Conservatives over recent months. I know the formulation of this report has been difficult – some Members believe it goes too far, whilst others not far enough. However, as a first stage, I think that this compromise deserves support. I look forward in the future to other externalities being included and would stress my group’s support that all revenue from Eurovignettes should be earmarked for use in the transport sector so that transparency and public opinion can be brought closer together. This report is a serious attempt to deliver what Parliament has called for over many years. It will be an important tool in combating congestion, in improving the environment and in facilitating modal shift, which is why it deserves our full support. And Commissioner, I would not worry too much about disagreeing with Georg Jarzembowski – we in the Socialist Group have been doing that successfully for years.

 EPLP MEPs believe that this resolution contains a number of points of merit. We have consistently supported the drafting of this resolution and approved the joint resolution as tabled on behalf of four European Parliamentary groups. However, we cannot support this Resolution if it includes unproven accusations which have not yet been judged by the relevant authorities. Unfortunately, as amended, this resolution is no longer based on proven facts and the EPLP regretfully has no option but to abstain.

− Members of this House will be well aware of my views in the past with regard not only to Kosovo, but to the whole Balkan region. In my opinion, the issue of Kosovo can only be resolved through a consensual approach involving not only Serbia primarily, but also neighbouring countries. There is a lot in this report that I can ally myself with, but the insistence that every EU Member State should recognise an independent Kosovo is not an area that I can support. Independence for Kosovo is something that can only be achieved by consensus and agreement with Serbia. Failure to recognise this is merely, in my view, harbouring problems for the future and raising an anti-Serbian attitude in this Parliament. Therefore, the passing of Amendment 3 renders this resolution partisan and seriously undermines the rest of the text. This means that sadly, I cannot support it.

− The situation in the Gaza Strip is deplorable. Hundreds of innocent civilians have been killed and thousands presently face death on a daily basis. Yes, I accept Israel should be allowed to live in peace. Yes, rocket attacks across the border are unacceptable and should stop. But the response by Israel is totally disproportionate and cannot be supported. The Israelis have failed to respect the international community. They have shelled the UN compound, they have attacked schools and children. This is totally unacceptable and must stop. We must have a cease-fire immediately. I will vote in favour of this resolution because the European Parliament needs to have its voice heard so that innocent Palestinians trapped in Gaza will not be forgotten. Israel: you have the right to live in peace. You do not have the right to practise wanton destruction and to be the delivery body of death and destruction on innocent civilians. Your actions mean that you have become the aggressor, not the victim.

 I have decided to vote against this report for two reasons. Firstly, we need to give our farmers the tools they need to do their job and this proposal will limit their ability greatly, especially for those farmers who work in damper and wetter climates and need to use pesticides to protect crops and their livelihood. I am not aware of any farmer who wants to use pesticides, but they are an essential part of ensuring food for our population at an affordable price. Secondly, no impact assessment has been done on this legislation which I find outrageous due to the serious implications it could have on the agriculture sector.

− Firstly, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for her hard work on this dossier and, secondly, I would like to congratulate Parliament as a whole for reinforcing this strong position to send to Council in the light of the difficulties this proposal faces there. Cross-border enforcement is a necessity across the EU if we are serious about reducing road traffic accidents and deaths. It is a nonsense that a citizen driving outside of his/her own Member State can flout traffic laws on speeding, drink-driving, failure to wear a seatbelt or failure to stop at a red light without receiving the appropriate punishment. I believe this is an important step to better cooperation between enforcement agencies which, hopefully, will lead to a fully harmonised road safety enforcement across the EU.

 Madam President, I would first of all like to add my thanks to our rapporteur for all his hard work on this delicate subject. However, despite his great efforts, I am afraid that I and my national delegation cannot support this report. I believe that the CAP is in need of radical reform. It needs to move away from the old direct subsidy route to a system that is market orientated and that values rural sustainability and the environment, and recognises efficient farming instead of propping up inefficient farming. Whilst this report in itself is not a major reform document, it does set the tone for future reforms beyond 2013. That is why I am disappointed in the outcome of the vote in the Agriculture Committee, which yet again – it appears to me – has resulted in that committee turning its back on a fundamental reform of this discredited system. In particular, I highlight compulsory modulation. I cannot support a position that will see less money going to rural development and furthermore removes the need for Member States to cofinance new modulation money. I also cannot support the Committee view that we should also step back from full decoupling, but I reserve my biggest fear for the Commission. Your position, Commissioner, on compulsory modulation is right. Your position on decoupling is right. For once, we have a Commission that seriously wants to reform the CAP, but faces a Parliament that always fails to deliver on this issue and believes that the challenges we face could be solved by sticking to the old discredited system. Hang tough, Commissioner, you are right and, sadly, I suspect this Chamber will be wrong.

 I fully support the Commission’s proposals on distributing free fruit and vegetables in schools, as part of the strategy on tackling obesity among children. Not only do I fully support the use of EU money to tackle a priority public health concern faced by all Member States, but I also support the strong social element attached to the proposals, in that they will allow Member States to support children from more deprived backgrounds who tend to eat less fruit and vegetables and who tend to be more at risk from obesity. Furthermore, this is the first time that CAP money will be used to tackle a public health concern, a sign of a change in thinking on the aims of the CAP. I am happy that Parliament has sent a strong message to the Commission and to the Council, in supporting an increased budget enabling more children to benefit from the scheme. However, I do not agree with Parliament’s position stipulating that fruit and vegetables should only come from the Community. We should not lose sight of the fact that this scheme is about promoting a wide variety of fruit and vegetables to school children and tackling obesity. (Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 163(1)).

I shall be voting for this resolution and I congratulate my colleagues on the Transport Committee for taking this initiative at this time. Sea Piracy is a criminal act that not only threatens seafarers’ lives but also disrupts legitimate trade and even humanitarian aid. Modern day pirates have no romance; they are not Johnny Depp type characters swinging through the rigging. They are desperate, dangerous criminals who need to be brought to book. Piracy is a problem all over the world and especially off the coast of Somalia, where it has risen to epidemic proportions. Now it is time for concerted international action to bring this type of activity to a standstill. This resolution is timely, and I hope it will help our governments to work together as a part of that international effort.

 I thank our rapporteur, Jan Andersson, for his report on this very important subject. Recent cases before the ECJ, and indeed that Court’s judgments, mean that workers’ rights and workers’ solidarity through collective agreements are being threatened by companies whose only priority is profit, and if that means undermining workers’ rights, then so be it: they are prepared to do just that. The European social model that we are rightly proud of is under attack and seriously under threat from profiteers. The threat of imported cheap labour is a reality, brought in through the back door by unscrupulous employers under the guise of free movement. The free movement principle was never intended to be a tool for cheap labour or as a principle by which workers’ social conditions can be diluted. What Jacques Delors would have made of this would be of great interest. The Viking and Laval judgments are an attack on trade unions and workers’ rights. That is why Mr Andersson’s report is badly needed and why I will support it. It restores the balance so clearly abandoned by the ECJ in its recent judgments.

 – Madam President, I welcome the report of my colleague, Ulrich Stockmann, and I thank him for his hard work on this difficult dossier. All through the process of this report, the concern of my group has been to ensure that the system of airport charges throughout the EU is both fair and transparent, and that a detailed appeals procedure was in place in case of dispute. Often people think of aviation as a single industry but, when one examines issues like airport charging, it soon becomes apparent that the airport and airline sectors have different views and aspirations. The report before us offers a balanced solution, favouring neither the airlines nor the airports. Whilst, personally, I would have preferred the scope to be based on a percentage of national passengers rather than an arbitrary figure, the rapporteur in his report has ensured that the figure is at a reasonable level of five million passengers – not the Commission’s ridiculously low figure of one million – and the major airport of a Member State has to be included. A key element in the whole of our discussions has been whether certain airports enjoy a dominant trade position. My group believes that, where this is the case, airport charges need to be regulated. However, many airports are in a competitive situation and airlines are free to choose where they fly into. In my region, Manchester Airport has 22 million passengers a year but faces competition from eight airports all within a 150-km radius. Clearly, in these circumstances, the market itself is a good regulator. I therefore welcome that the UK will be allowed to maintain its present system of monitoring airport charges, because it has in place a regulatory framework that encourages competition and regulates charges through its own supervisory body only at those airports that have a dominant position. It may be that other countries could follow this regulatory framework as a way of delivering a fair and transparent airport charges system. I hope now that we can agree this directive at its second-reading stage. This should help us deliver a directive that will put an end to secret meetings setting charges for airports in a monopolistic or dominant trading position. I seriously hope that airlines also recognise that we will now have a transparent system with a detailed appeals procedure, with full consultation, to end the constant complaining about airport charges and work with the airports to deliver a cost-effective, value-for-money service for users and passengers alike.

I am in support of this report from the Parliament looking at Ship Inspections and Survey Organisations and I am in favour of the other Parliament reports which, along with this one, make up the Maritime Package. The issue of the two ‘missing’ dossiers, on Civil Liability and Flag States, needs to be resolved by the Council one way or another, so it is important that Parliament keeps the pressure on by including them collectively in the Sterckx report on Vessel Traffic Monitoring, the Vlasto report on Port State Control and this report. Much work has been done, and I feel that agreement on the five dossiers we have voted on today could be easily reached, However without Civil Liability and without Flag States we will not be able to move any further forward. The Council must find a solution to their internal stalemate or else we will not be able to deliver a safer Maritime sector to the citizens of the EU.

I support this report looking at promoting sustainable development in mountainous regions. The move to a more market-orientated CAP means that mountainous regions, where agricultural production is less competitive, are not only facing new challenges but also, I believe, new opportunities. Mountainous regions may not be able to adapt as easily to competitive conditions and may entail extra costs so that they cannot produce very competitive products at low prices, but the focus needs to be on exploiting the resources available, including the beauty of the natural landscape to attract tourists, and exploiting the potential competitive advantage of these regions, including the array of regional and traditional products, the wealth of traditional knowledge and manufacturing procedures, which give their products competitive edge. I differ from some of my colleagues here in the European Parliament in that I do not believe the solution to the challenges facing mountainous regions is to throw more CAP money at these regions. Where there are clear public benefits to supporting farming in mountainous regions, such as environmental benefits, I believe that public funding under the rural development pillar would be more appropriate. Exploiting the potential of mountainous areas is key to their sustainable development, not simply throwing more public money at them.

 Mr President, I am happy to speak in favour of the ALDE Group motion to refer this back to committee. In my long years in this Parliament I cannot recall, within the transport area, a report that has caused so much confusion and uncertainty as this one. We are making law here, and with that comes a responsibility to act with full knowledge and understanding of the text that honourable Members will be asked to vote on. Yet many Members are unsure. Many Members are struggling to comprehend and understand this complex piece of legislation, made even more complex by the intervention of the Council. There is great uncertainty, great unease across a wide spectrum of this Chamber, which is why I believe we need to reassess, re-evaluate and examine more carefully the implications of these proposals back in the Committee on Transport. It is about getting it right, not about doing it quickly. By doing this, we will not be creating problems; we will be acting responsibly as legislators, defending Parliament’s right to work at its pace, not at a pace dictated to it by industry lobbyists and the Council of Ministers.
 Brian Simpson  (PSE

 Mr President, in thanking the rapporteur for his report, I recognise his efforts to try and get a first-reading agreement on this important dossier. A first-reading deal would indeed have been possible if the Council had accepted the Committee on Transport’s position. The rapporteur is right. We did discuss it in great detail in the Committee on Transport, and we came to a view in the Committee on Transport. But what happened subsequently is that that Committee on Transport view has been altered. Alas, the Council’s intervention and the subsequent Council amendments not only served to muddy the waters, but caused serious concern for consumer organisations, travel agents and passenger associations. Subsequently, what is now proposed by the rapporteur via the Council has serious implications, not only legislatively, but internationally also. Never in the field of EU legislation have two amendments caused so much mayhem and confusion to the detriment of the Committee on Transport’s democratic position. Some people do not have a problem with that, but the reality is that the Council’s intervention has caused great uncertainty, both morally and legally. There is a suspicion that the Council is creating loopholes to protect certain major air carriers, particularly as it applies to parent carriers. Also, the undue haste to get an agreement could lead to bad legislation. Therefore, I support the call for this report to be taken back to committee so that we can address all the concerns raised, get this legislation right, not for our major air carriers, but for our consumers, whose representations tell us they dislike the Council’s additions.

I believe it is absolutely essential for stability and security in Europe that we do all we can to help both Serbia and Montenegro recover from the economic and social upheaval that took place with the break-up of Yugoslavia and the subsequent disastrous wars. I would hope that, in particular, infrastructure and transportation would feature prominently. If we are to be realistic in our aspirations for both countries, then this agreement is essential and should be strongly supported.

I will be voting in favour of this report, not because I enjoy WTO disputes or have a paranoia about the United States, but because I am fed up with the protectionist actions of the United States over many years, particularly in the area of civil aviation. The Americans have perfected the art of whinging and complaining about other countries and their lack of free trade, when they themselves have adopted measures which allow bankrupt airlines to carry on trading, and have allegedly sifted millions of dollars of aid into Boeing. The International Trade Committee is right to support the EU in its case against the United States at the WTO. What we all should be aiming for here is fair and open competition between aircraft manufacturers with a freedom of choice for airlines to choose the best aircraft to suit their needs at the best price. The official motto of the USA is ‘In God we Trust.’ Perhaps that should change to ‘Don’t do as I do. Do as I say.’

 I will be supporting the Liese report today because the report is balanced and practical, if somewhat complicated. Civil aviation has to recognise that it needs to be involved in an emission trading scheme, and environmentalists need to recognise that people want to fly and the aviation industry contributes greatly to the economic well-being of many of our regions as well as national economies. I still believe that this agreement has problems. I still believe the provision of the 100% auction by 2020 could cause serious problems for small and regional airlines. However, what we have here is a compromise solution. I still believe this regulation will face challenges, legal and otherwise by countries outside the EU, particularly the USA and Russia, making a worldwide agreement difficult to achieve. But this is a start and for that we must congratulate the Commission for its courage and foresight. The aviation industry is struggling at the moment mainly due to high fuel prices, which is why a compromise on ETS was essential. I know the airlines are unhappy; I know the environmentalists are unhappy. Maybe then our rapporteurs got it about right!

 Madam President, on behalf of the Socialist Group I would like to thank Mr Costa for both his reports, although this evening I will speak only on the one dealing with railway safety. Safety must always be our top priority, and those who are given the responsibility of running our railway infrastructure and its rolling stock must be properly trained and their qualifications recognised if we are to improve both the efficiency and safety of our railways. It is right that safety certification of freight wagons should enter a new phase with the introduction of a new system in 2010. It is also right that passenger vehicles should be covered, and, whilst that must be done in 10 years, those who oppose this must surely recognise the need for such a system I also support the rapporteur in his assertion that none of this should hold back railway expansion. The whole industry in Europe, particularly in the area of rail freight, is haunted by the lack of vision that sometimes emanates from our infrastructure providers who latch on to any excuse to do nothing. We must expand our railways, both in infrastructure and rolling-stock terms, so that we can deliver an efficient, effective and sustainable railway network devoid of obstacles. Finally, I must thank our rapporteur and all the Members for their support of my amendments exempting heritage and tourist railways from this directive. Had they been forced to comply, the cost burden would have been crippling, putting at risk the preservation of that rich industrial heritage that these railways undoubtedly provide. We in Europe lead the way in railway heritage and preservation, a fact often overlooked by the Commission – but, frankly, never overlooked by this Parliament.

 Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Degutis for his excellent report and the work he has done over recent weeks. Apart from flight delays, the most complaints that I receive against airlines concern the way that they lure people with what appear to be low fares and conveniently tell them the true cost only at the very end of the process. Low-fare airlines have perfected this art over recent years. Now, not only will the customers see the true price, but also the security taxes levied by national governments will have to be highlighted separately. This transparency has to be a good thing, and I hope it will end what has been over recent years an exercise in deceit by some airlines which try to con the travelling public into believing they are buying a very cheap ticket when the opposite is true. I must also make mention of the report’s tightening of the ‘wet lease’ rules for aircraft outside the EU and its commitment to ensuring that social dumping is not acceptable when airlines lease in aircraft – again, something that has happened in the past. There are concerns that the number of ‘wet leased’ aircraft from outside the EU is at an unacceptable level, compromising not only our social laws but also our safety laws and undermining our own EU civil aviation industry, and our rapporteur has addressed this. This is an excellent report for consumers, airline staff and European aviation. It is so good, in fact, that I am pretty sure airlines will already have started to look for any loopholes – again, another thing that has happened in the past and, again, another art that our airlines have perfected.

 My colleague, Zita Gurmai, has produced an excellent report and needs to be congratulated on her detailed work and the commitment she has shown. The first intelligent car report is a flagship project within the Commission’s strategic policy framework for information society and the media, and our rapporteur is right to recognise that intelligent vehicle systems could reduce the annual death toll, currently around 42 000, on the roads of the EU. She is also right to point out that, at present, many people cannot afford the new systems, so the need to bring down costs has to be a priority. Electronic stability control technology, the use of portable or nomadic devices and work towards providing cleaner vehicles are all topics covered by the rapporteur. This is an excellent report, and it has my full support.

 I welcome this report because it strengthens existing legislation and yet again attempts to improve road safety, especially in the area of cyclists’ and pedestrians’ safety. Each year 8 000 people – pedestrians and cyclists – are killed and 300 000 injured on the roads of the EU. A great number of these casualties can be avoided either by better driver training or by improved motor vehicle design. The introduction of brake assistance systems, the introduction of higher performance tests and a quicker implementation period should all help to reduce the carnage that happens every year on our roads. I am particularly happy to see that those killers we know as bull bars will now have to pass the same performance tests on the vehicles on which they are intended to be installed, although for me the campaign to ban bull bars outright still goes on. I congratulate the rapporter on his report and I look forward to a speedy conclusion with the Council on this issue.

 I will vote in favour of this report but I must highlight that Amendment 35 is unacceptable to me and I and the British Labour delegation will vote against this particular amendment. Sustainable rural development is the key to maintaining our countryside and the traditional way of life enjoyed by our rural communities. Indeed, on the issue of modulation, Members may recall that it was only British Labour MEPs who supported concerted efforts to change our priorities away from direct payments and into sustainable rural development. Farmers have a key role to play in delivering rural sustainability and development, but they are not the only people involved in that delivery, which is why I cannot support Amendment 35. This Parliament has developed a habit of constantly demanding direct payments to farmers and no doubt it will do the same when we discuss the CAP Health Check in the near future. I think those of us who believe that things need to change in this regard, away from a system that rewards inefficiency at the expense of efficient agriculture, are those who truly believe in sustainable rural development.

 You will be aware that over many years this Parliament has been very vocal in its efforts to highlight the dangers to health of smoking tobacco. Yet through all that time the European Union has given millions of euros in support to farmers for growing that very same product. It really is hypocritical in the extreme to carry on such a policy. The report from the Committee on Agriculture tries to reopen the debate on extending tobacco subsidies until 2012. Yet the Commission proposal, that the report was allegedly drawn up in response to, is about extending the financing of the Community Tobacco Fund, which as we know is used to warn of the dangers of smoking tobacco. What was attempted here by the Agriculture Committee was a sleight of hand that would have done any top-class magician proud, but thankfully this has been spotted and hopefully exposed for what it really is; namely an attempt to extend subsidies to tobacco farmers. This has to be resisted by this Parliament on moral, economic and health grounds. The Commission's position is clear. There is no justification for tobacco subsidies linked to production. It is now high time Parliament adopted the same line by rejecting the Agriculture Committee stance on this issue. That is why I shall vote against.

 Sport is an important part of everyday life. Most EU citizens either participate or spectate at a number of sporting events and it is often seen as more important than life itself at times. Sport should not be above the law, but we as legislators should also recognise the unique position sport has within the European Union and the role played by various governing bodies. We should also recognise that whilst Association Football is the dominant game, it is not the only game being played, and we must recognise that other sports and pastimes as diverse as rugby league and hurling or crown green bowling and pigeon racing have an important part to play. It is not the role of the EU to govern these sports nor indeed act as some kind of sports police. That role should remain with the appropriate governing body. However, the EU can be complementary in nature and help in developing all kinds of sport by speaking out against sporting discrimination which still happens when one sport feels threatened by another. I cite the Greek Rugby Union as a classic example. I will be supporting the Mavrommatis report, perhaps not as enthusiastically as I support Wigan Warriors rugby league team or St Mirren and Blackburn Rovers, but then again this is only politics when all is said and done.

 Although I will vote in favour of this joint motion for a resolution, I have to say it is a typical European Parliament resolution brought about not for a concern for the environment or maritime safety but because Conservative Spanish politicians are still desperately trying to reclaim Gibraltar and embarrass their own government. It is a text that tries to be all things to all people and rambles on at length about trivia, but only gives a small amount of wording to the important issue of maritime safety. In English it appears badly written and paragraph 12 makes no sense and is a practical impossibility, which is why this paragraph cannot be taken seriously even if you understand it. What is important is that the oil has been removed from the ship, that EMSA and the Gibraltar and Spanish authorities acted swiftly and correctly when the disaster struck and that we need to ensure that the whole issue of maritime safety is addressed. All of this could have been stated on two pages far more effectively than the four pages of rambling text we are now faced with.

 I welcome this opportunity that is given to us by the EU-Latin America Summit to have a discussion on the situation in Latin America and, indeed, the relationship that the EU has with this part of the world. I will be supporting the joint motion for a resolution, but would stress that we need to ensure that a political solution is found to the problems in and around Colombia, in line with the position of the United Nations. We know that difficulties exist for countries of that region, and we in the European Union must be active in helping them to overcome their problems, in particular in regard to drugs and crime, and in cementing democratic principles in their governments and institutions.

 I voted against the motion for a resolution on this report, because I believe it is the height of hypocrisy for Members to vote to ban family members from legitimate employment on the one hand, and then refuse to open up details of the taxpayer-funded private pension scheme which they themselves benefit from on the other. This includes, of course, the issue of whether Members repay their own contributions that are taken out of the general expenditure allowance paid to Members, as allegedly we believe many do not. At best this is not transparent, at worst it is blatant hypocrisy.

 I will be voting in favour of this report and I think it is important that we take the opportunity to look in more detail at the use of coal as part of our energy needs. For too long coal has been seen as a dirty fuel and scant regard has been given to the possibility of cleaning up coal by use of new technologies. My own region of the North-West of England still sits on huge reserves of quality coal that is deemed too expensive to extract, and whilst it is true that coal in its purest form is not an environmentally-friendly fuel, new, clean coal technology now exists that would enable coal to play a key role in our energy supply whilst not destroying the environment in the process. We need to use our coal reserves better. We need to find more research money to make coal more environmentally friendly and more economically competitive. We need to do more to revive our coal-mining communities. I believe clean coal does have a future and I thank the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for its report which at least starts this discussion going.

 On behalf of the British Labour Members I wish to explain the reasons why we voted as we did on this report. We strongly support the 2% increase in milk quotas for the year 2008/2009 proposed by the Commission, allowing European farmers to respond to increased market demands. We have farmers in the EU more than capable of responding to the increased global demands for milk and it would be unacceptable to deny them the opportunity to take advantage of the favourable market situation. We are, however, unhappy that Parliament supports a voluntary, as opposed to compulsory, 2% increase in milk quotas. For me, the 2% increase is also a step in giving milk producers the option to produce more and thereby helping the transition to greater market orientation. This is in line with the soft landing ahead of the milk quota system in 2015, as envisaged in the CAP Health Check. While I understand that many countries do not fulfil their current quota allocations, including the UK, I strongly believe, that in line with the abolition of milk quotas in 2015, we need to get farmers used to the idea of having the option to produce more.

 On behalf of the British Labour members I wish to explain the reasons why we voted as we did on this important report. First and foremost we believe a thorough overhaul of the CAP is needed so that we can move away from direct payments to farmers towards a system that encourages rural sustainability. In this regard we would like to have seen full decoupling of direct payments but appreciate that many Member States have a difficulty with this. A key point for me is that reform of the CAP should not be seen as an issue of big farms versus little farms. It should be an issue of efficient versus inefficient. Therefore I and the British Labour delegation will be voting in favour of amendments in favour of increased funding for rural development, opening up trade with developing countries, and against amendments that seek to employ protectionist measures for EU farmers. We would like to see the Commission proposing the scrapping of degressive capping and addressing the issue of direct payments in a more radical way. We will not vote against the report but abstain in the hope that when the legislative proposals come forward Parliament will recognise the need for radical reform.

 I will be voting in favour of the compromise agreement reached in conciliation despite having reservations, not only about the financing of this legislation, but also at the attitude of the Council of Ministers during this whole procedure. Firstly, the point has to be made that governments believe that they can introduce enhanced security measures in civil aviation and expect the industry and subsequently the passengers to pay for it. My view, and indeed it was the view of Parliament, is that if Member States insist on enhanced security measures, they should at least contribute towards the costs. Secondly, my understanding of conciliation is where two parties compromise their views in order to reach an agreement. On this dossier the Council not only failed to even consider compromise or indeed conciliation, but arrogantly set about accusing Parliament of putting passenger security at risk. This is frankly unacceptable and leaves a bitter legacy for us all to remember for future conciliations. In the end I feel I am being blackmailed by the Council in voting for this agreement so we can at least have enhanced security measures in place to protect the public. But my vote comes reluctantly and with anger.

This is a very historic moment, the moment when the European Union attempts to drag itself into the 21st century. Many on the far right of this Parliament fear an effective European Union because it will diminish their ability to stoke up fear at a national level. Hence their almost hysterical demands on the one hand and total unacceptable behaviour on the other. I congratulate our twin rapporteurs on their work. We must all remember that what we have here is a reform treaty and an amending treaty that will ensure that an EU of 27 can work effectively and, more importantly, work closely with the citizens of the European Union. I will support this report in the hope that this will send a message not only to our citizens but to our member state Governments that this Parliament is serious in its desire to see a more accountable and more effective European Union.

 As an avid viewer of that great TV series ‘Deadliest Catch’ I am now a great admirer of fishermen and the work they do. I will be voting in favour of this report because we seriously have to address the waste that goes on, with perfectly good fish being thrown back into the sea because of the workings of the complicated quota system. Whilst I do not believe that market intervention is the answer here or that quotas should be abandoned, we do need to address seriously this situation. Our fish stocks are still low. Demand for fish is still growing and therein lies our dilemma. We must preserve our stocks and one way to do this is to eradicate or at least minimise the waste of unwanted by-catches and discards.

 Madam President, on behalf of the PSE Group I would like to thank Markus Ferber for his report and his hard work over many years. The PSE Group accepts that a great deal of Parliament’s first-reading position has been accepted by the Council, and this will guarantee the universal service; it will guarantee the financing of that service; it will also recognise that social protection must be in place, and it delays the implementation by two years to the end of 2010 for all the old Member States and 2012 for the new ones. In my view this is a good deal. There are those who still fight the anti-liberalisation battle. But that battle was lost over 15 years ago when Parliament accepted – against my advice at the time – to liberalise the postal services sector. Some of us in this Parliament have delayed the full implementation for those long 15 years, but there comes a time, eventually, when we have to face up to reality. Although, personally, I would like to see a second reading with no amendments, my group believe it is right to clarify the financing of the universal service and to protect those services presently provided for the visually impaired and the blind. So we will be supporting amendments 1, 2, 6, 18 and 19. We must ensure that postal services are able to compete, not necessarily against each other, but against other technologies. But we need the playing field to be level, and I hope, with the reservations I have outlined, that we can conclude our work on this dossier based on our first-reading position and get back to the most important issue of providing a reliable, regular and affordable postal service to our citizens, and to recognising the important work done by all those postmen and women throughout the European Union. Finally, when Markus Ferber and I started work on this dossier, neither of us had any grey hairs. Now look at the both of us!

 I will be voting in favour of the Chatzimarkakis report, even though I believe that the car industry has to do more to reduce emissions from the vehicles it produces. It is very easy on the one hand to pick out the motor car as the chief sinner in all things environmental, and certainly the motor car that we have at the moment leaves a lot to be desired in this area. But we must work with industry and educate them on the need to produce more environmentally-friendly cars. The motor industry is a big employer of people and contributes considerably to local, regional and national economies. It therefore cannot be treated in a cavalier way, as some Members of this House believe. One area that concerns me is in this report is the clear view that fiscal measures, and fiscal harmonisation, should be used as a way of promoting the Car 21 concept. For me, this is a move too far, and the one area I cannot support. However, I welcome this report and support it because overall it adopts a balanced and practical approach.

 Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Stockmann for his report and, on behalf of the PSE Group, I would inform the Chamber that we will be supporting the line adopted by the Committee on Transport and Tourism. Our rapporteur has done a fine job in producing a more realistic and balanced position, but I still find it difficult to understand why this proposal was put forward by the Commission in this format and at this time. Speaking now in a personal capacity: for many years within the civil aviation industry and with the Commission we have been fed a diet of deregulation and yet, in regard to airport charges, we are now being told regulation is the answer. I have to say that the irony of this is not lost on me. However, we are where we are. I fully support the need for transparency in airport charges, with full consultation with the stakeholders. I fully support the need to ensure that airports in a dominant position do not abuse that situation and I fully support an open and transparent appeals procedure, provided that the rules of engagement and the remit of the arbitrator are clearly defined. However, I very much doubt whether the proposition to regulate scores of airports throughout the EU is going to produce the utopia in airport charges that the airlines and the Commission want. Surely, if it is legislation to eliminate monopolistic practices that we seek, the regulation should be based on a market test relating to each individual airport, not an arbitrary figure plucked out of thin air for no apparent reason. I believe that, if you have to use a figure, you should use one that reflects the economic dominance of an airport, namely a percentage of national traffic, and address it to those airports that are dominant, not those which are not. I am not against regulating airports that are in a dominant market position, but I think regulating the majority of airports to catch the big boys, based on an arbitrary passenger figure in a one-cap-fits-all regulation, is a flawed process.

 I shall be voting for this report and I must congratulate the rapporteur on what is a technical issue of great importance. I would however like to make a few points. Regarding cabin crew licensing, clearly this issue causes some concern in certain Member States and has resulted in a determined lobbying effort by the cabin crew trade unions. I believe the rapporteur has found a compromise that allays fears held by some Member States, yet recognises the importance of the role cabin crew play. Some airlines frankly abuse cabin crew by not only treating them as mere ‘waiters in the sky’ but by employing them on contracts that pay minimum rates, for maximum hours, after paying for their own training. Secondly it is important to recognise that EU-OPS, as approved by this Parliament, now come under EASA competence. But I would take the opportunity to remind the Commission and EASA that flight and duty times as contained in Subpart Q of the EU-OPS Regulation cannot be changed until a study into fatigue has been commissioned and the wider industry consulted. Finally I hope now that other aspects of aviation safety and security can be introduced EU wide, including cockpit door and baggage hold surveillance.

 I voted for this report but there are still many areas of concern that Parliament has chosen not to address, notably to make the sector more competitive against third country imports, and to improve the quality of wine produced at EU level. Sadly national and regional priorities have got in the way of a lasting reform programme. In Europe we must protect our quality wine, and we must also address the issue of producing quality wines at an affordable price. There is no doubt the Commission’s proposals have been watered down. Thankfully, however, my amendment to lift the de minimis criteria, and those amendments to allow chaptalisation have been accepted by Parliament. These amendments are crucial for northern countries and my own wine producers in the United Kingdom. The European wine industry still faces many threats, and in the EU we are seeing our own market share disappearing to New World countries. But why? It is because they can produce excellent-quality wine at an affordable price and with a marketing strategy that is based on what the consumer wants in the 21st century; not what the Romans planted in the third. We need quality, not quantity, and we need to produce wine that offers value for money.

 Briefly I want to raise through my support of this report the problems still being experienced by EU airlines in regard to rights to fly over Russia. These rights are not only restricted by the Russian authorities but they are also expensive, issued in a discriminatory way, and in a manner that clearly disadvantages EU carriers, particularly those flying a number of routes to the Far East. This problem has been known about for some considerable time but the unwillingness of the Russian authorities to renegotiate with the EU on this issue has been both expensive and unhelpful. We now need the Commission and the Russian authorities to reinvigorate their efforts to find a solution to this very serious problem.

 I will be voting in favour of this report because at last it allows Member States, and in particular the United Kingdom, to carry on using imperial measurements. Personally I prefer the metric system, but there are some areas where the very nature of the work being undertaken necessitates using imperial measurements. I do not refer to the selling of vegetables, but to work like the renovation of historic and heritage modes of transport, and in particular heritage railways. I would point out that in the UK not everybody sticks to imperial measurements. The great game of rugby league went metric years ago.

 I voted in favour of this report as it contains many good ideas on how to progress our tourism policy. However, I want to highlight the importance of industrial heritage and how this can help regenerate old industrial areas and still provide us with culture and history. The preservation of our industrial heritage is just as important as the preservation of ancient artefacts or geographical phenomena. I come from the region that gave birth to the Industrial Revolution, a revolution so fundamental to the lives of so many that it deserves recognition as part of our unique European culture. Yet resources given to industrial heritage both at national and European level are small compared to other tourism sectors. For example, the European body for Heritage and Museum Railways ‘FEDECRAIL’ leads the world in the area of railway preservation and yet receives little help from the European Union The European Union should recognise the importance of industrial heritage and prioritise this particular branch of tourism so that young people can understand the significance of our industrial past. Surely the time is now right to recognise the potential for industrial heritage to play a major role in any future European tourism policy.

 I am afraid I will be voting against this report because it is my view that a framework on the protection of soil is not needed. I voted for rejection initially because I believe this issue should be left to Member States under the subsidiarity principle. What we have before us is a piece of legislation that is disproportionate, has little flexibility and merely repeats what is already covered in other directives. It tries to cover desertification on the one hand and cleaning up soil on the other — a wide remit indeed — but ends up being a report that covers neither adequately; but creates problems in how it will be implemented. In my own region where local authorities are trying to recycle soil, this proposal would make that so difficult that the viability of the whole operation is put in question. Sorry to say, I think this is a poor and unnecessary piece of legislation, and I will vote against in the hope that I can save farmers, horticulturalists and local authorities from a bureaucratic nightmare.

 As a former teacher of physical education, I will be supporting the Schmitt report because it addresses not only the need to ensure that physical education is taught in schools but that Member States must also ensure adequate training for physical education teachers. All too often, particularly at primary school level, the PE lesson is conducted by a non-PE specialist normally in a hall that doubles up as a dining room or a theatre, particularly at Christmas time. If we are to be serious about combating child obesity, if we are serious about improving child health and if we are serious about getting children away from video games and into sport, we must provide better facilities for physical education in all schools and ensure that the teachers have the specialist knowledge to teach the subject. For far too long PE has been a minor subject, particularly in primary schools, and lessons are often cancelled at the first whiff of rain. This has led to a generation of children being created that is the most unfit generation ever produced. Health and physical education is as important as maths and sciences, yet you would not know that if you entered many of our schools.

 I have voted in favour of the Liese report, even though I have doubts about its practicality and its implementation. I agree that aviation has to be included in any emissions trading schemes, but a balance has to be found between environmental considerations and those of the aviation industry. In addition, this scheme as proposed is highly contentious outside the European Union with many states threatening court action against the EU, including the USA, India and China because they believe any scheme involving aviation must be agreed internationally before implementation. It is right that aviation should be involved in ETS. It is wrong to single out aviation as a major CO2
 creator without also addressing the maritime industry and the biggest CO2
 creator in transport, road transportation. Some of the suggestions outlined by the Committee on the Environment in its report were frankly extreme. Parliament has taken a more pragmatic and balanced view. But still I see problems ahead for this proposal in the months to come, not least on the international stage and not least that we have exempted private jets.

 I voted for the reports in respect of the 2008 draft budget, but I did so heavy in heart because it would appear that the expensive circus that is our regular visits to Strasbourg looks set to continue. It is particularly poignant that we are voting to carry on meeting in Strasbourg on the same day that Air France has decided to leave some of our number stranded, or certainly inconvenienced, because of industrial action by some of its staff. Martin Luther King once said “I have a dream”. I too have a dream; and that dream is that one day this Parliament has a single seat from which to operate and the Strasbourg circus will come to an end.

 Madam President, first of all I would like to make an apology to you, to the Vice-President of the Commission and to honourable Members, because after I have made my speech I will have to leave the Chamber to do an interview. It is not my habit to do so, and I apologise for not staying for the rest of the debate. I would like to thank my colleague, Mr El Khadraoui, for his report and warn him that he perhaps may beat my record of being the longest-serving rapporteur in parliamentary history if he continues with this particular dossier! Let us be honest. The marriage entered into between the European Union and the US in the form of the initial civil aviation Air Transport Agreement is a marriage of convenience, with the EU being the eager bridegroom and the US the very reluctant bride. Now, when we come to consummate the marriage, we find that the US bride finds that her EU bridegroom is not very fanciable, and, seeing as she has got all the best bits out of him on their wedding day, the US bride now cannot be bothered to consummate the marriage, because Representative Oberstar is standing over the couple, shotgun in hand. Great differences exist between the EU and US on aviation policy, and I for one would not be surprised to hear, in the weeks and months to come, that negotiations on the second stage agreement have broken down because the US would not move on key issues. My fear is that the EU bridegroom is so desperate to consummate this marriage of convenience that we yet again give in to the reluctant bride. What about ETS and security, where the EU and US are worlds apart? What about foreign ownership of US airlines, or fifth freedom reciprocals? What about passenger lists and Chapter 11 protection? These are all issues that divide us, and, whilst I accept that there is a willingness to sit down and negotiate, it is always, it would appear to us, on the terms dictated to us by the Americans. I wish everybody well in their efforts, and the PSE Group will vote in favour. However, I sincerely hope the negotiations are successful, and that a more balanced, reciprocal, fair agreement is forthcoming at the end of the road. But I question whether that will happen, because of US attitudes, and I ask whether the road that we are actually on will lead to this marriage of convenience ending in a Las Vegas-type divorce.

 I wish to stress the importance of the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip. Whilst I accept that the political situation is one that is dictating the plight of the people of Gaza, nevertheless it is the people – men, women and children – who are suffering, and heaven knows what long-term effects this will have. I agree that Israel must feel secure in its own borders, but there are also obligations on Israel to ensure that humanitarian aid and assistance are given to the Gaza Strip. In Gaza there is a responsibility to end attacks on Israel, and we all have a responsibility to support a viable state for Palestinians, so that the Palestinian people can live securely in peace. I support this report because it is absolutely essential at this time that we in the EU make our voice heard on behalf of the people of Gaza. They need help and we should deliver.

 One of the great mysteries to the population of the European Union is how we can devise a system that pays farmers for leaving land idle. Now whilst I understand that some reputable organisations like the RSPB in the UK use this system to fund their excellent work, nevertheless it cannot be right that we leave good land idle and pay farmers for keeping it that way. That is why I support a zero per cent set-aside, but we must also in tandem ensure that our farmers and others are encouraged to keep land in good order and by making the land productive by helping them from other sources. If we are serious about fundamental CAP reform then an end to set-aside payments has to be at the forefront of any reform procedure. That is why I will support the Commission’s proposals.

 I will be voting for the compromise agreed by our rapporteurs with the Council of Ministers because I believe it is a step forward for the railway industry throughout the European Union, and is the best deal available to Parliament at this time. However, the slow pace with which the railway industry works is not only frustrating but also acts as a very effective brake on the kind of radical action that is required to galvanise railways in many of our Member States. A wide gulf exists between the railways of say France and Germany with those of Bulgaria and Romania. This gap needs to be closed if we are to be serious about developing a railway system that is clearly Europe-wide. Finally, whilst I welcome the agreement that all railways should be fully accessible within 15 years, is it not a sad fact and an indictment on our railway industry that many people of reduced mobility do not have access to their railway in the 21st century? The railway industry is caught in a philosophy of ‘can’t do’ rather than one of ‘can do’. I hope this package of measures at least moves us away from negativity and starts a more positive era for our railways. (Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 163)

 I shall be voting in favour of the report that has been prepared by Ms Batzeli, because it is quite obvious that a restructuring of the sugar industry is required. My only concern relates to Amendment 31, which, if passed, would still commit the European Commission to keeping the existing fund open up to 2011, and would be a negative aspect of this restructuring process. This report, whilst not perfect, nevertheless strikes a balance between the needs of the producers and the obvious need to reform this sector. My only concern regards the effect any restructuring could have on sugar cane producers from developing countries. At all costs we must avoid a restructuring that protects beet producers at the expense of cane producers and I would hope that the Commission will ensure that this does not happen, whilst still being fair to our own farmers.

 Renewable energy in Europe is an important issue, which, in my mind, does not get the recognition it fully deserves. In this era of energy crisis, global warming and diminishing stocks of the most traditional fossil fuels, it is right that Parliament should examine a better use of renewable energy. However, I would also like to point out that we still have large reserves of coal throughout the EU and, with the development of clean coal technology, I pose the question whether or not our abandonment of coal, as a source of energy, was premature? I will support this report, but I think we must be realistic in what can be achieved with wind or wave energy, especially when matched up with the ever-increasing energy demands of the EU. I think it is right to ask the Commission to draw up action plans involving renewable energy including wind, wave and solar power generation, as well as developing a strategy for biofuels. Although in regard to this, we must ensure that we do not save the planet, environmentally, only to see its population starve to death, which is why the committee's call for a fair balance between food and energy production is a correct stance to take.

Although I will be supporting the Ayala Sender report because it contains a number of good and constructive suggestions as regards the technical subject of freight logistics, I do have some concerns. One thing that concerns me is that the possibility of introducing 60-tonne mega lorries throughout Europe is a concept that I believe to be misguided and inappropriate when rail freight is at a low ebb, and when national infrastructures cannot sustain 60-tonne lorries it seems crazy to move away from present weight limits. I appreciate that some countries already have 60-tonne lorries, which is why it is right to allow Member States to decide for themselves what their national weight limit should be. However this should not be taken as giving a green light to 60-tonne lorries per se, nor should it be seen as a kind of 'thin end of the wedge' scenario. Sadly, Mrs Ayala Sender's excellent report has been given an unjust hearing because members and the media have highlighted just one section of it - namely 60-tonne mega lorries. It is right therefore to reiterate yet again that there will be no compulsion on Member States to introduce them on their national networks.

I wish to explain that I cannot support paragraph 32 of the report, which calls for broad tax harmonisation, or the harmonisation of corporate taxes, nor recital O, which criticises these Member States that guard their prerogatives in regard to tax issues. Member States must be free to determine their own taxation policy as part of national fiscal policy. In regard to paragraph 40, part 2, I will vote in favour of this because I have concerns that on a number of issues Member States use EU legislation to ‘gold plate’ their own national laws, and then blame the EU for any subsequent criticism that may come their way. I will also vote for paragraph 16, part 2, which states insufficient attention has been given to nuclear energy as a tool with which to tackle climate change in a balanced way and would hope that as a result a discussion could start based on facts and not on fears with regard to the role that nuclear energy can bring to climate change as part of a well balanced energy policy.

 Mr President, on behalf of my group I would like to thank the rapporteur, not only for his report but also for his inclusiveness in bringing together Parliament, the Council and the various political factions on this important issue. Members will be aware that current Community law in this area resides primarily in four directives that deal with the transportation of dangerous goods. The RID Directive and the ADR Directive deal with rail and road respectively, with the transport of dangerous goods by inland waterways covered by the annexes to these two directives. The proposed new directive now extends the scope of Community law to inland waterways and we need to support such a move. Some people may think that the rapporteur has not gone far enough in challenging the scope of the directive and there are others, mainly from industry, who think the directive too proscriptive and that it goes too far. The rapporteur has, frankly, got the balance right and surely the important aspect of all of this is that we would establish a single system of regulation for the transport of dangerous goods by inland waterways, with standards laid down and with everybody, including Member States, knowing their responsibilities. This report does give us added value, as explained by our rapporteur. It will enhance safety and therefore, I believe, and my group believes, deserves our full support.

 Mr President, I am so long in this Parliament that I recall the occasion when Commissioner de Palacio first proposed the Single European Sky and the term ‘functional airspace blocks’ first entered EU vocabulary. Well, after a painful birth, progress was made in 2004 with the regulation that enacted these airspace blocks, but I have to say that since then progress has been painfully slow, particularly in regard to the extension of those airspace blocks and specifically as regards lower airspace. I appreciate, Commissioner, that it was the Commission’s intention to work with Member States and no doubt some Member States have proved to be less willing to pursue this policy at the pace that we would like or, indeed, had envisaged, but surely the time is now right to find the accelerator pedal and for the Commission now to come forward with a directive as soon as possible. Since 2004, no new airspace blocks have been created and, as we have heard from previous speakers, the cost of that in our failure to create a Single European Sky is estimated to be at EUR 1 billion. In addition, the existing legislation is in need of updating and the travelling public are still faced on a daily basis with air traffic delays, due to the antiquated attitudes of Member States and what appears to be inactivity by the Commission. Patience is running out, and action is needed urgently. Failure to act is not an option, which is why my Group will support the oral question placed before Parliament by Mr Costa, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. Commissioner, we are all growing older and we would like to see the Single European Sky in our
 lifetime.

 Mr President, I congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Ferber, on his work on this report. It is a long time since he and I first crossed swords on postal services many years ago. In fact, I think we may even have still had the Berlin Wall at the time, which just shows you how long this has been going on. Postal services are a highly personal and highly political issue. That is why they are different to other sectors, like telecoms and energy, because post, as I have often said in this House, is about people; it is about frontline public service. That is why it is important and generates a lot of interest. I know in the work we have done in committee we have tried to take on board the views of other committees and political groups. And, after a lot of hard work, and I have to say a great deal of good will, we reached an agreement, which I think is a good one. I just want to say that this particular directive is not really about liberalisation. The argument as to whether we should liberalise the post was lost many years ago. Mr Hughes is right when he says that politics is about the art of the possible. And those who are a minority – and I respect them for their views – who think that we should stay with the old ways, stay with the monopolistic sector and reserved area, well, whilst I see the merits of their argument, in the real world, that is not where we are, that is not where we are living. The vast majority of our Member States have liberalised; the vast majority of those who have not would like to and so, therefore, it is a dose of reality that is sometimes needed. Parliament agreed to controlled liberalisation and, indeed, in its last pronouncement agreed that that should be on 1 January 2009. Yet, since then, we have had the accession of the new Member States and my group believes that that means we need to think through what we did previously with a view to a different timetable and delaying the implementation for those who need it. But I have to say that, whilst the Commission is strong on universal service, it is weak on how to finance that universal service within its proposals. So let us look at the key issue. How do we guarantee a universal service, and a universal service that treats all citizens equally, irrespective of where they live? That is why we support the guarantee of access points in rural and peripheral areas. How do we finance that universal service? How do we have the national plans in place to enable that to happen? How do we protect the workers and their working conditions, and how do we ensure that the new Member States are not forced into competition that they cannot sustain? That is where the timescale is important. They are the issues we have addressed in this report and in the compromise that we reached and I hope Parliament will support that compromise tomorrow.

 Mr President, I would like to speak in favour of referring this report back to the committee. There was a lot of concern in committee when the vote was taken to reject this proposal and no doubt the groups involved had reasons for doing that, but one of the consequences was that many road safety issues were then rejected also. Rather than go through the whole procedure in this plenary, my group and I feel that it would be far better if we refer the whole Markov report back to committee as of today, take it off the agenda and basically start again with our discussions between all the groups in the hope that we can come to a proper solution.

 Mr President, this weekend Germany played Serbia in Heidelberg for the first time at the great game of rugby league, or rugby à treize
. However, the HTV rugby union club in Heidelberg, aided by the German Rugby Union, tried to disrupt the event with disgraceful behaviour. They went around tearing down posters advertising the game; they threatened German players that if they played rugby league for their country they would be banned from playing rugby union. The national trainer of the German rugby union team, prior to the playing of the national anthems, threatened a player and banned him from playing, against his wishes, for his country. HTV played on the designated pitch the day before even though the local authority had forbidden them from doing so, thus ruining the playing surface for the international match the following day. The Germany vs Serbia rugby league match was recognised as an international by the Rugby League International Board European Federation. The actions of HTV Rugby Union Club and German Rugby Union are something we expect from a banana republic, not a nation in the EU, and show how bigoted the German Rugby Union and the HTV club have become. Their behaviour was disgraceful and shocked the spectators. This blatant discrimination and intimidation cannot be tolerated and will, I would hope, be condemned by this House and by the Commission. I would ask the German authorities to withdraw all support from the HTV rugby union club and the German Rugby Union until their attitudes change.

 Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, not only for his work on this dossier, but also for his perseverance in bringing this report to its second reading. Clearly, this process is required to bring about a fair and level playing field in the area of local public transport contracts. However, the PSE Group still has some concerns, especially in the area of quality of service offered by transport undertakings and especially in the area of bus transport in some of the Member States. In this regard, we believe that Parliament, in its pursuit of liberalisation in this area, may have forgotten about the importance of providing quality services and I would hope that in subsequent revisions of this legislation, the issue of quality and the enforcement of quality is given serious consideration. I appreciate that what we have today is a first step and that the road to this second reading has been a long one, but we must recognise the progress that has been made and hope that the agreement between the Council and Parliament can be reached quickly. My group will do all that we can to vote only for those amendments that fall within the compromise deal done with the Council, despite our reservations. For us, the alternative will be conciliation. What people require is an efficient, reliable, affordable and safe public transport system that places on public bodies a responsibility to ensure that those criteria are met. It also places responsibility on transport operators to deliver, and frankly, that is where the challenges will lie. Whilst it is right to put into place the framework for the issuing of public transport contracts, we cannot allow standards to slip and we must ensure that the procedures are fair and transparent. Hopefully, the framework will soon be in place. Now let us work on the quality of service to be provided.

.  I voted in favour of taking inland waterways out of the scope of this Directive for a number of reasons. Firstly, this report was introduced to facilitate adequate liabilities for seagoing ships, not inland waterways including river and estuary crossings. Secondly, any extension of the scope of this proposal to include inland waterways would have caused severe problems not only on the leisure-based inland waterways of the UK but also on many river crossings that provide an essential public service as part of the public transport network. Thirdly, bringing estuary crossings into this legislation would have added a considerable cost burden on operators, bringing into question the very viability of some of the operations. I was surprised that the Liberal Democrats supported the move to include inland waterways, as this could have adversely affected the operations of ferries across the river Mersey, which they purport to support. Thankfully the plenary, in its wisdom, has now overturned the view of our Liberal rapporteur and removed the problems that I have alluded to. This means I can gladly vote for the report as amended by plenary.

 Madam President, with over 40% of the EU-US market, this particular agreement is of great interest, of course, to the United Kingdom. While I accept that the agreement could deliver some benefits to consumers, it has still to my mind failed to address some fundamental issues and has a number of question markets over it. In particular, the deal falls well short of providing the kind of access to the US market that a number of EU carriers would like. It does little with regard to ownership of US airlines and appears little different from previous deals rejected by the European Union. So, in my opinion, those who enthusiastically welcomed this agreement may need to pause a little and examine it in more detail to see what it delivers for the EU. I know the ultimate goal is to create an open aviation area with the US and I indeed support any agreement that would unlock the transatlantic aviation market. But the question is: does this deal help deliver that? To me it is a deal that promises the EU jam tomorrow and gives the US the jam today. However, if this agreement does go ahead, then we must ensure that a clear timetable is quickly put in place with real and serious incentives on both sides to move forward to a second stage deal that delivers a fully open aviation market. In short, I do not think this deal is a disaster, but it is not as great as the Commission would have you believe. It is merely a first step and one that would appear to benefit the US. I look forward in future agreements to the United States giving something a bit more substantial back and for that country to stop over-protecting its aviation industry.

 Madam President, once again, given the importance of this dossier to the UK farmers and our rural communities, I cannot vote in favour of the rapporteur’s recommendations to reject this voluntary modulation dossier. I also take the opportunity to remind all British MEPs from all political parties that support for rejection will have serious consequences for the UK’s rural development spending plans and, in effect, you will be voting for a massive cut of over EUR 1.2 billion in British rural areas over the next 6 years. I also remind all Members of the House that, due to the low allocation of rural development money received by the UK compared to other Member States, the voluntary modulation system is not only needed but also essential in delivering ambitious and effective rural development programmes in my country. I think we need to spend a little time assessing what all this means, just as a way of highlighting the importance of the issues. Firstly, voluntary modulation will allow the UK to deliver a much broader range of environmental outcomes in line with stated EU policies. Secondly, whilst appreciating the political sensitivities surrounding Parliament’s right, we must surely focus on the potential of securing real and genuine development gains for rural areas. For example, we can give payments to farmers under agri-environment schemes designed to deliver environmental and biodiversity benefit; we can support hill farmers and farmers in the uplands; we can work on schemes to help mitigate the effect of climate change through support for energy crops and other renewable energy products and we can help protect our countryside in key natural resources. All of this is put at risk by Parliament’s attitude towards voluntary modulation and that is why Labour Party MEPs will vote against the committee’s short-sighted recommendation. Without voluntary modulation, the UK will only be able to honour existing contracts, falling far short of what we would like to do. Finally, I would like to ... (The President cut the speaker off)

 Mr President, Parliament has moved from its first-reading position on the Electricity and Gas Directive. I would just like briefly to explain why. The report as it stands is far from perfect, but we believe that we have made substantial gains for energy consumers in the European Union. We have put the issue of energy poverty onto the European agenda for the very first time and we have ensured the independence of the national regulatory authorities and given them an increased role to police the new system. We would like, however, to encourage the Commission and, in particular, the competition authorities to continue their work in ensuring that companies that own both generation and transmission systems play by the rules and do not abuse their positions. I would like to thank colleagues for all their help over the years.
 Eluned Morgan,  
rapporteur. 
− Madam President, this energy package is the culmination of years of hard work in which Parliament can be very proud of the changes that will now be put in place. We should, in particular, be proud of the fact that the EU’s energy consumers have now been put right at the centre of the energy debate for the first time and the issue of energy poverty has now been recognised at European level. The inherit conflict of interests that arises when a company owns both transmission and generation of electricity has been addressed, and the regulatory regime governing the energy markets has been strengthened. The Electricity Directive, for which I was rapporteur, is part of a package of five measures which seeks improvements in the way the electricity and gas markets work across the continent, to ensure that the markets are better integrated and operate in a fairer and less discriminatory way. Let me say how grateful I have been for the enormous cooperation from the other rapporteurs on this package, as well as from the shadows, the Commission and the Czech Presidency, for helping us to come to a conclusion on what was sometimes a very challenging debate. The legislation has seen a raft of new consumer protection measures set out, including ensuring that customers are able to switch suppliers within three weeks, the provision in each Member State of an independent and robust complaints system, and the right to compensation if service levels are not met. This legislation will also ensure that every household in the EU will be fitted with so-called ‘smart meters’ by 2022. These smart meters will enable customers to better control their energy use and increase energy efficiency, helping to cut energy costs and reduce carbon emissions. On the European Parliament’s initiative, the new legislation also includes special protection measures for vulnerable energy consumers, and the issue of energy poverty will now have to be taken seriously for the first time. I would like to ask Commissioner Piebalgs if he will now make a commitment that, in future, the energy framework of the EU, in addition to addressing security of supply, sustainability and competitiveness, will also now add a fourth leg – that of affordability – to all future energy policy proposals. An EU-backed report has recently concluded that up to 125 million citizens are affected by energy poverty. Member States now must take appropriate measures which could lead to the prevention of hundreds – if not thousands – of deaths in the poorest households across the continent. We will also see the end to discriminatory pricing on prepayment meters. The most controversial part of the package centred on whether there was a need for full ownership unbundling in the energy markets – in other words, a total separation of transmission systems from generation. The market structure in some Member States means that the monopoly enjoyed by transmission system operators, who also own the means of generating electricity, offers no incentive to encourage other players onto the market, thereby undermining competition. Parliament has now accepted a compromise that will allow ownership of both transmission and generation on condition that we see increased checks and balances to ensure the removal of the inherent conflict of interest that arises. Many of us reluctantly accepted the compromise because we believe that the wind is blowing in the direction of wholesale separations, and these integrated companies are likely to separate regardless of this directive. The Commission’s efforts in exposing the abuses of some companies is starting to pay off, with examples of companies like E.ON and RWE agreeing to sell their transmission networks following anti-trust investigations. We are also going to see a strengthening of national regulatory authorities. I would like to thank everybody for their cooperation, and I think we should be proud of what we have done for the consumers of the EU.
 Eluned Morgan,  
rapporteur. 
− Madam President, I would like to thank colleagues once again for their cooperation. I would also like to thank Bethan Roberts and René Tammist who have been a great help in preparing this report. This is my swan song after 15 years in the European Parliament, and I am delighted that we have made such a significant improvement in the energy markets on behalf of the European public. It is far from perfect but it is definitely a step forward. I think that the energy crisis will become more acute in future years, so getting the right market framework in place, and creating the right kind of incentives for the right kind of investment, is crucial. We need an estimated EUR 1 trillion worth of investment in the markets to stop the lights from going out in future. But there is a huge amount more to do. You know that there are 12 countries in the European Union where one company dominates 70% of the electricity market. What we have at the moment is the worst of both worlds. We think we have competition, but what we have is the massive power of very large companies dominating certain markets. It will require action on the part of national regulatory authorities and competition authorities to make sure that we do not continue in this way. The real challenge in future will be implementation. Let us not forget that there are many EU laws that already exist in the energy markets, and it is precisely because these laws were not being respected that the revision of this law needed to take place. Whether we need a fourth package or not will depend on the Commission ensuring implementation and good policing of these new laws by national regulatory authorities and competition authorities. So let us see a bit of action from the Commission, and also from the national regulatory authorities.

 Madam President, I am glad to see Mr Vondra back. I thank him for explaining the gravity of the situation, but when is the Council going to learn that until the EU speaks with one voice on energy issues, in particular in relation to Russia and the Ukraine, we are going to be in a weak position? I am going to give you an example where the Council does not do that. We shall shortly be starting negotiations on the second reading of the energy liberalisation package. The Commission came up with a very carefully crafted position on third countries investing in the EU, suggesting that the Commission speak on behalf of the EU on these issues. What have you in the Council done? You have retreated to national positions and said, no – we Member States we want the final say, not the Commission. It is this divide-and-rule, the oldest trick in the book, which you and your fellow colleagues have fallen for. Until you understand that pooling your powers to gain more leverage internationally is the way to go, we will always be in a position where we are vulnerable. You must answer the European citizens as to why they are now sitting in the cold. You have to change your position on this line. Will you do so?

− This report represents a revolution in the way we produce energy in the EU. The target of 20% renewable energy by 2020 is extremely ambitious but necessary if we are to win the fight against climate change. I hope, however, that the Commission will be flexible in its interpretation of when these targets are met if they are to include large projects such as the Severn Barrage. The 10% target for road transport fuels is a vital part of this package and of the efforts to achieve the EU’s goal of a low carbon economy. This so-called ‘biofuels target’ has been greatly improved to ensure that only those biofuels which deliver real emission reductions without increasing food prices are allowed in the EU. A strict set of social criteria has also been included which will safeguard people in the developing world who could otherwise have been adversely affected by the rapid development in biofuel production.

− I am supporting this report, as I believe that the environmental integrity of the ETS has been maintained and is a considerable improvement on the current system, as the polluter in future will pay for the right to emit through the auctioning of permits. The objective of reducing emissions from Europe’s power stations and heavy industry by at least 20% by 2020 is maintained, and this will automatically rise to a 30% reduction if there is an international agreement at the UN climate talks in Copenhagen in December 2009. I also believe that a balance has been achieved between jobs and the environment, which is vitally important in an economic downturn.

− The inclusion in this report of a EUR 9 billion fund to clean up coal-fired power stations through the development of carbon capture and storage (CCS) will offer exciting opportunities for the Welsh coal industry. This chance must be seized upon, to make Wales a leader in this new technology, and unlock the potential of a lucrative export market. It is essential that Europe takes the lead in this area, as finding a solution to the problem of coal is crucial, in particular when coal production is expected to rise globally by 60% in the next 20 years.

− Carbon from transport constitutes 21% of our carbon emissions. Setting ambitious targets for the automotive industry is therefore essential in ensuring that the car industry holds true to its voluntary target, which it has failed to meet in the past. By setting high standards for Europe's potential 500 million customers, we shall also be setting global standards for the world to follow. With overcapacity in the global car industry, it is imperative that Europe takes the lead in the production of green cars, which is where consumers are likely to turn in future.
 Eluned Morgan  (PSE

 Mr President, there are going to be radical changes in the way the EU produces and consumes its energy. This has been based on a three-pronged strategy by the Commission: security of supply, sustainability and competitiveness. But the Commission left out a fundamental part of this important debate, namely the issue of affordability. Since the publication of the Green Paper on energy, Socialists in this Parliament have been asking for consumers to be put right back into the driving seat. We want to see energy poverty as a part of this debate. So far in the EU there are no national definitions and there is no data collection, so we have no idea of the scale of this problem. We know that energy prices have been rising exponentially and they are hitting the most vulnerable in our society the hardest. I would like to give fair warning to the Council that, in the negotiations on the electricity and gas directives that we are about to begin, the issue of energy poverty will be fundamental to our agreement. We are not going to step on your toes. We are asking for domestic action on this – not Community action – but we do expect action for the poorest people in the EU on energy poverty.

I voted for this report which aims to tackle gender inequality. It is clear that women do not have the same opportunities as men to progress in their career. Working mothers will never be able to balance family and professional life without stronger parental rights for both men and women. This is why I fully support the calls for increasing the duration of parental leave, and in particular increasing the incentives for fathers to take parental leave, and flexible working conditions. It is only with these kinds of rights that we will be able to tackle gender inequality. Women will never gain true equality until men take their fair share of responsibility for childcare and running the home, just as my fantastic husband does. He cooks, he shops, but he's not so good at making the bed!

 Mr President, this report is the first in a package of measures dealing with the energy markets in the EU. There has been a great deal of cooperation between all the rapporteurs and the shadows on this package and we would like to send a message to the Council that we intend to negotiate this as a package, not as a series of individual reports. There is one aspect of the Electricity Directive which has caused a great deal of division within the Parliament. This is, unusually, broken down on a national basis, not on a party political basis. I would urge colleagues, however, to consider the report as a whole. It includes tackling energy poverty, better rights for consumers and measures to make the market work better.
 Eluned Morgan,  
rapporteur
. −
 Mr President, I hope that if Parliament adopts the electricity report tomorrow, it will be an indication to energy companies all over Europe that we want the consumer back in the driving seat. Before talking about the most controversial aspect of this directive, I would like to dwell on some of the areas where we have managed to find a consensus within Parliament so far. There cannot be anyone within the European Union who has not noticed the massive increase in energy prices in recent months. All over the European Union there are people struggling to pay their energy bills so we believe that the issue of ‘energy poverty’ should be placed firmly on the EU agenda. After all, the ETS system and the renewables targets are European and they impact on energy prices. We have respected subsidiarity, Commissioner, in our request that Member States should come up with their own definitions of energy poverty and an action plan for dealing with the problem. So, if the Council want a deal on this package, they need to understand that this is a central requirement of Parliament. Already many rights for consumers exist in the energy field but they are not enforced. So we have asked the national regulatory authorities to use incentives and sanctions to ensure the consumer is protected. We have also listed additional rights which should be enjoyed by the consumer such as affordable prices for low-income families, an easier way to switch suppliers, increased representation for the consumer, especially when they have complaints, and a fair deal for people in rural and remote areas. We believe there should be a roll-out of smart meters within 10 years, which should boost energy efficiency, and companies should be creative in the way they charge for energy and not reward people who use more as is currently the case. Priority access should be given to renewables to enter the grid so that we can reach that 20% target. We have got to understand that when we talk about transmission systems we are talking about monopolies, so clearly there is a need for very strict regulation. We would like to see much better cooperation between national regulatory authorities and competition authorities. In this way, we might get to a point where we do not have almost half of the countries in the EU where one company dominates over 70% of the market. Now to the most controversial part of the report – the issue of unbundling. The clear thing is that the current system has not worked. There is a suspicion that some are not playing fair. They are giving priority access to their own company; they put obstacles in place which could stifle competition. That is why I believe, as rapporteur, that total separation of energy supply from transmission companies or full ownership unbundling – as was suggested initially by the Commission – should be the only option for electricity companies. It is only in this way you will remove the conflict of interest. You can build as many Chinese walls as you want, but there will be no incentive for companies to encourage competition in the market if they also own transmission companies. We need a level playing field: we need easier access for renewables and SMEs, but, probably more than anything else, we need a stable regulatory framework for the one trillion-worth of investment that is necessary in the EU market. If we fudge this issue now, we will not be giving a clear signal to those investors and the lights could go off in Europe. This issue will not go away and, if the lights go out, governments can fall. So, who is resisting this? Germany, France, Austria, Luxembourg, Greece and Bulgaria: they think that strengthening these Chinese walls will be enough. Some suspect also that there is an effort to protect national champions who are happy to invest in other markets but are reluctant to allow others into their markets. We should not oversell the model however, we are not likely to see a reduction in prices under any model. We know that the Council has come to an informal agreement on this issue. They have suggested the strengthening of these Chinese walls. Many of us, however, feel that this will not be enough for European consumers and have suggested sticking to a tough position. I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs in particular and everybody involved in this package for the cooperation on this very complex dossier.
 Eluned Morgan,  
rapporteur

 Madam President, I should like to thank all those who contributed to a very interesting debate. I would like to reflect a little on what Mr Hökmark said about developing the best possible system to ensure security of supply, sustainability and competitiveness. I must say that the position the Council has come up with goes too far. I am disappointed with the informal agreement in Council, because it has bent too much to the will of the minority. I understand, of course, that there is a time and a place and a need for compromise, but I think it has gone too far. I am also disappointed with the Commission for not being firmer in defending its own position – do not forget that it is your own position that we are defending now. I would just like to remind you that you have backtracked and we have not – we are defending your
 position. What we have at the moment is not good enough. We have large industrial energy users coming up to us and asking us privately to unbundle, but when we tell them that we will try to do that and ask them to come and say that to us publicly, they say they cannot do that as they are vulnerable! That means that the consumer is not in charge – the consumer is not in control of the marketplace – and that is problematic. I think there has been a misunderstanding on the matter of special tariffs for vulnerable customers. I stand by this issue. I want to see special tariffs for vulnerable customers. However, we are not asking the EU to do this: we are asking Member States to do it and to take this issue seriously. We, the Socialists, in particular, have listened to what our constituents are saying: that high prices are hurting and that they are really suffering at the moment, and we want the issue of energy poverty put on the agenda in the Member States. It is not even there at the moment. Only one country in Europe has a definition of energy poverty. Put it on the agenda in your Member States because it is not there now!
 Eluned Morgan  (PSE

 Mr President, I would like to continue my Strasbourg tradition of naming and shaming Member States who fail to comply with the Lisbon directives. In 2005, all 27 Member States agreed to abide by the framework for the setting of eco-design requirements for energy-using products. By August 2007 only six Member States had declared that they had fully transposed this directive into domestic law. The Commission began infringement proceedings against 21 Member States and, to date, 15 Member States have still failed to comply with this law. So the list of shame includes: Germany, Italy, Luxembourg (once again), Portugal, Malta, Cyprus, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Finland, Denmark, Estonia and Greece. In this week when the Bali conference is occurring, it is a scandal that Member States are failing to conform with measures that they have already agreed with and which could already have had a significant impact on tackling the issue of climate change.
 Eluned Morgan  (PSE
). – 
 Mr President, one of the greatest problems in relation to EU policy is implementation. This is particularly true in relation to directives relating to Lisbon and climate change. On 4 January 2006 the energy performance of the Buildings Directive should have been implemented in all Member States. This would have led to massive energy savings. The problem is that only eight countries communicated full transposition on time. That means that all of the following countries have failed to implement the laws that they themselves signed up to: France, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg, the UK, Spain, Austria, Finland, Sweden, Estonia, Latvia, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Greece, Cyprus and Malta. The EU will lose credibility and its attempts to reduce carbon emissions will not be taken seriously unless its laws are respected on time. I urge you to write to the Member States I have just mentioned, to speed up implementation of this important directive.
 Eluned Morgan  (PSE
). – 
 Mr President, first of all, I would like to say that it is lovely it is to see Mr Dimas back. It is pretty much accepted that the carbon emissions in relation to aviation are currently a very small proportion of the overall carbon emissions of the EU. But you would have to be a fool not to see the incredible growth in the sector in recent years and to recognise that the industry’s own plans for expansion are enormous. Currently, the technology for alternative, less polluting fuels are limited in relation to aviation. This is why it makes absolute sense to accept that aviation is likely to continue to grow, but we need to ensure that this growth is offset in other sectors of the economy which do have alternatives in terms of reducing carbon emissions. That is why it is essential that aviation is brought into the emissions trading scheme (ETS). I would also like to underline the point that the EU has a principle that it is the polluter who should pay. Under the current ETS, far from the polluter paying, we have seen many polluters making windfall profits thanks to the ETS. This has to stop. It is right, therefore, that many of these carbon creators should be auctioned, especially when the wholesale reform happens. Perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of this debate is the question of where ETS auction money should be spent. In the forthcoming ETS review, there is potentially EUR 200 billion which could be raised if we went for full auctioning. I am sure many of us could think of countless ways to spend that kind of money, but I believe it would be sensible if we could steer this money via the EU budget, if possible, to spend on climate change initiatives which could include transfers of finance to the developing world including, for example, to pay for reforestation in developing or emerging countries. But, also, there needs to be recognition that even in our own Member States we are likely to see a huge increase in terms of energy poverty. Perhaps we should think about steering the money in this direction as well. So the decisions we make tomorrow will give an indication of where we should go, in terms of the ETS reform as a whole.
 Eluned Morgan (PSE
). – 
 Madam President, I hope the Commission will heed the vote of the committee when preparing the revision of the directive and not kow-tow to Member States which protect companies which overcharge their consumers. They have a vested interest in maintaining a system where there is an inbuilt conflict of interests which stops competitors from having access to the same market. These are often the same companies which care more about giving profits to their shareholders than providing serious investments to ensure that the lights are kept on. I urge you not even to offer the ISO model, which would require a magnificently complicated regulatory system which would have to be policed by an army of officials, but understand also that ownership unbundling needs rules. We need to ensure that we protect energy networks from hedge funds or private equity, which will not give the long-term investment commitment that is necessary, and let us stop third-country companies from buying either generation or energy networks if there is no reciprocal agreement with that country. I urge you also to put right the false impression on ownership unbundling spun by the German Presidency following the last Energy Council meeting. The majority of Member States are in favour of full ownership unbundling, especially in electricity. Do not be bullied by the big boys and let democracy and the consumers speak.
 Eluned Morgan (PSE
). – 
 Mr President, calling home while on your holidays has been far too expensive for far too long. Many mobile operators have been charging customers extortionate prices and, in Parliament’s view, very unnecessary tariffs. We warned them to put their house in order. We gave them the chance to do the right thing but they persisted and it is for that reason that we have had to introduce legislation that gives protection to anyone who uses a mobile while abroad. It is not an ideal solution, but it is the only option left to control those who abuse the market. Let this be a lesson to other industries. One of the things we discovered in our discussions with mobile companies was that much roaming traffic is kept in-house as customers are directed on to partner networks. So for many roaming companies, wholesale prices are simply a way of ensuring different parts of the same company benefit. When we understand this, the market price for consumers becomes even more exorbitant. This is a victory for consumers, a victory for the European Parliament and a victory for the European Union.
 Eluned Morgan (PSE

 Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner and the Minister for their personal commitment to this crucial issue and remind the House that these are the good guys! There are plenty of people in the Commission and in the Council who are going to be pushing against these in terms of where we are at. The proposals that have come forward from the Commission are indeed ambitious. However, they are not ambitious enough and they do not follow through the science. The science suggests that if we are to follow through what the ministers have already decided – that is not to go above two degrees – then you have to have a 30% cut in carbon emissions. If you follow Stern, you have to take the pain now to save later. What we want to see is world leadership. A 20% cut is not world leadership. The ministers have to follow through. If they sign up to this, they have to follow through. It is disappointing to see that the Member States are not signing up to 20% binding targets on renewables. It is disappointing that the Commission has caved in to the German car lobby, but it is good to hear the ministers say that actually we are not going to cave in to the car lobby, as some Commissioners have done – not Mr Dimas. Please Minister, sort out your national allocation plan. It is crucial. It is time for the Council not just to talk the talk, but to walk the walk. (Applause)

 Madam President, at the beginning of this year a harsh shiver went through the homes of many people in Western Europe as the Russian firm Gazprom turned off the supplies to Ukraine. The effects of that were felt throughout the European Union. A harsh shiver went down the spine of many politicians as we realised that in future, if we were to continue on our current trajectory, over 80% of our gas was likely to come from outside the EU. There are real security-of-supply issues that need to be addressed very quickly. On top of this, there is an increasing awareness of the climate change agenda. It is affecting our planet more quickly and in more dramatic ways than were hitherto imagined. If we are to stem the tide of the effects that humans are having on the environment, we surely have to start by making radical changes in the way we use and produce energy. I would like to think that the report we are voting on today will be an adequate response to those challenges. The Commission has set out its stall on the scale of the problem. We hope we have responded constructively to some of the tough choices that need to be made. There has been no doubt that this is an opportunity for the EU to prove itself to the citizens of Europe. This is one of the greatest contributions that Parliament has made to this debate, putting citizens and consumers right back into the centre of the energy debate. If we are to take on these challenges the consumer has to be involved and we have to recognise that energy poverty is a real issue for millions of our citizens. Energy efficiency is surely the most cost-effective way of meeting some of the energy challenges we face, and the Commission has come up with a very comprehensive action plan on energy consumption and energy efficiency. It is imperative that we try to make the European Union the most energy-efficient economy in the world by 2020. This is a great example of a situation where we already have reams of legislation in place and Member States are ignoring the laws that they have signed up to. We have to reach a stage where we cut our energy consumption by 20%. Implementation on this is absolutely crucial and I would like to ask you, Commissioner, what further steps we can take. You suggested that we are going to initiate more infringement proceedings – but can we do more to name and shame Member States that are not implementing the laws that they have signed up to? For too long, many Member States have been more concerned about getting the best deal for their national energy champions than helping or providing benefits for the consumer. Why is it that in the UK last year 19% of the public switched energy companies, while in France the figure was less than 2%? Is it because all the citizens in France and in Germany are happy with their energy suppliers? I doubt it. I suggest that it is because it is extremely difficult for many companies to access these markets because of some companies’ in-built vested interests in keeping others out. That is why we have to do something very serious in opening up and unbundling the energy networks. When you arrive in the UK on the Eurostar, the first sign you see is a huge sign which says that Électricité de France is giving power to millions of Londoners. I dream of the day when I can get off the train in Paris and read a sign that says: ‘Centrica – still not in Russian hands – providing power to millions of Parisians’. I am afraid that day is a long way off. Security of supply and sustainability have to go hand-in-hand. We have to use mechanisms such as the emissions trading scheme to drive the economy. Energy mix is up to Member States, but let us be sensible and acknowledge that the energy mix in one country will affect others, and that is why we need targets on cutting CO2 emissions by 30% by 2020. We are insistent on binding sectoral targets of 25% in renewable energies. That means no less than a revolution in the way that many Member States produce their energy. We spend pitiful amounts on research and development and we have to work towards a truly common European energy policy in external affairs. I would like to thank the other political parties, in particular Mr Reul, Mrs Ek, Mr Turmes and Mr Seppänen for their contributions and their support in this debate. I hope, Commissioner, you will take on some of our ideas and we look forward to receiving your ideas on the strategic energy review in the new year.
 Eluned Morgan (PSE

 Mr President, I just wanted to say how delighted I am that we are reaching a conclusion on this. Science is crucial to the competitiveness of the European Union. When you see the economic giants rising up in China and India and how many computer scientists are being produced in that part of the world, you know the challenge is on. The Commission acknowledged this in its initial presentation of the financing it sought for this programme. It must be said that the Council’s response was very
 disappointing, not the first time under the Luxembourg Presidency. Thank goodness the Brits were there to save the day and to increase the amount of money allocated to the science budget. It is crucial to acknowledge Mr Blair’s role in that. However, we must also recognise that it is still not enough: EUR 50 billion is not enough for a seven-year programme for 27 countries. It is not a serious proposal. At the very least, Member States need to work together much more constructively in terms of building that capacity, because it is crucial. I refer to what Mr Turmes said earlier. Taking energy as an example, it is crucial to look at things like the technology platforms and the zero emissions platform. That is the kind of thing that will make a real difference to climate change. Unless we allocate that kind of money and emphasise that link between science, the state and private sector, we will have no hope of addressing these issues. Ideally, we would develop these things in the European Union in order to roll them out to areas like China and really make a big difference. Finally, on capacities, it is crucial that regions in the poorer areas of the Community catch up, meaning it is essential to develop the capacities aspect of this programme further.

 Mr President, I am sorry I was not here earlier: it was Air France’s fault. I would just like to mention that Air France has cancelled flights from London. I want to raise the issue of the 84 Lisbon directives that have been approved by Parliament. Seventy-six of them should have been enforced by now and fully implemented, but only 13 of those 84 Lisbon directives have been fully implemented by all Member States. The directive on the common regulatory framework for electronic communications should have been fully implemented by 24 July 2003, but Belgium, Greece and Luxembourg have yet to notify the Commission of their implementation. The Lisbon Strategy is in jeopardy through such lax behaviour by Member States. However, I am encouraged to see that the Commission will open 50 cases against Member States that fail to implement the liberalisation of the energy markets. It is about time we saw that happening.
 Eluned Morgan (PSE
). 
 – Mr President, the revised guidelines will extend the European Union’s current gas and electricity transmission networks to the new Member States, and I welcome that. We have already seen what happens when the internal market does not work, when it is not fully completed, when supplies are not secured. Europe’s main gas supplier, Russia, has shown that it is willing and able to turn off its gas supplies to its own political advantage. That leaves us extremely vulnerable, and I am glad to see that at last the European Union is taking the whole issue of energy seriously. Gas prices around the world have soared, but there is no reason why gas prices in the United Kingdom need to be three times those of the Netherlands. We have been told in the United Kingdom that factories may have to close for the short term. The reason is that the high prices have caused a shortage of gas supply through gas pipelines, which is due to the lack of access to other European Union markets. Gordon Brown has said that the lack of liberalisation of European energy markets has cost the United Kingdom GBP 10 billion a year. How can United Kingdom companies be competitive in the face of that kind of inequity? European Union leaders have recently backed the Green Paper suggestions on developing gas and electricity interconnections. That is all very well, but we should not avoid a debate on issues such as price fixing, national champions, the resurgent nationalism and Member States’ failure to implement European Union legislation. On that note, I am encouraged by the announcement that the Commission will open 50 new cases tomorrow against European Union governments that have failed to implement European Union laws by failing to open up the EU’s energy market. That is great news, but may I ask the Commissioner why it has taken so long to take this action?
 Eluned Morgan (PSE
). – 
 Mr President, I welcome this resolution as a recognition that there is indeed an energy crisis in Europe. I can tell you that, as a MEP representing the United Kingdom – where gas prices are three times the price of gas in the Netherlands and where factories have been warned that they may have to close for a while due to gas shortages. The single European energy market does not work. The answer is not to retract into narrow nationalism, but to cooperate and make the system work better. We need to develop the common European energy policy. Hurricane Katrina and Gazprom/Russia’s recent behaviour are two major incidents which have forced our hands on this issue. Since the encouraging noises that we heard in Hampton Court, I am afraid we have seen some disappointing new moves from the Member States: their continuing failure to implement current existing legislation in this field; price-fixing in the energy market; new protectionism and the establishment of new national champions. None of this bodes well for the forthcoming meeting tomorrow where we hope we do not see more back-pedalling by the Council. This is the first time that we in Parliament have had a chance to comment on the Green Paper. Our first initial reaction must be one of disappointment: there are no new targets and no concrete proposals to establish a common energy policy. There is no way you are going to get investment of one trillion euro without more long-term planning. This paper entirely ducks the issue of transport and aviation and their contribution to the energy debate. It needs a lot of work by Parliament. I hope that we will be able to cooperate in this field and that we do not need a third serious incident to make the Member States realise we have to act in this field.
 Eluned Morgan (PSE

 Mr President, I welcome this report. This was of course is one of the top 10 priorities of the UK Presidency, essential for achieving the Lisbon goals. Now ICT accounts for 40% of Europe’s productivity growth and for 25% of the EU’s GDP growth. One of the key issues for me – as it is for the Commissioner and the rapporteur – is not just the economic goals of Lisbon but that the goals of Lisbon should embrace all. Social inclusion is of course a key factor. I know of poor single parents in Ely in Cardiff, where I was brought up, who do not have a car. When they want to do their weekly shopping it is impossible for them to take a bus; they have countless bags to carry and young children to take with them, and so they book a taxi at the cost of about GBP 10. Now if they were to shop online they would not have to pay that GBP 10, and this would make a huge difference to many poor families. The demonstration of the practical advantages of ICT is important to ensure that poorer members of our society embrace new technologies. Finally, we have to be realistic in relation to ICT. The prime investment for the sector has to come from the private sector. The state sector cannot respond quickly enough to changes in technology. Our responsibility is to provide a stable legislative framework for this kind of investment.

 Mr President, there are currently 84 Lisbon directives that the European Parliament has adopted; 63 of them should have been fully implemented by all Member States; so far, only 12 have been fully implemented. According to the latest figures published by the Commission, the directive on the common rules for the internal market in natural gas should have been implemented by 1 July 2004. The following countries have yet to notify the Commission of their legislation implementing that directive: Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Spain, Ireland, Latvia and Luxembourg. Lisbon is placed in jeopardy by such lax behaviour on the part of the Member States. Mr President, would you write to the Commission and ask them what they are doing to speed up legislation on the Gas Directive in particular?

 Mr President, there are currently 84 Lisbon directives which the European Parliament has adopted; 63 of them should have been implemented by 1 June 2005, but only 13 have been fully implemented by all Member States. The Biofuels Directive should have been implemented by the end of 2004, but the following Member States have yet to notify the Commission of their legislation implementing that directive: Estonia, Greece, Italy, Cyprus, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia. The Lisbon Strategy is in dire straits because of the failure to implement legislation by Member States. Mr President, I should like to ask you to write to the Commission, on behalf of Parliament, to ask what it is doing to speed up the implementation of the Biofuels Directive and what action it is taking against Member States which fail to implement and take seriously the Lisbon Strategy.

 Madam President, I would like to talk about human rights in Laos. In the middle of the last European elections, I watched a documentary about the plight of the Hmong people. I told myself then that I would take the first opportunity I had in this House to raise the plight of those people. I am glad to have this opportunity here today. The Hmong people are an ethnic group that has been persecuted for many years for supporting the US during the Vietnam War. When the Communist Party took over in 1975, thousands of Hmong people died because they supported the US at the time. Many fled the country, but many others fled to the mountain jungles and are still there today, several decades on. The documentary I watched showed a whole village – young children and old women and men – crying when the camera crew arrived because they believed that at last their plight would be shown to the world. The Hmong people of Laos have been attacked using helicopters and ground troops. They live a very basic existence and sometimes go without food for days on end despite being surrounded by edible berries: they would rather starve than give away any clues to the Laos authorities of their whereabouts. This is fear that women and children, in particular, should not have to put up with in the 21st century. I therefore urge the Commission and Council to consider very seriously what aid, if any, should go to Laos without seeing considerable improvements, in particular with regard to the rights of the Hmong people.

 Mr President, I wish to speak on the immoral behaviour of the company Irish Ferries. I know my colleague, Mr De Rossa, will be speaking on this issue as well. This week that company sacked 550 Irish and Welsh seafarers and took on Latvians at a much cheaper rate – less than half the minimum wage. That is because Irish Ferries has a new flag of convenience – the Cyprus flag – which means that it can skirt around the minimum wage laws of Ireland. This is bad for Irish workers and it is also bad for Latvian workers, because they are being exploited. I hope that this is not the shape of things to come under the Services Directive. The approach adopted by Irish Ferries has been positively Victorian. It smuggled security men on board the ships to force the staff to accept this switchover. Obviously there are serious safety issues here. We clearly need to revisit the 1998 Manning Directive. I should like to ask you, Mr President, to ensure that the Council puts this on the agenda for Monday’s Transport Council meeting. This is something that my colleague, Mr De Rossa, is also very keen to see.

 Mr President, the Structural Funds are an essential example of EU solidarity – solidarity between the richest and the poorest parts of the EU – and I am delighted to see that the Structural Funds have been refocused to concentrate on achieving the Lisbon goals. There will be better strategic planning, and there will be increased simplification, which is what we are looking for. In the Hatzidakis report, we are also asking the Member States to take their responsibilities seriously in terms of making sure that the money is spent properly, and we are demanding that the Finance Minister in each Member State signs off the accounts on an annual basis. We want to see an end to the blame game, blaming the Commission for the failures within the Member States. In Wales, we have enjoyed generous support from the EU Structural Funds, and I would like to see that support continue for West Wales and the Valleys. If the Council gets its skates on, we may sort out the budget before December and we may see a situation where we receive the maximum amount of funding. Being poor is not a badge of pride, but, on this occasion, it would be a window of opportunity to help our poorest communities. I am also pleased to see that there is a reference now to inactivity in helping people who are inactive in the workplace.

 Mr President, the European Parliament has passed 83 Lisbon directives, 63 of which should have been implemented. In fact, only ten have been fully implemented by all the Member States. I wish to continue my practice of naming and shaming Member States that fail to implement EU legislation. Today the issue I am concentrating on is being discussed at the G8 Summit: the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Allowance Trading Scheme Directive, which should have been implemented by the end of 2003. Estonia, Italy, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and Sweden have yet to notify the Commission of their legislation implementing this directive. There is no point in passing these laws if they are not implemented. Such lax behaviour by Member States jeopardises the Lisbon directives and economic liberalisation. Mr President, could you please write to these countries and ask them when they intend to initiate this law?

Despite recent major jolts to the EU project, we still have some fairly substantial work in progress, not least the Lisbon Strategy. I would like, therefore, to continue my mission to name and shame Member States that have not implemented some of the Lisbon directives. The European Parliament has passed 83 Lisbon directives. Sixty-three should have been implemented; only ten have been fully implemented by all Member States. The European company statute directive should have been implemented by 18 October 2004, but the following countries have yet to notify the Commission of their legislation implementing this directive: Belgium, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal and Slovenia. Mr President, would you write to those Member States and ask them when they intend to implement the directive?

 Mr President, I was responsible for the Committee on Regional Development’s opinion on this discharge. The Court of Auditors gave a relatively clean bill of health to the internal organisation administration of the structural funds, but that was not the case in relation to the Member States. One of the fundamental problems we have with the whole system is that of shared responsibility. When the Member States fail, the Commission gets the blame. Until we sort out that issue we will not get very far. Therefore I suggested that we should not agree to sign the interinstitutional agreement until the Member States agree to sign annual statements of assurance. I am sorry that some of the other parties did not agree to pre-empt that situation in this report. I hope they will show more backbone when it comes to the interinstitutional agreement. It is also important that we have more preventive measures in order to stop fraud and mismanagement. It is essential that the Commission use the Court of Auditors a bit more in terms of giving opinion on the development of policy. Will the Commissioner give a commitment to ensure that, in future, there is a systematic policy of asking the Court of Auditors for its advice during the development of policy? There is a real opportunity now, in particular with the new seven-year programmes coming up.

Today I would like to mention the Electricity Directive which should have been implemented by 1 June 2004. Those countries that have not implemented the Electricity Directive are Belgium, Germany, Greece, Spain, Ireland, Latvia, Luxembourg, Poland and Portugal. Sweden has yet to notify the Commission of its legislation implementing the Electricity Directive. I believe that the Lisbon Agenda is in jeopardy. It is time we put pressure on the Member States.

 I have voted for Turkey's progress towards accession despite having serious reservations. I would like to emphasise that my reason for voting for
 Turkey's progress towards accession is because it is a Muslim country and will serve as an important bridge between Europe and the Middle East in particular. I have concerns, however, that Turkey still has a very large number of human rights abuses. I also have concerns that a country with such a massive number of people living in poverty will not be able to reach the levels acquired in the acquis communautaire
, and I fear that the emphasis has been on the market access to Turkey rather than the need for Turkey to conform to the social and environmental standards in the EU. I am not interested in seeing the enlargement of Europe simply in order to see a larger market. An equal emphasis must be placed on social and environmental considerations.

 Mr President, the Cuban political system is unique in the world. We, as a parliament, absolutely condemn the human rights situation in the country and the lack of free speech. However, that is not to say that the situation is all bad. On a recent visit to the country we found that schools, where there is a ratio of 15 pupils to one teacher, are the envy of Europe. The humanitarian work of educating doctors to transform health services in developing countries is not a case of talking about solidarity with Africa, but acting on solidarity with Africa. Today, however, relations between the EU and Cuba are at an all-time low. There has been no high-level contact between the governments of the EU and Cuba for over a year. The situation came about as a result of the EU pursuing sanctions against Cuba for a crackdown on dissidents in 2003. The sanctions came in the form of an invitation to Cuban dissidents to attend Member States' national day celebrations, alongside government representatives in Cuba. This action clearly infuriated the Cubans. They were the ones who cut off contact. My appeal tonight is that we should be consistent in our approach to human rights. By all means condemn human rights violations in Cuba, but do the same in China. If you are to impose these kinds of sanctions on Cuba, then impose them on China as well. I feel that the EU strategy relating to Cuba is to spread an incredible degree of naivety. Did we really think that we could shift the human rights agenda in Cuba by inviting a few dissidents to a party when 40 years of US embargo have failed? We need to adopt alternative strategies to push the human rights agenda. The current method is not working. Mr White argued for the freeing of all dissidents in Cuba. What about Spain? Do you want to free all dissidents in Spain as well? I will not be lectured to by the Spanish PPE on visiting Cuba when the deputy leader of the Conservative Party, Michael Ancram, was swanning around Havana last week. It is time that you and Mr Tannock got over losing the elections. Get over it and stop imposing your stupid obsessions on the rest of the European Parliament!

 a reactionary! (Laughter)
 That is as nothing compared to the comments I have had from members of his party in e-mails. I have been described by members of UKIP as a ‘paedophile’ and a ‘big fat git’. Indeed, when I had a bomb in my office, UKIP members wrote to me, and Mr Farage put out a press release, basically saying that it was what I deserved.

 Mr President, I rise on Mr Hoppenstedt’s report to give the Budget Committee’s opinion. Like Mr Hoppenstedt, this will be my last speech before this Chamber after 20 years. The Budget Committee recognises the importance of these proposals and their urgency. It is quite clear that some key EU policies will be undermined without proper financing and therefore we are happy to support the proposal. However, we would point that this money is coming from the margin of heading 1a, so that will reduce the margin and therefore reduce the availability of funding for other projects which may be important in the future. We should bear that in mind. Secondly, we should also ensure that these organisations do not in any way become agencies because, if they did, they would of course be subject to the interinstitutional agreement on agencies. Finally, we would not want the Budget Committee’s position to be in any way undermined by the rush for these proposals. That is why the Budget Committee was happy to support Mr McCreevy’s proposal on Monday night about interim funding, so that we can ensure that proper financial procedures and a proper trialogue takes place on the financial implication of these proposals.

 The greatest failing of the single market is the failure to establish a single market in energy. National energy policies have led Europe to a dead end with an extreme dependence on expensive imported fossil fuels. There is neither a European energy grid nor a strategic energy storage policy. As a matter of urgency we must diversify our energy supply, reduce consumption, encourage low-carbon energy and establish a stable competitive internal market. For these reasons I support these reports while being concerned that the struggle to find a compromise acceptable to all may blunt the effectiveness of this legislation, so effective monitoring of implementation is vital. I support the increased provisions for consumer rights and welcome the recognition of energy poverty as a serious social problem. I remain uneasy about the non-binding nature of the EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators. Ultimately we can only secure a single energy market if we have a European regulator with real powers. I congratulate Parliament on pushing the Member States to go further than they wanted to go. This is another example of Parliament guaranteeing the victory of the broader European cause over national self-interest and protectionism.

 I welcome this report as a necessary adjunct to the type approval for the general safety of motor vehicles legislation approved earlier this year, which is mainly concerned with environmental and safety standards for tyres. We need tyres to be safer, more fuel efficient and quieter. Traffic noise, of which tyre noise is an important component, is a major cause of ill health. Reducing fuel consumption will be of great benefit to the consumer at a time of increasing austerity but it will also reduce CO2
 emissions and contribute to the EU’s ambitious goals in climate change reduction. With the labelling process consumers will be able to make an informed choice when buying tyres but also when deciding on which car to buy. We must monitor, though, how effective the labels are. We must ensure that consumers really do understand them, otherwise the whole exercise will be meaningless.

 Madam President, I would just like to focus on the microcredit issue, which the Committee on Budgets completely supports as it will help people without access to normal sources of funds – the very sort of people who need help in the current environment. We also welcome the Commission’s JASMINE initiative. However, there are certain considerations that we want to state. Firstly, funds should only be used where other sources are not appropriate, owing either to high risk or low profitability. Secondly, they must also be used to bring in private finance. Thirdly, because of different approaches from different Member States, we would like to look at whether it is feasible to have an EU framework for non-bank microfinance institutions. We would also like to look at whether interest-rate caps, which are used in some countries, are appropriate in these circumstances. In the longer term, we would like to get beyond the use of structural funds for this important initiative, because some of the people who need help are not in the areas that have support from the structural funds.

 Mr President, out of this budget review, we simply have to ask ourselves one question: does the budget reflect the political priorities of the 21st century? If it does not, it needs changing. Is it flexible enough to reflect changing times? Because one of my frustrations at the moment with the budget is how we deal with negative priorities. Too much is left in the budget because we cannot change things because of the restrictions of the MFF. If I could turn to activity-based budgeting and management, I think the Commission has made huge progress on this but I would warn against over-bureaucratising this exercise because what we want to ensure is a qualitative evaluation, not simply ticking boxes. We do not want people spending all their time evaluating themselves when they should be getting on and doing some work. So we have got to be careful about that. I personally think the annual policy strategy would be better if it was every two years or every two and a half years to fit in with the parliamentary cycle. This would allow us to get a much clearer idea of our policy perspectives on top of the Commission’s annual work programmes.

− History is littered with wars over access to land and oil, but I fear they will pale into insignificance when compared to likely future conflicts over access to water. Water is the most vital of all resources: life is impossible without it. Yet even in developed countries we are seeing serious water shortages. The consequences for less developed countries are catastrophic. The international community must take access to water much more seriously before it is too late. As we have seen in Copenhagen this week, climate change is accelerating at an alarming rate, which will further exacerbate water shortages. Access to clean water is a basic human right, so let us make it a major campaign.

 – Madam President, let me begin by congratulating Mr Schwab on his report and thanking him for his extremely cooperative approach to this whole matter. Last Thursday night, a colleague of ours, Linda McAvan, was involved in a very serious car accident. Her car was destroyed, but she walked away relatively unhurt. This was because the car she was driving had the most modern safety features and this enabled her not to be seriously injured. That is the context in which we are discussing this report. Road safety saves lives, as Commissioner Verheugen commented, and is so important to the well-being of many families in the European Union. We should not lose sight of that, even in these very difficult times. That is why I was determined to oppose those people in this Parliament and in the Council who wanted to weaken this Commission proposal. I believe the original Commission proposal is a very good one, and we were determined to resist changes to it. There was one main weakness, however, in that proposal, which is that there was no provision for the selling off of tyres that did not meet the new requirements after the implementation date. I believe that to be a major flaw. That is why I proposed to the committee – and the committee accepted – an amendment stating that tyres that did not meet the standards after the implementation date should be sold off after 12 months. However, in the current circumstances of the car industry, given that cars are not being sold, it was quite clear in the discussions we had with the Council that, in fact, 12 months was probably unrealistic, and we had to consider the serious environmental consequences of getting rid of tyres that are perfectly good and sound. Therefore, we were prepared to accept, in the trialogue, 30 months after the implementation date as being the period before which tyres not meeting the requirements should be sold off. However, thanks to the intervention of Mr Schwab, if the Commission believes that there could be an earlier date, that is provided for in the comitology procedure. This was an important area of strengthening. I would also draw attention to the important environmental measures – particularly tyre pressure monitoring systems – which will not only save on CO2
 but also make cars safer, because under-inflated tyres are a cause of many accidents. We have reduced rolling resistance and included gear shift indicators in this proposal, which was not in the original proposal. This will not only benefit the environment but also save motorists money – it is cash in people’s pockets, which is very important at this time. The point about safety has been well made. As I say, tyre pressure monitoring systems are very important, because under-inflated tyres – much to my shame, the United Kingdom is one of the worst culprits for having under-inflated tyres – are a cause of accidents. Lane departure warning systems and electronic stability control are also important. I congratulate Mr Schwab on bringing the implementation of these forward by a year, because they will be of major advantage in terms of safety. As Mr Harbour and the Commissioner have pointed out, simplification is part of this proposal and that is very important. Finally, I would draw attention to what we have done in terms of demanding greater emphasis, in road services, on reducing noise. This is because road traffic noise is a cause of stress, and stress is a cause of ill health and, indeed, of fatalities, and it is therefore important to address that issue.

– Mr President, I welcome this report, with just one or two small reservations. We have heard from my colleague, Mrs Gill, how important small businesses are to the economy and how they are bearing the brunt of the difficulties at the moment. The trouble is that the European Union is geared entirely for big businesses, whether it is about legislation, access to markets or funding. We often talk about better regulation, but what we really need is proportionality. We have to ensure that our legislation is proportional to the problems we are dealing with, and particularly in the IPPC, which we have talked about today. It is really about big business, not about small businesses, and we should reflect that. I welcome initiatives like JASMINE, which I think are moving us in the right direction, but we need to think in terms of funding, market access and legislation and about the specific needs of small business. Let me make one particular plea: we have a single market but we do not have a single Community patent. We have been at this for years and years now, and it really is a disgrace that we cannot sort out this problem. It could, by itself, be the biggest help for businesses in the European Union. Let us have some action.

 Madam President, I was interested that the Czech President-in-Office said that the opposition is trying to torpedo the Czech presidency because, from where I sit, the Czech President is doing a very good job all on his own of torpedoing the Czech presidency. I notice the Czech presidency states that it is doing all it can to enlarge the European Union and to admit Croatia. If it is doing all it can, why can it not ratify the Treaty of Lisbon? After all, the Czech presidency agreed to it and, therefore, should fulfil its obligations. We must be honest: it is not a great start to a presidency. The Czech President describes the climate change package as a silly luxury. The Czech Finance Minister describes the economic recovery plan as being reminiscent of the Communist era. We have a so-called work of art – which has given offence to everybody, but particularly the Bulgarians – and the first statement on the Gaza crisis had to be withdrawn several hours later. What we need at the moment is leadership, and what I have seen so far has taught me that the sooner we get a full-time president of the Council the better, because it is only coherent European action that will deliver security to Europe, will deliver world influence and deliver economic recovery. So let us have some leadership. (The President cut off the speaker.)

 Mr President, rather like Mr Schulz, I was concerned at the beginning of this presidency at the slowness to react to the looming financial crisis. I think Europe as a whole was guilty of complacency in thinking that this was not our problem, but an American problem. However, since that financial tsunami has hit us, I welcome the response we have had; I welcome the leadership we have had from my own Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, and from President Sarkozy. What we have learned is that Europe stands or falls together. If we act individually we are lost, and events have proved that. We are in a situation we have never been in before, and that is why I welcome the dynamic leadership we have had, in contrast with Mr Kirkhope’s party, whose members, like rabbits paralysed in the headlights, think that doing nothing is the only solution to our great crisis. I note that President Sarkozy talked about ‘our friends, the Americans’. The West as a whole faces a huge crisis. We can only come out of it if we make working together a priority. So we must emphasise the importance of Europe’s working with the new administration in January, so that we have a united front to the great challenges such as climate change and the financial crisis.

In particular, the EPLP does not support subsidising the production of tobacco; bullfighting; new funds for dairy, sheep and goats and funds for publicising the CAP. British Labour MEPs welcome any opportunity to help small and medium enterprises, as they are the backbone of our economy, providing the majority of jobs in the EU.

 – Mr President, I share in the delight of my friend and colleague, Ms Gill, that we are closing loopholes in this directive. Timeshare is a big industry, but it also can be a big scam. For example, I have been dealing with a company called the European Timeshare Owners Organisation, which operates in Spain – but conveniently from an address in Gibraltar – and constituents have told me that they were approached by this company which offered to resell their timeshare. When they went to Spain at great expense, they found there was nobody to buy their timeshare, but this company wanting to sell them other timeshares. I have been trying to get in touch with this company for several weeks and only finally this week managed to do so, because, miraculously, the phone numbers they give do not have people at the other end to answer – and they do not seem to respond to letters either. I hope that we will start now to crack down on organisations like the European Timeshare Owners Organisation, because they give timeshare a bad name and, frankly, they damage the image of the Spanish holiday industry, which I know you care so much about.

 Mr President, I presume that the leader of the UK Independence Party’s obsession with fraudsters is because of his own party’s intimate relationship with fraud and fraudsters. To return to the main point of the debate: clearly the Lisbon Treaty cannot come into force on 1 January as we hoped. We have to wait for the Irish Government to tell us how they think we should proceed. But meanwhile other states should exercise their sovereign right to ratify this Treaty. My own Member State will finish its ratification today in accordance with its long-standing and widely respected parliamentary tradition. Meanwhile globalisation continues apace and with it the insecurity that it generates, which we saw a lot of evidence of in the Irish referendum. The EU is a political process designed to deal with those issues so that is what we should be doing: looking at the Millennium Development Goals, at climate change, at migration. What action? That is why I am going to avoid too much introverted institutional navel-gazing and think about action to improve the lot of our citizens. I have one question though for the Slovenian presidency: could you tell me what are the implications of the Irish vote for Croatia’s accession to the European Union?

 Mr President, I welcome the recognition by both the Council and the Commission recently that climate change is not just an environment policy but also a security and humanitarian policy. There is nothing new in that of course. The Stern report indicated that some 200 million people could be displaced by climate change, creating huge migratory pressures. It is for that reason that we should always bear in mind that global warming is actually the poor suffering the consequences of the actions of the rich. I would hope that in our discussion on climate change we can tie our climate change objectives to our development policy objectives. We cannot act in isolation in this area. Of course the poor within the European Union also suffer. That is why any policy on energy has to ensure that Member States have a policy on energy poverty because too many people are suffering because of the rise in energy prices. We need to address that. But most importantly in this summit, we have to ensure that we have action rather than simply words. The Commission set out a programme in 2007. Two thirds of that has reached the light of day. Where is the other third? Member States commit themselves to targets which they do not reach. We have to focus on action. I also welcome the work being done on better regulation and the help for small businesses. However, we must put much more emphasis on looking at transposition and evaluating how legislation has been implemented and if it has achieved what we have set out to achieve. If it does not achieve what is required, there is no point in having the legislation in the first place.

 Mr President, the Committee on Legal Affairs supports the CARS 21 initiative, which we believe was an exemplary example of stakeholder involvement. We say yes to the integrated approach, which we believe is fundamental to the success of this initiative. But, like Mr Harbour, I would raise the question about Member States’ commitment, given their unilateral desire on occasion to legislate or implement fiscal regimes which undermine the integrated approach. Yes to simplification, replacing 38 directives with UN regulations – as long as we are not seen as abdicating our right to legislate should we need to – and yes to the development of technologically driven solutions such as ECOR. But I would hope that the Commission could take more action, as Ms Mann has suggested, on intellectual property rights, particularly in relation to China. We would like to see a proper implementation of the Regulation on Motor Vehicle Distribution in the EU and we believe it is fundamental to address non-harmonised implementation, the End-of-Life Vehicles Directive. We have to improve cross-border inspections of vehicles and cross-border enforcement of traffic rules in other Member States, because otherwise the whole situation becomes very disparate. But, like Mr Turmes, I believe that what we should be looking for is a framework which extends to 2020 and beyond.

I support a competitive European market for spare parts. This will help drive down costs for consumers and boost business for small and medium enterprises. As a result, I support the Commission proposal, which would open spare parts markets to competition. As such, I am unable to support amendments which increase the time allowed for the market to be liberalised for up to 8 years. This would slow the progress of achieving our goal of a competitive market for spare parts.

 Madam President, hopefully, and I say hopefully, the Lisbon Treaty is going to represent the closing of a chapter in the history of the European Union, the chapter of the growth of the EU, the consolidation and peace and stability on the continent, the dismantling of trade and economic barriers between Member States, and the institutional development which was needed to achieve those things. Now, though, we need to open a new chapter, a chapter of looking outwards, of rising to the challenges of globalisation. We need a global Europe which sets a completely new agenda for globalisation, resting on the principles of openness, fairness and the importance of cooperation between Member States. We know what the challenges are – they have been well explored in this debate. Climate change and migration are, in my view, the two biggest, but we need to maintain high growth and jobs. We need to have a modern effective social agenda. We need to deal with terrorism and crime and promoting security beyond our borders and dealing with poverty. And indeed, as Ms Bowles has said, we do have policies towards those. But let us be frank: progress has been slow, it has been uneven and it has not always been very effective. If we really are to deal with globalisation, we need a radical and fundamental shift, not only in our policies but in our entire thinking in the European Union. We have to focus now simply on action and delivery. We have to ensure that Member States fulfil their promises, because we have an EU framework. What we do not have are 27 Member States that all do as they say they are going to do, and our focus must now be on delivering on promises and fulfilling all the potential that the EU has.

 Mr President, I welcome the Commissioner’s remarks, particularly as commitment to better regulation involves clear team work of regulators and those people affected working together to develop a piece of legislation. I also welcome that he is clear that there have to be economic objectives and that has to reflect market needs. Looking through the Commission’s own summary of this consultation on company law, I notice that less than half the respondents call for the adoption of a European private company statute. That seems to be slightly at odds with some of the statements we have heard so far, so perhaps he could clarify exactly what those responses were. I also notice that most people wanted a codification and consolidation of existing company law, rather than anything going further. Clearly, he has got quite a difficult balancing act. What I want to know is: to what extent have we identified so far a clear need for legislation at a European level, as opposed to a domestic one? I suspect that, in some cases, the pressure is coming from those who have very complex domestic laws and who want a European law to simplify matters. However, the problem is we have a European law on top of domestic laws and we often find it makes life much more complicated. Surely, the whole object of this exercise is simplification and clarification.
 Gary Titley,  
on behalf of the PSE Group
. –
 Madam President, I wish to begin by making three statements to set the context of this debate. Firstly, we must not forget that one person’s red tape is another person’s vital piece of legislation. Secondly, we should not forget, as Commissioner Verheugen has said in the past, that 50% of the administrative burden relating to EU legislation is added by Member States. Finally, the most important thing is that the European Union is itself a simplification process, because by having one set of rules instead of 27 we have cut business costs enormously in comparison to what life was like before many European Union laws were passed. Having said that, legislation has to be clear, easy to understand and to enforce, and adaptable to changing circumstances. That has not always been the case in the past, and sometimes one wondered whether the overall effort of producing and enforcing a piece of legislation did not outweigh in some ways the benefits to be derived from it. That is why I would support what the Commission has been trying to do in its drive for better regulation and simplification, and in particular the establishment of an impact assessment board. It is important that all the institutions realise their role in this. It is all very well for Parliament or the Council to pontificate about better regulation, so long as, when it comes to amendments, we ourselves look at the impact of those amendments. Parliament also has a responsibility to look at existing legislation and analyse it in depth to see whether it has had the effect it wanted. We tend to agonise for months over this or that amendment, but often put no effort into finding out whether the legislation has had its desired effect. I would hope therefore that we, as a Parliament, might step up our own efforts to participate in this process.

 Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Schnellhardt on his patience above all else. The spirit industry is extremely important to us, creating jobs, status, export and tax revenue. Therefore it has been important to update the 1989-1990 regulations, to bring greater clarity and greater legal certainty to improve the definition of the main spirit drinks and to resolve any problems with spirits with a quasi-geographical indication status. What we now have is a proper registration system for geographical indication, which is important, and I am glad we have got rid of the three categories of spirits. We have now ended up with something that is compatible with the WTO and TRIPS, which ensures smooth running in the internal market, prevents fraud and counterfeiting, protects the consumer and does not underplay and undermine solid, long-established industries, such as the second biggest vodka producer in Europe – the United Kingdom – where in Scotland vodka is such an important industry. That is why we must support these proposals. I think the Commission proposal was better than the compromise, but it is important to move forward with the compromise on vodka, bearing in mind geographical indications will protect forever Polish vodka, Finnish vodka, Swedish vodka, Lithuanian vodka, and so on.

 Mr President, 18 days ago a 3-year-old girl, Madeleine McCann, of British parents, was abducted from her hotel in Portugal. So far, despite extensive police searches, she has not been found. There has been extensive coverage of this in the United Kingdom, Portugal and Spain, but I am not sure that there has been coverage in other Member States. The suspicion is that she has been abducted and transported out of Portugal. Firstly, I hope I speak on behalf of this House in expressing our sympathy to the family, but I would also ask that all national authorities give publicity to this case. As we know, there is a serious danger of there being trafficking in minors and we would hope this is not the case in Madeleine’s case, but we would urge all national authorities to be on the alert to see if we can possibly find this girl before anything serious happens to her.

 Mr President, the Committee on Legal Affairs would like to remind colleagues that one thing that underpins the European Union is the rule of law. It is the rule of law which has delivered the single market, with all its advantages and some disadvantages, having regard, of course, for the principle of subsidiarity. We recognise that there are items of purely sporting interest, nothing to do with economic interest, which belong to the sporting bodies. We also recognise that there is a difficult dividing line, which is why we welcome the British Presidency’s initiative in setting up the independent review. But we would remind colleagues that there are a wide variety of instruments in the EU Treaties that could be use to protect young players, to deal with players’ agents, to provide for group exemptions to competition law, and to interpret whether sporting organisations provide services of general economic interest under Article 86 of the EU Treaty. So there is plenty provision for us to take action. Clearly, what we all want is for football to be successful, for teams to thrive – we support success – and we also want to ensure that clubs like Accrington Stanley are well-catered for and their supporters are able to support them. So I would hope that out of this independent review we can develop a sensible, coherent response.

 Mr President, you will recall that I recently wrote you a letter. Thank you for the speed and the positive nature of your response. One of the items I raised with you was the fact that, in view particularly of the summit that has just taken place and the emphasis on climate change, it is important that the European Parliament set an example and set out a strategy for itself to be carbon neutral, because it is difficult for us to tell other people how to behave if we do not have our own house in order. I was delighted to read in your response that the new Secretary-General will be drawing up a proposal to make Parliament carbon neutral. I should like to urge that he proceed with all possible speed to reinforce the success of the spring Council meeting on climate change and, in particular, that he look at the specific difficulties we have in relation to the three places of work and how we can become carbon neutral in that context.
 Gary Titley (PSE
). –  
Mr President, I think it would be very difficult to underestimate the importance of this Spring Summit, because it comes before the Berlin Declaration, which is going to explain how and why the European Union is relevant to the world, in essence relaunching the European Union. It comes before further reflection on future reform of the European Union itself. So I would like to echo what Commissioner Wallström said, i.e. that this Spring Council has got to show how the European Union can deliver for its citizens, because before you talk about fine institutional matters you have got to talk about how you deliver. I think if we fail to deliver action at this summit, this is going to undermine all the plans of the German Presidency. I think we need to deliver action, as has been said, on completing the internal market. There are simply too many gaps which affect ordinary citizens who want to travel and to work in other Member States – even things like registering a motor vehicle in a number of Member States. We have to deliver on the subject of better regulation in order to improve the rights of consumers and improve the business atmosphere. We have to carry through a commitment to cut the cost of red tape by 25%. In particular we have got to follow through on the ten fast-track practical proposals presented by the Commission. On action and energy, we have to fulfil existing agreements on energy liberalisation. We have to have a competitive energy market and that involves unbundling and strengthening the power of regulators. I would hope the German Government, as opposed to the German Presidency, will be taking a lead in this area. We need to take action on climate change. We have to take a global lead but we can only do that if we have action to reduce our own emissions, to cut our use of carbon and to make the emissions trading scheme much more effective and much more watertight.

The report is positive in the fact that it highlights the growing disparity in road safety between certain Member States. It also pushes for increased cooperation amongst stakeholders and the sharing of best practice. However, attempts to introduce road safety initiatives such as Daytime Running Lights (DRLs) and harmonised blood alcohol limits will do little to improve EU road safety. Evidence suggests that DRLs will place motorcyclists and pedestrians at greater risk. Rather than alter blood alcohol limits, Member States should focus on enforcing the laws already in place and effectively penalising offenders. As such we have decided to abstain on this report.

 Mr President, may I begin by congratulating you on your elevation. I hope you will enjoy your two and a half years in the Chair and, of course, give me plenty of speaking time! This debate is a bit like the political equivalent of Nero fiddling while Rome burns. We talk a lot about encouraging a switch of people and goods from road to rail, and yet leave in place huge obstacles to operation of the railways. No wonder passenger numbers and goods figures are falling. We must have a European single market in railways, rather than a series of totally incompatible national markets. Without it, the railways are at a handicap, particularly in relation to air travel. I can get a plane ticket from Manchester to Prague on my computer at the click of a button, but just try getting a train ticket from Manchester to Prague. It is impossible. We must have liberalisation of the railways now. We must open up the market now. Of course we have to have safeguards. I would not recommend anybody to follow the experience of the United Kingdom. The privatisation – as opposed to liberalisation – there was a complete disaster. However, under the current government, the UK has put things right and now has the highest investment in railways anywhere, the largest increase in passenger numbers and also has actually seen more kilometres of railway line being built. Nobody needs this investment more than the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Why are we delaying when they are desperate for investment? We need that investment in order to put a proper European railway market into operation. We also need to ensure that passengers are properly treated. I receive many complaints from people with reduced mobility who find it very difficult to travel by rail across Europe. We need standards on this, and we need proper ticketing so that you can press a button in Manchester and get a ticket to wherever you want to go. What is more, we need to move faster than is being proposed by the European Commission and the Council.

 Mr President, I congratulate Ewa Hedkvist Pedersen on this last report for the European Parliament. It is an excellent report, although it has been rather bombarded by some weird and wonderful amendments. We do not need elaborate schemes. We simply need safer roads, safer drivers and safer vehicles and, most importantly, we need action and enforcement. When I was Parliament’s rapporteur on eCall, for example, the industry had made progress but the governments were not making progress. That is why I say we need action. However, I have two reservations. Firstly, on the issue of daytime running lights, I do not believe that there will be any overall net gain in road safety because, as cars become visible, other users, particularly motorcyclists, become less visible. Daytime running lights will mean more fuel usage, and that is bad from a climate change point of view. It is a matter of subsidiarity. The situation in Spain during the day is not the same as the situation in Sweden. I think this should be left to Member States. Secondly, I do not believe in harmonised blood alcohol limits, simply because you can have all the standards in the world, but they are no use unless you have enforcement. We in the UK have perhaps a more generous blood alcohol limit, but we have the lowest level of drink driving. Why? Because enforcement is rigid and the penalties are very severe. That is where we should be putting the emphasis.
 Gary Titley (PSE

 Mr President, I wish to congratulate the President-in-Office on the way in which, with characteristic Finnish honesty but uncharacteristic Presidency bluntness, he has described the difficulties in the Council of getting Member States to agree on things, and how impossible it is to make progress in certain areas where we have unanimity. It is very important that the EU delivers in areas like justice and home affairs and immigration policy, and we must ensure that we make progress for the benefit of our citizens. I would hope that in areas where we have almost reached agreement, such as prisoner transfers and the possibility of a rapid response instrument for emergencies, we will be able to carry these through in a summit. We can also apply the same principle to Member States in other areas as the Commission did yesterday in taking action about opening up energy markets and on economic reform. Let us not lose sight of the importance of getting Member States to deliver on what they promised to do on the whole Lisbon Strategy. However, enlargement is clearly the big issue. We seem to have avoided a train crash with Turkey, but that does not guarantee the train is not going to come grinding to a halt, because if that train does come to a halt, the consequences will be very severe not only for the European Union but also for the Balkans. We must move ahead with enlargement. We must not become distracted by things like absorption capacity, because we all know that if Norway wanted to join, nobody would want to talk about absorption capacity. It is a code word for something else. Let us make progress on enlargement; let us keep the show on the road.

 Mr President, my assistant recently discovered a website which advertises quite openly that if you have been banned for driving in one country they will find, for a fee, a driving licence somewhere else. That is clearly unacceptable in modern society, just as it is completely unacceptable that people who commit serious offences in one country can avoid being penalised in another country. This proposal will gradually end that situation, but I regret that it will take so long, and I hope the process can be speeded up. This proposal brings simplicity and transparency and cuts red tape, although I notice that Mr Nattrass has not bothered to stay to hear that observation. It is, in fact, a key element in better regulation. The original proposal was much more bureaucratic, and we in Parliament have done a good job of making it much simpler. It will improve road safety and combat fraud. I particularly welcome something nobody else has mentioned yet: the emphasis in the report on the competences of driving examiners. We need to raise the general level of driver training throughout the European Union. I am not happy with the motorcycle proposals: they are unnecessarily complex and do not give enough emphasis to training at the very earliest stages and the requirement for compulsory testing. However, I recognise that there is no real support for this either in Parliament or the Council, so I must concede defeat. Contrary to some of the scare stories some of my colleagues have spread, there is very little in this proposal that differs from existing UK tradition and practice.

 I should like to thank the Commissioner for that very thorough and clear answer. However, it is a fact that people still complain about over-booking. My other concern is that there are still airline companies which are ignoring this Regulation on Air Passengers’ Rights and are telling their customers that it does not apply to them. Is the Commission going to get tough on some of these operators who seem to think they can operate outside the law and outside EU regulations?

 Mr President, I welcome the Finnish Presidency, which I assume will be carried out with the usual Finnish efficiency and professionalism. Finland has a lot to teach us, particularly in relation to the importance of investment in high-quality education and also how to balance economic efficiency and social justice. I welcome the President-in-Office’s speech, which boils down to three points. There are three priorities for the Council at the moment: action, action and action. Citizens do not love processes, they love outcomes, and we will be judged by our outcomes. On Friday we, in the United Kingdom, will mark the anniversary of the horrific events of 7 July 2005, when 52 of our citizens were blown up in a terrorist attack. I well remember the sympathy and solidarity that I received from my colleagues here in the European Parliament at that time last year, and that which we showed to our Spanish colleagues the year before at the time of the Madrid bombings. Our citizens expect Europe to make them secure. We had another event on 21 July, which fortunately was unsuccessful. However, because of the European Arrest Warrant one of the suspects was brought back to the United Kingdom from Italy in a matter of weeks. That is precisely the sort of action our citizens want to see. We need to deliver on better security cooperation. We also need to deliver on better security as a whole. We still have great shortfalls in our crisis management capabilities. That is because Member States say they will do something and then do not deliver. Let us make delivery by Member States our absolute priority. Similarly, on migration policy, let us have a fair, effective policy that links development and migration policy, one that makes our borders much more secure. Let us, on energy, recognise that we have a single market. Let us follow through on that logic. Let us drive forward the whole single market agenda, which is still too incomplete. I welcome your commitment to better regulation, President-in-Office, but as you have heard today the biggest gain in better regulation will be to stop the European Parliament wandering around Europe, so that we can better focus on legislation.

 Madam President, I want you to imagine a scene: it is a dark and stormy night, it is cold, wet and windy, and you are driving along unfamiliar roads – possibly even lost – when, all of a sudden, something is in your way. You are forced to swerve and you hit a tree, knocking yourself unconscious. At that point, a relatively minor accident could become very serious: you could be in shock, you could develop hypothermia, you could have bleeding which if not stemmed could be fatal. If you are not knocked unconscious, do you know where you are? Do you know anything about the emergency 112 number? Indeed, do you have a mobile phone or is your battery flat? In all of those circumstances a relatively minor accident could be lethal. That is because of what is known as the golden hour principle: if you receive treatment within the first hour you are more likely not only to have your life saved but also to have a reduction in the intensity of injuries. That is why we need eCall, which is a pan-European in-vehicle emergency call system based on the 112 emergency number. If you have an accident, a device within the vehicle will be triggered by the airbag going off, by a sudden rise in temperature in the car, by the car overturning or by sudden deceleration. When it is triggered it will send data – such as the time, location and identification of the vehicle – to a public safety answering point, which will then alert the emergency services who will come rushing to your aid. This device could also be triggered manually and have a voice call so you could communicate with the emergency services. I know there are some issues about privacy, but let us be clear that this system works only when it is triggered in an accident and is not a device for tracing where you are when you are driving. This came out of the Emerge project, which was funded by the Fifth Framework Programme, and I should emphasise that much of the technology is here now and some cars already have it. However, there is no common platform. We need this because 40 000 people are killed on our roads every year and 1.6 million people are injured. The cost is EUR 160 billion, or 2% of the EU’s GDP. We hope to halve the number of deaths by 2010. Thus eCall is the first building block in the Commission’s Intelligent Car Initiative. Most measures are designed to stop accidents happening, but accidents will inevitably happen and it is in those circumstances that we need eCall. Research has shown that it will reduce the response time in rural areas by 50% and in urban areas by up to 40%. That will save 2500 lives, reduce serious injuries by 15% and so cut road-traffic accident bills by EUR 22 billion a year. It will also cut accident-related congestion by about another EUR 4 billion a year. Therefore, it is a great idea. Unfortunately, it is a very complicated idea, because a huge range of stakeholders need to come together – the car industry, the telecoms industry, emergency services, public authorities – to get this introduced on a coherent basis on a common platform. That is why the eCall Driving Group was set up. It has produced a Memorandum of Understanding, which binds stakeholders to implement equal and agreed principles and an agreed timetable whereby we will have full-scale tests in 2007, PSAPs will be upgraded by the end of 2007 and we will introduce this in all new vehicles in 2009. We have over 50 signatures, but unfortunately only seven are from Member States and ironically one is from a non-Member State – Switzerland. If there is no commitment to this scheme from the public authorities it will not happen, because the industry cannot justify the research without the commitment of public authorities. What is needed? We need to publicise 112 as a lot of people do not know about it. This system requires enhanced 112, which involves caller location. Member States have an obligation to have it under the 2002 directive, but many of them do not. We need to have PSAPs upgraded to deal with this. Many countries are doing that at the moment, but there is still a long way to go. This will cost money: the device in the car will cost anything from EUR 150 to EUR 450, but, if done properly, the price will come down. We need the PSAPs to be upgraded. This will cost about EUR 4.5 billion a year. However, set against savings of EUR 26 billion, there is a huge cost benefit to this device. My message to you is quite simple: this is a great device, it will save lives, it will save money, but we need the public authorities to get their finger out and get on with this, because they are the ones who are dragging us back.

 Mr President, this week we have debated the issue of better regulation. One of the biggest obstacles to better regulation is our calendar of meetings. We have 12 weeks a year of plenary sittings here in Strasbourg. Frequently there is insufficient business for those plenaries, so we pad out the agenda. As a result of that, the committee meetings are constantly under pressure and those codecision committees are now unable to legislate effectively. We need to have a debate about how we organise our work. This calendar has been introduced without any such debate. We would like to postpone the vote on this calendar to the next plenary session, so that those of us who have tabled this motion can debate our working methods, that is to say, how we can improve regulation in the European Parliament and how we can better use the EUR 300 million it costs us to be here for the pursuit of better regulation. This is a huge use of taxpayers’ money which undermines the work of this Parliament. (Applause)

.  This report on the free movement of workers identifies the improved profitability and competitiveness of businesses in Ireland, Sweden and the UK – countries that have opened their labour markets. The British experience has shown that the UK was right to take the bold step of opening up its labour market. British growth and productivity rates have proven that fears about opening EU labour markets are unfounded. A single market cannot function properly whilst labour markets remain protected and sealed off. The UK has shown how free labour markets, coupled with proper social protection, can boost a prosperous economy. This has led to the longest period of sustained economic growth in living memory in the UK. The European Parliamentary Labour Party believes that European labour markets should be open, like the UK's, and should not fear tides of immigration.

 Mr President, there are three priorities for the spring summit – action, action, action: action on the fact that over a third of our working-age population is economically inactive, which is a disgrace. You cannot embrace globalisation while abandoning large numbers of our citizens. We need proactive labour markets. We need to take action on the implementation of legislation: too many Member States are not implementing legislation they have agreed to and, frankly, that is a situation which is unacceptable. Finally, 13 years after creating the single market, it is time we accepted that there is a European single market which demands European champions, not national champions. So, let us see less of the talk of this summit and instead see many more plans for concrete action from Member States. Deliver, do not talk!

We believe firmly in the right to freedom of expression balanced by the right of journalists and others to use this power responsibly. The motion fails to balance clearly these competing aims and to convey accurately the context in which the current controversy has emerged. The EPLP is in contact with those across the UK who have expressed concerns to us.

 Mr President, I wish to begin by apologising to the House for the considerable embarrassment of my countryman, Mr Nattrass, who clearly lacks the intellectual capacity to discuss the correct report. He obviously thought we were talking about the Eurovignette. It is very embarrassing. We know UKIP is 20 years out of date, and it shows in this Chamber. Firstly, tiredness kills. If we look at the demands on drivers these days with congestion and the just-in-time culture, we realise what strain there is on drivers. That is why this measure is a very important step forward for road safety. Key to it are digital tachographs, and key to the success of that was having a much more realistic deadline than the original one. That allows us to have proper monitoring, and this is a much simpler regulation than previous ones. That has to be the key to success. I am delighted that Parliament has been able to increase the number of checks, but it is all about monitoring, implementation and enforcement. We must ensure that all Member States carry out those checks and we need coordination between the enforcement authorities in all Member States. I hope the Commission will be vigorous in monitoring progress there. Member States could do more than simply apply laws. There are insufficient rest areas for drivers; there are insufficient incentives for training. I compliment the work done by Scania through its Driver of the Year competition to encourage training. Working time is clearly part and parcel of this process and needs to be monitored. I am horrified to learn that ten Member States have not yet implemented that. We hope the Commission will take greater action. Let us emphasise constantly the importance of consistent implementation. It is the Commission’s job to ensure that Member States are doing their job.

 Mr President, it is obviously important we are having this debate today, because on 1 January, the latest step down to 50 grams for the reserve sector took place, and we are awaiting the Commission’s study – hopefully to be published in the summer – on accomplishing the internal market by 2009. There are great challenges facing the postal sector, but also great opportunities. Post has to keep up with developments elsewhere, not least the switch from consumer-to-consumer business to business and consumer, but also as regards the single market. It is a condemnation of the European Union that 13 years after the completion of the single market, there are huge obstacles to cross-border postal activity, the work of the expanding home-shopping market and indeed for newspaper and magazine publishers. In order for this process to work properly, we have to have transparency, clarity, certainty and the clear involvement of postal customers and consumers. We recognise of course that each postal market is unique, but that cannot excuse serious regulatory asymmetry leading to serious market distortions. We have to have a structure whereby national regulatory authorities must work together. We have to have greater clarity and transparency in the authorisation process and this is one area on which the Commission must focus. We need Member States to adopt and implement the quality of service standards devised by CEN so that we can compare like with like. We must ensure that postal customers, small as well as large, are involved in this whole process. Ultimately the success or failure of this venture will depend on us being able to satisfy people that our little old mothers living in isolated places are still going to get a universal service. Answer that and this process will be successful.

I know I speak not only for the whole of my delegation but also for the whole European Parliament, because Phillip’s fair-minded and judicious approach to politics won him friends throughout this Chamber. My delegation has placed at the entrance to the Chamber a book of condolence, in which we hope colleagues throughout Parliament will feel free to put their memories of Phillip. We will be presenting this book of condolence to his family at his memorial service, which will take place at Derby Cathedral on 29 January. My office will provide details to any Members who wish to attend. (Applause)

 Mr President, I would like to begin by apologising to the Presidency. When it agreed to open negotiations with Croatia, I confess I suspected that a rather grubby deal had been done to overcome Austria’s objections to Turkey. I was wrong. We now know that Croatia was cooperating very closely with The Hague and providing information which led to the very significant and important arrest of General Gotovina and I congratulate the Presidency on that progress. If it is not too much of a shock for Mr Alexander, I would also like to congratulate the Presidency on its cooperation with the Parliament, which has led to huge progress on some very difficult dossiers, noticeably REACH, the long-running Eurovignette saga, and hopefully data retention. I also understand the Presidency is making great strides, or trying to make great strides, in introducing transparency to the Council and I would hope Mr Alexander could tell us what progress he has made on that. Nonetheless there is still a lack of transparency in the Council, so I wonder whether he could just lift the veil momentarily by answering some questions. Which net payers, apart from the UK, are prepared to pay more money to solve the budget problem? Which net recipients are prepared to receive less in order to solve the budget problem? Which net recipients from old Europe are prepared to receive less in order to show solidarity to new Europe? How many countries in the Council advocate spending programmes so long as they do not have to pay for them? Which of the main beneficiaries of the CAP are arguing for further reform? Which CAP beneficiaries are prepared, like the UK Government, to make public the information about where the money goes? By that I mean information that shows that the benefit is felt not by farmers but by multinational processors of food and big landowners. Which finance ministers are prepared to sign an annual statement of assurance of their accounts, which will put an end to the annual saga of us failing to sign off the accounts because of the failure of Member States to control their accounts? Which Member States come to the Council meeting and ask not what Europe can do for them, but what they can do for Europe?

 Mr President, recently a terrorist suspect wanted by the British Government was arrested and extradited from Rome in a matter of weeks. This was a direct result of the European arrest warrant; previously it could have taken years. This is just one example of the positive benefits the European Union brings to its citizens. Each citizen has benefited from the single market by some EUR 6 000 a head in increased output. It is possible, if you wish, to swim in the sea off Blackpool in my region because of European Union laws that have improved the environment. Those are positive benefits for our citizens. We need to do more to shout those positive benefits. I welcome the papers that were presented at Hampton Court, because they deal with how the European Union can bring added value to our citizens, particularly in the area of the energy markets where we have a crisis waiting to happen. However, we have to ensure that there is follow-up on these matters. One of the difficulties with the Lisbon Agenda in particular is that Member States themselves promise to deliver but do not. I would hope that out of the Hampton Court discussions came a clarification of the role of Member States and the important role of the European Commission in ensuring that Member States carry out that which they have already agreed. If that were to happen, the European Union could move much further forward without necessarily having any of the grand plans that some people have outlined in this debate. Let us stick to delivering what we agreed to deliver. That will be the key success of the European Union. I congratulate the President-in-Office for the commitment made by this Presidency to Parliament. We are delighted at the extent to which ministers have engaged Parliament and particularly the extent to which the British Home Secretary has ensured that Parliament is involved in taking forward that security agenda. That is one of the most important dimensions of where the European Union is going in future to protect the interests of its citizens. (Applause)

 Mr President, I am sure Mr Blair will be flattered by Mrs Grossetête’s belief that he is ‘super Tony’, able to click his fingers and the whole of Europe will be transformed overnight, and that he is a dictator and therefore able to get the other 24 Member States to do what he wants overnight. I, however, would like to welcome much of the progress made by the Presidency, particularly its involvement with Parliament and the constant attention by ministers to the wishes of Parliament. I welcome the progress that has been made on justice and home affairs and the very personal commitment by the British Home Secretary to involving Parliament on data retention and making this a first-pillar issue, which is a huge step forward for relations between the Council and Parliament. I welcome the progress made on Africa; the progress made on better regulation, particularly continuing the six-Presidency programme in relation to that, and the first commitment of the Presidency to work with the European Commission. I welcome the progress on enlargement, particularly opening negotiations with Turkey. We know that was a very difficult decision, that there are many Member States with genuine concerns, and it is a great credit to the British Foreign Secretary that he was able to keep that process on schedule. It would have been a disaster for Europe if it had faded away. We have opened negotiations with Croatia, and I notice that the British Deputy Prime Minister is there today furthering those negotiations, and we are making progress in the Balkans. Clearly, I welcome what the President-in-Office has said today, particularly about energy policy because, as the acting President will recall, it was something I made reference to at the Labour Party conference. It is our failure to get the single market fully completed that is important, as well as transport infrastructure and energy infrastructure. What is missing in Europe is that we have a delivery deficit. Governments have got to put their money where their mouth is and deliver on their promises. I hope that will happen at the summit. Member States will be made to realise Europe will only progress if they do what they promised to do.

.  The European Parliamentary Labour Party (EPLP) is in favour of this initiative to halve the number of road traffic accidents in the EU by 2010. However, we have several reservations. For example, the UK currently has blood alcohol limits of 0.8mg compared to 0.2mg in Sweden. Despite the divergence between these levels, the two countries have the best road safety record in the EU. If the EU had the same road safety records as these two countries there would be 17 000 fewer road fatalities a year, a reduction of 39% on current levels, going a great way to achieving the 50% reduction in fatalities by 2010. The EPLP believes therefore the emphasis should not be on harmonization but in sharing best practice on enforcement in road safety. Similarly the EPLP does not see the need to harmonize speed limits. This would lead to very peculiar road signs in the UK resulting in bizarre figures when speed limits are converted from Km/h to miles per hour. The EPLP therefore cannot support harmonization of blood alcohol levels and speed limits at this time.

 Does the President-in-Office agree with me that part of the problem is that different countries are proceeding with liberalisation at different rates? The United Kingdom will soon fully liberalise, along with Germany and the Netherlands, which means that 60% of the market will be liberalised. Therefore, the key element will be the Commission's forthcoming report on the final steps towards full liberalisation in 2009, dealing with regulatory authorities, access arrangements, and also the differing treatment of VAT between the reserved and non-reserved sectors, which is a very sensitive issue and needs to be treated with due care.

 Mr President, I would like to welcome the future President-in-Office by quoting Charles Dickens: 'it was the best of times, it was the worst of times, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us'. So it is with the European Union. At the time of our greatest success, the enlargement to 25, we find ourselves cast down by doubts and recriminations. Globalisation has bred insecurity among our citizens, causing some to doubt the European project and to embrace protectionism and isolationism. Yet it is only by coherent European action that we can confront the threats and seize the opportunities of globalisation. Unfortunately, much of what the EU has achieved is now taken for granted by the voters and is regarded, frankly, as 'old hat'. We have to define a modern vision of the European Union and its purpose and relevance; a vision based on concrete outcomes, not processes; a vision based on certain key principles. Firstly, the importance of international partnerships and particularly the most successful partnership of them all, the European Union. We have to recognise that the strength of the EU lies in its supranational institutions which complement and supplement national sovereignty and do not replace it. Secondly, our ability to deliver jobs for our citizens and economic security for their families is central to our continuing success. A successful economy is not an Anglo-Saxon conspiracy, but the key to our survival. The European Union has already done a lot. In recent days we have heard that EU membership costs this country EUR 20 per head, or that country EUR 50 per head. These figures are insignificant compared with the EUR 6 000 per head by which the single market has benefited its citizens through extra growth. But we must do more to harness the knowledge economy by investing in the projects of the future and not the past. Economic efficiency depends on social justice. Prosperity comes from a secure workforce and a society that invests in all its citizens, excluding no-one. We need active labour market policies to help people find and keep work. A third of our working-age population is economically inactive. That figure is a disgrace and stands to the condemnation of the EU and its Member States. Finally, we need an open society where people are free to travel to find work. Such an open society has to be fair and just and not a free ride for the criminals and the terrorists. That is why I particularly welcome the presidency programme on justice and home affairs. Real progress here will show our citizens the benefits of European action. The presidency has to bring Member States together to build a competitive Europe and a Europe capable of giving leadership in the world on issues such as security, climate change and world poverty, the very issues that our citizens are concerned about. I wish you the best of luck.

 Mr President, this Parliament has a very good record as a strong supporter of the peace process in Northern Ireland and, indeed, we were strong backers of the peace fund for Northern Ireland. It is therefore natural that we are concerned that the peace process has been running into difficulty, and the McCartney murder highlights one of the reasons for these difficulties. It is often the case that so-called ‘freedom struggles’ come to be used by criminal elements who use a political cause as a cover for their activities. The McCartney murder has shown that this is happening in Northern Ireland. As we have heard, we have the motiveless murder of an innocent man. That murder has been met by a wall of silence and intimidation little different from that imposed by the Mafia elsewhere. As peace becomes more possible, the more the criminals – the drug runners, the bullies, the extortionists – feel threatened. Frankly, we have reached a crucial point in the peace process. It will not work unless we can break the hold of the gangsters. People have to come to realise that the so-called liberators have become their jailers. This is not a phenomenon restricted purely to the Nationalist side. It is also a phenomenon of which we are aware on the Unionist side. But the issue we are debating today is the murder of Robert McCartney, and we need to keep that issue in the public eye. That is why Sinn Féin, in particular, has to break the wall of silence so that it can set its community free. That is why we would support the use of the budget line for aid to the victims of terrorism in order to provide finance for any civil action taken by the family – money, I hasten to add, not directly for the family but money for a court action. We have to remember that for evil to thrive it only takes good men and women to remain silent. The results of the general election in Northern Ireland last week show that there has been a move in support of those who are opposed to the Good Friday agreement. Time is running out for the peace process and that is why we need to maintain our pressure on those responsible for the murder and cover-up because, unless we resolve this issue, the peace process will fail completely.

 The EPLP welcomes the directive on drivers hours. We believe they will make a major contribution to road safety. We had however reservations about amendment 11 concerning the express delivery industry. While recognising that there may be a problem in some countries we feel that the solution being proposed is unworkable and so could bring the directive into dispute. Accordingly we chose to abstain on that amendment.
 Titley (PSE

 –
 Mr President, I wish to begin by explaining to the House that in his opening remarks my fellow countryman, Mr Nattrass, was confusing the application of the Working Time Directive to the transport industry with this directive. As for the rest of his rantings, they were as incomprehensible to me as they were to everybody else, and I notice that he has not bothered to stay for the rest of the debate. I welcome this directive because, as the Commissioner said, the current proposals are 20 years old. A lot has changed in that time: the abolition of frontiers, the single customs document and better roads, which means you can now drive for long periods of time without any natural interruption. We have an EU of 25 Member States, covering 1.5 million square miles of territory. Therefore it is vital for road safety to have a consistent set of rules across the European Union. It is currently possible to drive for up to 8 hours and 59 minutes with only a 15-minute break. That is unacceptable: tiredness kills, and failing to modernise these proposals would be irresponsible. However, it is important that the legislation be workable and enforceable, not only simply, but also consistently across the EU. Therefore, I welcome Parliament’s proposals to require new vehicles to be fitted with digital tachographs at least from 2006. The Commission is wrong to insist stubbornly on its position, given that only two out of the three potential tachograph suppliers are able to test pre-production models at the moment and are not able to go into full production. It is important that the break periods be simple and easy to understand and that a degree in mathematics is not required to apply them! It is also important to have derogation for essential services delivered in the interests of the public, no matter the nature of the body that delivers those services. I welcome the committee’s proposals on bus and coach services, provided that we can differentiate between the leisure industry and the express-coach industry. However, I still remain to be convinced that certain proposals can be enforced and understood. I recognise the problems with the express-vehicle industry but I am not sure how these proposals can be enforced. I do not think retrofitting digital tachographs is feasible at a cost that most people could afford. I also question whether it would be possible to scrutinise the application of the Working Time Directive in this directive, given that most of the records would be held back at base and not in the lorry concerned.
 Titley (PSE

 Madam President, the core of the Lisbon Strategy has to be jobs. For that, we need active labour market policies to ensure that work is rewarded, the unemployed are helped to get work, and that training and retraining are central to everything we do. The three institutions must develop laws that are easy to understand and enforce and achieve their stated objectives without detrimental side effects. The Commission has to deliver on the areas for which it is responsible, particularly the completion of the internal market. I welcome Mr Barroso’s commitment to the Services Directive. We need it, but it must bring clear benefits and not losses. The starting point of the Services Directive is the screening of Member States’ laws hindering the establishment of services. We do not need a directive to do that. Member States could be doing that now; if they were really committed, they would get on with it. That is the key to the debate on the Lisbon Strategy: are Member States prepared to deliver on their promises? The success of Lisbon rests with you, Mr Barroso. In your relations with Member States, are you going to be a man or a mouse? The answer to that will determine the success of your Commission and of the Lisbon Strategy. (Applause from the PSE Group.)

 Mr President, this House has a very proud record of supporting the peace process in Northern Ireland and of supporting both the Irish and United Kingdom Governments in trying to achieve a lasting solution to the difficulties there. It is the view of both the Irish and UK Governments that the only remaining obstacle to peace is the criminality and paramilitary activity of the IRA, a statement that was greeted with some surprise by IRA circles. However, the events of the last few months – the raid on the Northern Bank, the murder of Robert McCartney, the intimidation of witnesses, the evidence of money laundering – suggest there is extensive criminality, which has now become part and parcel of the Northern Ireland scene. I hope that this Parliament will send a message of support to both governments and tell all parties that criminality has no place whatsoever in political action. Criminality imprisons people, it does not liberate them. (Applause)

 Mr President, I welcome the proposals on driving licences because they represent a huge advance in combating fraud, improving road safety and, most importantly, providing legal certainty for the free movement of people. I especially welcome proposals for higher standards for driving examiners. I did not like the Commission's original proposals because I thought they were too bureaucratic and too complex. They would have done unnecessary damage to certain groups such as caravanners, so I congratulate the rapporteur on producing a simpler and more practical proposal. However, we still need to look further into the question of motorcycles, where national practices and problems vary so much in the Member States. In the UK, our problem is not so much young motorcyclists, but middle aged men – like me – having a mid-life crisis, buying a very powerful motorcycle and then killing themselves. We do not have major problems with young motorcyclists because of our requirements for testing, particularly for the moped test. Other countries have different problems relating to motorcycles and mopeds, so I will argue that the proposal made by the Commission and Parliament for a 'one size fits all' solution will not work. That is why, in conjunction with some of my colleagues in the PSE Group, I have brought forward amendments which will allow for a two-track approach that will respect the principles of progressive access. On one track there will be a practical test for mopeds and then two further stages of progressive access. The other track will have no requirement for practical tests for mopeds, but then three stages of progressive access to the most powerful motorcycles. In both cases, with regard to decisions on direct access to larger machines, it should be at the discretion of Member States to adopt a minimum age anywhere between 21 and 27. I would hope that we can resolve this problem of motorcycles during the vote.
 Titley (PSE

 Mr President, the Lisbon Strategy is so full of grand ideas that we often hear very little – and indeed we have heard very little today – about the simple things, such as improving the quality of our own legislation. The fact is that the European Union could add between two and six per cent to its productivity if its regulatory framework was matched by the best in the world. We should therefore be making it a priority of the Luxembourg presidency to encourage the Commission to put real resources into consultations at an early stage in its proposals and to test whether its competitiveness is appropriate. We also need to spend time looking at existing legislation and seeing whether it has achieved the effect that we asked for. Often we pass legislation, but do not look at what it has actually achieved. Is existing legislation being properly enforced and implemented? It seems to me that, in the European Union of 25, implementation enforcement should get far higher priority than it has up until now. I am glad that the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has taken up my suggestion that we should have an own-initiative report looking precisely at these issues. We have also heard considerable talk today about social Europe, but we have to ensure that social Europe applies to everybody and not simply to those who are in work. Far too many of our citizens are economically inactive, and therefore we should be putting investment into active labour market policies that enable people to get back to work and then policies that support people in order for them to be able to continue in work. If we fail to do that, then we will fail in our Lisbon Strategy. Finally, I urge the Luxembourg presidency to take fresh initiatives in relation to Northern Cyprus so that we can ensure we have effective economic regeneration in that part of the country.

 Mr President, this has been a difficult year. It started for me with a letter bomb exploding in my office. Since then we have had the Madrid bombings. I would hope that at this time of the year our thoughts are with the victims and their families. Outside the European Union there was the tragedy of Beslan, and then today's bus siege in Greece. All this reinforces the fact that the security of our citizens has to be an absolute priority for the EU but, as a number of colleagues have already pointed out, that needs real action. Far too often cooperation among our police, judicial and intelligence services is cooperation in name only. Even a short conversation with anybody who works for Europol would reinforce that. Member States have to deliver on their promises. We need action, not words. The same applies to the economic agenda. Member States have to be called to account by the presidency for the things they have promised to do. In particular, we have to get much more investment into people. We particularly need to deliver on the active labour market policies that Mr Wim Kok has reported on in the past. Too many people in the European Union are inactive. We are far too prepared to pay people to be on the scrap heap. We need much more proactive policies to make work pay, and that includes more childcare and more education and training. We cannot simply write people off as being unemployable. Sound finances are the basis of a good economy and therefore we are right to review the budget. As my colleague Mrs Dührkop Dührkop said, it must not be some sort of mathematical exercise. We have to look at what we do. What is the added value in doing something at European level? What is the best way of getting value for money for our citizens? At the same time, we always have to remember that solidarity is the cornerstone of the European Union. You remove that cornerstone and you undermine the very foundations of the Union. That is why this debate on finances is vital to the future of the European Union.

 Mr President, as we have heard, sport is important for the physical and psychological health of our communities. Football, which is the most popular sport, has a particularly important role in this. The top professional clubs have to lead by example. I have to say I have been very impressed by the work of the professional clubs in my own region in the north-west of England in working to combat exclusion, providing education and providing community leadership. One area of great importance where football clubs have to be active is in combating racism and xenophobia. I was delighted to support the ‘Give racism a red card’ campaign in the United Kingdom. We have to keep up that fight. I regret the scenes we have seen recently in Spain, Italy and elsewhere, which show racism in football on the increase again. We must not condone this. It is important that the new Commission takes initiatives in this field and it is important that we make it clear to football clubs that they must not condone the activity of their own fans. We must not forget, however, that football is a business and it must be allowed to operate in the same way as any other business. Nor must we forget that – frankly – the old transfer system was akin to serfdom and did no service at all to professional footballers. I hope we would not advocate a return to those days but we have to do everything we can to support plans to bring young people into the game and give them more opportunities than they have at the moment. This is why we need to look at the UEFA proposals. But I think that talking about the transfer system is missing the point. The points of key importance in football at the moment are television rights and how they are distributed among television clubs. I would like to hear the Commissioner tell me whether he has any proposals on those rights so the money is more fairly shared between all clubs in football.

 Mr President, my delegation voted in favour of this Commission because all along we believed this was a matter of competence of the Commissioners. We were not happy with the original proposal, although we feel that if Mr Barroso had handled matters better we could have avoided the problems that arose. However, we recognise the difficulties he faced with certain governments. We still have reservations about this Commission and we will be looking to call it to account in the future. We will also hold the Commission to account on the promises President Barroso has made to Parliament today, not least in relation to human rights. I have this morning written to President Borrell, drawing his attention to the disgraceful incidents that took place last night and on Tuesday night in football matches between England and Spain, where there was racist abuse of black English players. I would like the Commission to take an initiative, along the lines of President Barroso's commitment, to deal with the problem of racism in football.

 Mr President, we are undoubtedly at a crucial moment in the development of the Union. Wherever we look, whether it is at the Lisbon Strategy, or the security question and the demand for greater police and judicial cooperation, or even this week's report of the Court of Auditors, we see time and again that Member States that talk about European cooperation do not put it into practice. We cannot continue with a system where Member States pick and choose which bits of decisions they are going to implement and when – and these are decisions they themselves have agreed. This is undermining political support in the European Union. I hope that once we get a full-time President of the Council he or she will regard this as an absolute priority, but in the meantime, in order to keep the Lisbon process on track, the Commission should publish a regular annual scoreboard outlining which Member States have done what and when. We can then judge, name and shame the villains. My colleagues Mr Désir and Mrs van den Berg have set out many of the key elements that we would like to see emphasised in the Lisbon Strategy. I would like to add to that the need for more active labour market policies at national level. We seem very happy to pay out money to keep people on the unemployment scrap heap, to pay people to be written off and marginalised, when we should be investing in helping them back into work. There is not enough emphasis on this, although it was originally in the Kok report and I hope will continue to be. The President-in-Office said that Mr Barroso is to be applauded for drawing the appropriate lessons from last month's debate on the Commission. It is a pity that the same cannot be said about the Dutch presidency. Mrs Kroes undoubtedly has the experience and expertise that will be of benefit to the Commission, but given the concerns that are being raised it is wrong for her to retain the competition portfolio. Whenever she has to adjudicate in a controversial matter, rightly or wrongly her integrity is going to be called into question. The presidency should act in the interests of the European Union, not from narrow national concerns. I fear that the Dutch presidency has failed in this respect.

 Mr President, I speak on behalf of the European Parliamentary Labour Party, which shares many of the aspirations contained in this resolution. However, responsibility for ratification of the Treaty lies with the Member States, in accordance with national law. We do not feel we should be attempting to second-guess the national ratification procedures, and more specifically the date for the referendums, and therefore chose to abstain.

 Mr President, as I believe most speakers agree, following the European elections Europe is on trial. We have to prove ourselves worthy of our citizens' support. We will not do that by talking endlessly about process or by having obscure institutional debates, nor by flowery speeches on the meaning of 'Europe'. Now that we have agreement on a Constitutional Treaty, we have to focus on what Europe does rather than how Europe does it. We have to show how Europe can benefit all our citizens, so I want to see a President of the Commission who is a man of action, not a man of words or fine speeches. The most important priority - and I recognise your commitment to that, Mr Barroso - has to be jobs. We must implement the recommendations of Mr Wim Kok. We must have incentives to create jobs. We must have policies that make work pay and we must spend money on training and retraining our workers, not on simply keeping them out of work. We must incorporate the most marginal into society. Europe needs all its citizens if it is to prosper. We have to invest in our people because we cannot have economic efficiency without social justice. We must also maintain the requirement to ensure that European laws are properly enforced across all Member States. In the last Commission, Commissioner Kinnock did an excellent job on reforming the procedures of the Commission. I would hope that if you are selected as President, Mr Barroso, you will ensure that his work is continued and finished so that we have a modern, accountable Commission that guarantees that we have proper probity at all levels.

 I gave assent to the CARIFORUM EPA and the Côte d’Ivoire Interim EPA in response to the guarantees which Commissioner Ashton gave this week. There has been a change of style and tone since Commissioner Ashton replaced Commissioner Mandelson and now we are receiving clear signals that there is a change of substance too. In the case of the CARIFORUM EPA, the Commissioner gave clear assurances to rapporteur David Martin on his concerns about access to generic medicines, the review clause, and flexibility on how the MFN clause would operate. Before giving assent to the Côte d’Ivoire Agreement, we were given clear and unequivocal confirmation that Côte d’Ivoire would be free to take what they wanted from any other EPA. It is significant that, in the case of the SADC EPA, the revision of a number of contentious clauses was agreed. This includes the protection of infant industries, the possibility to introduce new export taxes to assist industrial development, and export quotas. The decisions I took were not taken lightly, but were taken after careful consideration of the commitment to ensure that EPAs could be a tool for development, and reflect our partnership and mutual respect with the ACP.
 Glenys Kinnock  (PSE
). - 
 Mr President, I can confirm, as others have done, that what we have seen since Cathy Ashton became Commissioner has been a sea change not only in style and tone, but also in vocabulary and now increasingly in substance. I am sure the Commissioner will agree with me and many of us in this room that we still face a formidable task as we try now to build and rebuild trust after years of negotiation which have created enormous amounts of tension and acrimony. In the almost exactly 10 years since Cotonou was signed, we have to remind ourselves what actually was said in the agreements about the trade prospects between ACP and EU. The wording was ‘a new framework for trade which is equivalent to their existing situation and in conformity with WTO rules’. We have to really work much more towards fulfilling those objectives. The policy of concluding separate deals with separate countries has led to serious inconsistencies, and I can confirm to those who do not know the Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA), and who do not have as much contact with parliamentarians in the ACP as I and others in this room have, that it has created really very difficult situations and severely damaged the cohesion that I perceived amongst the ACP in the past. I know that just a few weeks ago the new President of Ghana wrote a letter on behalf of the entire ACP group to the EU Presidency, and he claimed that the EPA process continued to threaten the very existence of some of the regional integration groupings. That is a recent comment by a new president. ACP parliamentarians tell us at every single one of our meetings that there has barely been any engagement with them and little, if any, consultation with them. I would like the Commissioner to tell us what she might think is appropriate in the future on this. I am pleased to see what has happened in the SADC negotiations, but clear commitments on the modification of texts, transition periods for tariff regularisation, safeguards, rules of origin etc. are now up for grabs there with SADC, and hopefully you will confirm that they are options for all the ACP countries who will be continuing to negotiate. Will you tell us please, Commissioner, that you will insist on precise commitments in an EPA to development programmes and that trade liberalisation has to be linked to development benchmarks? If that is the case, how will you do it? Will you see to it that there are legally binding commitments in EPAs to the provision of time-scaled and predictable funding? Commissioner, I think the ACP countries, as you said to us earlier, face a period of slower growth and, for the first time in 25 years, efforts to reduce poverty are being brought to a close. I have just two final quick points, one on the CARIFORUM EPA: it is not a perfect outcome but it still needs safeguards. On Côte d’Ivoire, we need to have the reassurances that Erika Mann asked for and which Mr Van Hecke asked for. That is very important for us. (The President cut off the speaker.)
 Glenys Kinnock  (PSE
). - 
 Mr President, I just want to touch on two issues as far as assent is concerned. I mentioned CARIFORUM. Everyone is feeling very comfortable and optimistic about the CARIFORUM Agreement, but of course there is still a need for certain safeguards. Certainly, at the recent meeting in Guyana, that was made absolutely clear by the President and others in that country, as well as Members of Parliament. The issue of bananas was raised. Baroness Ashton, you said there will be duty-free and quota-free access, which is fine, but the issue is that the agreements that have been signed with Central America, and subsequently with Mercosur and the Andean Pact countries, will reduce the tariffs for them, and nothing we do is going to make it possible for banana producers in the ACP to remain competitive. That is a critical issue, and the agreements have been reached before the ink has even dried on the CARIFORUM Agreement. There are also deep concerns in the Caribbean about the implementation units, which have still not been set up. There are still problems caused by the tensions that have been created between the various countries in the Caribbean. There is also the issue of Haiti. The Donors’ Conference did not produce as satisfactory an outcome as we would have liked, and there are some concerns about whether the EPA can be fully agreed or worked upon as long as Haiti is not involved. As regards Côte d’Ivoire, we would like very clear assurances. It is a country which has experienced a great deal of turmoil, uncertainty and instability over many years, and it is very important that we give assent, but also that we have assurances that you will indicate, in the form of a letter to the negotiators in Côte d’Ivoire and to the Côte d’Ivoire Government, that we remain committed to negotiating in good faith for a decent outcome for the people of that country.
 Glenys Kinnock,  
rapporteur. 
− Mr President, I have to say at the outset that I very much welcome the communication which has been prepared by the Commission. I think it is both comprehensive and ambitious. In my report, Commissioner, I recommend which practical actions, investments and processes are needed if we are to identify that very special place for children in external action. The Commission and the Council communication and conclusions on external action will build upon the external dimension of the EU strategy on the rights of the child. I believe that this is essential work for the European Union. Commissioner, I now look forward very much to seeing actions intended to match the ambition which I see. We need to see substance backing up the rhetoric. That means that resources must be available and, of course – as I am sure you will agree – there must be no backtracking by the European Union Member States on the commitments they have made to fund the Millennium Development Goals (MDG). What we know is that, for most of the world’s two billion children, it is a daily struggle against poverty and vulnerability. As we know, 98% of the children in our world living in extreme poverty are living in developing countries. Furthermore, it is now clear that the impact of the financial crisis will be severely felt by children and young people, for instance when the budgets are cut back on health and education. That is why I think it is right that we make a political commitment, at the highest level, on behalf of and with children. The EU must see in its partnership with the developing countries the opportunity to influence public policy to save children’s lives. Priority actions for children must be promoted when the European Commission negotiates the country strategy papers’ regional and thematic strategies, when they are drawn up, and subsequently when they are reviewed. When there is budget support, including MDG budget contracts, specific objectives and indicators on children must and should be included. I welcome the Commission’s intention to draw up partner national action plans for children. We need assurances that even the most marginalised children – including children with disabilities and orphans – have access to equitable health, welfare and judicial services. I believe there needs to be more and better training of Commission staff – both in Brussels and in delegations – particularly in how they manage the participation of children. We need to see a radical rethink in the European Union about how we ensure that we listen to children and invite children to participate, because we understand that it is children themselves who give lives to the values that are enshrined in international law through the Convention on the Rights of the Child agreed in 1989. It is my experience that the children themselves – the young people – have a wealth of understanding and experience – which we must tap into – on how to tackle poverty and environmental degradation. I welcome the fact that the Commission recognises the importance of consultation during the preparation of the EU strategy on the rights of the child. I also understand that this has been planned for the first half of 2009. Commissioner, would the Commission be able to confirm when this process will begin? I trust there will not be any decision that the public consultation – including with children – will be put on hold until a new Commission and Parliament is in place. Finally, to quote Kofi Annan, ‘There is no trust more sacred than the one the world holds with children. There is no duty more important than ensuring that their rights are respected, that their welfare is protected, that their lives are free from fear and want and that they grow up in peace.’ I think all of us would agree that those are fine objectives.
 Glenys Kinnock  (PSE
). - 
 Mr President, may I at the outset thank the Commissioner very much indeed for her strong and audacious statement, which was very much appreciated. May I also say to Mr Kaczmarek that he should be aware that 19% of maternal deaths are caused by unsafe abortions. Surely this is something that has to be seriously addressed, and there should be no pretence that it can be dealt with in any other way. As we focus on sexual reproductive health rights, we hear from the other side that they have problems with the vocabulary used in this resolution. Apparently they do not even like the word ‘rights’ to be used; they do not like the word ‘services’ to be used. These semantics would not go down very well, I fear, with the thousands upon thousands of grieving motherless children in the developing world, or with those children whose mothers have died in agony because there was no anaesthetic, or with a mother bleeding to death because there is no thread for stitches, or a mother dying because there is not the three cents to buy the magnesium sulphate that would save her from death through haemorrhaging. Tell them that the vocabulary used in this resolution matters. Try telling them that it all costs too much. Those lives are precious and no woman should die giving life. We also have to take into account that some people say the reality is that women have low status and low value, and therefore that we cannot change things. That is absolute nonsense. We have to change things. We have to deal with the kind of misogyny that leads to this suffering and grief. We also demand change from the presidency. We demand action from the presidency on the commitments it has made on the MDGs. We liked the fine words from the presidency of the European Union, but we need to see more action. Meeting MDG 5 means building health systems and ensuring that we address financially the fact that 40% of women globally give birth without any skilled assistance. We look to the presidency to take the lead. For instance, in France between 2006 and 2007, aid to Africa actually declined. France is off track in its commitments, and we need to know that the presidency is going to reflect on the call to action and make the kind of commitments that are needed before 2010. Will the presidency state whether those budgetary commitments will be made? Will it deliver on that promise? We know that there is a need to fight maternal mortality. We know how much it costs. We know too, sadly, what it costs not to do it.
 Glenys Kinnock  (PSE
). – 
 Mr President, I, like others, will have to comment on the fact that the Parliament which was duly elected on 29 March in Zimbabwe has never met and its elected members continue to be harassed and intimidated and suffer from violence. Our resolution calls for a strengthening of sanctions, and of course we will also have to join the calls made at the UN for an international arms embargo and for worldwide travel bans and the freezing of assets. We know who the additional ringleaders that need to be targeted are, we know who the henchmen are, who the bag carriers are. You have Chihuri, the police chief; Shiri, the Air Force head; Gono, the governor of the central bank; Chinamasa, the Justice Minister; Bonyongwe, the chief of Central Intelligence: these are the people that can and must be targeted. Our resolution clearly reflects the pre-conditions laid down by the MDC. All talks must be based on the outcome of the 29 March election which the MDC won and not on the sham run-off in June. It must be a transitional arrangement designed to lead to a new constitution – nobody has mentioned that, and that is what Morgan Tsvangirai is calling for – followed by fresh elections. He says very clearly, and I quote him, ‘I want no power deals and no power sharing’. As Geoffrey van Orden has said, there are no negotiations going on so we should not take heart from the current situation. There has to be an additional mediator. Clearly Mr Mbeki is unable to do it alone and we call for an African Union nominee to be put in place. That nominee must be of equal standing with Mr Mbeki and people like Mr Chissano and Mr Kufuor come to mind at this stage. Finally the unchecked state-sponsored brutality and violence and savagery have to stop, and that is why the international community must act, and act urgently, in the interests of the suffering people of Zimbabwe.
 Glenys Kinnock (PSE
). – 
 Mr President, clearly we need to identify the fact that Kenya is a country where most people are actually subsisting on a couple of dollars a day. There is massive discontent and deprivation; a whole army of discontented people, as we have seen, has been engendered by the situation there, because what they realise is that the gap between the haves and the have-nots in Kenya has widened – and that in the context of that 6% growth in GDP which others have mentioned. Kenya is a low-income, low-resource economy. It is also a country which, tragically, is mired in patronage and in corruption. And what we see is that, as we speak here today, people are storing up food, and people are out on the streets again in Nairobi and in other parts of Kenya. Therefore I would add my voice to those that have said that the EU must suspend budget support to Kenya until a political resolution to the present crisis has been found. Of course, it is unacceptable that that EUR 40.6 million was sent the day after the election criticisms were made. I am very encouraged that Commissioner Michel intimated in our committee on Monday that budget support would be reviewed immediately. I would like to hear some more detail of that. Instead of channelling money through line ministries in Kenya, we must look at ways of doing it through project support, which also ensures that the poor of Kenya are not damaged by such an action. In my view we need to be much clearer about the need to place aid conditionality on good governance, as is clearly stated under the Cotonou Partnership Agreements, and we have not done that. We have, I am afraid, turned a blind eye to many of the serious accusations about corruption in that country. Finally, the perpetrators of those irregular election results that the observers have reported to us must be held to account and must not be allowed to get away with it. I also say that the European Union must play its part in monitoring the mediation process. We have been at the vanguard of asking for these considerations to be made, and I would like the Council and the European Union to be stronger and more consistent in its approach, and make sure that Kofi Annan is given all the support he needs from Europe, and that a new Election Commission can be put in place as soon as possible.
 Glenys Kinnock,  
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development
. −
 Mr President, I would like to say at the outset that the Committee on Development feels very strongly that it is important for the Commission to mainstream children’s rights into all aspects of development policy, seeing this as a means of achieving the Millennium Development Goals. I know that the Commission communication proposes to deal with such issues. I wish to state very clearly that we need a children’s rights approach and need to move away from a common focusing, in this debate so far, on issues such as child-trafficking, abduction and pornography. We need to ensure that we understand we are talking about the rights of children: the rights of children to be consulted; the rights of children to be listened to; and the rights of children to have the respect of adults and not be told by adults what they should be doing. I also very much welcome the fact that the Lisbon Treaty makes reference to children’s rights. We welcome this, because at the moment only animal rights have this kind of legal base in the European Union, and we urgently needed to make this the case for children too. Finally, in the wider world and in Europe itself, we need to see that what we are doing is safeguarding children’s lives and generally enhancing the well-being of all the children in Europe and in the wider world.
 Glenys Kinnock  (PSE
). – 
 Mr President, as Michael Gahler said, clearly the Summit was somewhat overshadowed by the fact that there have been these acrimonious negotiations over economic partnership agreements (EPAs) and a relationship has indeed been soured by these negotiations, as much as the Commissioner and the Council have tried to work for a good partnership. A number of heads of state raised their concerns, including the head of the African Union, Mr Konaré, who said that the Commission was playing African regions one off against the other. The General Affairs Council this week – rather disappointingly, for some of us – did not recommend the flexibility that many of us wanted to see, particularly towards the non-least-developed countries (non-LDCs), although, as I understand it, the UK and the Netherlands in particular were pressing for this to happen. Still that sword of Damocles is poised over the heads of the non-LDCs and they face the consequences, both economic and social, and economic shocks which, for us, ought to be absolutely unthinkable. There are still concerns that have not been addressed on EPAs, on development assistance, on rules of origin and on commitments on the impact of agricultural subsidies. These are all things which the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states, in general, and Africa, in this case, were asking for. It is not enough for the Commission to say that those of us who criticise EPAs are somehow in the pockets of the non-governmental organisations, that the ACP states are misinformed and misled by people and that it is only trying to comply with World Trade Organisation rules. These kinds of argument really do not wash when we see the kind of dangerous situation the non-LDCs are in. I want to say, finally, that our citizens in Europe will not accept any situation where, in 2008, any poor countries are worse off than they are at the moment, and we cannot stand and allow that to happen. We urge the Commission to show flexibility.
 Glenys Kinnock  (PSE
). – 
 Mr President, my Group recommends, as others have said, that, in the interests of credibility and authenticity, Parliament establish a position which reflects what was unanimously agreed at our Joint Parliamentary Assembly and was reflected by the Kigali Declaration. I believe that it is both a moderate and balanced document, which represents lengthy and successful negotiations between all our political groups – including, of course, Mr Sturdy’s political group, as he made reference to it – and with the ACP. I have never encountered the kind of pressure that the ACP has faced during these negotiations, especially as they are threatened with being severely disadvantaged by Europe’s GSP tariff regime. It is that threat that has caused the emergence of new regional groupings, and we will possibly see bilateral agreements, for example with Côte d’Ivoire. These subgroupings which the Commissioner has talked about are not something that we should see as a great achievement, but rather as something that threatens regional integration and is causing massive regional tensions amongst the ACP. Mauritius, Seychelles, Madagascar and Comoros have agreed a subregional EPA; West and Central Africa have put forward no market access offers and so face GSP. South Africa and Namibia, in the SADC, seem to have reached a red line they cannot cross and are being asked to include most-favoured-nation clauses which would oblige them to give the EU any market access they may concede in the future to other countries. The Pacific, of course, is also not experiencing the best of negotiations and it is unlikely that any countries other than Fiji and Papua New Guinea will sign or initial. Intransigence and a lack of flexibility have clearly alienated the ACP, especially when they realise that the Commission is pushing for agreements from the ACP that it has not sought from others, and colleagues from the Committee on International Trade will confirm this. Both technically and politically, the ‘goods-only’ agreement has proved impossible, even for the Caribbean. The capacity of the Caribbean is greater than of any other region. Only last week, they said that what was on offer was simply not tenable for them. Surely, the Commission must now step back, take the pressure off and reassess how it can ensure that we do not do the unthinkable and throw the non-LDCs to the wolves. The willingness of both sides to continue negotiation in good faith should be communicated to the WTO in order to avoid the trade disruption which failure to sign an EPA by the deadline would cause. The EU must make the required internal legislative changes to permit the continuation of the current trading arrangements. Subsequently, the EU and the ACP could work together to ensure that there is no opposition or challenge in the WTO. We, as Members of the European Parliament, simply cannot return to our constituencies, wherever they are in Europe, and say that vulnerable ACP states are going to be treated in this way when they are already agreeing amongst themselves that they are being asked to agree economic partnerships that they see as being harmful to their economic interests.
 Glenys Kinnock (PSE
),  
rapporteur
. – Mr President, thank you very much for being here, giving the status that these issues deserve in this Parliament. I should also like to thank the Commissioner for his kind remarks. I think many of us here deeply regret the fact that the Council chose not to be represented here today in discussions on the G8 and the Millennium Development Goals. We are sorry that priorities took them elsewhere. My report is an opportunity at the midway point to assess progress or otherwise on meeting the Millennium Development Goals. Of course the reality is that many sub-Saharan countries are not on track to meet even one of the MDGs. Virtually no country in Africa is on track to achieve the Millennium Development Goals for child and maternal health. That is why our committee agreed that the European Union should continue to lead on efforts to support sexual and reproductive health rights through funding and other support. In 2005, the leaders of the rich world met at the G8 Summit in Gleneagles and undertook to double annual aid to poor countries to USD 50 billion, and to give 100% debt cancellation. In May 2005, the EU Council had already set the agenda for the Gleneagles Summit which took place in July of that year. They had agreed –
 and this is important –
 a time-bound commitment to meeting the 0.7% of GNI and 100% debt relief. At the time of writing my report, it was clear that were serious questions of credibility in relation to certain Member States of the European Union. This is where I have a fundamental disagreement with the Commissioner. Excluding debt relief, a number of Member States are falling behind. The Iraq and Nigerian debt deals have been counted in such a way as to distort the true picture on real aid. It is estimated that it amounted to some USD 13 billion in 2006. In 2010, when aid to Africa is supposed to reach USD 50 billion a year, debt relief would have been largely accounted for and would therefore no longer bolster the amount of aid a country gives. The shortfall is now estimated by Oxfam to be an absolutely shocking USD 30 billion. At the G8, we saw efforts by some Member States of the European Union to press for the promises to be met. But what we saw, as you said Commissioner, was a reiteration and confirmation of the 2005 promises to increase aid. We are still lacking clear timetables and binding practical commitments. We need more specifics and clear financial pledges which will, for instance, fill in the funding gaps for the countries endorsed by the Education Fast Track Initiative. We also need clarity on the pledge to scale up universal access to HIV/Aids. They talk about 5 million people in 2010. We want to know whether this is a global figure, because, if it is, it should be more like 10 million. If it only applies to Africa, then the communiqué is presenting a somewhat different picture. Of course, again, there is no specific target date. The reality is that developing countries do not want some kind of cheque in the post or some kind of promissory note. They want to be able to put credible and costed plans in place, as our own governments do. On climate change, all the G8s except the US and Russia agreed to cut emissions by half by 2050. The US commitment to join in with the UN efforts was welcome. However, again I have to say that there were no clear binding targets, and even the 50% by 2050 target had no base year agreed by the G8 in Germany. There is also no agreed intention to limit climate change to 2°C. In the context of the importance we attach to debt relief and to pledges on aid, we know that the whole issue of trade justice continues to elude us. Last year in the G8 in St Petersburg they issued a grand clarion call for the Doha Round to reach a successful conclusion, but what you see, in fact, is a far cry from what developing countries thought they were signing up to when they signed up to a Doha development round. All the G8 in Germany did was to repeat what they said in St Petersburg a year ago. On EPAs, I particularly recommend Mr van den Berg’s amendment, which unfortunately was left out of the text that you have here because an error was made when the compilation took place. I think it makes a very valuable addition to the debate on EPAs. Finally, I would like to say that what we need to see now is an absolute change of gear. In 2005, thousands of our citizens across the world marched under the banner of making poverty history. We are seeing that aid really works. There are real improvements in reducing poverty, getting children into school, improving health and saving lives. However, there has to be real social and political change, as well as the growing understanding that what we are calling for here is not for charity but rather for justice for the world’s developing countries. (Applause)

 Mr President, I really enjoyed hearing the Commissioner say that the Joint Parliamentary Assembly was now a robust organisation. It certainly is. I would like to thank him for his loyal participation in each of the JPAs so far. I would also like to note that the President of Parliament will attend the session next week in Wiesbaden, as did his predecessor, President Borrell, who is now a member of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly. This involvement is very important and gives status and importance to the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, which, as others have said, including Mr Cornillet in his excellent report and presentation, continues to grow and to thrive. That is because it is nurtured by so many committed and active parliamentarians, from the ACP and from this Parliament. We enjoy very active collaboration in the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and, again as Mr Cornillet says, the parliamentary nature of our work has noticeably increased. We have a wide-ranging agenda and, whatever lists we may wish to make, all our work relates to the Cotonou Partnership Agreement, which is a binding, contractual agreement between Europe and the ACP member states. The nature of the partnership between all those countries is absolutely unique. What makes it so is the obligation within the Cotonou Partnership Treaty to have this parliamentary dimension. That is something we should be very proud of. Another important point is that we have worked very hard to improve the ability of parliamentarians from ACP countries to scrutinise the actions of the executive and the governments in their countries. They also have to hold their governments to account, because that is what parliamentarians are meant to do. But, quite frankly, in most of the ACP countries where we have talked and worked with parliamentarians, they are seldom brought into the ambit of the work undertaken by their governments. The Commission has been somewhat guilty in this respect as well, because in consultations, such as on the country strategy papers, they have had written into the agreements the need for negotiations and consultations with civil society. I have no problem with that; that is very good. On the other hand, parliamentarians are the elected representatives and I would like to see much more engagement by them in programming, in implementation, in monitoring and in evaluation. We also need to urge European national parliaments to scrutinise the European Development Fund. They can help us in that way. I think that the work of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly has changed over the 13 years I have been a member, and for the better. It used to be the case that it was completely dominated by European parliamentarians. I think all of us here can fairly say that is no longer the case.
 Glenys Kinnock (PSE

 Mr President, I trust that the Commission will take note of the concerns that many– indeed, the vast majority of – Members of Parliament have raised this morning. The EPA negotiations are clearly at a very critical stage, and this week European Union and ACP ministers meet in Brussels to review progress, at a time when, as others have said, they are under intense pressure to conclude by the end of 2007. The reality is, of course, that even where technically they are well prepared, ACP countries still face serious political issues which remain between ACP member states, within governments in the ACP, between governments and private sector, civil society and regional integration organisations. David Martin raised some very important points about the level of suspicion and anxiety that exists in ACP countries. In the last few weeks I have been in both west and east Africa and, from the Prime Minister of Senegal, to the President of Ghana, to the Tanzanian Minister of Trade, the message was exactly the same: there are too many unresolved issues. On aid for trade: is it new money? Is it predictable? When is it going to be on the table? On levels of regional integration, in Tanzania I learnt of the enormous problems there and of the new east Africa configuration which they are planning for and have, I think, written to the Commissioner about. Then there are the Singapore issues, which others have mentioned and which are currently causing enormous difficulties in the SADC negotiations. Most ACP member states have welcomed duty-free, quota-free access. However, it remains the case – and I am not sure that anyone has mentioned this – that a dozen or more EU Member States are expressing concern and objections to the proposal, and some ACP states are concerned about the impact on sugar, bananas and rice. Only yesterday, Barbados was saying that the region could benefit only if the EU ensured that they build the technical, productive and infrastructural capacity so that they can maximise the opportunities, particularly for sugar, between 2009 and 2015. There is this doomsday scenario that people talk about. That is why, if they cannot sign up by the end of this year, the ACP should be provided with a high level of market access using GSP+. The assertion I hear that alternatives do not exist is simply not the case and neither is the claim that no ACP region or country has asked for them. Recent research by the ODI, the UN and others points to an enhanced GSP as a viable alternative to EPAs and would provide that essential breathing space for negotiations to continue. GSP+ would provide more generous access than GSP, which is clearly not an option. Most ACP countries could well meet the eligibility criteria and would be provided with a level of market access almost equivalent to Cotonou for current exports, with very few exceptions.

. – Madam President, thank you very much to Mr Kaczmarek and to the Commissioner for his response to the report. In the Horn of Africa, one hardly knows where to begin, because what we see is a lethal cocktail of conflict and poverty, where the rule of law barely exists, where there is no concept of democracy and human rights and where five out of seven of the countries of the region are in conflict with their neighbours. So, as the rapporteur says, there can be no real security and there can be no developments without peace. The key issues are related to building peace, preventing conflict and resolving conflict. Those are the central elements in the report. It is very important to point out that, as the Commissioner is very well aware, in other regions of Africa, for example West Africa – I was recently in Côte d’Ivoire – and in the Great Lakes area, we are now seeing peace breaking out. But the Horn of Africa stands out as the one region where we have not been able to grapple with conflict management and prevention. Certainly, the idea of an envoy and other suggestions are very welcome indeed. What we see are the worst examples of conflict. In Darfur, the UN says that some 200 000 people have died and two million have been displaced since that conflict began in 2003. The Government of Sudan continues to ignore efforts at mediation, including from the UN Secretary-General. The border disputes between Eritrea and Ethiopia remain unresolved. The Government of Ethiopia continues to break international law as far as that is concerned. The leaders of Eritrea and Ethiopia refuse to give the people the right to choose their own government and to respect elections, as has been the case in Ethiopia. Now we see intense fighting in Somalia, where about a thousand people have died and where Ethiopian troops have been very active, fighting on behalf of the transitional government in Somalia, but of course – as we all have to acknowledge – with covert assistance from the United States. The Eritreans, meanwhile, back the Islamist militias. I have written to the Commissioner on this subject and would still like to ask him why it is that we have offered such support to the transitional government in Somalia and why we are not asking serious questions about the bloody process which we are apparently continuing in many ways to tolerate. There is a humanitarian catastrophe looming in Somalia and we are still not holding those responsible in the transitional government accountable for their actions. Why, Commissioner, are we not asking questions? Is it political expediency that prevents us from doing that? Why is it that the Ethiopians do not leave? Why is it that security cannot be established? Why is there no genuine power sharing, and is the EU insisting that moderates in the Islamic courts must be involved in any possible solution in Somalia? Finally, I have to ask whether the EU is serious about state-building in the Horn of Africa or whether we are actually focusing on other priorities. May I suggest that the other priorities in the Horn of Africa are the so-called war against terror?

 Mr President, I wanted to tell the House that one hour ago Morgan Tsvangirai was again arrested by the police and security forces in Harare. He and his staff were about to have a news conference to discuss the events which you described in your speech. I would therefore like this House to condemn that re-arrest of Morgan Tsvangirai and to say that the brutality against the opposition has to stop. The Southern African Development Community has to react at its meeting in Tanzania this week. (Applause)
 Glenys Kinnock (PSE
). – 
 Mr President, as others have said, as General al-Bashir continues to prevaricate on the deployment of an AU-UN hybrid force in Darfur, we see the humanitarian crisis getting worse. We see the number of internally displaced people increasing. The ceasefire has collapsed. The international community has and is continuing to fail to fulfil its responsibility to protect innocent civilians in Darfur. This means that the European Union must act urgently to impose its own targeted and phased smart sanctions. We do not have to wait for the UN Security Council to agree on essential new measures – as others have suggested – on an arms embargo covering all of Sudan, on asset-freezing of the wealthy people of Sudan, on travel bans and on consideration of an oil embargo. Clearly, revenue flows to the south would need to be protected if we impose an oil embargo, and consideration would perhaps need to be given to compensating the south Sudanese for lost oil revenue. But the least we can do is to put a bar on investments, on technical equipment and on expertise. I also believe that there should be serious consideration of sports sanctions against Sudan, especially consideration of excluding Sudan from the 2010 World Cup. This means that Europe has to put pressure on FIFA. The EU position, frankly, is weak and untenable. There is too much emphasis on carrots and not enough on sticks. The German Presidency must take a lead and insist on a unified position from Member States. Commissioner, you have described the position, and in the Council we hear the fine words, but nothing happens. The question is: how does Europe put pressure on Khartoum? There must be an urgent and detailed investigation of the personal finances of wealthy individuals in Sudan. We have to prepare the arguments against those who claim that this would push Sudan closer towards Chinese business interests. The truth is, frankly, that nothing is currently influencing Sudan. It is virtually impossible to influence them, and so, if we remain supine, then we maintain the position where they can be as brutal as they like and Europe will continue to do nothing. Millions of people in Darfur are paying for European broken promises and totally worthless commitments. Khartoum knows that Europe is all bark and no bite and that is why today we are calling for new, strong, economic, legal and military measures. Public condemnation is not enough. We want solutions which reflect the tragedy. Europe is shamefully weak and I have to say finally that if Darfur was, for example, Lebanon, then real sanctions would be getting a lot more discussion time in the Council, and President Barroso in the Commission and you, Commissioner, would put pressure on the Council to do more.
 Glenys Kinnock (PSE
). – 
 Thank you very much, Madam President, and congratulations. It is very good to see you in the Chair. As others have said, we are very proud of the fact that the Cotonou Partnership Agreement represents binding contractual agreements with 78 African, Caribbean and Pacific countries. It is, therefore, a very special relationship indeed. Commissioner, we regret the fact that the great flurry of activity that we saw in 2005 on development and funding for development did not, in fact, include a substantial increase in the contribution of Member States of the European Union to the European Development Fund for the ACP. The reality is that the 10th EDF represents only 0.28 % of Member States’ GDP. That contradicts what you said in terms of how you saw the results of those negotiations. I agree with you on the pace of ratification; that remains of enormous concern. Only four Member States of the European Union and five of the ACP have currently ratified this part of the Agreement, and I think that is of some concern. I have some questions for you. I know you are not the Commissioner for Development, but perhaps if it is not possible for you answer them, you will pass them on. In Barbados, Commissioner Michel promised to submit the country strategy papers to ACP countries’ parliaments for their scrutiny. I want to know whether progress has been made on this commitment, and whether we can have some description from the Commission on where we stand on that. Further to that, I would like to ask you whether you are prepared to enter into structural dialogue with the European Parliament on the country strategy papers for ACP countries. My colleague, Mr van den Berg, has said that we want the same status for the ACP as we have for the DCI country strategy papers. Furthermore, I want to know how the Commission responds to questions that, I think, we in the Parliament have to ask, for instance on budget support to a country like Haiti, which has been recognised by Transparency International as the most corrupt country in the world. How is it that the Commission is now proposing to give budget support to Haiti? The same question applies to Equatorial Guinea. On our committee, we find it very difficult to understand those decisions. With regard to Togo, we see that the Commission is now prepared to normalise relations. We want to know where we stand on the 22 commitments: are they being fulfilled by Togo. At the Vienna JPA, the Commission promised to send details to us on the progress with Togo and we have, as yet, as I understand it from our secretariat, received absolutely no information on that. Finally, Commissioner, will you undertake to work more closely with the European Parliament on these issues in order to make sure that the Joint Parliamentary Assembly’s views are taken into account? I urge the Commission to answer the serious questions of this kind that we are addressing to you this evening.

 Mr President, our funding for HIV/AIDS prevention is still running well below target, falling behind by something like USD 12 billion. Therefore, as the Commissioner said, there is an urgent need for more public and private funding in order to address the shortcomings. There is no single panacea for HIV eradication, but there has to be more education and more funding for vaccine research and for microbicides, which the Commissioner mentioned. The development of a vaginal microbicide has to be our immediate priority, and it is predicted that it could be developed and used within five years. It is the only way for women to have real control over their own sexual health. It is a method that does not require the consent of a partner. In addition, AIDS treatments in the developing world will not, and cannot, be sustainable unless there is a supply of the newer versions of generic medicines, which are increasingly needed as drugs-resistant cases of HIV/AIDS become more frequent. That means we have to be much more audacious in the way we confront the patents that pharmaceutical companies continue to hide behind, making the price of treatment impossible to meet in many developing countries and under the kind of health systems my colleague, Mr Bowis, mentioned.
 Glenys Kinnock,  
on behalf of the PSE Group
. –
 Mr President, I have to say that in both the Council and Commission statements I detect a rather worrying element of complacency. You cannot talk of working with General Bashir and hoping that in the future we can persuade him. I have followed the situation in Sudan for many years and I can confirm that would not be realistic at this time in particular. The future of the people of Darfur is now in the balance, just as much as it was before the agreement on maintaining the AU force until 30 September 2006. The government of Khartoum is answerable to nobody. It is patently failing to allow humanitarian access to some three million people in Darfur. What will the international community do? You are not telling me what you will do to hold the government in Khartoum to account. In three months, or even earlier, the UN force must be ready to deploy, because the AU will start to pull out. The confusion about the future of the African Union is very serious: it is underfunded, overstretched and finding it very difficult to operate. A United Nations force must be deployed as quickly as possible, with a stronger mandate than it has now, and it must be capable of protecting the vulnerable and traumatised people of Darfur who are currently under such terrible threat. No deadlines have been met by the Sudanese. Their genocidal strategy is moving forward. There is no ceasefire to monitor any more. It is pointless to talk about the peace agreement: it is finished. We said ‘never again’ in 1994 after Rwanda, and what we face now is the first genocide of the 21st century, unless we end this complacency and do something. You talked about the key players. There are key players: China, Russia and the Arab League are also complicit in this. One last important point: you did not talk about the need for the imposition of a no-fly zone. There have been 13 UN resolutions, each of which has called for a no-fly zone. Not for a moment has this ever
 been imposed. What are you going to do, Council, what are you going to do, Commission, to ensure that those Antonov planes do not continue to fly over the villages of Darfur dropping bombs on those innocent civilians? I urge you to think seriously about the imposition of a no-fly zone. Could you not consider using the French jets that are currently in neighbouring Chad to monitor the airspace and stop the Sudanese from terrorising the people of Darfur?
 Glenys Kinnock (PSE
). –  
Mr President, clearly, as the Commissioner and others have said, agricultural change remains the key to lifting millions of farmers in Africa, Asia and Latin America out of poverty. Realistically, Commissioner, until we in the rich world tackle the need for fairer and better access to our markets, there will be no prospect of a wider deal on industrial goods and services. A shift to regional trade deals would, as you and others have said, be a major step backwards and undermine the essential principle of non-discrimination. Such deals would exclude most of the world’s poorest countries, including ACP countries, which are of course by definition generally small, vulnerable and of little economic significance. Before returning to the negotiations, Commissioner, the rich countries must deal with subsidies and dumping, especially as regards cotton. Also, there is an urgent need for a decision on Aid for Trade, with new money and with no strings attached. In addition, it needs to be understood, during the preparations, that the pace and scale of market opening is critical for developing countries, as is special and differential treatment and tariff protection. Someone has mentioned the danger of a flood of trade complaints to the WTO, and it is my belief that there should be major reform of the sanction mechanism, which currently only comes into play when the complainant is a major player. ACP commodity-dependent countries know this full well and to their cost. ‘Waving or drowning’: it is sometimes very difficult to tell the difference. Multilateral agreement is essential. Regional, bilateral agreements are not what we are looking for. You now face a formidable task, Commissioner, and one that will severely test your diplomatic and consensus-building skills, as well as those of others. We wish you well in that task.
 Glenys Kinnock (PSE

 Mr President, I want to raise with Parliament the deteriorating situation in Darfur. Tension is building up very seriously and a large-scale military confrontation is threatened, as thousands and thousands of Sudanese troops are now moving into the region with trucks, bombs and guns. We also face a massive humanitarian catastrophe, as the hard-line Sudanese junta absolutely refuses to accept the UN troops, as agreed by the Security Council last week in New York. We face competing pressures on the budget and I would hope that this Parliament will remain faithful to the view that Darfur should not drop out of our set of priorities at this crucial time. Could I also ask you to contact High Representative Solana to ask him to make urgent representations to the Sudanese, and to the African Union to make sure that the latter’s mandate can be extended until such time as that United Nations force can be deployed in this tragic region of Sudan.
 Glenys Kinnock (PSE
). – 
 Madam President, I welcome the commitment shown by the Commissioner to these issues and indeed for giving us the clear understanding that it goes beyond just enjoying Oxfam chocolates. I would also like to say that, like Linda McAvan, I have many experiences from developing countries, such as Uganda, where last year I met a farmer who had a kilo of coffee beans to sell for 150 Ugandan shillings. Subsequently I paid 1000 Ugandan shillings for one cup of coffee. This is the kind of injustice which the Fair Trade movement is dealing with. My own country, Wales, has now voted to become a beacon of Fair Trade practice. This week our First Minister announced proposals for Wales to become a Fair Trade nation. We are now working to increase awareness of Fair Trade issues amongst the population in Wales. That means working in colleges, schools, the voluntary sector, across business networks and elsewhere, and increasing awareness amongst our population. I believe that in 2007 Wales will become a Fair Trade nation and our Fair Trade support will, as others have said, make an enormous difference to the lives of countless poor people and will mean that we will make our contribution to making poverty history.
 Glenys Kinnock (PSE

draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development
. –
 Mr President, I wish to thank Parliament's team, who showed such respect and gave such commitment and importance to the Committee on Development's position. I must reflect a rather negative position from that committee: in June 2005 you will recall that this Hemicycle was encircled by a 'Make Poverty History' band. Unfortunately, that hope has been dissipated as today we discuss Financial Perspective proposals that reflect lower levels of growth for the Development Cooperation Instrument than is the case for all Europe's other external actions. How can we believe that it is possible for Europe to meet its Millennium Development Goal targets if resources are to be limited for those critical years up to 2013? Europe's preoccupation with counterterrorism and with migration should not dictate that resources should be diverted away from our essential task, which is to work with the pressing needs of the world's poorest people and poorest countries. The Development Committee also firmly rejects the language used by the Commission, which presumes that the proposals to rationalise the instrument have the potential to enhance either the coherence or the responsiveness of the European Union as a development partner. Finally, our commitment is to fund human and social development in the world's poorest countries. As things stand, I think we tragically face the likelihood that Europe will be seen as reneging on those principles and on those priorities. I also feel that the strong and welcome commitment made last year by us all – the Commission, Parliament and, in particular, the Council and the Member States – is now seriously under threat and the Committee on Development has to express its deep concern about the effects of the Financial Perspectives on its work. (Applause)

 Mr President, I thank Mr Cornillet for his excellent and wide-ranging report, which covered all the points raised in the debate this morning. Anyone looking at our Joint Parliamentary Assembly over a number of years, as I certainly have for around 12 years, has seen a very heartening increase in confidence, maturity and, indeed, in engaging on issues related to trade and to political dialogue, to which we attach great importance. Someone said that everything in Africa was terrible and things were not improving. I do not think that we can make that case. There are limitations, but we are there, working behind the Cotonou Partnership Agreement with parliamentarians in a unique way. There is no other North-South parliamentary assembly such as ours that has this opportunity to press on governance, democracy and human rights, and that is what we do. On the EDF, briefly, we are concerned and we had a debate at the part-session in Brussels a few weeks ago. Many of us are concerned about the situation of the overseas countries and territories in relation to the EDF. We are concerned that allowance has not been made for the entry of East Timor into the ACP-EU relationship, and we have a number of other concerns. We are always puzzled about the 3% or 4% administration costs. I do not know why the Commission needs to put money in to pay itself for the job it is doing. I find that rather odd. Let me turn briefly to sugar, with which the Commissioner has been directly involved. At the weekend I am going to Africa – Swaziland – and Mauritius to look again at the issues related to sugar there. The Commissioner must be aware that the figures we now have on the budget line, going from EUR 130 million up to EUR 170 million by 2013, are far short of what the Commissioner and others had promised, which was EUR 190 million. My own government talked about EUR 230 million. They are going to get EUR 1.1 billion at the end of 2013 and it is back-loaded. How can that be sensible? We urge the Commissioner to look at this and to try to make this more workable. Stop this back-loading and increase the amounts on the budget line for these countries. The issue is not just about employment in sugar, as the Commissioner must know – because we made enough fuss about it in Europe – but also about the other developments that depend on and grow around that source of employment. Thousands and thousands of livelihoods are at stake in those 18 Sugar Protocol countries. You can rely on us in the Joint Parliamentary Assembly to keep raising this issue. We have work in progress. Our committees are working well and I think that we can fairly say that the Joint Parliamentary Assembly can only grow in strength in future years. We will continue to fight on EDF, trade and other concerns and priorities that we share with our fellow Joint Parliamentary Assembly parliamentarians.
 Glenys Kinnock (PSE

 Mr President, it is an interesting statistic that there are more nurses from Malawi living in Manchester, in the United Kingdom, than there are living in Malawi; and there are more doctors from Ethiopia living in Chicago than there are in Ethiopia. There is an estimated global shortage of 820 000 doctors, nurses and other health workers. Obviously human resources are a central part of all human healthcare systems, but the reality is that the recruitment of health professionals and the scourge of HIV/Aids are continuing to prolong the crisis already afflicting very fragile healthcare systems in developing countries. Many leave developing countries – as you said, Commissioner – because in developing countries they earn low wages, have poor working conditions, little prospect of advancement and a lack of training. In addition they have the pressure of dealing with high numbers of patients with HIV/Aids and other very difficult diseases. This brain drain is the major obstacle to providing quality care in Africa. Countries are losing the most qualified and experienced nurses. Last year Kenya lost 3000 graduate nurses to other countries, mostly to the United States and the United Kingdom. There is a net flow of skills away from Africa, where individuals make decisions to go where they can earn and where they can take their careers forward. Many women that I have met across the United Kingdom working in elderly care centres, etc., are doing so because they want to earn money in order to send money back to care for their children in the countries where they come from. A consequence is that that the losing nations do not have that skill space that they need to educate their young people and develop their own economies. We in the European Union have to look at ways to compensate those countries that are being so drained of the skills that they need. I welcome the Commission’s urgent attention to the crisis. We hope that we will see strategies – and that is the next step – that can deal with the root causes of the problem we are talking about this evening. That problem is that in spite of the terrible burden of disease there, Africa only has 0.6% of the world’s registered healthcare workers. How can that be acceptable when the healthcare and disease pressures are so enormous there? I am concerned by Commissioner Frattini’s recent proposal to promote the recruitment of highly educated immigrants, including the creation of a ‘green card’ for researchers, engineers and doctors. Parliament must call for an active end to the recruitment of health workers. It rightly calls for the European Union to press for a global code of conduct on ethical recruitment. Commissioner, would you subscribe to the view that this is something that the Commission should do in order to try to deal with this crisis, which is what this evening’s debate is all about? The other side of the coin is that in Europe we have an ageing population and we have declining birth rates. We are therefore trying to suck in the health workers from other countries in order to deal with our own problems. Raising wages to levels comparable with the industrialised world is very difficult for developing countries, but funding must be targeted at the health system and efforts must be made to decentralise healthcare and to support regional development. I also believe – and no-one else has mentioned this, but it is in the resolution – that tele-medicine is a very important way of dealing with this issue. I was recently in Mauritania and saw how, in a very small hospital in a desert area of that country, health workers were making contact with French doctors in order to have some consultation on diagnoses for patients. That is something we could also look at investing in, in a more serious way than we do currently. With regard to nurse practitioners, nurses should be given more status in developing countries than they now have. That is very important, as it is to look at what countries such as Uganda are doing, which is to decentralise the health service and take it out of the main cities, into the rural areas. If we are actually going to deliver on the Millennium Development Goals we have a huge task. In relation to health, it is a major task and we need to make a contribution. In relation to the financial perspectives we are now discussing, we really do not have the options to deliver on the debates and on the commitments that you have discussed this evening.

 Mr President, I should like to thank the Council for being here for this very important debate in relation to the European Development Fund. As the Council is aware, because of the ongoing debate on the budgetisation of the EDF, no provisions relating to the financial framework were included in the revised Cotonou agreement. However, in Annex 1 it states very clearly that ‘the European Union will maintain its aid efforts at at least the same level as that of the ninth EDF’. Therefore, in my view, President-in-Office, the ACP countries were misled into believing that they should feel secure about future funding under the tenth EDF. The Commission’s assessment was that for the tenth EDF, EUR 24.948 billion was the appropriate sum. In December, however, the Council in Brussels agreed on EUR 22.682 billion on current prices for the 2008-2013 period. President-in-Office, I give this history because I think it is relevant to the position adopted by Parliament’s Committee on Development, which is that the Development Committee requires reassurance and clarification before we agree to give our assent to the amended Cotonou agreement. Past agreements should dictate that both the Council and the Commission should understand that when the Development Committee takes a strong stance, as we have done on the DCCI, we in that committee will maintain a very strong position on our principles. Our principles centre around development, and if they are not addressed, then the Council should understand that we will not give our assent until that is clearly part of the way in which you are operating. One of our concerns relates to the fact that certain members of the Council say that we should accept that we deduct EUR 0.3 billion for the EU’s 21 overseas countries and territories and that a further EUR 0.9 billion should be deducted to cover administrative costs. Yesterday in committee, the Director-General of DG Development made it very clear that the position that you may have on the OCTs was not shared by the Commission. Will the Council therefore clarify what its position on the OCTs is? As a British Member of this Parliament, I am very well aware of the position of the UK, the last Council Presidency. However, President-in-Office, I would like to know what your position is. Also, on administrative costs, how can it be sensible for the Commission to pay itself for the administration of its own resources? This cannot make sense and I am sure is not something that you are familiar with in your own administration. Would the Member States – the Council – be prepared to consider giving additional money to cover the costs of the OCTs? These are not unimportant caveats. I am not introducing them in a casual way, because I really want to know exactly from you how it can be the case that you make these decisions which say that you do not want to give us the assurances that the money that you are giving to the ACP for the ACP’s use are funds for those countries to use in a clear and transparent way. I would also take issue with the assertion that the tenth EDF represents a significant improvement on the ninth EDF. In real terms I would argue that it is nothing more than a stagnation. The Development Committee cannot and will not be duped by what we see as double-speak on this issue. The ninth EDF included funds left over from the previous EDF: ‘unspent money’. Once this money is added to the ninth EDF, the figures touted by the Council are comparable only in nominal terms. When things are finalised, the tenth EDF will have to be ratified and that presents us with enormous concerns when you consider that 25 Member States will have to be part of this ratification process. The results of an under-spend in the past have been that we have gone in for all these facilities – water facilities, peace facilities – which have had very limited democratic control. Surely this is a matter of concern for you, President-in-Office? Our next debate will be on economic partnership agreements and one of the most contentious issues for us, and which we will raise, will be the financing of aid for trade in the economic partnership agreements. Will you clarify, President-in-Office, whether you will be offering additional funds for the EPA negotiations, or whether you expect such funding to come from the ACP’s tenth EDF? Finally, if the African Union is to be included, how will allowances be made for the fact that many members of the African Union are not ACP countries? Do you expect those countries to benefit from EDF money if the Council decides that you will support the African Union from the tenth EDF? We are talking about a binding agreement with the ACP, and I trust that the Council will reflect that in the decisions it takes on the tenth EDF.

 Mr President, I should to like to thank the Commissioner. I wish to begin by referring to his remark that talking about alternatives to economic partnership agreements is ‘academic’ – that was the word he used. It is very clearly stated in the Cotonou Agreement that alternatives are part of what the ACP countries have an option on deciding to follow. Therefore, Commissioner, it is not an academic issue, but something that is very definitely an option for the ACP. The economic partnership agreements are very complex and complicated for the ACP and are the most complex and complicated negotiations they have ever engaged in. I suspect that they also present the Commission with certain difficulties, if not only because of the tensions which naturally exist between DG Development’s concerns and priorities and DG Trade’s concerns and priorities, which are very different. We know from our own experience in this Parliament that there is not always that necessary coherence between our objectives. My impression is that there are concerns that are common to all the regional negotiations and I am following them very closely. There are examples of the Commission wanting a framework that facilitates trade as a first priority. The ACP regions are far more interested in addressing supply side constraints and the link between EPAs and development support. Market access remains absolutely central as an issue. The proposed opening of the economies of the ACP countries – most of which are least-developed countries – is a major concern. The benefits of regional integration, market access and integrated trade and development, as my colleague Mrs Martens said, are absolutely clear. However, what we understand in the Committee on Development is that any potential benefits could be outweighed by the potential costs which they might be expected to pay. Therefore, the agreements they might have to make on market access – market opening – may not be exactly what they need and perhaps they could get more from other kinds of arrangements. To be competitive and to market their goods, there needs to be substantial investment in their ability to do so. ACP countries need training and their workforce needs to be improved; they need improved infrastructure, transport and institutional capacity-building. All these are major priorities for the ACP. It must be said that it is not for the Commission to tell the ACP what a good EPA is. It is up to the ACP – in consultation with their parliaments, the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and civil society – to make that kind of decision. Any criteria we make on economic partnership agreements must be based on their relationship with the Millennium Development Goals. I should like to ask the Commissioner one question. The central Africa negotiations are portrayed as a model of these regional negotiations. My sources tell me that DG Development at its highest level – that probably means you, Commissioner – is very worried about the capacity of the secretariat of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community in their negotiations. Is it the case that you, Commissioner, have publicly called for the executive secretary and chief EPA negotiator in CAEMC to be dismissed? If that is the case, then how does this sit with DG Trade’s description of this as being the absolute role model? Finally, I should like to draw attention to the Cape Town Declaration of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2002. Benchmarks were put in place there to assess the conduct and outcome of the negotiations on the basis of key social and environmental indicators, including decent work, health, education and gender. The potential for this was confirmed last year by the ACP Council. Will the Commissioner act upon these proposals?
 Glenys Kinnock (PSE

 Thank you, Commissioner. I am talking about the fact that the collateral damage from the effects of the reform of the sugar regime has been felt by the 18 protocol countries. You say that they had EUR 40 million between 18 countries. Three commissioners – you, Mr Mandelson and the President of the Commission – pledged EUR 190 million to the ACP countries. I am now following that very closely. We can see no place in the budget for that money; we can see no likelihood of anything like the amount you promised to them being included in the budget. However hard this Parliament tries, it is very difficult in terms of the budgetary allocation that we have to make sure that we ring-fence the kind of money that we need. Will you, Commissioner, urge the Council to agree that we should ring-fence the money in any unallocated money that we may find under Heading IV? Will you make it your business to protect the ACP sugar-producing countries at this time, when they are feeling so vulnerable?

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to talk about the potential offered by the International Financing Facility proposed by the UK Chancellor Gordon Brown. The IFF leverages money from international capital markets by issuing bonds which can potentially raise USD 50 billion each year from 2005 to 2015. The advantage of this, referring to some of the points you raised in your introduction, Commissioner, is that this money is frontloaded, it is long term, it is stable and it is predictable money. It raises one billion a year, which can be used to get children into school and to abolish the fees that jeopardise the education of millions of children in developing countries, especially little girls. The IFF has already put in place a pilot scheme for immunisation, which is searching for vaccines for malaria and for HIV/AIDS – the scourge in Africa and many other parts of the world – for which there is no cure. The agreement is to provide a global advanced purchasing scheme to make sure that life-saving vaccines are commercially produced at affordable prices and that these are produced in ways of which we in this Parliament should all approve and which we should find essential at this time. We acknowledge that meeting the Millennium Development Goals, which is part of the purpose of this debate, is difficult, but if we can put the money in place – predictable money – then we will get every child into school and we will prevent the needless deaths of 30 000 children every day. That is what we are talking about; that is about us trying to translate hope into reality. When he heard about the IFF, Nelson Mandela said that it was an absolutely necessary and timely initiative that deserves an active response from the international community. I very much hope that the European Union will support this initiative firmly and in a very committed way.

.  The reform is essential. However, the collateral damage of this reform should not be felt by small, vulnerable ACP economies with whom we have a very special relationship. African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries rightly feel that they have been abandoned and betrayed by what has been agreed in the Council. What has been proposed by Parliament today is equally unsatisfactory and for this reason I voted against the resolution. Parliament has today voted for a delay in the implementation of the Everything But Arms (EBA) Agreement. Such a move would seriously limit the promise of an initiative designed to provide least developed countries with duty-free and quota-free access to the EU's sugar markets. I call upon the Council to honour its commitment to EBA by implementing no delay or safeguard mechanisms. We now must look to the future and make sure we provide ACP countries with adequate financial support for their restructuring. Compensation amounting to EUR 7.5 billion has been offered to European farmers, whereas so far the ACP has only EUR 40 million. Today, Parliament agreed that the Commission's estimates of ACP needs of EUR 200 million must be met with new and fresh funding. I hope this will be listened to.

 Madam President, I thank the Commissioner and Mr Fruteau for dealing so well with what is an extremely contentious and difficult issue. Clearly the reform of the sugar sector is essential, but I cannot agree that the collateral damage of what is an internal European Union reform should be felt by some of the small, vulnerable economies with whom we have very special relationships and partnerships. Throughout the discussions the ACP countries have made the case for a gradual price cut, an end to dumping and for additional long-term funding to help them deal with what is a drastic reform. By and large, their pleas have been rejected. It is the view of the ACP countries, as Mr Fruteau has intimated, that they have been abandoned and betrayed by what is on the table now. They have no guarantee of where the money is to come from in the long term to help them restructure and to diversify both within and outside of sugar. In the Caribbean alone the losses as a result of the cuts are expected to be in the region of EUR 125 million. The ACP Sugar Protocol countries supplied tropical sugar when Europe needed it. Now they are asking that we understand the inevitable dependence they have on that commodity, one upon which they depend for foreign exchange earnings which have brought stability to them and have ensured that they maintain democracies. Compensation amounting to EUR 7.5 billion is on the table for European farmers. So far the ACP has EUR 40 million, which is to be divided between 18 countries, and it is not even clear how it is going to be divided. In addition, Commissioner Mandelson warned last night in the WTO debate that the figure of EUR 190 million, which the Commission has proposed, is now threatened by a 20% cut agreed in the EU’s budget negotiations. Commissioner, where exactly is that money going to come from? Is it yet again the intention of the Commission to raid the development budget to cover the cost of these accompanying measures for the ACP? I hope that the Commissioner for Development, Mr Michel, will stand firm and that, in the spirit of what you said about your interest in developing countries, you will give your support for new and additional money to cover the accompanying measures. Another concern relates to the effects of the regulation on LDCs. I refer you to the amendments that I have submitted on that issue. Almost all of the world’s least developed countries are members of the ACP group. Therefore they have an enormous interest in the appalling suggestion that we should pull back on our commitments to Everything But Arms. From 2009 all least developed countries should benefit from the same guaranteed price as that provided for in the ACP Sugar Protocol. There should be no delay in the fulfilment of Europe’s commitments to provide duty-free, quota-free access on a stable and long-term basis to LDCs. The safeguard clause that was agreed by the Council calls for an upper limit of a 25% increase per year on LDC imports. That makes an absolute mockery of EBA. LDCs are set to lose EUR 783 million of potential earnings in the first year alone. I hope that this Parliament will not accept a situation which jeopardises a European initiative of which we have been justifiably proud. We must not vote for any delay on the implementation or indeed for a safeguard clause, which would limit the promise offered by EBA. In line with the objective of having coherence between agriculture and development priorities, I would recommend support for amendments on the elimination of export subsidies and the abolition of C sugar exports. If we fail to act we will be giving absolutely the wrong signal to millions of the world’s poorest people, at a time when Europe is meant to be focusing on making poverty history.
 Glenys Kinnock (PSE

 Mr President, I thank the Commissioner. I should like to begin with a few positives. First of all – and I believe that no one has mentioned this – the fact that the final text tackles the US abuse of food aid and that the ‘safe box’ has been created is very important. Secondly, it is important that the text reins in the worst excesses of the ‘blue box’. The final text also contains quite hopeful language on the special products and on the special safeguard mechanisms. Those are positives. Aid for trade is also welcome, although I have reservations about the World Bank and the IMF being in charge of it, bearing in mind the emphasis on conditionalities for which they are so well known. Like my colleague Mr van den Berg, I am very keen to know where the EUR 1 billion promised by President Barroso at Gleneagles is going to come from. There are huge gaps in the budgetary promises that have been made. When I chaired a press conference of the ACP Group in Hong Kong I got a real sense of their feeling of frustration and betrayal. On sugar, bananas and cotton the WTO has done the ACP no favours. Mr Mandelson, these countries are our natural allies, but unless we really prove that we have in place a Doha development mandate, and that we are honouring that mandate, then I believe that in the months ahead we will not be able to rely on our ACP colleagues. Also, it is absolutely critical that we have new long-term substantial funding for the Sugar Protocol countries. Realistically, can we, in the short time available, make progress on ending dumping, on confirmation of the developing countries’ rights to protect their farms, their infant industries and services? Will we put in place fair and equitable access for developing countries’ exports? Those are essential. It is a formidable list. Can you do it by 30 April, Commissioner?
 Glenys Kinnock (PSE
). – 
 Mr President, I wish to inform the President-in-Office and the Commissioner that I was very interested to read a paragraph in the conclusions adopted by the General Affairs Council last week that stated that there was strong commitment to the needs of developing countries, and in particular the LDCs, and that the Council supported an ambitious development programme in Hong Kong. Almost simultaneously, a decision was being taken to make drastic changes to the sugar regime that has been in place in the European Union for many years. Those drastic changes will have huge implications for the 18 sugar protocol countries in particular, as well as for LDCs. Similarly, decisions that will destroy thousands of livelihoods in banana-dependent countries – our traditional suppliers – were also taken last week. When you say these things in the Council, how can you simultaneously do the opposite? It was decided in the Agricultural Council to grant EUR 80 billion to European sugar farmers. Contrast that with the paltry EUR 40 billion which is to be given – we hope, as currently it is still virtual money – to ACP countries. They will in fact lose more in refining aid than we are preparing to give them to assist in their transition from this. At that Council meeting, Commissioner Fischer Boel said she felt that this reform was going to strengthen her hand. I really cannot believe that. This morning Commissioner Mandelson and I were at a G90 meeting, where we heard the grievances of the ACP countries in particular. If Commissioner Fischer Boel thinks that she has strengthened her hand to negotiate with developing countries after the decision that was taken on sugar last week, then I do not know exactly what planet she is living on. What we felt at the G90 meeting this morning – and Commissioner Mandelson will confirm this – was a terrific sense of anger and, indeed, of betrayal. I know the Commissioner is not responsible for distributing the aid that these countries need, but something has to be done in order to rebuild confidence in the very short time available to us between now and Hong Kong.
 Glenys Kinnock (PSE
). 
 – Commissioner, firstly let me say it is regrettable that the Commission chose the path of litigation rather than that of negotiation, which would probably have provided a much more practical solution and might have produced a more satisfactory result. The reality – as others have said – is that, for instance in the Windward Islands, bananas provide employment for over a third of the working population and account for 50 to 70% of export earnings. It would be extremely serious if that were to be jeopardised. As you suggested, Commissioner, preferences for countries such the Windward Islands harm no one and are not aimed at damaging the trade of Latin American exporters or of any other exporters. The best approach would be to find ways of postponing the single tariff, and to negotiate and agree to a fair solution that allows all suppliers to continue to trade. Arbitration has obviously been a failure, but the Commission must try to ensure that the trade can continue until such time as you, in conjunction with the Development and Trade Commissioners, can find a viable way of ensuring that other sources of income can be found for poor farmers in the Windward Islands so that they continue to have a future. Finally, I fear that bananas and sugar will be well and truly on the agenda in Hong Kong as far as the ACP countries are concerned.
 Glenys Kinnock (PSE
). – 
 Mr President, I would like to focus on how I think we, as Europeans, should put our own house in order. First of all, on trade, it is essential to end the subsidies to farmers in Europe which keep prices low and squeeze African commodities out of our markets, as well as the export subsidies that allow cheap food to be dumped in Africa. High tariffs, keeping out African goods, need to be cut, but African countries need time before opening up their markets. They do not have in place those safety nets, which we might have, to protect their workforce. In addition, we need to urge Member States to sign up to the UN Convention on Corruption. Member States should be held responsible for corrupt practices by their own staff and agents. That does not appear in the report and I think it is something that Member States like my own should be urged to sign up to. Since 9/11 there has been a tightening up on corruption, but it is still not treated with the same seriousness as terrorism or drugs. It also necessary for Europe to stop encouraging the brain-drain from Africa. This is not on the report either, but it makes an enormous difference, particularly in health services in Africa. Finally, I turn to the arms trade, which nobody has mentioned. The arms and mines which are killing thousands of people and have done so in Africa over generations were mostly made in the Soviet Union. As we know, however, they are traded, dealt with and circulated around Europe. They are based in Europe. We must, as Europeans, do far more to control arms brokering and the transit trade which takes place from our own continent. These are responsibilities that we must take as Europeans and we must not try to place the onus of responsibility simply on Africans.

 Mr President, I wish to begin by welcoming the President-in-Office – who, I know full well, is a very committed internationalist himself – to this debate. I thank the Commissioner for the support she gave us in the delegation that attended the summit in New York. As you have all mentioned, NGOs and others have been somewhat critical of the Outcome Document of the summit. However, I would argue, as you have done, for a more measured approach in the assessment that we make and would agree that we should describe it as a glass half-full. I also believe that exaggerated accusations of failure will not help to create the right incentives for policy makers to take risks and take action. In the Outcome Document there are strong commitments on how we should meet the MDGs by 2015. However, one of the things I regret is that global target 8 is not strong enough to ensure that countries like New Zealand, Australia, Canada or Italy are not let off the hook and to keep pressure on them to do the same as the European Union has done. Promises of 0.7% are simply not enough and, therefore, we need to see action from these countries and others. I also welcome – as I am sure the President-in-Office does – the strong reference in the document to the need for innovative sources of finance to be sought in order to meet the MDGs. I also believe that the endorsement given by George Bush to the MDGs represents significant progress – perhaps the best progress of the week. Perhaps self-interest is pushing the United States along that multilateral road that many of us believe it is not prepared to take. I am also keen to acknowledge that in the Outcome Document they make a very clear link between security, development and conflict resolution in the measures that they take. It also clearly identifies the responsibilities of both developed and developing countries. The EU development policy statement is now the appropriate vehicle for us to move this forward and to show that we firmly believe in the need to rebuild, in Europe and elsewhere, that strong sense of unity, purpose and action. The document is also strong on governance and the rule of law, which are very important aspects of our work with developing countries. You have mentioned the Peace-building Commission – which is very important – and peace-making, peace-keeping and peace-building. I regret that the Human Rights Council is now going into the General Assembly, where it will be subject to wrangling and horse-trading. Therefore, again, the European Union has a role to play in pushing this forward in a positive way. Most of all, I welcome the fact that we now have collective responsibility to protect civilians against genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and all crimes against humanity. Now we look forward to the proof that in the future the UN will be able to avoid those failures that we so tragically saw in Bosnia and Rwanda. On reform issues, we regret that the Secretary-General will continue to be micro-managed by the member states of the United Nations. The biggest disappointment is the failure to address the proliferation of nuclear weapons. That means that we now have a yawning gap in our international arrangements and the EU again must apply pressure to move this forward. Finally, I wish to refer to the amendment tabled by the PSE Group on sexual and reproductive health rights. This is an important position for us to take if we are to meet the Millennium Development Goals. It underpins all those goals, particularly on HIV/AIDS and maternal and child mortality. I trust that this Parliament will reinstate this in the text; that we will commit ourselves, as we did in the vote on my report on the Millennium Development Goals, to this important aspect. This Parliament should then subsequently support the international legitimacy of the UN. In 1945 the stakes were high for the policy makers; the stakes are high now, but the reasons for moving forward are just as great as they were then.

 Mr President, my thanks and congratulations go to the rapporteur. It is very important that we acknowledge that tourism is a major industry in many developing countries. Many developing countries such as poorer countries, and LDCs such as Mozambique and others, see it as a sector which needs to be developed further. Therefore, it is appropriate to ask the Commission to look at ways that we can do that, certainly with ACP countries, under the provisions already existing in the Cotonu agreement. For some developing countries, tourism accounts for something like 50% of GDP, so we should be aware of that. We can be positive; it leads to the development of infrastructure, it can help to reduce the isolation of rural communities and it offers new opportunities for vegetable growers and others in developing countries. However, there are downsides, which all of us here would acknowledge. We need to have a proper regulatory framework that ensures that there are no corrupt practices and that there is no property speculation or environmental damage, and it should not be beyond the wit of us as donors to ensure that host countries do not suffer in any way from the development of tourism. What I see and hear from the Commission is that there does not seem to be very much understanding of how we can actually integrate tourism into the broader development strategies we have; that ought to be positive and something that can be thought about. There need to be well publicised penalties, as my colleague has said, for people who are involved in sex tourism because so many people, especially children, are drawn into prostitution and drugs. The European Union has a role to play here, and we have a role in pressing the industry – nobody here has spoken about the responsibility of the tourist industries in our own countries to ensure that their practices do not damage the countries where they are. We need to be sure that we are pressing the need for workers' rights – on low wages, on long hours and on the lack of secure contracts. This is the kind of thing that could be monitored through our ACP relationship with 78 countries.
 Glenys Kinnock (PSE

 Mr President, I will begin by saying how proud I am of the UK Presidency’s very strong commitment to making poverty history. This is a time of unprecedented opportunity in the world. And I believe that, for every obstacle we might face, there is a solution. The world must at last be ready to keep its promises to Africa: on aid, on unpayable debts, and on fair trade. African leaders, as others have said, must deal with governmental issues and with corruption. We must also understand that poor governance is as much a result of pervasive poverty as it is a cause. There are now no ifs or buts or whens. We can work together to invest in better crops, to improve malaria control, to get medicines to the sick, to develop an AIDS vaccine, to protect fragile eco-systems. We can get millions of children into school and we can save precious mothers’ and babies’ lives. We can speed up developments by empowering women, who in Africa are 50% of the population but 70% of its poor. Conflicts can be resolved, the arms trade can be controlled, and companies can and should be made to trade openly and ethically. Africa’s route out of poverty has now been very clearly charted and we need, as Gordon Brown has said, to have a new relationship with Africa. We can be the generation that makes history by transforming the life chances of millions of Africa’s people.

 Mr President, my reason for speaking today is to draw attention to the fact that on 19 June, in the time between this part-session and the next one, Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of Burma’s democracy movement, will celebrate her 60th birthday. On that day she will have spent 9 years 238 days in detention. The junta in Burma is now more hardline and more firmly in control than ever. Aung San Suu Kyi’s house arrest is now more restrictive than it has ever been. She has no visitors; her phone line has been cut; she lives behind a wall of sandbags and barbed wire, patrolled continuously by armed guards and soldiers. We see no sign of change. The last resolution of this Parliament on Burma was very clear. We would ask the Commission to seriously reconsider softening its approach to this regime, which continues to show utter contempt for human rights and democracy. Aung San Suu Kyi is a Nobel Peace Prize winner and a recipient of the Sakharov Prize of this Parliament. She shows breathtaking courage. Thank you, Mr President, for your commitment to Aung San Suu Kyi and to the people of Burma.
 Glenys Kinnock (PSE

 Mr President, I also support the questions that my colleagues have asked the Commission, which are extremely important in terms of how we deal with the continuing crisis in Sudan, in the North-South negotiations as well as in Darfur. As Mr Gahler said, Dr Mudawi, a brave defender of human rights in Sudan was once again arrested by the Sudanese Government, by its National Security and Intelligence Agency. He was about to board a plane, ready to go to be presented with an award by the President of Ireland. That is continuing evidence – as if we needed it – of the determination of the Sudanese Government to harass human rights defenders and arbitrarily arrest, without trial, people who have the audacity to speak out. That evidence needs to be taken into account in the attitudes we take in terms of the EUR 4 billion of budgetary spending that has been allocated. We need to be absolutely clear that we reject and are prepared to speak out about the attitude of the Sudanese Government to anyone who wishes to fight against oppression and for rights and freedoms. The suffering and agony of the Sudanese people demands a renewed and much more determined international effort on their behalf. What we are talking about in Sudan is the real tragedy of our time. It is the failure of the international community to deal with ethnic cleansing, with mass rape and killings in that country. I was looking only this morning at recent reports by NGOs about how banditry continues and how the difficulties of delivering humanitarian aid are exacerbated by this situation. The IDPs in Sudan are reporting very clearly to NGOs – and British NGOs are reporting to me – that they are identifying Arab militias that are now being absorbed into the army of the Government of Sudan and trained as soldiers. The NGOs have reported continuing attacks, again this week, on women collecting firewood. Those women are now so desperate that they are selling part of their food rations in order to buy wood in the markets to try to avoid the attacks they experience as they leave the camps to get firewood. We understand that ethnic cleansing has virtually now stopped. However, if you ask the African Union, they will tell you that it has largely stopped because ethnic cleansing is largely complete in Darfur. Two million people are homeless, and they are still being terrorised by the Janjaweed militias. It is estimated that 197 000 people are seeking refuge in the inhospitable deserts of Chad, which we visited last December. Those people have lost everything but are still prepared, in desperation, to leave their country to go to Chad. The desperation of those people in Sudan puts into perspective some of the debates that we have in our countries in Europe about asylum and immigration. Peacekeeping remains the key issue. The African Union is hopelessly stretched at this time and cannot fulfil its mandate unless we see much more concerted efforts to beef up the military support that they need in that country.
 Kinnock (PSE

 Mr President, the Millennium Declaration adopted by world leaders in 2000 represents an unprecedented declaration of solidarity. It is evidence that there is real determination to achieve the Millennium Development Goal targets, which would lift 500 million people out of extreme poverty, would save 30 million children who would otherwise die before their fifth birthday, and would save more than 2 million mothers who would otherwise not have survived pregnancy and childbirth. Hundreds of millions of women and girls would be educated, and millions would have access to clean water and sanitation. The world has the technologies, the policies and the financial resources to deliver the promise and vision of the MDGs. On aid, MDG8 highlights the need for substantial increases in ODA. Only four Member States have already reached the 0.7% target. Others have set timetables. Austria, Germany, Greece, Italy and Portugal, meanwhile, are all far off target. At the current rate, Germany will not reach its target until 2087. Italy, one of the world’s wealthiest countries and a G-8 member, gives only a miserly 0.17% of its GNI in aid. There has to be close monitoring of annual intermediate targets by EU finance ministers and foreign ministers. I should like to ask the Commissioner to respond to that part of our resolution. The financial perspective suggests that further squeezing of development spending by other categories, as well as within the external relations category, threatens the likelihood of us contributing as we should to meeting the MDG targets. The Commission must continue to work to improve the quality and effectiveness of our aid using the MDGs as the tool to guide our policies. Member States should collaborate and coordinate in a coherent way more than they do currently with the Commission, in order to tackle how aid can be best used to serve and fulfil the MDGs. On unsustainable debt, most EU Member States are committed to cancelling the bilateral debts of the world’s poorest countries. Again, I am afraid that Italy must be singled out and named and shamed as a country continuing to make progress at a snail’s pace on this issue. On trade, I totally agree and concur with the opinion presented by the Committee on International Trade, which covers a number of our concerns as far as the European Union’s role as the world’s biggest trading bloc is concerned: our role in dealing with access to markets, building capacity and other aspects of trade and trade liberalisation. The European Union negotiates in a way that sometimes calls into question whether there is a clear enough understanding of the pro-development objectives that are referred to on so many occasions. This is true of both the WTO negotiations and the EPA negotiations where I can confirm that, as far as ACP countries are concerned, there is the sense of a need to feel that closer consultation has occurred and that there is greater understanding by DG Trade of the development aspects to which they give such high priority. On the common agricultural policy, Member States must urgently tackle the practices that depress world prices, distort poor-country markets and undermine earning opportunities for their farmers. I believe that the amendments on trade and agriculture policies, which we will vote on later, are in all cases inappropriate and, in a number of cases, propose totally unrealistic options. Furthermore, Parliament should reject Amendments 10 to 16, which reflect unacceptable conservative views on essential aspects of MDG targets. The supply of condoms for the treatment of sexually-transmitted diseases and access to safe and legal abortion must remain as clear priorities if the over-arching goal of poverty eradication is to be achieved. Five hundred and thirty thousand women died in pregnancy or childbirth last year. There were more than 3 million stillborn births. Four million infants did not survive their first year of life. We should support the real need to facilitate access to responsive post-abortion procedures. There is also a need to facilitate access to high-quality and safe services to the fullest extent provided and allowed for by the laws in the countries concerned. As the WHO reported only yesterday, 78 000 deaths occur as a result of unsafe abortions. Millions of women in desperate need resort to unsafe induced abortion. I would contradict those people who believe that any woman takes the decision to terminate a pregnancy lightly, and say very firmly that it is not and never would be the case. She has the right to choose good-quality responsive abortion and post-abortion care under the law. A woman has the right to choose. (Applause)

 Mr President, you will be very familiar with the work of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, having been a very effective and hard-working Vice-President of it in the past. I wish to begin by thanking Mr Bowis for his report, which reflects his own very strong personal commitment not only to the JPA but also to development. His particular interest, knowledge and expertise in relation to health issues have been of great importance to our work in that Assembly. His report shows that the Assembly has grown in maturity over the last few years. Its work needs to flourish and be reinforced in the ways indicated in the report, because the Assembly forms the very democratic foundations of the ACP-EU partnership. The Cotonou Partnership Agreement emphasises very clearly the importance of the Assembly, but omits to award enough importance, if any at all, to the role of national parliaments in our cooperation. It is very important that the forms of cooperation we have continue beyond the meetings with our parliamentary colleagues so that we can support their efforts, as elected representatives, to conduct dialogue with their governments, to scrutinise the legislation and actions of their governments and to hold their governments to account. Sadly, an inability to do this is often a feature of the relationship between parliaments and governments in developing countries. As the rapporteur suggested, with reference to the Pan-African Parliament, there is often a lack of institutional capacity. Parliaments are short on staff and equipment and often lack the basic technical knowledge needed to make their work more effective. This is an important issue and one we shall pursue in Mali. In fact, just the other day a Member of the Malian Parliament with whom I am in contact told me that it is difficult for parliamentarians there to exercise legislative power, because the executive branch simply does not provide them with information. I agree with Mr Bowis that an important part of our work is to build up this critical democratic culture in the ACP parliaments with which we work. Central to this are the links with these parliaments that transit through the EDF and financing. As Budget Commissioner, Mrs Grybauskaitė will have a particular interest in ensuring that parliamentarians are aware of how this money is spent in their countries and also in the Economic Partnership Agreements. Mr Bowis talked about the committee's bedding-down. That is happening and the fact that people are slightly dissatisfied about the amount of time they have is merely symptomatic of how successful the whole process is. The JPA continues to grow and flourish, nurtured as it is by our determination to increase our effectiveness and to ensure that both our political voice and that of the parliamentarians from the ACP countries are heard. The JPA has a monitoring and supervisory role that is unique. There is nothing else like it in terms of North-South connections between parliamentarians. We must therefore continue to ensure that we can effect change in the 77 developing countries concerned.
 Kinnock, Glenys (PSE

 – Mr President, as others have said, those who have suffered so much in this disaster want more than just promises of support or the transfer of money from one disaster to another – from Africa to Aceh for example. After all, when USD 1.6 billion was raised for relief in Iraq it was largely at the expense of Africa. We need new, additional money, and the needs of victims of other crises, such as those in Sudan, Congo, Haiti, Liberia and northern Uganda, should not be forgotten. Our efforts should moreover not be at the expense of the eight million people who die every year from preventable diseases such as malaria. I would urge the Commission to look again very closely at the ACP's request to have their own disaster warning facility and would also urge that particular attention be paid to the needs of Somalia and the Seychelles, where thousands of people have been displaced and their livelihoods destroyed. One of the paragraphs in our resolution opposes the use of the EDF B envelope to support those countries in East Africa. Indeed, it is very unclear how funds can be made available for Somalia from an EDF envelope from which it does not even benefit.

 Mr President, the dramatic events in Côte d'Ivoire have once again alerted us to the fragility of the situation in that country, which in the past was recognised as a great economic success in an otherwise very volatile region of Africa. People used to flock there in search of work and prosperity. The situation is very worrying because there has been clear incitement to violence. This is particularly resonant when one recalls that exactly the same situation arose in Rwanda, where the militias were urged to attack civilians, and French civilians in particular, in messages broadcast both on government and private radio stations. I welcome the fact that this incitement to violence through broadcasts has been dealt with in the UN resolution, but would also like to see the United Nations being granted, as part of its mandate, a peacekeeper's right to deal with such situations. The situation in Côte d'Ivoire is primarily about the blame game. When I was there around a year ago on an ACP-EP mission, there was a great deal of talk from the North and the South, the rebels and the government, about which side was responsible for the failure of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement. The resentment in that country is not just against France. The weight of history is now being used as a potent weapon to arouse popular resentment against President Gbagbo and France. Some fear that Abidjan is going the way of Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a country whose skyscrapers and boulevards now lie in ruins. My view is based on what I saw when I was in Côte d'Ivoire, and is that this confrontation is much more between African and African. It pits ethnic groups from the North against ethnic groups from the South and landowners against migrant workers who want to be landowners. It is also a confrontation over Côte d'Ivoire's most valuable asset, cocoa. What makes the situation particularly intractable is that there are issues that were never resolved at independence and which have continued to fester ever since. These are questions such as: who exactly is a citizen of the Ivory Coast? Who can rule the Ivory Coast? Who can stand for election in the Ivory Coast? Who can own land in the Ivory Coast? The northerners claim that they are being disenfranchised and are continuously being discriminated against by the elites – as they see them – in the South. The problems in Côte d'Ivoire will never be resolved until property rights and other demands are addressed. Finally, with reference to the UN resolution, I agree that the arms embargo is of great importance. What the previous speaker did not mention, however, was the very important fact that this embargo was strongly supported by the African Union, which is a very positive development. Chapter VII of the UN Charter authorises the use of force in the event of the arms embargo not being respected. I should therefore like to ask the Commission how it will ensure the EU supports and works with the UN in its efforts in Côte d'Ivoire and takes stronger action, over and above Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, in respect of the situation there.

 Thank you, Commissioner, for the commitment you have made during your term of office to trying to ensure a better situation for the suffering people of Burma. I just wanted to follow up on the last common position, where there is a distinct lack of clarity regarding the lists of companies. What exactly is meant by the measures that have been put in place? Having said that – and it is clear from your response earlier on, Commissioner, that we are not going to get much more clarity on this – could we have an assurance from you that the Commission will look very closely and on a regular basis at the list of companies affected, and will update the list regularly, having monitored very carefully what will be necessary if this is going to be effective in any way?

 Mr President, I too welcome what is an extremely necessary and timely initiative by the Commissioner, and I would also like to thank him very much for his cooperation and hard work during his time as Commissioner, which Parliament has appreciated very much. However, although I welcome the initiative, it must be said that it is very general. The Commissioner himself acknowledges that it contains a lot of very broad proposals. We want more information on thresholds for graduation and on how much the GSP will be improved for countries that are not graduated. I also look forward to more details on the rules of origin, because it is quite difficult to judge at this point whether what is being proposed is anything more than cosmetic. I would like to know whether the Commissioner agrees with my assessment that if the EU substantially enhances its preference system, it could meet the requirements of the improved GSP option, the EPA alternative, which some non-LDCs are continuing to call for, as the Commissioner is well aware. At the meeting in Gaborone, the EU agreed to postpone until 2006 the anticipated review of the situation of non-LDCs that are not in a position to enter into EPAs. It also seems to me that WTO rules allow for differentiation between developing countries in non-reciprocal trade preference schemes, provided that such arrangements are based on objective criteria and that identical treatment is available to all similarly-situated developing countries. On the basis of that analysis, I would like the Commissioner to be more specific on whether, when Cotonou was negotiated, an enhanced GSP was looked at as an option for those that could not or did not want to enter into EPA negotiations. I asked for this information in committee, but I was not entirely satisfied with the answer. Finally, I should like the Commissioner to provide more information and clarity on what is meant by 'vulnerable', 'special development needs' and 'small economies'. The Commissioner talked about landlocked countries, etc., but he needs to spell things out more clearly so that we know exactly what he means.

 Mr President, I would like to say at the very outset that everything I saw in Darfur confirmed the view that what we are seeing there is a genocide. The evidence and the testimonies that we took from the people we spoke to all referred to collaboration between the Janjaweed and the Government of Sudan. What the people talked about was coordinated violence against them. It was not random violence, it was coordinated by the Janjaweed with the assistance and collusion of the Government of Sudan. We heard of decapitation, burning, brutality, terror and awful suffering from the people that we spoke to. It was only in 1994, when I was in Rwanda, that I ever saw the degree of terror in people's eyes that I saw in those camps in Darfur and in Chad. We need to see an effective global arms embargo, an international commission of inquiry; we need targeted sanctions against those, both in government and business, who have been connected with these atrocities and I believe that there should be an oil embargo. 320 000 barrels of oil are produced each day but the benefits of those barrels of oil never reach the people of Sudan. To both the Commission and the Council I would say that in Al Fasha the African Union expressed no enthusiasm for an increased protection force. They had little coordination with the United Nations or discussion on the plan of action. They called for more monitors and for an international policing and human rights monitoring force. They said they were not able to deal with the current challenges they faced, never mind having to deal with a substantially increased force. They were very clear and very adamant on that. To both the Commission and Council I would also say that the plan of action agreed by the UN is leading to the Government of Sudan now deploying forces towards the safe areas, into the rebel areas, and causing immense instability and difficulty. They are contravening the no-fly zone. When we landed in Al Fasha, an attack helicopter was hovering overhead. On our visit to one village, we saw the rockets that had been fired at the people, destroying the village and sending the people scattering into the bush. We want to hear no more of 'never again' from anyone in the international community. We have to challenge the Government of Sudan and stop its relentless Orwellian denial of what is happening in its country. The pattern of violence must stop.

– Mr President, I would like to make an explanation of vote on the Brok report: firstly, as a tribute to the work that Mr Brok has done in this institution; secondly, to show my support for the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, but, more importantly, to urge my Government, when the Lisbon Treaty is ratified and when we have an extra seat coming to the United Kingdom, to allocate that seat to the people of Gibraltar. I am proud to have represented Gibraltar for the past five years in this Parliament and I am happy to continue. But I honestly have to say that it is difficult for the seven Members who have been elected to represent Gibraltar to do full justice over the range of issues that come to us: human rights, whistle-blowing, pensions, cross-border pollution and, of course, bilateral relations with Spain. Some people argue that the numbers do not work. It will be giving up too much to give Gibraltar a seat. Well, for many years in this institution Denmark gave a seat to Greenland. Greenland has around twice the population of Gibraltar. Denmark gave 8% of its seats to 50 000 people. I am asking the British Government to give less than 1.5% of its seats to the 26 000 people in Gibraltar.

– The sentencing of Roxana Saberi on 18 April 2009 for ‘spying’ was done without her having any access to a lawyer and on the basis of a trial that was neither fair nor transparent. I am not naive. The US does engage in spying but, if Roxana Saberi was a spy, the Iranian authorities by their actions did nothing to convince anyone of that case. The bias and manipulation of the trial and the accused were a travesty of any sense of justice. I can only welcome the resolution’s demand that Roxana Saberi should be released immediately on the grounds that the trial was held in camera without due legal process and there was a complete failure to comply with international norms.

− Madam President, I speak on behalf of the Socialist Group and as the Party of European Socialists’ shadow rapporteur on the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the group of southern African countries that included Madagascar. In April we overwhelmingly approved that Economic Partnership Agreement with reservations about the situation in Zimbabwe. If we were debating that EPA today, we would have to enter our reservations regarding Madagascar. Yet only 15 years ago there seems to have been the potential for Madagascar to be so different. I can remember in 1993 the visit of the then newly elected President Albert Zafy. But, of course, by 1996 he had been impeached for corruption and the abuse of power. Since then, Madagascar has been troubled by unstable governments with threats of secession and impeachment punctuating a rough politics. Now we have a situation – an army coup d’état – partly triggered by a plan by the former government to lease one million acres of land in the south of the country to a Korean firm for intensive farming, when a substantial majority of the population live on less than one euro a day. This unconstitutional change of government is a serious setback for democratisation. We welcome the fact that the UN has appealed for nearly USD 36 million worth of humanitarian aid, anticipating the food shortages that will result later this year from the current political events in Madagascar, but we strongly condemn the coup d’état and all attempts to seize power by undemocratic means. We call for the immediate restoration of the legal and constitutional order in the country and ask all Malagasy parties to comply fully with the provisions of the constitution. We want to see the suspension of the National Assembly and Senate lifted and urge that the mandates and immunities of parliamentarians be respected. But this is only going to happen if the international community can work together to step up its efforts and exercise pressure to end the political violence and the political impasse in that country.

 I voted in favour of this report, and in particular Amendments 51 and 52, which replace the oldest Member taking the chair at the opening of the new Parliament by a ‘provisional choice’. I do not understand why we have ever had this bizarre rule. Maybe the ‘father or mother’ of the House has a logic. The longest serving Member at least has experience to fall back on, rather than merely age. We have already had this system abused by Mr Le Pen and his Front National when in 1989 Claude Autant-Lara was parachuted into this Parliament and made a farce of the opening of the institution with a lengthy and highly offensive intervention. Within months he had stood down, having performed his function of bringing ridicule upon the European Parliament. We cannot, 20 years on, allow Mr Le Pen a second opportunity to bring Europe into disrepute.

 When I was first elected to the European Parliament 25 years ago, it was shortly after an ‘initial ban’ on the trade in seal products in 1983. Unfortunately, despite revisiting the issue on a number of occasions, this is still unfinished business. The situation, a quarter of a century on, is scarcely any better than back in 1983. We still see hundreds of thousands of seals culled in Canada in the most cruel and brutal slaughter. Hopefully today’s vote will be sufficiently overwhelming to finally achieve what we thought we had managed 25 years ago. Neither I nor the seals want us to be back here in 2034.

 Thank you very much. Maybe the Commissioner would comment on the situation of the German Government on this matter. Like Mr Martin, I am a supporter of this free trade agreement with the Republic of Korea. However, we do need to be careful about details and timing. It is estimated that 650 000 Korean cars would sell in Europe per annum. While there is already some production in eastern Europe, there will be a significant volume of new imports. Most surveys indicate that these will substitute the sales of Japanese cars produced in Europe, like those produced by the Honda plant in my constituency in Swindon. This plant is currently mothballed and the workers are on standby. In order not to exacerbate the current situation here and elsewhere in Europe, will you ensure that there is a serious time lag before such imports are allowed?

 I will be brief, as I realise there is very little time. Commissioner, I have to say that the implementation of the rights we have are, frankly, a joke at the moment. I was recently in Amsterdam and watched KLM dealing with delayed passengers by rebooking them on a self check-in. The staff systematically, without asking the passengers, declined the compensation and assistance which they were entitled to. Can we have some monitoring by the Commission? Can we have some people actually at airports looking at what the airlines do? Because, frankly, it seems to me that it has become a joke.

 Mr President, I want to urge you to intervene with the Commission on behalf of a group of my constituents. The citizens of Gibraltar, whom I have had the honour of representing formally for five years and informally for two decades before that, are gravely concerned about the cancer clusters that have recently been discovered both in Gibraltar and on the Spanish side of the border. It is difficult when you are in Gibraltar not to see, and occasionally smell, the smoke and pollution from the refineries adjacent to the border, and the concern is that these are the causes of the cancer clusters. What we would like to see is a joint investigation on both sides and jointly agreed terms of reference, to try and alleviate the worries and concerns that people on both sides of the border have about the problems of pollution and its consequences.

 I supported the Beer report on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, including Amendments 5 and 8 that called for Europe to become a nuclear weapons free zone, because I am in favour of nuclear disarmament. I welcome President Obama’s initiative in this regard. Yet the US and others are still in denial, firstly about Israel’s massive nuclear weapons capacity that underpins Iran’s drive to become a nuclear weapons power. Secondly, the world’s major proliferation in the past decades has not been Pyongyang but Pakistan. A.Q. Khan and the leaders of Pakistan, supposedly allies of the West, have done more to make our world more dangerous than any of the ‘states of concern’ or the whole ‘axis of evil’ together.

I recognise the fact that there are many rare diseases that are orphaned from research as medical institutes engage in a form of triage, ignoring the plight of those suffering from unusual diseases that offer little in the way of profits compared to those potentially available from common diseases. This is particular true of rare genetic diseases that are hereditary. I believe we should encourage research in these areas by underpinning an element of the research costs. In doing this I declare an interest in that one of these diseases is to be found within my family.

 I welcome Caroline Lucas’s report laying down certain obligations on operators who place timber and timber products on the market. I was the draftsman for the opinion of the International Trade Committee which was adopted unanimously in committee. For us, the best way to stop the trade in illegal timber was to strengthen requirements and obligations and enhance the legal means to prosecute possession and sales by operators placing illegal timber and timber products on the EU market as a deterrent. We need to work together with major consuming countries such as the US, China, Russia and Japan to tackle this problem and to set up a global alert system and register of illegal logging and countries of concern using Interpol, an appropriate UN body utilising the latest satellite technology systems.

Since then the situation has improved marginally, but Amnesty International, amongst other NGOs, still exposes the serious problems and abuses of human rights in that country. The improvements have not gone far enough for me to be happy at this stage to vote in favour of the agreement.

 As someone who has reservations regarding the long-term safety of nuclear power stations I am not entirely happy with this report. I accept that those who work in the industry are dedicated professionals. I accept accidents are few and far between. Yet the problem is the consequences when there is an accident are potentially so extreme. We cannot forget the nuclear accident in the Urals revealed by Roy Medvedev, the Three Mile Island accident that involved the events of the film The China Syndrome
 that went on release only days before the accident, nor the Tokaimura accident in Japan, nor finally Chernobyl, whose consequences live with us all today but most tragically have been visited on the people and children living in the immediate vicinity or born to parents who were there.

 Mr President, let me be clear: I support the extension of copyright from 50 to 70 years. My problem is: who benefits? I welcome the fact that, as demanded by the Musicians’ Union, session musicians are going to get 20% of the profits for distribution. The problem is the balance between the multinational record companies and the featured artists. Many of these people signed contracts 30 or 40 years ago that gave them 8% of the dealer’s price, with the companies responsible for producing, distributing and collecting the money from sales. Now these selfsame multinational record companies will get a multi-million-euro windfall for doing absolutely nothing because, in this new digital age, there is nothing to do. On the basis of an industrial structure long made redundant by technological change, it is the Sheriff of Nottingham winning, not Robin Hood. These artists should have been able to reclaim their property that they alone were responsible for creating.

My only reservation is with regard to Amendment 39, part of which argues that freedom of speech should not be compromised, even in cases of harassment. We rightly have restrictions on freedom of speech covered by the laws of libel and slander. Equally you cannot with impunity shout ‘fire’ in a cinema. On that basis I have to vote against this particular amendment with the threat it would pose to minorities.

I am not willing to equate the crimes of the Nazis, the Holocaust and the genocide that saw six million Jews, along with Communists, Trade Unionists and disabled die, with those of Stalinist Russia. This political relativism threatens to dilute the unique nature of the Nazi crimes, and in doing so provides an intellectual underpinning to the ideologies of today’s neo-Nazis and fascists, some of whom are with us here today.

 While I welcome the bulk of Mr Lambsdorff’s report on EU priorities for the 64th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, I have a problem with his call at this stage for a single European Union seat on the UN Security Council. I am in favour of a reform of the Security Council to recognise the new global political realities – Japan, Germany, India and Brazil can make good cases for membership and it would be invidious to exclude representation from Africa. But support, or not, for a single EU seat should come at the end of a negotiating process – even if it has a logic – not at the beginning. On that basis I felt it appropriate to abstain on this report.

 Madam President, firstly can I apologise to the Commissioner and to my fellow rapporteurs for missing the debate until about five minutes ago? I have been delayed getting here and have managed to arrive at the last minute. I hope that I will not be repeating what other people have said, or at least not too much, and can I ask them to bear in mind my apology for that? I am actually speaking on two issues: I am speaking as the rapporteur on the Interim Economic Partnership Agreement with the Pacific and as the shadow rapporteur on behalf of the Socialist Group on behalf of the Interim Economic Partnership with Eastern and Southern Africa. The whole debate that we are having this evening was not triggered by any decision of the European Commission or the European Union that we wanted a new trade relationship with the countries of the African, Caribbean and Pacific, but by a decision – a decade or more or so now – of the World Trade Organisation that we were unfairly discriminating in favour of some developing countries at the expense of others. Some people have said that this should be just about development – I am very much in favour of that – but we have to bear in mind that one of the underlying requirements is that it is actually about making our agreements with these countries WTO-compatible. So we have to do that; that it is the first thing. On top of WTO compatibility, we must do whatever we can to try and improve the situation of these various regional blocks and to try and deal with the particular situations that actually face them. With respect to the Pacific, for which I am the rapporteur, we have a collection of 14 – plus one if you include East Timor – very small nation-states. One, in fact, is the smallest country in the world, with a population that is exactly one million times less than that of China – Nauru. But even the biggest ones are actually comparatively small, and we need to take that into account in what requirements and demands we put on them. We need to make sure that there are adequate transition periods for small and medium-sized enterprises because, quite frankly, apart from some mining enterprises in Papua New Guinea, they are all small and medium-sized enterprises. We need to do what we can about regional trade and in particular to take into account the special relationship that countries of the Pacific have with Australia and with New Zealand. Only two of the 14 have actually signed up for the Interim Agreement. However, I know from my visit to Port Moresby at the last ACP meeting that there are other Pacific countries that would like to sign a final agreement provided it meets their requirements, which is why, in my case, I am actually in favour of the interim agreement. That is the message I got, both from the governments of Papua New Guinea and Fiji. Not that they are entirely happy – there are issues that they would like to renegotiate – but they see the answer as being signing up and accepting an interim agreement which would lead towards a final agreement which will be more development friendly and will enable more of the Pacific countries to actually engage. We also need to look at a number of specific issues that apply in particular in Papua New Guinea and Fiji and elsewhere in the Pacific, but may apply to some other of these agreements. We need to look at intellectual property right negotiations that cover not only Western technological artefacts but traditional knowledge; we need to make sure that there is a transparency of government procurement with openness to European contracts triggered at a point appropriate to the needs of the Pacific nation-states; we need to look in the case of the Pacific particularly at working visas to be made available in the European Union to Pacific island nationals for periods of at least 24 months for them to be able to work – not in the higher professions but probably working as carers and in similar occupations. Can I say, with respect to eastern and southern Africa, that many of these points would apply there? I particularly would like to thank Mr Caspary for working together with me on this and, on the Pacific, let me say the work of Mr Audy. But with respect to the ESA we need to look at good-governance issues in particular. This includes Zimbabwe. I do not have a problem with an interim agreement but I think a final agreement would be difficult for Parliament to accept unless there was a clear road map in the case of Zimbabwe to see an establishment of a properly democratic regime there and one that could find some way out of the difficulties it is in at the moment. The last point I would like to make in relation to ESA, apart from to endorse the report of Mr Caspary – with some of the amendments which have been tabled – is to mention the situation of the Chagos Archipelago. It is in there because I tabled an amendment, which was accepted. Normally in these kinds of agreements we actually consult with neighbouring countries and neighbouring territories. The Chagos Archipelago is in the middle of part of this region: Seychelles-Mauritius-Madagascar. These people are currently refugees in Seychelles, and I hope that we will consult with them between now and any final agreement being made as to what the impact might be on them and on their territory should they get the right to return.
 Glyn Ford,

– Madam President, the Socialist Group is concerned about the human rights situation in China. While we recognise that the situation has improved significantly over the last 10 years, there are still many areas where human rights are still not properly or adequately protected. There may be a degree of freedom of thought, but there is not freedom of action. We would certainly highlight the failure to allow free trade unions to operate within China. We are concerned about the plight of the 100 million migrant workers who have moved from country to city and who have the most limited access to health and education. We are concerned about the plight of religious and ethnic minorities across the whole of China. Nevertheless, the Socialist Group was opposed to this debate and resolution. The reason was proportionality. It is right to criticise China for its human rights record, as we criticise the United States for its use of the death penalty, Guantánamo and extraordinary rendition, but we do not have to do it every part-session. Frankly, it is becoming counterproductive. At one time, the Chinese authorities paid heed to our resolutions, but no more. As some individuals and groups in their desperate attention-seeking continue to up the ante with today a demand, I think for the first time, that Member States should abrogate the one-China policy and recognise the Tibetan government-in-exile. The Dalai Lama was here only in December, speaking on behalf of Tibet in the plenary. Why is it necessary to revisit the issue again? There is nothing new in the resolution. I, along with Elmar Brok, Philippe Morillon and other Members of this Parliament, had the opportunity last summer to visit Lhasa. We were the first international group to travel there after the troubles in March and spoke both to the authorities and those who were sympathetic to the Tibetan protesters. As I wrote afterwards, the reality was that peaceful protests – and we support peaceful protest – turned into race riots, when shops, homes and Han Chinese were attacked and burned, with dozens of deaths. Schools suffered arson attacks and hospitals and mosques of the Muslim minority were attacked. The Dalai Lama himself recognised the reality of the situation when he threatened at the time to step down as a living god. China has done an enormous amount for Tibet in terms of providing infrastructure, like the new Qinghai–Lhasa railway, and higher levels of social provision than elsewhere in rural China. The problem is it is beginning to be resented elsewhere within China. (Protests)
 But the problem is, to quote the Beatles: ‘Money can’t buy you love’. Tibetans still want a degree of cultural and political autonomy far beyond that which China is prepared to grant. As I said at the time, China needs a dialogue with representatives of Tibet to find a solution that grants that autonomy, while protecting minority rights of ethnic and religious groups in the province. The alternative is that impatient, young Tibetans will turn to violence and terrorism. As a result of the article I wrote at the time, I was asked to discuss the matter with Dalai Lama’s representative in London, which I did at some length. I agree with the Commissioner: it is through dialogue and engagement that we will find a way forward, not through shrill, endlessly repetitive, rehashed resolutions, such as the one we have here today.

The bail out of the banks was a necessary but not sufficient step. We must also take steps to deal with the problems of the labour market. Work-sharing must be encouraged and when short time is demanded, we should encourage maintaining hours at the workplace by utilising the time for training to improve skills. The real crisis is not in the subprime mortgage market but rather in the ten times larger casino economy of the increasingly esoteric and fantasy world of the derivatives market, which needs to be brought under control. I therefore welcome moves to control tax havens and to introduce an EU-wide financial transaction tax to overcome the worst consequences of the crisis, mitigate speculation and raise finance to help us stay on track to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.

 I support the Fava report on sanctions against employers of illegally staying third-country workers. Some unscrupulous employers are prepared to exploit these illegal workers with wage rates below the legal minimum, appalling conditions and long working hours. Where they do get caught they must face severe sanctions. Yet the problem is that there is a vicious conspiracy to keep the exploitation hidden. The employers made the profits which they clearly do not wish to surrender while the workers, if they expose the exploitation, face deportation. If we are serious we must have a policy that gives amnesty to those who expose the exploiters. This would change the balance of power between employees and employers in a way that would virtually eliminate the problem.

 Mr von Wogau has my congratulations on his work both here and more generally for his chairmanship of the Subcommittee on Security and Defence. I support the idea of an EU Operational Military Headquarters being established. Of course NATO should be and is our first port of call when security is threatened. Yet during the Bush-Gore debates just over a decade ago, George Bush said that had he been President he would not have intervened in Kosovo.

 – I congratulate Mr Vatanen on his report which I endorse. In particular, I support the idea of an EU Operational Military Headquarters being established. Of course, NATO should be, and is, our first port of call when security is threatened. Yet during the Bush-Gore debates just over a decade ago, George Bush said that had he been President he would not have intervened in Kosovo. Now despite my antipathy to the Bush Administration’s foreign policy, it seems to me that it is a perfectly reasonable position for Bush to take on the basis of US self-interest.

− The European Parliamentary Labour Party abstained on this report not because we are opposed to enhancing the role of European SMEs in international trade, but because Mrs Muscardini has produced a Trojan horse that contains within it unacceptable positions on Trade Defence Instruments. We are disappointed that the Commission has shelved the review because of difficulties in securing a consensus on the way forward. Our view remains that there is an urgent need to amend the Community’s trade defence regime so that it takes better account of developments in the global economy. Lack of reform means that our industry is badly placed to take advantage of the benefits of globalisation. While we welcome the Czech Presidency’s inclusion in the work programme of improving the transparency of Trade Defence Instruments, this is not enough.

 Climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing the world today. I am in favour of energy-efficient light bulbs, but frankly it is not enough. We will all have to make and put up with changes to our lifestyle and lives that are far more drastic and dramatic. I was recently asked at a public meeting in Cheltenham in my constituency what I thought was the most important thing that could be done to combat global warming and climate change. My response was clear: ratify the Lisbon Treaty. Without a strong powerful EU with competence in Common Foreign and Security Policy I do not believe we will get the US and Japan, China and India, to take the necessary measures. The backing and encouragement of a powerful EU speaking with a single voice will do more to combat climate change than millions of energy-efficient light bulbs.

− I voted in favour of the Laperrouze report on the Second Strategic Energy Review despite (for me) its over-enthusiasm for nuclear energy. I am not in favour of early closure of safe nuclear plants, but my enthusiasm for new plants is extremely limited. In my own region, the South-West of England, we have the possibility of constructing a tidal barrage across the Severn that would, with far less potential damage to the environment, have an output of two nuclear power stations and provide in a ‘green’ way 5% of Britain’s energy needs. I also voted in favour of the Green Amendment 22 pointing out the delay and escalating costs of the fusion power ITER project. I was not in favour of basing this joint project in Europe as the host pays a disproportionate part of the total budget. I was therefore in favour of Japan, which wanted it, hosting this white elephant. Far earlier than anticipated, I am being proved right.
 Glyn Ford  (PSE

 Mr President, last Monday the British Government announced feasibility studies into five tidal-power schemes in the Severn Estuary: three would be barrages and two would be lagoons. The EU has rightly set ambitious targets for renewable energy, but the idea that achieving these targets will be pain-free is a delusion. The Severn barrage could supply up to 5% of the UK’s energy needs, yet this would challenge interpretations of the Habitats Directive. The result of legal arguments – or public opinion – blocking the scheme would be to prove the truth of Nietzsche’s dictum that madness is rare in individuals, but common in parties, groups and organisations. The EU and the British Government should ponder Jeremy Bentham’s philosophy that we should look for the greatest good for the greatest number.

 Madam President, we in the Party of European Socialists are committed to a successful outcome of the Doha Development Round, yet the ticking of the political clock has created a situation where, if you like, progress is on hold. Commissioner Ashton made the point that in the United States we have a new, and from my point of view, very welcome, administration in that of President Obama, but we are waiting for a review of trade policy, which may take some time. In April or May there will be elections in India. The one place Commissioner Ashton did not mention was the European Union itself, where we have our own European Parliament elections in June, and following that a new incoming Commission, in which I hope Commissioner Ashton will continue to serve as Trade Commissioner. Yet that does not mean that there is nothing to do in the interim. Europe must continue to emphasise its commitment to development and free trade within the context of ensuring an end to exploitation and meeting the need for sustainable development. I agree with Mr Papastamkos: free trade on this basis can be a win-win situation for all participants. The current financial and economic crisis is a reason to move forward and not to retreat. Commissioner Ashton and the Commission can try to prepare the ground for a compromise between the United States and India. It was obstinacy on both sides, in my view, that acted to scupper a successful conclusion at the last time of asking. Matters may be 80% agreed, but we need the other 20%. We have one new administration in the United States. The outcome of the Indian election may give us another. In the mean time, we have no choice but to continue to pursue bilateral agreements. I welcome the progress made in last week’s negotiations on the free trade agreement with the Republic of Korea, where I understand we are close to reaching an agreement which, again, will benefit both sides. I am the rapporteur on the free trade agreement with ASEAN, and have to say that the negotiating basis is creating an institutional road block. We need to consider the possibility of looking at a coalition of the willing and able among ASEAN who can, if you like, sign off on an agreement. As with India, there is in my view currently no governmental will to achieve an outcome. After the election, Delhi’s incoming administration, whether new or old, must put up, or we the EU must move on to those who want not just to talk, but to arrive at a conclusion. Finally, I welcome Mr Pannella, the next speaker, who is the new ALDE spokesman on trade. Maybe a visit to the Committee on International Trade would prove appropriate. We would welcome him.

Hamas random rocket attacks cannot be supported, yet it was not entirely the responsibility of Hamas that the cease-fire ended. The Israeli action is entirely disproportionate and its targeting of innocent civilians – men, women and children – is a form of collective punishment that is in contravention of international humanitarian law. The attacks on UN offices and its aid provision seem deliberately aimed at cutting off aid to the needy and removing independent observers of Israel’s barbaric actions.

 I supported the Catania report on the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union (2004-2008). In particular, I voted in favour of paragraph 32, which calls for the ruling by the European Court on the People’s Mujahedin Organisation of Iran (PMOI) to be respected. This ruling demanded that the PMOI should be taken off the EU terror list. I hold no particular brief for this organisation. A long time ago, I stopped signing their declarations regarding the situation in Iran, which I had more difficulty finding credible, particularly after participating in a Foreign Affairs Committee Delegation to Teheran when I could see for myself the emerging reformist opposition to the hardline fundamentalist regime in Iran. Nevertheless, I do not have to support the organisation to deplore the failure to implement the Court’s view that the PMOI’s action gives no reason to include, or continue to include, them on the terror list thus visiting on them all the repressive consequences that follow.

This is not the position taken by farmers in other Member States. Nevertheless, the real impact is unclear with the failure to provide a satisfactory impact assessment on the proposal in its current form.

 I supported the report by Mr Susta. Counterfeiting can be the destroyer of jobs, the cause of ill-health and the source of funding to international criminal gangs and terrorists. Because of this it is vital that Parliament, Council and Commission take whatever steps are necessary. Yet multinational corporations in their search to maximise profits create a climate that encourages the production of counterfeit goods and public acceptance of the process. I will give one example. The regionalisation/zoning of DVDs sees massive price differences across regions which consumers can only access by adapting illegally their DVD players or purchasing pirate DVDs illegally, as a global single market in their product has been prevented by technological chicanery. Imagine other companies indulging their profit-seeking in similar ways across the board.

 I welcome both of these reports, the first on ‘measures necessary for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting’ and ‘extending the measures necessary for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting’. As I have said on a number of previous occasions, the decision to issue EUR 500 and EUR 200 notes, which are five times larger than and twice as large as the largest dollar or yen note in general circulation, makes the euro potentially the currency of choice both for money-laundering and counterfeiting.

 As a member of the Committee on Petitions I welcome the report by my colleague Simon Busuttil on misleading directory companies. The companies are nasty parasites on small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the Union. They write deeply ambiguous letters to SMEs inviting them to complete or update their business name and contact details, giving them the false impression that they will be listed in a business directory free of charge. As such, these are often dealt with by junior members of staff. Signatories and companies consequently discover they have unintentionally signed up to a contract, normally binding for a minimum period of three years, at an annual cost of EUR 1 000 plus. The 400 petitions received from SMEs detail the harassment, stress, embarrassment, frustration and financial loss suffered because of the actions of these conmen and women. This report rightly applauds the action by the Austrian Government to outlaw these practices. What this report demands is that the Commission and the other 26 Member States follow Austria’s example and root out the activities of these fraudsters.

I do not dispute the legal validity of the decisions made, but I do dispute that they reflect the intention of Parliament, Commission and Council when the Posted Workers Directive was approved. The conclusion is clear: that the Directive must be reviewed to amend its provisions to restore our original intention. It must be a priority for the European Commission. It needs to be urgently addressed. If this Commission does not rectify the situation, the next Commission after the 2009 European elections must.

 Mr President, you will be pleased to know that I am not going to talk about Strasbourg, or even the fact that your eyesight is getting worse as about half the Members you have called appeared not to be in the room. What I want to talk about is the Penhallow fire – which I have mentioned before in this House – a fire disaster which took place on 17 and 18 August last year in my constituency. A newsletter has recently been produced which suggests that the fire doors were not adequate, that sprinklers would have actually saved the hotel from being burnt down and that, in fact, the fire was arson. These are speculations made by an, admittedly inexperienced, fire officer, but the problem is that neither the fire service nor the police have published the official report. As Commissioner Kuneva is at the moment in the process of looking at proposals for improving hotel fire safety across Europe, can I ask her to urge the authorities in the United Kingdom to actually publish a report so that we can get to the bottom of this matter?

We welcome the involvement of the African Union in the process, but we urge the Commission to engage in this dialogue to try to find a peaceful and democratic solution to the current crisis and to use, if necessary, the threat that we will cut off all aid – apart from food and humanitarian aid – to Mauritania if we do not find a satisfactory solution in the coming months.

 Mr President, I would like to acknowledge the enormous amount of work my colleague, Syed Kamall, has put into this report on trade in services, but I am afraid I cannot unreservedly congratulate him on his work, as I have fundamental disagreements with some elements of his approach. The key issue is services of general economic interest. Here, normally in the European Parliament, between the Socialist and the Christian-Democrat groups we reach a point of compromise that reflects the political balance of forces in this institution. But I am afraid, here on this occasion, that compromise has not been reached: in fact, we have heard some comments from his colleagues that suggest that some of his own group members, those with a more developed social conscience, are squirming and feeling rather uncomfortable with the approach that has been taken by the rapporteur. This must be the most liberal report – and I say that, in case there is any confusion, in the pejorative sense of the term – that the International Trade Committee has ever passed to the plenary. It makes no effective distinction between commercial and non-commercial services, and I and a large majority of my group will only be able to vote in favour of Mr Kamall’s report if Amendment 2, Amendment 11 and, in particular, Amendment 5 are adopted, which will protect universal, accessible and high-standard public services for all.

Equally the proposal to invite the Dalai Lama to the General Affairs Council is absurd to anyone who is not deliberately trying to undermine the EU-China relationship.

 I supported all the amendments to the Committee on Transport and Tourism’s report on the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 881/2004 establishing a European Railway Agency. In the United Kingdom we have seen a growth of more than a fifth in the number of passengers on the train. In the short term this has led to enormous difficulties as over-crowded trains have led to enormous congestion and as passengers in certain regions – including my own, the South West of England – have resented and protested at the movement of rolling stock around the country. At the same time campaigns are moving to re-open long closed stations and lines to cope with demand and the need to reduce carbon emissions, such as the campaign in Radstock, Somerset. In the longer term, new orders for rolling stock will alleviate the crisis but, if Europe’s railways are to continue to flourish, we need some strategic thinking that hopefully a strengthened European Railway Agency can provide.

 Madam President, I will be supporting this resolution and the majority of the amendments that have been tabled to it, including those on behalf of my colleague Erika Mann. In my constituency thousands of jobs depend on Airbus directly, particularly in the Filton area of Bristol, and of course across the United Kingdom and in the European Union tens of thousands of jobs depend on the success of Airbus. I would have criticised Mr Kamall to his face for his approach, which is widely Eurosceptical and anti-European, but as he buggered off within about two minutes of speaking I will not have the opportunity to direct my criticism to himself. I hope it will be reported by one of his colleagues, who will tell him that normally we try and stay to the end of the debates we participate in, rather than call in, speak and then rush off to do your press release. In 1992 there was an agreement between Boeing and Airbus – or rather between the European Union and the United States – to mutually desist from complaining, even though it was to the advantage of Boeing, who get direct subsidies from the US Government through NASA and the Department of Defense, whereas Airbus merely gets launch loans which have to be repaid with interest. Already EUR 7 billion have been repaid. In 2004 the United States broke that agreement by referring the whole matter to the WTO. The union Unite and the management in the United Kingdom are united in insisting that we put as much pressure as possible on the United States over this matter. The criticism from Boeing and from Congress needs to be resisted – and resisted strongly. If we are to lose our competitivity with respect to Airbus, leaving Boeing alone in the world with a monopoly position, then we will see a loss of contracts and a loss of jobs. A negotiated settlement is clearly the best solution and the best way forward – maybe 1992 plus. But, in its absence, we have no alternative but to vigorously defend our position and the interests of Europe’s economy, competitivity and jobs.

I fully support my colleague’s report, and would have done so in person had it been possible. However, I do not believe that this means we cannot build new coal-fired power stations. The coal industry is once again at the forefront of a revolution, with the 25th anniversary of the miners’ strike fast approaching. This revolution is based on the clean coal and carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies that are being developed at the Hatfield colliery near Doncaster. CCS technologies would mean that 90% of a power station’s CO2
 emissions are captured and then transferred to geological storage. Such technology could revolutionise the way in which the UK satisfies its energy requirements. In addition to the benefits of using a natural resource that we possess in abundance, the jobs created within a nascent clean coal agency could give a lifeline to mining communities that have seen a quarter of a century of economic and social decline.

 I will be voting in favour of this report. I did vote for Green Amendment 7 that complains of President Sarkozy’s ‘sales offensive on nuclear technology worldwide’. I am afraid this macho technology drives far too much of French foreign policy. The rumour is that the reason France is the only Member State not to have established diplomatic relations with North Korea is not through any concern with human rights but because of a failure in 2001 of the then South Korean Government to promise the French nuclear industry a disproportionate share of the nuclear contracts associated with the KEDO project to build two light water reactors in North Korea in exchange for the freezing of their graphite-moderated reactor at Taechon capable of producing weapons-grade plutonium. France’s nuclear obsession makes us all less safe.

 I wish to raise the issue in the context of this debate of US Missile Defence plans, particularly in respect to the Czech Republic. Two thirds of the Czech population are opposed to the building of a radar installation close to Prague as part of these plans. Two Czech peace activists have been on hunger strike for three weeks in protest at the Czech Government’s obstinate support for these plans, despite little evidence that they will do other than make Europe’s security worse rather than better. I welcome the fact that these two are now being joined by key political figures each fasting for 24 hours. I agree with them that the EU needs to reach a common position on the installation of these Star War technologies in Europe. We need an urgent debate in this Chamber with the Council. I hope the President will push for this next month.

 I want to join in condemning Sudan's persistent failure to cooperate with the International Criminal Court (ICC) and to hand over to the ICC Ahmad Harun and Ali Kushayb. To date the conflict in Sudan has claimed 300 000 victims and created two and a half million internally displaced persons. Yet we continue to deliver aid via Ahmad Harun's Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs. I ask the Commission and Member States to cease such deliveries via this ministry, to press the Government of Sudan to remove him from office and to immediately arrest and hand him over to the ICC. It is all very well to lecture China on its failure to act over Darfur, but in this case the EU is as weak-willed as the rest.

 Madam President, we regret the recent clashes between the national defence forces and the National Liberation Front in Burundi. We call on both sides to respect the ceasefire of 7 September last year and particularly demand that the leader of the FNL, Agathon Rwasa, should fully engage in the peace process. We ask the Commission to provide resources to facilitate the reintegration of FNL troops into society, to help provide assistance to the refugees and in particular to demobilise child soldiers that we find in this country. We have to demand that the Government of Burundi respect the rule of law, end the climate of impunity and ensure that those guilty are swiftly brought to justice. That is what we expect from the Commission and the Government.

 I supported all the amendments to the calendar that reduced our time in Strasbourg and increased it in Brussels. The current situation is bizarre, trekking as we do backwards and forwards between Brussels and Strasbourg at vast cost in time and money. We should meet at a single location. I do however reject Mr Stevenson's complaint regarding the current transport strikes. We recognise and support the right to strike. Our objection to Strasbourg is not based on any opposition to the exercise of workers' rights in France, but the inherent waste involved in our current institutional arrangements. I voted against making an exception for the Monday of Orthodox Easter when we make no provision for not meeting on 14 July. Secular celebrations deserve the same treatment as religious festivals.

 I voted for the Oomen-Ruijten report on Turkey's progress towards membership of the EU in 2007. I do believe that Turkey should be capable of joining the Union. Currently there are difficulties on issues of trade-union and human rights and the rights of minorities such as the Kurds and the Christians. However, progress is being made, albeit slowly, and should be acknowledged. I did support the amendments dealing with the Armenian genocide. I know it was a long time ago, but a nation must come to terms with its history and so far Turkey has failed to come to terms with this bloody stain on its record. It may not be a final barrier to membership of the EU, but we cannot in all honestly just sweep it under an all too convenient Turkish carpet.

 Madam President, the tragedy of Burma has been only compounded by the refusal of the military junta to allow the delivery of aid and assistance. They have refused more than token assistance from a US task force, home-based in Okinawa, which was fortuitously deployed off Thailand. While hundreds of thousands have died in the initial disaster, this can only be multiplied massively with the refusal to receive aid and therefore control the outbreak of disease. Oxfam have estimated that up to two thirds of a million people may be threatened in the current circumstances. We have to urge everyone – the Chinese, the European Union, other neighbours – to put as much pressure as possible on the regime to moderate its position and open its doors to aid and aid workers currently parked in Bangkok and Thailand.

 Madam President, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 and an epicentre near Chengdu in Sichuan killed over 100 000 people on 12 May. We can only offer our condolences to all those who have lost family members, and in particular parents who have lost children. However, unlike the parallel tragedy in Burma, where some have suggested responsibility to protect should lead to direct international intervention, the Chinese have employed exceptional emergency resources, along with soldiers and medical staff. China has welcomed foreign assistance, including Japanese rescue workers who are currently working in the area, as well as allowing the Chinese and foreign media to follow the disaster in its aftermath. The European Union has already contributed EUR 10 million in aid, as Commissioner Michel has said. We urge the Council and Commission to provide further emergency aid, technical assistance and reconstruction aid to the region concerned in the coming months and years.

 Madam President, it is a pleasure to speak on Mr Holm’s report on trade in raw materials and commodities. Last month I had the privilege of attending, on behalf of Parliament, the UNCTAD XII Conference in Accra. From that conference there came a cry for help for the world’s poor. Escalating food prices are increasingly leading to rioting on the streets, and we need a fresh approach if we are to deal with this situation. The new crisis threatens to kill more in a day than have died from terrorism in the six years since 9/11. Politicians and governments may not yet have noticed, but the world’s poor are seeing their children increasingly go hungry. The impact will be particularly acute in Africa, where commodity prices have more than doubled in the last 12 months and continue to soar owing to speculation, shortages and changing patterns of production. The root causes are growing demand from East Asia and the supply consequences of a failure to invest in agriculture. Climate change, written in the language of floods, droughts and record-breaking temperatures, is only making the situation worse, particularly for the world’s poorest. It is therefore my hope that we adopt this resolution.

I support De Keyser and Salafranca's report as someone who has been on two occasions a Chief Observer on behalf of the European Union; Indonesia 2004, Aceh 2006/7. I believe that the work done by the Union improving the integrity of the electoral process is vital. Our job is generally not to confirm the winners but to reassure those who have lost that they have lost fairly and can be vital in diffusing tension post election. While I agree with the participation of nationals from countries outside the EU like Switzerland, Norway and Canada, we do need to ensure that the majority of those present are EU nationals. On one occasion to my knowledge they were close to forming a majority of the missions observers. It is right and proper as paragraph 38 states that we should give support post election to new Parliaments. I am aware as someone who has behalf on the UNDP on advising the new Indonesian Parliament in 1999 on revisions to their Rules of Procedure, of exactly how useful this can be. I congratulate my two colleagues on their report which I am sure we will revisit in the new legislature after 2009.

I will be supporting this report, strengthening as it does the rules of the European institutions regarding lobbyists. I was the author of the first report on this subject more than a decade ago, in January 1996, produced by the then Rules Committee, and the legislations we currently have in place regarding lobbyist are those proposed in my original report. More than 10 years on it is clearly time to modify and strengthen these rules. We failed last time to have a common system for all of the institutions but this now seems possible. For me lobbyists are all those who want to come into the Parliament, Commission or Council to influence the decision-making process, whether employers or employees, consumer groups, producer groups or special interest groups. It is estimated there are around 5 000 lobbyist in Brussels – seven for each and every MEP. The vast majority do a good job – a very small number do not. We need to ensure that the few do not taint the many and that our work benefits from outside inputs rather than being distorted by it. I look forward to the proposals for a ‘common legislation’ by the end of the year.

 Mr President, firstly can I thank the Commissioner and his staff, the committee staff, my group staff and my own staff for the work that has gone into this report. I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs on behalf of the major political groups who, in a spirit of cooperation, have made this report what it is today. I take full responsibility for the report, but all of the above have their political footprints trodden across its pages. In some sense we wish that this negotiation between the EU and ASEAN was unnecessary. My own committee’s priority is very clear: we want a successful conclusion to the Doha Development Round, which unfortunately looks at the moment as if it is being sucked into the black hole of the US presidential selection and election. It may hopefully emerge relatively unscathed in six or twelve months’ time after the inauguration of President Clinton, McCain or Obama when the US finally has a new trade spokesperson in place to continue the dialogue. But in the interim it looks like we will have negotiations with Korea, where my colleague David Martin was Parliament’s rapporteur, with ASEAN and with India for bilateral or EU free-trade agreements. The Council’s mandate to open talks with ASEAN, the EU’s fifth-largest trading partner, covered only seven out of the ten members of ASEAN, since ASEAN is an extremely diverse region ranging from economies whose GDPs are equal to those of some nation states of the European Union to three less developed countries, two of whom benefit from the ‘anything but arms’ provisions and one of whom is the pariah state of Burma, of which we have heard so much talk today. It is clear that a free-trade agreement will potentially benefit both sides, increasing the flow of goods and services, and enhance innovation and boost economic growth. We welcome the signing of the ASEAN Charter on 20 November last year at the 13th ASEAN Summit in Singapore and look forward to its swift ratification. This should help to strengthen economic integration within the ASEAN countries and in my report we call on the Commission to provide technical and other assistance to facilitate the process. The negotiations need transparency on public procurement, competition and investment, intellectual property rights and state aids. We need to talk about the removal of non-tariff as well as tariff barriers, particularly with respect to banking, insurance and legal services. On our side, simplification of the rules of origin is important. Harmonisation of standards including product safety, child protection and animal welfare is something else we should be seeking. We need to protect against counterfeit pharmaceuticals, but at the same time the committee is concerned that we do not compromise the flexibility of the TRIPS arrangement. The Trade Committee believes that an essential part of any agreement must be a sustainable development chapter, including a sustainability impact assessment. Plus we need a parallel political cooperation agreement with binding social and environmental clauses committing both sides to the ratification of core ILO conventions, as well as the normal PCA clauses on human rights and democracy. Trade and sustainable development fora should be established including employers, employees and civic societies that can actually have an input not only into the negotiations but, more importantly, afterwards on how the agreement is carried out. The report suggests that we should consider environmentally friendly and fair trade goods having preferential access to the EU, that the tariff barriers should be taken down more quickly. But of course, were that to be implemented, we would require the Commission to modify its customs nomenclature to enable this to happen. There are some country-specific issues. On Singapore we have concerns about banking secrecy that were made clear when the committee visited and spoke to members of parliament in that country. We welcome the restoration of democracy in Thailand. And of course we have agreed that Burma should participate in, or at least sit in on, negotiations, though it is absolutely clear from our point of view that until the current regime has gone, there can be no prospect of signing any agreement with Burma. Our idea is to have a framework agreement for all that allows individual countries within ASEAN to act on the basis of their own current situation and to open up particular sectors at an appropriate speed for them. So eventually – and I emphasise eventually – we will have a common and full agreement with all. So while one can only welcome Vietnam’s leadership of the process, the institutional architecture, compounded by a lack of drive and will on the part of some ASEAN nations, has made progress slower than anticipated or wanted. Let me be clear, the European Union should not allow foot-dragging by individual member states of ASEAN to veto progress. If there is no alternative, Council, Commission and Parliament might in the last resort look at the possibility of bilateral rather than multilateral arrangements. I hope that government and civil society in ASEAN see Parliament’s position here today as an encouragement to move forward, and move forward quickly.

 Mr President, can I thank all the Members who participated in this evening’s debate. I am aware of the need, as Mr Audy has just pointed out, that we should make sure that development issues are not neglected with respect to a number of the countries, not just the Philippines. As someone who is much better acquainted with Indonesia than with the Philippines, I am aware there that there are many parts of Indonesia where it is not Jakarta, it is a developing country and we need to be paying attention there. I thank Mr Mandelson for his comments and I would make the point that in a spirit of cooperation and consensus I have just had a conversation with Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna and I have agreed to withdraw Amendment 11 −

 The original compromise resolution was in my opinion not entirely balanced. The initial disturbances in Lhasa and elsewhere were orchestrated attacks on people and premises with arson, injury and murder of Han Chinese and the Muslim minority. In my own country this would, if it had been white youth against our migrant community, have been described as race riots. Nevertheless on balance I could have supported it. China still fails to fully respect human rights across its territory, with respect to independent trade unions, internal migrants and the practice of minority religions. However, the amendments from the right that have passed pushed this text beyond the fringe. The rejection of the EU’s ‘one China policy’, the demands for a dialogue ‘without preconditions’ made it impossible for me to support the resolution even with my agreement on the human rights elements contained within the resolution, as I indicated by my roll-call votes.

 I will be supporting this resolution. It is essential as I said in my report from more than a decade ago that we have a binding legal basis for our code of conduct on arms exports. Yet the imperative to export is driven by a divided European industry that is desperate for long production so as to enable it to compete with mass-produced armaments from the US with only batch production domestic demand. Thus we need to see a single market in defence equipment which will enable Europe to first compete, second to stop feeding regional wars around the world and third move some of its most highly qualified scientists and engineers into the new advanced technology industries of tomorrow.

 I abstained on the final vote on this report. While it contains many good elements it does not go far enough. Any CAP reform must first decrease subsidy and increase the role of the market in agriculture. Second, look at promoting the wider rural economy rather than focusing on farming alone. Third, it must promote ‘good’ food rather than put quantity before quality. Only on this basis can we establish a CAP that matches the needs and requirements of the new millennium.

 Mr President, I am delighted that Parliament is going to release EUR 162 million from the European solidarity fund for aid following the flooding disasters last summer in my own region and elsewhere. Clearly, as we know, this money is for infrastructure projects, for repairing roads, bridges, railways, hospitals and other institutions, but at the same time it will enable the Government in the United Kingdom to release money it would have had to spend on this in other ways. There are still thousands of people who are living in temporary accommodation and many shops and factories are closed. So I am delighted that money from the European Union’s solidarity fund has been released and hopefully that the people of Gloucestershire and elsewhere will benefit from this.

We must ask Hamas to stop attacks against Israel from the territory it controls, and Israel to cease military actions killing civilians and extrajudicial targeted killings. The policy of isolation of the Gaza Strip has totally failed at a political and human level. The blockade must end, with the re-opening of crossings in and out of Gaza.

 I welcome this report by Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Corbett, which both emphasises the fact that the Reform Treaty is not the Constitution, while also enabling Europe to pursue the new global role it will have to play in the coming decades. It strengthens the institutional power of the Union. It enhances democracy by empowering the European Parliament. It enables the Union’s Common Foreign and Security Policy to develop to ensure that Europe’s economic and industrial power is reflected in global politics, and in particular will allow the EU to play a key role in tackling global warming.

 The comment ‘if you give a man a fish you feed him for a day, while if you teach him to fish you feed him for life’ is all too apposite to this debate. If Africa is to escape from its poverty trap, it will need to expand the exploitation of its raw materials, strengthen its manufacturing base and increase its exports, but at the same time it will need to improve its scientific expertise. We in the West must increase the involvement of African scientists in international collaborative science and R&amp;D projects, and reinforce existing research infrastructure.

 I will be supporting Mr Deprez’s report on the factors favouring support for terrorism and the recruitment of terrorists. Nevertheless, I want to make two points. First, I want to raise the ‘Nelson Mandela’ question. We must distinguish between those fighting oppression and vicious authoritarian regimes like the apartheid regime in South Africa, and the nihilism of the 9/11 bombers. I would not have supported the Rivonia bombing, but neither would I, if Nelson Mandela had fled to Europe, have supported his extradition to a South Africa where he faced the death penalty. Second, the West has to recognise that on occasion our actions or inaction in the Middle East, in Palestine and elsewhere contributes to rising hostility and terrorism towards ourselves. Sometimes we can be our own worst enemies.

 Only a few months ago US intelligence acknowledged that its claim that Iran was developing nuclear weapons was in error. In fact, Iran’s nuclear weapons programme was abandoned in 2001/2002. Yet Washington has failed to draw the appropriate political conclusion from this intellectual U-turn. The argument for deploying National Missile Defence technologies in Eastern Europe was to supposedly defend against a nuclear Iran which had mysteriously acquired ICBMs. Now if Iran’s nuclear programme does not exist, the justification for NMD deployment vanishes, unless the hidden agenda is to threaten a resurgent Russia. I am resolutely opposed to such a deployment and will campaign against it.

 Mr President, it has been an interesting debate and it would be funny if it was not so tragic. Most of the opposition I have heard this afternoon is, I think, sincerely felt and believed, but it is not based on the facts and it is not based on the text before us. Nothing in this report undermines subsidiarity or proportionality. Indeed, if it did, it would be corrected by the Council of Ministers. So I urge you, even now, to vote in favour and allow the Council of Ministers to do the right thing to make sure that it is absolutely proportionate and subsidiarity is respected. Mr Weber, Europe was born out of the values of the Second World War – a determination that we would never look away again whilst one group of individuals or other groups were targeted or made a scapegoat and led away to concentration camps and work camps. A determination that there would be no hierarchy of oppression. Yet, sadly, you want to have a Europe that is not based on those decent values, a Europe that believes and respects that all human beings are born equal. Those opposed to this have to answer to their conscience, to their religion and to their voters as to why you believe some people should be treated differently from others, that they should not have equality. I stand here fortunate, as a gay man – and if I chose to be gay, is it not interesting that one obviously therefore chooses to be heterosexual? – fighting for equality, not just for gay men and lesbians and bisexuals and transgender people, but for people on the basis of their age, their religion, their belief, their gender, anything that is perceived to be different that could be used to take equality away from them. I believe the litmus test of any civilised society is not how we treat a majority, which, interestingly, is made up of so many different minorities. The litmus test of any civilised society, as people listening in the visitors’ gallery will tell you, is not how we treat the majority, but how we treat the minorities, and, in that instance, some Member States are sadly lacking. Shakespeare said, rather brilliantly, ‘the evil that men do lives on, the good is oft interred with their bones’. Look to yourself, imagine if it were you who was different – who had a different religion, a different belief, a different age, a different sexual orientation – would it be right that you should have your human rights taken away from you? The answer has to be ‘no’. Now is the opportunity for the House to do that which is right and just and good.

I am pleased to say that, on behalf of the Socialist Group, we will be supporting his report in its entirety. We are also pleased that we have achieved most of our objectives. I am also pleased that, working with you, Henrik, you have shown the imagination that is absolutely necessary for a brilliant legislator, which is to put yourself in the position of the person seeking to use the service. That is the way you have approached this in its entirety. It is why you looked at the one-stop shop, the Internet, the multi-entry visas and the reduction on visas for people under 25 – I only wish I could avail myself of that privilege – and approached it by asking how we can make this work for the citizen. This is a brilliant example for the rest of the House. We often approach things by putting forward amendments, which may improve the text and may have coherence, but does it serve the citizen? That has always been your approach. I am pleased to say that we have the multiple-entry visas. We also have the whole issue of appeal. I worked with – to name a member of the DG – Jan on this very important principle, namely that, if you are refused a visa, or you are refused entry into the Schengen area, your appeal may not be suspensive, but the authority that refuses must make itself accountable. I wish to thank the rapporteur once again, and to thank the Commission for making sure that we have that principle enshrined here. I have nothing more to say other than to thank my staff and to thank your staff – and particularly Renaud, who is in the public gallery. Without our staff, we could never do the job that we do so well. It has been a brilliant three-year love affair and, like most short-term love affairs, I am pleased to see it coming to an end.

Equally, as announced in the voting list and for the sake of clarity and coherence of the text that we have now adopted, I kindly ask that you request the plenary services to proceed, without any substantive change, to do the following: to group the articles according to their content under specific thematic titles, to re-order recitals and definitions accordingly and to produce and publish Parliament’s position as a consolidated text as soon as possible. Finally, may I pay due thanks to the enormous and supportive work which I have been given not only by the secretariats, but by the tabling services. (Applause)
 Michael Cashman,  
rapporteur. 
− Mr President, I look forward to this debate, and particularly to hearing from those who are not so keen on enhancing transparency and public access to documents. I wish to begin by thanking the seven ministers from the EU who have declared their support for my report. In particular, they are, and I quote: ‘therefore, glad to see that Parliament’s Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted a report on 17 February 2009 that shares our vision of a more transparent Union’. I find it staggering that, when we are trying to reconnect to our citizens, people do not support transparency and openness. I find it equally staggering that, when we are trying to connect the institutions back to the public, there is a lack of willingness to enhance public scrutiny and accountability. Some Members have raised doubts about whether all the amendments that my report proposes are within the scope of the legal basis of the regulation – Article 255 of the Treaty. I should like to set their minds at rest: the object of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 is: ‘to give the public a right of access to documents of the institution which is as wide as possible. That right of public access to the documents of the institution is related to the democratic nature of those institutions.’ Do not simply take my word for it – I am quoting verbatim from the Turco judgment of the Court of Justice. It is in the spirit of that judgment that we must interpret Article 255 of the Treaty. Take our Amendment 44 on classified documents. It is simply disingenuous to say, as the Commission has, that the classification of documents as confidential has no link with public access to such documents. Under the present version of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001, documents may only be classified in order to safeguard the essential interests protected under Article 4(1). So the link is already there. What we have done is to draw the logical consequences from that link and incorporate rules on the classification of documents into the regulation itself. These rules, which are carefully modelled on the rules the Council and the Commission already apply, define limits on the public’s right to access to documents, just as Article 255 requires, and there is nothing in the Treaty to prevent the institutions adopting these in the regulation. Take our Amendment 24, which refers to agencies and bodies created by the institution. Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001, as amended, will lay down the principles, conditions and limits of public access to the documents of those agencies, but it will not, in itself, create obligations for agencies. If you read our Amendment 29, for example, you will see that the regulation applies only to documents held by the institutions, although it does set the standards that agencies will be expected to follow in adopting their own rules on public access to their documents, in accordance, I might add, with the joint declaration adopted by the Council, the Commission and Parliament on 30 May 2001. Let me also point out for those who cannot witness it, the sadness that the Council is not here to attach the due importance to this extremely important report. I know some of you were also concerned that we went too far in seeking to ensure that Member States did not undermine the level of transparency the regulation aims at. I believe I have come a long way to meet concerns, as you will see from compromise amendments that remind the Member States of their duties under Article 10 of the Treaty not to stand in the way of the achievement of the Community’s objectives, including transparency and democracy. The amendments by Mr Nassauer may bring some reassurances to his group and other MEPs who are concerned that some private information may get into the public domain. That will not happen and cannot happen under my report. There is still the space to think that personal and private data will remain protected, so I will listen with great interest as to why those who oppose this regulation do so.
 Michael Cashman,  
rapporteur. 
− Mr President, those were interesting remarks, but I am afraid they have very little to do with the contents of my report. I would point out that we have nothing to fear from public scrutiny and we have absolutely everything to fear as institutions from hiding information. We become more vulnerable. Commissioner, it is official documents which are accessible. Go back and look at the report. The space to think. Official documents. Within the notion of a space to think, that will not be official. Go back to the report. Accept our principles. It has been an interesting debate but I have to say that the recast – which you defend – is not in the spirit of the interinstitutional agreement and it is not enough. You say it has worked well, but I am afraid the recast ignores vital jurisprudence on what actually needs to be done. My reasons for delaying the final vote are so that we have absolutely maximum flexibility to negotiate with the political parties and with the institutions. I would further point out that there is nothing to prevent the Commission from amending its proposal at any time after the vote tomorrow, except perhaps institutional and political reluctance. I find it somewhat patronising to be told that we will get action plans. Commissioner, I do not doubt your personal commitment to openness and transparency, but I do not want action plans for our citizens. I want rights enshrined in law which cannot be taken away – not gifts, but rights. Parliament must therefore put political pressure on the Presidency to negotiate and it may be that we will have to negotiate without the Commission. Yes, Commissioner, I know the Council is not here, but I do not give up on one Council. I have been in politics long enough to know that you fight and you fight. Let me finally quote this President, if you will allow me: ‘My Administration is committed to creating an unprecedented level of openness in Government. We will work together to ensure the public trust and establish a system of transparency, public participation and collaboration. Openness will strengthen our democracy and promote efficiency and effectiveness in Government’. So said Barack Obama on 21 January 2009. I await a comparable announcement from the Commission or, indeed, from President Barroso.

 Mr President, thank you, Marco, for a very good report, but sadly I have to agree with other people in this House that you strayed beyond the remit – and I know why. The previous speaker said that it is impossible. If we do not ask for the impossible, how will we ever achieve change? But of course you have gone beyond your remit. We are not going to have broadcasts of political groups. MEPs putting up on their websites or through Parliament’s Information Service what they do and where they go does not mean that they are effective; it does not mean they are good. The Regulation is about access to all of the documents held, received or produced by the three institutions when acting in its legislative capacity. That is what we need to get back to. We need to define what the ‘legislative capacity’ is. We need to look at how the Regulation has worked up until now and we have to improve it. That is what I want to do in conjunction with all the players, and I am pleased to welcome here the Swedish Minister, Cecilia Malmström, who worked originally on this. We all want to take the whole issue of access forward. Why? Because we recognise that many people realise that there are things that happen, particularly in the Council, as you have illustrated, whereby their ministers, their national ministers, are involved, but how they debate and how they vote is secret. Once we reveal that element of secrecy and we expose how Member State ministers actually vote, then those ministers are held accountable back home in their Member States and suddenly national citizens feel connected to all things European. So, Marco, you have sadly gone wider than the remit, especially with this dream that you have. If you had not declared that you were an Italian radical I would never have known it from this report, but the fact that you expect political parties to broadcast their internal debates – it is not going to happen and indeed, as the previous speaker said, all you do is expose division rather than reinforce the fact that we are here because we believe in a Europe that is accountable to its citizens. That is why drawing up the voting list will be difficult. My heart is with you, but I have to follow my head.

 Mr President, discrimination is alive and well, and it is living in the world and in the European Union. That is why I want to congratulate the French Presidency on the initiative at the United Nations on the decriminalisation of homosexuality. It is depressing that we have heard, here today in the House, intolerance promoted. Discrimination scars our world and – can I say to others – it scars the souls of those who practice it. Discrimination is given voice by politicians and institutions, such as the Vatican, that should know better. That is why I want to thank you, on behalf of those people who do not have a voice, because if they used it – as homosexuals or because of their gender identity – they would be beaten, tortured, imprisoned or face capital punishment, solely because of their difference. We will win. We will achieve equality. As a gay man, I am committed to that. We will achieve equality simply because justice and goodness are on our side. Thank you to the presidency. It is a great privilege for you to end your presidency on such a commitment.
 Michael Cashman  (PSE

 – Madam President, I wish to congratulate the French Presidency for its commitment to the fight against AIDS and HIV, and also congratulate those who have spoken in the debate this evening. It is a late-night debate on an issue that actually affects every single one of us every single minute of every single day. As a gay man living in the 1970s and 1980s, I could so easily have contracted the HIV virus. I was lucky. I did not. However, I watched as swathes of generations were cut down by a virus and cut down by discrimination and stigmatisation. That is why the message we need to send tonight is that we are committed to making available treatment and to having early testing but, above and beyond all that, and the brilliant and excellent work Mr Bowis did as a Health Minister in a Conservative government, we have to say that what happens to you is as if it happens to me, or my daughter or my son. People do not go for early testing for one simple reason: fear of the discrimination that they will have to live with – that stigmatisation. I remember once in the early 1980s visiting a hospital to try and cheer up the patients – which I always failed to do! – and walking into an HIV unit to find that in one of the beds was one of my close friends. He could not even tell me that he was living and dying with an AIDS-related illness. That situation still exists, not only in our countries, but also on other continents. What happens on other continents affects us directly because, unless we engage with the communities most at risk, they will never hear the message. A sex worker who gets trafficked into the EU is as vulnerable as a visitor from the EU to Africa or one of the other continents. That is why I welcome this resolution. 1 December 2008 is the 20th 
anniversary of International AIDS Day, but little changes except the lives that accumulate, that go past and are destroyed. That is why I congratulate the House, the Presidency and the Commission, and all of the speakers, for being here to send a signal that what happens to them happens to us.

 Madam President, I should like to say to the Ombudsman that it has been a really interesting debate: sniped at by Hans-Peter Martin, lauded as a god by another. I think it shows that he has probably – just about – got it right. Ombudsman, Parliament does not always place you in a very comfortable position when you are called upon especially to rule on decisions that we take and the actions of this House. I see that I have excited Hans-Peter Martin – how wonderful! But let me just tell you, Ombudsman, that you always carry out your work in a constructive way and absolutely within your competences. Probably the reason why we have seen an increase in your workload is because you have been so effective in promoting your work and your office, and I congratulate you on that. It leaves me nothing more than to say that it is an excellent report. I look forward to contributions from other colleagues, but also I enjoy working with you, not the least in relation to access to documents, but also as Vice-Chair of the Committee on Petitions. (Applause)

 Mr President, as the original rapporteur on Regulation No 1049/2001 I find this a very interesting debate. What I find strange – since I know the participants in the debate here tonight are committed fully to openness and transparency – is that the argument as to why not enough has been done is ‘we need more time’. This is unacceptable. Only 30% of the European population have faith in the European Union. Why? Because they feel absolutely disconnected from what is done in their name. And the amazing thing is that we have a positive story to tell. Why is it that the institution has to be dragged screaming and kicking to the European Courts in order to do the right thing? We need to do more than just explain. Commissioner Wallström, I know you are as exasperated and exhausted by these arguments as I am, but it is not enough to say we need more time. We actually need to demonstrate to our citizens that we will not only explain to them why we do what we do, but how we do it and the legal advice upon which we operate. Because, unless we do that, we will disconnect people from the European project. It has been argued here tonight that this is impossible with regard to some matters, owing for example the imprecise definition of ‘documents’. It is not imprecise at all. It is in fact well defined. It means all documents held, received or produced by the three institutions or the agencies set up by them. And ‘documents’ itself is clearly defined. So let us have the courage to have an open register. Not the maze that we have at the moment where, when you go into one register, you do not get access to all of the other registers or all of the other links. At the moment we have citizens who go into a maze. Let us allow citizens to come into the door of the three institutions and let us expose ourselves to the scrutiny of public opinion. I tell you now that unless we do the right thing, the judgement will be made in the June election in favour of those extreme parties who are not in favour of the EU or the EU institutions. Time is running out. Act now. It is not impossible.

 Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur for the excellent work he has done. The compromises we have achieved with the Council are sensible and effective, and I say this as the original rapporteur on the Schengen border code. Brevity is the source of wit, so I will detain the House no more, other than thanking – as every MEP should – the two wonderful assistants, Renaud and Maris, who work with me and who make my work not only enjoyable but also productive.

 Mr President, I condemn the human rights abuses that occur daily in Iran. I believe also that we should lift the ban on the People’s Mujahedin, and we should do that as soon as possible. I want to speak out against the death penalty being used against juveniles. I will never forget the picture of two boys who were publicly hung by the neck until they were dead. Their crime was that they were young homosexuals who dared to love one another. Such inhumanity should be condemned universally. That is why, Commissioner, we need a radical change in our policy towards Iran. We cannot sit back and wait: there is no more time!

The European Parliamentary Labour Party (EPLP) has abstained on the legislative proposal, due to the fact the UK is not obliged to follow this Directive, as it has an opt-out/opt in on JHA measures concerning immigration and asylum. However it was very important to consider our responsibility carefully as it would have had a direct effect on those countries legally bound by this Directive. The Weber report required a series of amendments that would have improved on the rapporteur’s draft. It was important that the report should have included the particular amendments as recommended by the PSE Group. As these amendments were not adopted we have abstained on this report. These were: Amendment 98 ensuring the protecting of unaccompanied minors; Amendment 103 concerning the length of detention and conditions; Amendment 95 on the definition of the risk of absconding. Overall the EPLP feels that this report did not enhance the capabilities of EU States to deal effectively yet humanely with the returning of third country nationals residing illegally in the EU but has instead added extra burdens to an already complicated and highly emotionally charged issue.
 Michael Cashman,

Mr President, I should like to thank Vice-President Frattini for those words. If Parliament had codecision on this we would be in a much stronger position. I have to say to colleagues here today that I met with NGOs and civil society at the very beginning, as did other shadow rapporteurs, to see what we could do. It was quite clear to me at the very beginning that if I had my way I would have a list that was endless, because human rights are so important: they are paramount and are the very reason that the institutions were established so that we never got back to those conditions that created the Second World War and the appalling shadow that was cast across so many different peoples and so many different minorities. However, the reality is that we are merely consulted, which is why I have had to take on a very difficult position. It is extremely difficult for me as a gay man not to want to include specifically homophobia. However, if I am to be consistent in the application of principle in that we need to bring on board that which is not covered, then I have to forego the very things that also my heart desires. So it has been difficult. I am pleased to say that this report was adopted by 48 votes in favour, none against and 8 abstentions. That indicates that what we have here – although, indeed, there are some amendments which I did not personally support – are the wishes of the committee. I want to pay great tribute to the Portuguese Presidency and my colleague sitting here in the Chamber who worked very closely with me, who supported Parliament in order to try to achieve a position which both the Council and the Commission could support. I am pleased that the Commissioner has listed nine out of the eighteen amendments. We are getting 50% support – of course, I want 100% support but I live in the real political world. I want the Agency, above all, to succeed. The origins of the Agency are the Charter of Fundamental Rights and all the international conventions on human rights that we have in common amongst the Member States. However, there are some delegations, some politicians and some Member States who want the Agency to fail. They do not want it to be effective, and that is why I have been absolutely specific in the demands that we are making upon this Agency. I want it to succeed. I believe that the amendments that were adopted in committee will help it to succeed, while not placing upon the Agency undue demands which will go beyond the resources, both human and financial. There have been suggestions amongst some of the women’s groups that this does not go far enough, but we have introduced the gender perspective and taken account of the Gender Institute. Of course, there must be complementarity, but we must not have duplication because, again, that would waste the resources. So let me finish and let me listen – arguably the most important thing and one of the most difficult things to do in politics. Let me listen to the debate, but I will not be able to support the amendments that will be placed before the plenary tomorrow for the simple principle: I said at the beginning I could not take on board a whole range of amendments and to change that attitude now would be to go back on the agreement that I reached with the shadows. Of course minority languages are important, of course other areas are important, but there is nothing more important than an Agency for Fundamental Rights which is successful in the work that we set it to do.

Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for relenting on the very important issue of Amendment 6, which states ‘All human beings are born equal and therefore human rights are indivisible and inviolable’. Can I thank colleagues for their contributions, and can I just tell you that, when one of the non-attached Members states that they are going to vote against me, when those extremists within Parliament vote against me and against my report, my heart fills with joy and my brain tells me that we have got it absolutely right. Because there should be no extremism when it comes to the defence of human rights, except to be extremely defensive of human rights. I would say to my good friend Sophia in ’t Veld that of course I agree with her, but I believe that the issue of the Roma, privacy and homophobia are already covered. Indeed, the Roma would be covered under discrimination based on ethnicity and race. I would say to my colleague Mr Lambrinidis that the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights gives us the area in which we can operate on the basis of privacy, preventing trafficking and dealing with social exclusion. Ms Gál said it was absolutely right that it is about the workability of the Agency and that is what we have to face. That is why I have included multiple discrimination. We must remember that we are not dealing solely with the areas that they can cover. These are thematic areas based on the objective foundations which are the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the international conventions, which all of the Member States have in common. To my great friend Mr Cem Özdemir – çok teşekkür ederim!
 – I would say, on data protection, yes, it is covered. Also, we have the data protection supervisor and we have data protection directives, and the last thing we want is duplication. It is interesting and we should celebrate. The Angelilli report is coming up. It is an own-initiative report, yet here we have an absolute commitment – not an own-initiative, not a request – that the rights of the child be covered under the Agency which protects fundamental rights. Therefore, I congratulate the House. I urge it to vote with me. Let us not bring in more, let us not dilute, let us be focused, let us get the job done – and Mr President, save your gavel for another time!

The British Socialist Delegation (EPLP) welcomed and voted in favour of the resolution on terrorism. Whilst the final version of the resolution adopted by the European Parliament is not perfect, we recognise the importance of sending a clear, unequivocal signal to those who threaten our way of life that we shall not succumb. The EPLP is convinced that the EU can and will do all it can to defeat terrorism and that with neighbouring Member States and international allies working together we are more likely to achieve this ultimate goal than by isolationist policies. We take full responsibility for our role as parliamentarians to extensively scrutinise Commission proposals in this field to ensure that any legislation which is adopted is appropriate, proportionate and respects the fundamental rights of our citizens. We will continue to be critical of allies’ policy where there are policy differences, however we recognise and welcome the on-going co-operation between the EU and democratic states, especially the important relationship between the EU and the US, in the field of Justice and Home Affairs. We remain convinced that it is through co-operation with our allies not antagonism or retaliation that we will defeat those who seek to destroy our values and principles through violence and hatred.
 Michael Cashman  (PSE

 Madam President, I welcome the responses of Commissioner Frattini and the President-in-Office of the Council. However, the reality is that we in this House have the luxury of talk, talk, talk. But actually, in government and in the Commission, you have to take action – action to prevent terrorist attacks: terrorist attacks which are not imagined; terrorist attacks which are real, which are being planned currently. The reality of politics is that if you took no action, the same members of this House who attack you for taking the action, would attack you because you had not acted. Therefore, I welcome the strategy, and the fact that we will review the strategy. Furthermore, what we have to do, as has been said before, is to tackle the roots of terrorism. They lie in hopelessness and despair, in poverty, in the preaching of hatred. Let me say quite clearly and unequivocally, those who espouse a cause, a tradition or a religion for their terrorist acts undermine their ideology, their religion, their cause and their tradition. Now, above all, we need to act as 27 Member States –
 not separately –
 and act in conjunction with our allies, including the United States. The United States is not a problem. The attacks on the United States did not occur on September 11, they occurred before then, and an attack upon one is arguably an attack upon all of us.
 Michael Cashman (PSE

 Mr President, firstly I would like to correct my colleague, Sir Robert Atkins. He said that the committee of inquiry was set up at his behest. Those who worked in the Committee on Petitions will remember that it was at my behest, but I will share that equally with him. He said, and I have to correct him, that the British Government was conspicuous by its absence and so was the Regulator. Where was he when we met with the Chief Secretary of the Treasury and the Regulator? Sadly, he was conspicuous by his absence. We need no lectures from previous Conservative governments, which actually twiddled their thumbs whilst people’s pension policies burned. I welcome this report, but sadly I cannot fully support it. I believe it strays into areas where it should not go. It fails to properly recognise the measures and provisions which the Labour Government has put in place since 1997. The report strays into areas such as the role of the rapporteur post-Parliament, the role of the rapporteur at EU Member State level, and I do not consider this appropriate. It is intervening in the sovereign Member State parliaments and their legal obligations under the Treaty. Yes, it makes helpful suggestions regarding the single market and responsibility of the host state with regard to financial services, but does it alter the plight of the victims, two of whom are sitting in the gallery today? Sadly, it does not. They are victims of mis-selling, and it was because of their plight that we set up this temporary committee of inquiry. I also commend the work of the chairman of this committee of inquiry. Sadly, it will not help the victims. It is full of promise and no guarantee. That is why I have urged all along that we ask that the parties involved, including the UK Government, adhere to any recommendations that may come from the British Parliamentary Ombudsman. If there is compensation, let us be clear: it is the British taxpayer who will pick up the tab. The Labour Group will not vote against this report but it will abstain because of the reasons I have already outlined. Sadly, I must agree with an earlier contribution that party politics has crept into this and it will not serve the victims of the Equitable Life crisis.
 Michael Cashman and Peter Skinner (PSE
),  
in writing
.  The EPLP supported the setting up of this committee because it believed Parliament could use it as an opportunity to provide clarification and learn lessons from the Equitable Life crisis and give a voice to the victims. Several of the facts of the crisis and its aftermath were not included in the report, so the final result is not balanced. The report has also been used by the opposition parties to attack the Labour government, while misleading the policyholders by falsely raising their expectations. This vote is on a recommendation to adopt the findings of the report and not the report itself, following the committee vote there were no further opportunities to amend or improve the text. Therefore the EPLP abstains on this vote.

 Mr President, it saddens me to have to take the floor once again on this issue. More than 18 months after the adoption of the Fourtou Report in December 2005 by an overwhelming majority of this House, we are still debating the same issues, and nothing has changed. The Council is absent – that is shameful! Citizens from many Member States, including my own, but also Spain, Germany, Holland and Belgium, are having their legally acquired lands taken by local authorities without due process, which I am convinced is in breach of EU law. Moreover, they are being forced to pay large sums of money – tens of thousands of euros – to pay for new infrastructure and new developments that they do not want and which are on their land. The situation I am describing sounds unimaginable in the 21st century EU but it is a sad reality for thousands of citizens in Spain. People have bought land or property in good faith only to see it taken away by what can only be described as, at best, administrative incompetence or, at worst, criminal negligence and corruption. This issue was brought to the attention of the Committee on Petitions in 2003. Back then, 15 000 citizens wrote to us asking for help. What have we done? Well, we have adopted the Fourtou report, which brought forward a series of recommendations to the Valencian Government. The Valencian Government brought forward minor changes in the LUV, which do not address the key problems of land grab. It is worth mentioning that large numbers of projects in Valencia were rushed through prior to the entry into force of the new law. This is a clear sign that constructors and developers wanted to continue to exploit the loopholes of the previous law. We have now sent three fact-finding missions. The last came under shameful attacks from the Partido Popular, which were attacks upon the integrity of this House. It saddens me to say that the President of this House, Mr Pöttering, remains indifferent to the attacks upon the integrity of this House. The Partido Popular politicians say that the petitions in Valencia have been imagined. The pain is real, the pain is desperate, and that is why people have looked to us. The Commission is unhappy. It believes that possible infringements of EU law are under way. Therefore, I say this: to do nothing is not an option, we have exhausted what we can do in this House and this will be resolved in the Court of Justice or before the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, and it will be to the shame of the Partido Popular in Spain.

 Mr President, it is always good to see you in the Chair when we are discussing fundamental freedoms and human rights. I am speaking on the VIS regulation and decision. I would like to say that after two and a half years it feels as though it is the end of an unrequited love affair. I have admired this dossier from afar; I have wrestled with it, I have caressed it, but I have never felt that it has really returned my passion. I would nevertheless like to thank Baroness Ludford and the other shadow rapporteurs for the close cooperation that we have had. However, two and a half years is not really good enough. We should not be patting ourselves on the back. It is a first reading deal, but progress has been slow. We have before us a good package, but nonetheless if we are to be efficient when we are working in codecision, we need to work more quickly and more efficiently. I have to say that this is a call for greater resources, not only for the Commission, but for the Parliament, both within the committee secretariat and within our own delegation secretariats. As I said, we have a text which represents a balanced position. It does not include everything that the Socialists would have wanted, but my Group feels it does contain the major elements: limited and proportionate access; data protection rules; the right of appeal, which is absolutely essential; sanctions for misuse and the principle of non-discrimination, which I am proud to say was set in the precedent of my report on the Schengen border code. We are also pleased that the German Presidency can agree to the package of the VIS regulation and the VIS decision, again equally important for us. We also welcome the Council’s willingness to reach agreement on the third-pillar data protection framework decision. This is of prime importance. I would like to finish perhaps on a somewhat controversial note: the issue of biometrics and in particular fingerprints. Here we need a change of mindset if we are properly to enhance civil liberties, in particular freedom of movement, and, essentially, the protection of minors who are travelling unaccompanied. I believe this will help us to prohibit the trafficking of minors. Will privacy be invaded or at risk? I do not think so. The risk to privacy is dependent upon the use of biometrics and the storage of biometrics. I end, as I began, by applauding all sides of the House, the Commission and the Presidency on the close cooperation that we have had.
 Michael Cashman,

. – Madam President, I will not read from my notes. I will say what I feel, not what I ought to say. The Commissioner offers his sympathy, but we do not need sympathy. What is needed is the enforcement of fundamental rights, which are critical here; the right of access to information in order for you to be completely certain that what has happened to you is not life-threatening. The easiest thing here would be to attack the government of one of the Member States. I do not what to do that. I want to seek to achieve a solution on behalf of the petitioners. Commissioner, you talk of a political solution. Well, I wish to inform you that this is a political institution, which is why we are approaching the European Commission to help us achieve that solution. The solution will not come through sympathy, but through the determination to ask the Danish Government, under the auspices of good and loyal cooperation, which is enshrined in the Treaties of Maastricht and Amsterdam, to acquiesce to the request for information from the petitioners and workers who formed an association and cleaned up after this tragedy. Therefore, do not sympathise with them, but lend them the Commission’s political clout and support and enquire of the Member State as to whether it will release information that is essential to these people in terms of ensuring that they are not at risk and that their lives are safe and in good hands. That is all we ask. I shall detain the House no longer. I am tiring of the Commission’s response to the effect that ‘it is nothing to do with us’. That is the simplest way to reinforce the Euro-scepticism that is growing across the EU and which, sadly, is prevalent in Denmark.
 Michael Cashman (PSE

 Madam President, I rise in sadness, and not in anger. After the Second World War, we still have not learned the lessons. During the 1930s we stood and watched as Jews, Communists, trade unionists and homosexuals were taken off to the camps. We stood. We said and did nothing. We have now moved on. I say to those countries that have lived under domination and repression that they, of all countries, should know the value of fundamental human rights, freedom of association, freedom of speech and the right to a private life. (Applause)
 You should be teaching us about fundamental values. That is why we will not hesitate to defend human rights and human rights defenders, wherever they are. Let me say to anyone who feels under attack wherever they are – and, as a gay man, I could have been born in Poland, Latvia or the Czech Republic in fear of my life, in fear of my job – you are not alone, we are with you and we will win for the simple reason that goodness and justice always succeed in the end. When we refer to politicians in office and the statements that were made, we are not talking about a one-off statement but rather a series of statements that have been calculated and made over the years. Hate-speak creates a climate that somehow lives are inferior, that the person poses a threat to society. A climate is created and fear is engendered, rights are under threat. Words once spoken cannot be taken back and the harm that is done continues and the words too often empower the thug, which leads to violence. I note that Mr Weber says ‘no to homophobia’. However, it is sad that he also says ‘no’ to doing anything about it here in this House today. Let me finish on this: we will succeed, but that means we have to take up our responsibility to defend human rights and to end human rights abuses, wherever they are. (Applause)

 Mr President, may I start by congratulating the rapporteur on the work that he has done on this extremely important report. Can I first say that of course, AIDS and HIV are themselves not prejudiced. They affect anyone who actually becomes vulnerable either by the use of badly treated blood which is often contaminated and passed on, unsafe sex and the bad use of needles to list just some examples. But what we have to deal with is how to prevent the transmission. It seems to me that highest on the agenda is the whole issue of information and education. We have to inform people about how they can protect themselves. We have to inform people about their rights and about access to medicines. At the same time we have to create a whole process for awareness-raising amongst communities and individuals who feel that they themselves are not under threat or will not be affected by AIDS and HIV. When we look in particular at Africa, where millions and millions of lives are being ravaged, and when we look across Europe, where more and more young people are becoming infected with the HIV virus, what we have to look at is not only the accessibility of treatment, but also the cost of treatment. We must do everything we can to reduce the cost of that treatment and to make it available to all. To those who say that condom use is not effective in preventing the transmission of the HIV virus, I say they do a great deal of damage and in fact they cost lives. Condoms do 
work. Needle exchange does
 work. Good practices do
 work and they save lives. And those who promote abstinence? Well, if abstinence can work in sexual relationships, of course it will. But what about when abstinence is not a choice? The young 14-year old girl raped on a highway in Africa: does she have a choice? No. She has no choice. And that is where education and the promotion of awareness-raising and ending the discrimination that blights the lives of people living with AIDS and HIV is so important. Finally, I do not think she is often quoted in this House, but I want to quote Madonna – that is the pop star. She once said that to come out and declare your sexuality is to be a hero. To come out and say that you are HIV positive and to deal with the discrimination and the anger that you therefore suffer is to declare yourself a warrior: a warrior because you fight the battles that you never want another generation to have to fight again. I commend the report and I commend it to the House.
 Michael Cashman (PSE

 Mr President, of course the reality of this is that on PNR, the Americans are setting a negotiation bar for conditions of entry into the US or into their airspace. That is the reality. They can set the bar as high as they like. We have citizens who wish to travel and businesses who want to work there. That is the reality. The reality on SWIFT is that we had an institution, not I believe the only institution, that was dealing with a conflict of jurisdictions, operating and holding data in the US and equally in the EU. It had subpoenas which it legally had to meet in the United States of America and that was where we had the conflict. SWIFT, I believe, has actually operated and negotiated an excellent memorandum of understanding. We can either come into politics to name, shame, moan and whinge, or to try and solve a problem. I came in for the latter. Therefore I believe, Commissioner Frattini, you are absolutely right. We need legal certainty for EU citizens, for EU businesses operating outside the EU and with offices outside the EU as well as within, and in which they hold data. We need a joint political commitment of Congress and this Parliament working across the transatlantic divide to fight the threat of terrorism which affects us all, and indeed we need to protect above all our fundamental rights and freedoms. Therefore I welcome the joint meeting of this House and US elected representatives so that we can reach an agreement. Finally, this will only be achieved by decisive action at Council level, not just at Commission level. I welcome the excellent suggestion of the previous speaker of bringing this up at the G7. Let us solve the problem; let us not moan about it.

Whilst there are certain omissions which are regrettable, on the whole we support the Commission’s programme. On the particular issue of security of citizens, justice and migration, the EPLP supports the general position of the EP as well as the other institutions in the development of policy in this important field. That said, on the issue of maximising the effectiveness of the decision-making process in this field, we underline that, on this issue, it is solely for Member States in the Council to decide.

.  The British Socialist delegation (EPLP) voted in favour of the Cavada report and the EP's resolution on the progress made in the EU towards the area of freedom, security and justice (AFSJ) (Articles 2 and 39 of the EU Treaty) because we support any actions to improve the transparency and effectiveness of the EU institutions and their capacity to deliver for our citizens in the field of Justice and Home Affairs. Whilst we welcome the EP's demand on the importance of launching a wide debate on how to improve our effectiveness in this field, both procedurally and in practice, we nevertheless recognise and respect the significance for Member States in Council of agreeing how best to take this agenda forward. It is imperative that any procedural decisions which would affect issues of national sovereignty are given full and serious consideration before any decisions are taken. This debate should involve national parliaments and the European Parliament as well as the Member States in Council and the Commission.

 – Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, but in my one minute I want to focus directly on what we should be doing. We should be examining the way we communicate with our citizens, and that means we have to be absolutely clear about the language that we use. It must be plain, simple, clear and precise. It is no use talking about tools and barometers. People switch off. We need to be passionate about what we do and how we do it. This is arguably the most successful European institution, and yet we are criticised and we very rarely defend ourselves. There are 25 Member States with different political persuasions and cultures, acting together for the common benefit of 450 million citizens – absolutely brilliant! But do we sell and promote what we do effectively? We do not. Do we ensure that national parliaments engage in their scrutiny role? No, we do not. We merely stand back and take the criticism. Finally, let me grab four seconds. I urge the Commission to go forward with its proposal for the review of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001. It is not in this report. It is accepted in the Commission work programme. We can only be held accountable and be effective if people understand what we do for them.

 Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for the way in which he has worked so cooperatively with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on this. From Mr Pirker’s contribution, you will see that Mrs Gál has had to do an enormous amount of work in her own Group and I congratulate her on the work she has done to bring people together. Let me just say to Mr Pirker that we have an expression in the United Kingdom that you put your money where your mouth is. The easiest thing in the world is to say that you are ‘concerned’ or you are ‘committed’; it is much harder to follow it through and give the resources in order to achieve the outcome that we all hope for. We often say ‘red tape’ when what we mean is that we do not want to stop people from doing something that they should not. In this case, when it comes to empowering human rights’ defenders, red tape is absolutely necessary and, I would say, brilliant. When it comes to cost, if, again, we say we value something and we put no resources behind it, we expose our hypocrisy. So that is why I ask Mrs Gál to continue her excellent work. I believe we will reach a compromise with the Council, because the Commission has shown that it is willing to try to initiate that compromise. Let me also say to the Council of Europe that, although I fully understand its concerns, you cannot have too many human rights’ defenders in the field of defence of human rights and fundamental freedoms. With this agency we are not replicating what the Council of Europe does; we also have obligations in the Union, specifically under the Treaties: the Treaty on European Union and, of course, the Charter of Fundamental Rights. We have seen in very recent months and, indeed, over the last year, worrying hate-speak used by politicians in certain parts of the Union. We have seen a rise not only in hate-speak but also in racist, xenophobic and homophobic violence, and the Council has done nothing when it comes to Articles 6 and 7. In the absence of action by the Council, is it any wonder that we need an agency that will monitor, report and bring forward recommendations and thereby hold every single Member State to its international obligations? It makes sense. Finally, let me say this: if we see one individual attacked because of religion, sexual orientation, gender, ethnicity, whatever, and we stand back and do nothing then we create the conditions that brought about the Second World War. This institution in particular was built out of the ashes of the Second World War with a commitment that we would never turn our eyes or ourselves away from the appalling violence that man commits upon man.
 Michael Cashman (PSE

 Mr President, I should like to congratulate the Commissioner. It is not a perfect agreement. When compromises have to be made, agreements are never perfect, but, as Mrs in 't Veld said, it was either an agreement or no agreement. If there was no agreement, we would have had data anarchy and certainly no EU-wide protection for our citizens. I want to associate myself fully with the comments of Mr Cavada, who I believe has taken a really constructive approach. We need to look at what is happening with PNR and we need to look at what is happening with SWIFT – incidentally, the memorandum of understanding that SWIFT managed to negotiate is a good basis upon which to build any future negotiations. But we can see it also as an opportunity to create this so-called Schengen transatlantic area, because we will come up against these problems time and time again. However, I should like to say to this House that nothing is being imposed on us. The choice is ours. If we wish to travel to the United States, we will have to abide by conditions set by the United States. If we want to set up a business in the United States, exactly the same principle applies. We have to negotiate for our common good and this interim agreement is a step in that direction. Congratulations, Commissioner! The easiest thing in the world is to knock something; the hardest is to support it. Well done.
 Michael Cashman (PSE
). – 
 Mr President, it has been an interesting debate and I should just like perhaps to add a note of realism. We must remember that we are not talking about travel within the EU: we are talking about travel to the United States. We are talking about travel through US air space. I believe an agreement is essential if we want to protect the fundamental rights of the EU. But if we are to have this agreement we have to be willing to negotiate, we have to move. We have to recognise that in the absence of any agreement, the Americans will do quite legally what they have done in other instances: they will say to every passenger travelling to the United States of America, ‘we wish you to sign a data waiver, i.e. that your data can be transferred to the United States’. Let me tell colleagues now that if that happens, any notion of EU-wide data protection is absolutely and fundamentally lost. Furthermore, let me say that America is not the problem. An attack upon the United States, an attack in Germany, an attack in Denmark, an attack in Madrid, an attack in the United Kingdom, or attempted attacks, are attacks upon every single one of us because we have common values. The United States wants to make the world a safer place. We need to work with the United States to make that a reality. America is not the problem: terrorism and extremism are the problem. My colleague Mr Coelho cited some brilliant examples of negotiations and agreements currently in place. We should look at those agreements, we should emulate them and we should give our citizens their fundamental rights and their fundamental freedoms.
 Michael Cashman (PSE

 Mr President, most of what needs to be said has been said already. I commend Mrs Wallis’s report. It is a very thorough interim report. I particularly welcome the request that we delay for three months. It is vital that we do not rush to judgment and that we await the outcome of the inquiries that are being undertaken in the United Kingdom. Of course we must look at the causes of this situation and the crisis that occurred, and particularly at the application of Community law. In that respect I am pleased to be speaking before Commissioner McCreevy. I look forward to what he has to say. It is vital, as I have said, that we do not rush to make a judgement. The witnesses have been extremely forthcoming and cooperative with the Committee of Inquiry. Uppermost in our minds, as the former speaker said, is that we have some recourse to justice, but we must certainly ensure that another Equitable Life crisis never happens again. Those people did what, arguably, we ask all good citizens to do: provide for their retirement, their future. They did so in what should be arguably one of the safest investment pots in any investment industry. It failed to be so, on the evidence that we have before us. I commend the report and the work of the temporary committee.
 Michael Cashman (PSE

 Mr President, I am saddened by what I have heard here this afternoon from our Polish colleagues from the League of Polish Families and the Law and Justice Party. I have heard from them about the promotion of hatred, the promotion of discrimination, the promotion of evil. We have heard family and religion used as a reason or an excuse. There is no reason, and there is no excuse, for the promotion of hatred. I have heard traditional values referred to. What value is there in diminishing the lives of ordinary human beings? There is none. This House was built on the ashes of the Second World War. When it was built we vowed that no minority would ever be scapegoated again. We stand by that. We will defend that. I was in Warsaw on the march that your Government tried to ban. Let me say to you: the reception that we got from those decent, ordinary people confirmed to me that your two parties do not represent those decent ordinary men and women of Poland! (Loud applause)

 Mr President, following discussions with other groups, it is a compromise amendment. I will read it in its entirety as it is short: ... ‘reinforces the view that, in principle, the petitions process should be a right which is targeted at European citizens who do not have other means of recourse to action by the European Parliament; MEPs can avail themselves of this right through the Rules of Parliament and remind them that they have other parliamentary processes at their disposal.’
 Michael Cashman (PSE
),  
rapporteur
. –
 Mr President, when I was made first vice-chairman of the Petitions Committee, colleagues said to me that it would be rather like being the gate-keeper of a cemetery: I would see a lot going in, but not much coming out. I am pleased to report, especially during last year’s activities, that we have seen a lot going in and a great deal more coming out. A cemetery it certainly is not; it is alive and kicking and due to get livelier. It is probably one of the most important committees in the House. Some would say that, as first vice-chairman, I would
 say that; but I honestly believe it to be true. It is the direct interface between the institution and the citizens – citizens often seeking redress for problems that arise at Member State level. I am also pleased to say that we work in close conjunction with the Commission. We are a solution-based committee. People bring us problems and we try to work quickly and effectively. At Member State level, the importance of the committee representing Parliament is not always recognised. One of my recommendations would certainly be for greater attendance by Member State representatives when we are dealing with issues that are germane to them. The report is a lengthy one and that is primarily due to the fact that we have enlargement; there has been greater engagement with this committee. The petitions process and the work of the committee have played an influential role in bringing pressure to bear on Member States to ensure that EU laws are satisfactorily transposed and implemented. Importantly, it also highlights the plight of EU citizens whose rights are diminished. The introduction of the e-petitions system has proved a useful tool for Members, assistants and group staff and allows us all to keep an eye on developments on ongoing petitions. I mention some key points in my report. Without going into too much detail I should like to highlight just two areas where the committee has managed to be influential, although not totally so. The cases in point are the so-called ‘Valencian Land Grab Law’ (LRAU), Ms Fourtou’s report, which we adopted in December 2005; and one of my reports on the confiscation of cars by the Greek authorities, which we adopted earlier this year. Those examples are good illustrations to show the best and the worst of the system. Yes, we have brought about resolution in some of the cases with the Greek confiscation of the cars, but I have to say that, sadly, the situation in Valencia is still grave, and requires further monitoring. I make several recommendations in my report, including increasing the membership of the committee to approximately the same membership as other committees; and speeding up our processes in the way in which we work with the Commission to ensure close cooperation and effective working methods. I want to pay particular tribute to the Commission staff, who often come to the committee, wait for a long time and then sincerely and effectively deal with the issues before them. We cannot thank them enough. The work of the Commission staff is not always fully recognised. I feel it is important that we have clear rules, however, on the admissibility of petitions, especially for the future, in order to ensure that all citizens can have recourse to the petitions process but that the system is not abused. I have tabled only one plenary amendment to the report, on behalf of the Socialist Group, which underlines that in principle the petitions process is aimed at European citizens and reinforces the view that in principle the petitions process should be a service that is targeted at EU citizens who do not have other means of recourse to action by the European Parliament. MEPs, as citizens, can avail themselves of that right, but nonetheless they have other parliamentary processes at their disposal. I hope that other groups can support the aim of this amendment. I should also like to pay tribute to the Petitions Committee secretariat and their tireless support for the Members’ work and our work. As with other committee secretariats which I have worked with, the Petitions Committee secretariat provides high-quality assistance to us all. To put it simply, we would not be able to do the work without them. So I should like to finish by once again paying tribute to all members of the secretariat. I look forward to hearing the comments of the House. I should also like to thank the chairman of my committee, Mr Libicki, for all his work and the support that he gives me and others. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr Iturgaiz Angulo has repeated tonight in this House the claim made by a former minister of the Valencian Government – namely that I am waging a campaign with others against the Valencian Government without any evidence. I must say at once and with all due seriousness that I take these allegations, which are aimed at undermining my integrity and reputation, very seriously indeed. I will defend my reputation and my integrity to the hilt. I say to those who are making these allegations that if they believe I am waging a campaign without any evidence, can they please put their case and put it swiftly.
 Michael Cashman (PSE

rapporteur
. –
 Mr President, I would like to associate myself wholeheartedly with the statement by my friend Mr Hammerstein Mintz. I was the original rapporteur on Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 on public access to documents and I well remember the heated debates, not only within Parliament but within the Council and within the trialogue, as we set out to win the arguments for what was at that time a groundbreaking regulation. I remember – and it is worth naming some of the old EU-15 – the vehement opposition from France, Spain, Italy, Germany and Austria. I am pleased to say that the Austrian Presidency has now changed its attitude, but I mention this because it shows what a long way we have come. There are different approaches to openness and transparency. We have the wonderful Nordic example, and then we have the rather suspicious view taken in other Member States, but arguably we have nothing whatsoever to fear from transparency. What is there to fear from opening our decisions to external examination? What does a Member State have to fear from explaining to its own parliament why the minister voted as he or she did? I make several recommendations in my report and I call upon the Commission to take action. We recognise that Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 was not the end of the game but merely the beginning of a long – arguably cultural – journey to win the argument for openness and transparency within the three institutions. We come from different traditions. That is why I have called for a further review of the regulation. This review was provided for in the original recommendation and there are several areas concerning the regulation’s implementation which now, several years later, could be substantially improved on the basis of the lessons that we have learned from its implementation. We need to look again at the definitions of legislative and non-legislative texts in relation to public access to documents, in order to ensure that all the institutions are working in an open and transparent manner. Access to documents is not a gift – it is a right. This is especially important when Parliament and the Council are working in a legislative capacity. Increased interinstitutional cooperation and increased use of the codecision procedure necessitate greater openness by the Council in particular. Citizens must be able to see what is being agreed in their names by national ministers of national governments so that they and opposition parties can hold them to account. We need to look at the way we define the circumstances in which specific documents can be classified completely, or in part, as confidential. These rules should provide legitimate derogations for specific clearly-defined reasons, but should not be interpreted in a broad sense, which would essentially have the result of denying public access to documents. Here is the point on which I shall finish: we won the argument from 1999 until May 2001 when the regulation was adopted. Time and time again we have won the argument for a review of the internal rules of the institutions so that the Council in particular, when meeting in its legislative capacity, should meet in public and vote in public. The arguments have been won. I know the Vice-President is personally committed to the whole notion of openness and transparency. The House is committed, but that is not enough. We have a wonderful window of opportunity on 9 May, Europe Day. Let us make Europe Day a positive day when we can announce how we will improve the citizens’ right to know what is done in their name. Finally, there is a rise of anti-Europeanism, not least in the ten new countries that joined us two years ago. Often governments which bring a country into the family of the European Union suffer as a result; they are not re-elected. We would be a friend of anti-Europeanism if we continue to cloak what we do in secrecy. Let us take on the anti-Europeans. Let us promote our institutions. Let us celebrate what we do. Let us bring forward that review of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001, not reluctantly but with enthusiasm.

 Mr President, I shall not detain the House by taking up two valuable minutes but would like to commend to the House the very valuable work of Mr Hammerstein Mintz. He has worked very closely with all of us, and on behalf of the PSE Group I would like to say that he has the full support of my group. If you would allow me, I failed to thank my good colleague Mrs Cederschiöld with whom I worked very closely, as with others, on my report, and I thank the House for its patience.

 Mr President, I would like to thank Vice-President Frattini for his comments. As the rapporteur on the Schengen border code, I believe that we did set the precedent for close and effective cooperation. We all know the substance of this report. It is about making people’s lives easier and improving the daily lives of our citizens. Arguably, that is what we should focus on more and more. It reinforces the Schengen border code. We know that, once we have secure external borders, freedom of movement within the EU will be much simpler and more easily controlled. Equally, we must remember that we need to be sensible. Like Mr Brejc, Mr Lax, and others, I myself have adopted that approach. If what comes from the Commission is sensible, we only need to amend it to improve, simplify or clarify. That must be our approach. We will then bring forward effective and well-understood regulation that is easy to implement at our borders. As the shadow rapporteur on the Visa Information System, that is also the approach I want to take. I know the rapporteur for the Schengen Information System is here today and I believe that, by cooperating in order to secure our borders and make sure that the information we have is used effectively, we will enhance the single biggest benefit of being a member of the EU, which is freedom of movement. Congratulations to all concerned. (Applause)
 Michael Cashman (PSE

rapporteur

 Mr President, it is a sadness to have to deal with this issue, which goes to the heart of the acquis communautaire
. One could say that we are dealing with a Greek tragedy, but one that affects other EU citizens. On the Committee on Petitions, above all other committees, I believe we have to put aside our national and party political obligations and allegiances in order to deliver natural justice for the citizens who approach us. We have received numerous petitions from citizens across the EU concerning confiscation of their cars by the Greek authorities. The petitioners have stated that Greece has not properly implemented Directive 83/182/EEC, which concerns conditions for the exemption of certain taxes and excise duties for EU citizens who are normally resident
 – and that is key – in another Member State. The Greek authorities have also imposed disproportionately high administrative penalties and confiscated petitioners’ property, claiming that those concerned were attempting to evade tax payments. The petitioners have been asked, in some instances, to pay up to ten times the level of customs duties without any due recognition of the actual value of the motor vehicle. This report has been discussed several times in committee and was adopted by a large majority at the end of November. The petitioners came to present their petition, explaining that, in some cases, they have had to pay fees and fines of up to EUR 45 000 to retrieve their property, after the Greek authorities had impounded and confiscated their vehicles. Both I, as rapporteur, and the chairman of the Committee on Petitions have been in regular contact with the Greek authorities to try and resolve these issues and the cases that are currently before them. An amendment to the law on the Greek national customs code has been adopted by the Greek Parliament. However, I am informed that this law still gives the Greek Government the power to confiscate vehicles in this situation. It is worth remembering that the petitioners have fulfilled the conditions for exemption, laid down in Directive 83/182/EEC, from, in particular, turnover tax, excise duty and other consumption tax, in respect of temporary imports from another Member State of motor-driven road vehicles. All the petitioners have their normal residence – i.e., the place where they live at least 185 days in each calendar year, because of personal or occupational ties – in a Member State other than Greece; that is, they fulfil the conditions laid down in the directive. The petitioners were also able to give absolute proof of their normal place of residence by appropriate means, such as identity cards or other valid documents. Furthermore, the imposition of a special administrative penalty and, in particular, of fines set at a flat rate on the basis of the sole criterion of the cubic capacity of the vehicle – with no account being taken of the age of that vehicle – as well as of an increased duty, which, in some cases, can amount to up to ten times the taxes in question, is – not only in my opinion, but in the opinion of the Commission – incompatible with the Community principle of proportionality. Finally, I hope that the adoption of this report will send a very strong signal to the Greek authorities that they must amend their law so that it is in conformity with the EU directives that I have referred to. Often in the EU, we believe that the acquis communautaire
 is an à la carte
 menu from which we can pick and choose what we like. On the contrary: the acquis communautaire 
and being a member of the EU means that we adopt fully and transpose properly the acquis
. I call on the Commission to tell us what actions it will be taking if the Greek authorities fail to implement the Community directive appropriately.
 Michael Cashman (PSE
),  
rapporteur
. –
 Mr President, there was a suggestion, interestingly from my own side of the House, that we were targeting Greece unfairly. Let me just say that, in the Committee on Petitions, we can only react to and deal with petitions that we have received and we have received no petitions from any other Member State regarding the confiscation of vehicles. As Commissioner Kovács quite rightly said, where there are problems, vehicles have not been confiscated. I therefore say to Members of the House that they should look at the title of this report. Quite clearly Greece is not in compliance with this directive. There are clear violations, otherwise the infringement process would not have begun. When we sign up to laws, we have to implement them properly. Whether the case is before the Court or not, given that we are co-legislator it would be staggering if the European Parliament did not have an opinion on whether a Member State is compliant. Finally, the resolution of this problem quite clearly lies with the Greek authorities. They can resolve it swiftly or they can leave it to the European Court of Justice.
 Michael Cashman (PSE
). – 
 Mr President, I wish to express my disappointment at the statement made by Commissioner Frattini, which was more a repetition than a statement. Commissioner, we know you are concerned and we know the Commission is concerned, but the Commission should be judged on what it does. Infringement proceedings must be brought against any Member State that fails to transpose or implement the appropriate directives already in force in a number of Member States. I agree that we must campaign and educate, but that in itself is not enough. A proposal for a horizontal directive directly related to the race and ethnicity directive promised by President Borroso must be brought before this House. I am saddened by some of the contributions this afternoon. This is about equality, not about promoting homosexuality. It is about giving homosexuals the equal rights and equality that others take so much for granted. I am gay. I am a homosexual, born to an ordinary man and woman. Because of that some people will wish to take away my right to talk about my sexuality, to celebrate my 22-year relationship and to be part of a wider community. Some would vilify me, take away my democratic rights and use hate-speak against me. I could decide to go on a gay pride march, but that gay pride march could be banned. Why? Because society is preoccupied with what it perceives as my sex life. A judgement has been made on it. Where is the morality in that? Where is the morality in preaching and promoting discrimination and hatred, sometimes behind the shield and the excuse of religion or belief? I say to Commission Frattini and the entire Commission, as well as to this House, that if we do nothing when we see people beaten to death, vilified and discriminated against then we are condoning and becoming complicit in those beatings, in the hate-speak, the defamation and the ill-treatment. Even in the United Kingdom, where enormous advances have been made, a young man was kicked to death just before Christmas for no other reason than he was homosexual. If this House does nothing then it is party to every single blow that was rained upon that individual and other men like him and on gay women across the European Union. That I should even have to make such a statement here in Parliament makes this a day of great sadness. (Applause)
 Michael Cashman (PSE
). – 
 Mr President, if we cannot be respectful in listening to one another, there is hardly any reason to be here. I rise under the precedent of Rule 145. I would like to inform the House that the Council left their building over an hour ago, the traffic in the vicinity of Strasbourg is extremely bad and it is not the intention of Her Majesty’s Government to slight this House or its Members. I am told that the government representative is five minutes away. I beg the House’s indulgence. (Mixed reactions)
 Michael Cashman (PSE
). – 
 Madam President, this is a very difficult debate because, interestingly, groups that are normally homogeneous are split; political allies who normally work with one another are split. I have absolute respect for those who have their reservations about that which is being proposed. I ask that they have respect for those of us who believe that this is a way of protecting fundamental freedoms. It is important to restate that this is not about the data within the calls or on the internet; it is about traffic data, and it is arguably to allow us to protect fundamental freedoms. Of course, there are costs; there are costs to businesses, there are costs to each and every one of us, but the cost if we do nothing is cataclysmic. We have to deal with the real and imagined threats. There are people who use the Internet to entrap young women and children into prostitution rings. If we can break one prostitution ring with this directive, that alone would have been worth it. I and my group are proud that we have achieved a compromise that delivers and protects fundamental freedoms.
 Michael Cashman (PSE

 –
 Mr President, I welcome the statements from the President-in-Office of the Council and from the Commissioner. However, I want to address my words to the Members of this House. After 11 September, the bombings in Madrid, London and Turkey are a wake-up call. We have heard the Council and the Commission being urged to act. Of course they have to act, but so does the European Parliament. Terrorists and organised criminals use modern technology while we, in this House, argue and debate whether our police and intelligence services should have access to the same tools and the same technology. We argue in defence of the right of privacy whilst our citizens' lives are being physically damaged, undermined and sometimes terminated. Ordinary men and women look to us to make their lives and their communities safer. Yes, we must achieve a balance on privacy, on the retention of data and the use of data, but not to the point where we hand the terrorists and criminals an advantage that undermines our own way of life and gives them the opportunity to commit further atrocities. In this House we must end the interinstitutional argument and act collectively with the Commission and the Council to achieve agreement, with checks and balances on data retention, the use of biometrics, passenger name records, Schengen Information System II, VIS, police and intelligence cooperation. Balance is essential. But remember this: terrorists have no respect for democracy and even less respect for human rights, except their own. Political extremists will exploit the vacuum we create by our inaction and our prolonged deliberations, undertaken comfortably within our secure environments. Our citizens fear that we have lost touch with reality and do not understand their fears, their needs, their lives. Extremists will and do use the explosive cocktail of terrorism, immigration and asylum and the fear of the stranger to pursue their own agenda, which will diminish the rights of the vulnerable. We must be practical and sensible in our approach, but we must act. Freedom of movement across the European Union is seen as the biggest single benefit of being a member of the EU. That new right has been acquired because we have ceded another right. We have consented to the fact that information can be collected, retained and used on us. Had we not ceded that right of privacy, we would not have freedom of movement across the European Union.
 Michael Cashman (PSE

 Madam President, first of all I wish to point out that organised religions have only been around for some 2 000 years, and we are in danger of elevating them to a position that they should not have. Of course there should be a dialogue, but it should be on the same the basis as for any other non-governmental organisation. We have to ensure absolutely the separation of religion and politics. Religions have achieved a great deal on behalf of citizens but, equally, they have opposed advances. In my own country, the rights of women, lesbians and gay men have been opposed every single step of the way by organised religion. There was a mention of slavery by the previous speaker. Indeed, when we were trying to end slavery in the United States, the religions there tried to prevent its abolition. Therefore, we should have that dialogue: a dialogue where we tell them what we – the institutions – intend to do, where we listen to their arguments as to why we should modulate or change, but we must have the courage to act in advance of public opinion and in advance of those sectors within religions that would prevent any progress. When these meetings take place, the minutes, recommendations and list of attendees must be available for public dissemination. If they are not, I would point Members to Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001, which assures public access to documents held, received or produced by the institutions and the agencies set up by them.
 Michael Cashman (PSE
). 
 –
 Madam President, what the Commissioner has said in relation to Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 is incorrect, and I speak as the rapporteur on that regulation. Not only can the list of attendance be requested, but also minutes, agendas, decisions taken and any other material accumulated or discussed. Any documents that are requested can be refused only under Article 4 – exceptions – and Article 9 – sensitive documents. I should like to reassure the House that it is not only the list of attendance that can be accessed by Parliament and members of the public.
 Michael Cashman (PSE

rapporteur

 Mr President, it has been a real privilege to work on this dossier, primarily because when we began people told us we would not complete it under the Austrian presidency, let alone under the Luxembourg presidency. The importance of this has been underlined by the previous speakers. It is the first time that the Parliament has acted in codecision in the area of asylum, immigration and border control. It is extremely important that the Parliament dealt with this dossier in a mature, reasonable and practicable way. Wish lists are for the past. Of course we have not achieved everything that we in Parliament wanted; as we know that is the nature of compromise. That is not to say that compromise is a bad word, it is a brilliant word. Compromise is the whole notion on which the European project was built in the early 1950s and in 1957. I am proud that today we are legislating. In this House, and indeed in our other institutions, we talk too much and do not deliver enough. Tonight we are legislating and bringing forward changes that will have a real effect on real lives. As was mentioned earlier, each of us, especially as politicians, can talk a defining moment into a crisis. But what do we achieve in doing this? We actually reinforce the argument from eurosceptics and the europhobes that this House means nothing and achieves nothing. We have difficulties, but out of difficulties comes a rebirth, a renaissance. Without a renaissance there is nothing for the future. So, codecision does not have to be slow, but it has to be thorough and it has to be built on absolute mutual respect for each of the parties involved in the negotiations. Why have we have achieved so much? Because we have done it on the basis that only by acting together can we achieve more than we could ever achieve by acting alone. I have to thank my fellow rapporteurs. There have been no shadows in this report; we have been equal rapporteurs, equal participants and without them we could not have presented this document today. I would like to thank Mr Battilocchio for the opinion he gave on behalf of the Committee on Development. More importantly, I would like to thank those people who sit behind us – sometimes seen, sometimes unseen: our assistants and our advisers, without whom we could not do this work. Those people are so rarely thanked. So let me say once again, we have achieved a great deal. We have reinforced the role of the Parliament, especially in the re-introduction of internal borders. We have reinforced the role of the Commission, but again I wish we could have done more in relation to spot checks on the application of the Schengen acquis
, which was not possible. I wanted us to have a right of appeal or for the European Court of Justice to have jurisdiction. We did not achieve this, but we achieved a great deal more. On non-discrimination akin to Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, for example, there is the right of people undergoing second line checks to have those checks conducted with dignity and, if necessary, in a non-public area. On refusal of entry, there will be clearer explanations of the justification of that refusal and the right of appeal once the appellant has returned to their country of origin. And where appeals are successful, the necessary compensation will be provided according to national law and corrections. We have reinforced and upheld the principle of freedom of movement for EU citizens and others with a right to reside which, in a Eurobarometer poll, was seen as the single biggest benefit of being in the European Union. As an inclusion to the main body of text, the annexes are extremely important when we come to adopt and review this regulation in future. Regular reports on the implementation of the regulation are to be compiled by the Commission. Also, very importantly, there is the declaration by the Council and the Parliament on the issue of stateless citizens which states that ‘the European Parliament and the Council request the Commission to bring forward proposals, in the framework of the revision of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001, in order to exempt holders of aliens’ and non-citizens’ passports residing in a Member State from the visa obligation’. I am proud of what we have done, I am proud of the collaboration and I now wait to hear from my co-rapporteurs.

 Mr President, I am pleased to follow the honourable gentleman, Mr Mote. With that contribution, he gives us evidence that he is an expert on political folly. As a member of UKIP, he gives us a double affirmation of that. Let me say Mr President, that discrimination diminishes every single one of us and if we stand by and do nothing, we endorse it. That is why I welcome Mrs Gál’s report and the establishment of the fundamental rights agency. However, we must not make too many demands upon the agency or it will fail in the beginning. It needs to work in conjunction with the three institutions and ensure that the proposals coming from those institutions are compatible with and not in contradiction of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and our international obligations. Its focus should be within the EU, but at the same time it should have a role in the formulation of our EU Association agreement. I welcome this consultation process but I will pay more heed to the concrete proposals that will follow. Let me say two things. Mr Kirkhope, who is no longer in the Chamber, said that politics should not enter the work of the agency. It seems to me that he wants to neuter the organisation before it begins. Decisions to end infringement of fundamental rights must be taken in the political context and cannot be taken regardless of those consequences. Indeed, some political delegations in this House have never voted in favour of non–
discrimination measures. That in itself party politicises non–
discrimination measures and fundamental rights. Mr Pęk was vehemently against this: European taxpayers will pay. If European taxpayers had not paid, we would still be under the stranglehold of the demonisation that followed the Second World War and Soviet domination. We must have the guts to pay for our freedoms and defend them. If Mr Pęk and Mr Mote are against it, Mrs Gál must have taken the right route and I recommend this report to the House. (Applause)

 Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner and also congratulate Mr Wieland on his excellent report. As a member of the Committee on Petitions, may I say that it is a really good example of a cross-party, consensual approach to problem-solving. However, Member States’ responses are often inadequate. Sometimes they are simply not forthcoming. The Council is rarely present in the committees. However, recognition is due to the Commission officials who regularly brief our committee for the work we are undertaking. The committee is a brilliant interface between the citizens and the institutions and it brings forward solutions to problems at both EU and Member State level. Member States’ intransigence is also highlighted. I would, at this point, also like to pay tribute to our current chairman Mr Libicki, who has carried on the good work of our previous chairman. There is only one element in Mr Wieland’s report with which I could perhaps quibble, and that is his reference in paragraph 17 to a standing working group or subcommittee. This is, after all, a report on the previous year’s deliberations and we should not undermine the role or the work of the Bureau and its coordinators. But I look forward to seeing how we can address the issue of the increasing number of petitions that we have to deal with. You will not have heard this from me before, Commissioner, but in that regard we will need additional resources. Without the resources, we cannot serve our citizens. The secretariat is severely understaffed, but again I have to pay tribute to its staff. They work extremely hard and supply us with everything we need, but their job would be a lot easier if the secretariat was fully staffed. We also need additional resources to promote the right of petition, especially in the new Member States, and to ensure that, where necessary, the Commission is fully willing and able to enforce the infringement process. Finally, we must never forget that the right to petition enshrined in the Treaties is an important example of the exercise of citizens’ democratic rights and their ability to hold the institutions and their Member States to account. (Applause)

 – Mr President, first of all I would like to apologise to the services, who do a great deal of work, most of it unthanked and unrecognised. I know that they work long through the night. I approached them yesterday in relation to a ruling on paragraph 89 of the Commission's legislative proposals. I have to apologise because I believed that another colleague would raise this at the time and I expected a ruling on the admissibility of that paragraph from you. Therefore, I should like to ask if such a ruling has been made. If so, was it made in conjunction with paragraph 88? In any event, is what we voted on today legally admissible?
 Cashman (PSE
). 
 – Mr President, I am sorry to raise this again but, given that this issue was raised, I thought, as indicated in the voting list, that the matter had been referred to the authorities for a ruling. We expected – perhaps wrongly – that the ruling would be made prior to the vote being taken. Mr President, are you telling me that the ruling was that paragraph 89, as written, was in any event admissible?
 Cashman (PSE

 Mr President, as I stand here today I feel that, if I was living around Auschwitz 60 years ago, as a gay man I would have been rounded up, sent to the camp and I, probably, would not have survived. What we have to do here today is to separate the people from the groups – from the names we call them – because we are dealing with millions of individuals who died because they posed a threat to some ideology or because they were different. In this House we talk about fundamental freedoms and fundamental rights, yet all around us in the world today racism, xenophobia, homophobia, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism still exist. Therefore, it does not matter what we say today; what matters is what we do. The Commission’s proposals will matter. It will matter whether it has the courage to bring forward non-discrimination on all
 the grounds of Article 13, and not just some. To do the latter would be to reinforce a hierarchy of oppression. We must all bear responsibility for what happened in the past – every nation, every country. But the difference is that we are either imprisoned by the past or we become guardians of the future to ensure that such inhumanities never occur again. Remember the people with disabilities, the trade unionists, the anti-fascists, the homosexuals and the millions of others mentioned here tonight who died. We must be determined that such a scenario never occurs again. Let me finish with what Pastor Niemöller brilliantly said: ‘When they came for the Jews, I was a not a Jew, so I did not speak out. When they came for the trade unionists, I was not a trade unionist, so I did not speak out. When they came for the queers, I was not a homosexual, so I did not speak out. When they came for me, there was no one left to speak out’. Remember and determine to change the future.

 The Socialist group supported the above report when voted in LIBE committee on the 25th October 2004. The report, as voted in Committee, included the obligatory insertion of a digital photograph whilst leaving the option of a second biometric (a digital fingerprint) up to the Member States. The PES position was carried in committee, a position which afforded necessary data protection and civil liberties protections (see amendments 5,7,8,9,10,11,12). Furthermore, the Socialist group supports the protections in article 2 and article 4 paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the Council position of 23rd November. At the Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting end November 2004, it was decided that two biometrics would be obligatory (digital photo and fingerprint). The Council expressed its desire to take a final decision on this issue during its meeting of 3rd December 2004. The Council insists that the report be adopted by the EP during its December I plenary. The PES group sees no gain for the European Parliament in challenging the Council to reconsult the Parliament on this report which falls under the consultation procedure. The PES group urges the Council to recognise the Parliament's good faith shown in respecting the Council's desired timetable on this report.

 Mr President, as someone who opposed the previous nominee, I should like to say to Commissioner Frattini how pleased I am to see him take up his duties. I would like to welcome Mr Coelho’s report – it is an excellent piece of work. On behalf of my Group, however, I have to state that we are not happy that there has not been time for Parliament to be reconsulted on the new proposals from the Council. We have concerns – although thankfully some of them have been met – with regard to the protection and integrity of data, verification by the passport holder of that data, the insertion of any corrections necessary, and restrictions on the use of the passport and the data. The reality is that our citizens want freedom of movement not only within our borders, but outside those borders too. We must therefore be realistic in our approach and ensure that biometrics in passports ensure free and virtually unrestricted movement across borders so we can focus on and combat organised crime, traffickers, drug barons and terrorists. However, one particular fear that arises from this, and which has frequently been discussed in our debates, is that of the capture of data. In this area we must be extremely vigilant. Access to data must be carefully regulated by national legislation in accordance with the provisions of Community law, European law and our international agreements. Biometrics in passports must reinforce privacy and civil liberties and must not be used as a catalyst to assault fundamental freedoms and rights. In conclusion, I welcome the protection of citizens’ rights and freedoms as contained in Articles 2 and 3 of the Council document agreed on 23 November 2004. I commend Mr Coelho’s report and in particular Amendments 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12, which reinforce citizens’ rights.

 Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mr Diamandouros and the rapporteur on their work. I should now like to turn to Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001. Contrary to criticism, the regulation on public access to documents works quite well. I urge the Commission to accept our demand for a revision of that regulation, especially in respect of the new Constitution. If the Council is to meet in public when it acts in a legislative capacity, we need a definition of a 'legislative capacity'. I should like to mention Mrs Sinnott's remarks. It seems she has left the Chamber, but she indicated that the Ombudsman is a manifestation of an undemocratic process. Is she stating that the Scandinavian countries with an ombudsman enshrined in their constitutions are undemocratic? If that is what she means to say, then she should apologise. I should also like to say to another honourable Member, who I believe is a member of UKIP – she must be sleeping! – that the role of an ombudsman reinvigorates and reinforces the democratic process. It is a part of the appeal process and it is about recourse to natural justice. With regard to the infringement proceedings, I do not share the opinion that the infringement proceeding process is being abused by the Commission. The infringement process often leads to a judicial process. To make such documents public before a decision to go to the courts is made is to undermine either side in that legal process. I thank Mr Diamandouros and the House for listening so politely.

 Mr President, I find it somewhat ironic that all of the men who have spoken on the other side of this House have had the temerity to tell women what they should do with their bodies. I am proud to stand here and defend a woman's right to choose. That is fundamentally what this is about. It is about choice. It is about informed choice. I find it sad that there are people in this House who want to imprison citizens and women, in ignorance. This is about a fundamental freedom, with the focus on abortion, a highly emotive subject. It is easy for you to try and divert this debate, but it must not be diverted. It is about fundamental freedoms: freedom of information; freedom of movement; freedom of expression; and it is about intolerance. That is why I am proud to stand here and say that if we allow this to happen in Portugal, what happens when there is another government that has another view about opinions that are different from their own? What happens then? If we stand here and do nothing, we condone these undemocratic attitudes. I have heard religion mentioned. I am very sad. I see the fingers of the Vatican all over this. Women need no lectures from men in frocks, telling them what they should do with their bodies. (Applause from the left)
 Please keep your religion out of our lives and please keep it out of politics. If we could separate politics and religion, I tell you now that the world would be a safer and better place in which to live. (Applause from the left)
 I condemn the actions of the Portuguese Government and I urge this House to do likewise. This issue goes to the heart of Europe. Ours is a Europe based not on suppression of information or repression, but on fundamental freedoms and human rights. The actions of the Portuguese Government must not and will not go unchallenged. Finally, as I said previously, this is about informed choice as opposed to enforced ignorance. Therefore I call on the Commission to act in its capacity as guardian of the Treaties and the fundamental rights enshrined in those Treaties. (Applause from the left)

 I congratulate Mr Karas. This vote is an excellent outcome for many reasons. First, among them is the fact this is a package which Parliament recommended and negotiated. I have been in such negotiations and I know how difficult such talks can be. Second, is the substance, which is to say this legislation delivers better protection for British and other citizens across the EU. Securitisation was the method by which the so-called ‘toxic assets’ were spread between banks, leaving huge debts in many private and public banks. The idea of retention of the originator asset by as much as 5%, subject to a review after impact assessments and international changes, is vital. Reducing the ‘leveraging’ and ensuring the proper capital adequacy of banks is the guard against behaviour by banks which has brought us to the very edge of financial disaster. Mr Karas can be satisfied with his work in the negotiations. I know how difficult it is for Parliament to get improvements to texts, but this first reading deal is a sensible one.

 Mr President, this ban is great progress and represents a true victory for campaigners across the South East of England particularly – as you could imagine – and across the European Union, many of whom have written to us in the House to demand the end of this cruel trade. The fact that a Labour chair of committee led this campaign, in the face of intense lobbying by the perpetrators of this cruel and obscene trade, is crucial in realising its success. It was not the watered-down original – as my colleague, Richard Corbett pointed out – but, after critical amendments were proposed by Arlene McCarthy, the ban was voted through in the committee and now in Parliament. I was intrigued just now to hear Mr Hannan from the Conservative Party suggesting this should be a matter of national discussion and democracy. If we were to rely upon that particular route, only eight countries would be signing up to this particular ban, as opposed to the 27 by voting it through the European Parliament. It shows that trade and animal welfare are compatible and we should rejoice in that.

 This report recognises the reaction of global leaders that tax havens are a part of a global economy which should contribute positively to the wider interests. Much work has been done already on withholding taxes, and this report adds to the current interest in raising transparency of savings and transactions in such tax havens.

 I agree with the recommendations emerging from this resolution, which comes at an urgent time to address the financial crisis. It must first be said that we are not through the crisis yet and that the authorities cannot relax in the thought that it will pass. Several key aspects are important to be acted on. First, dealing with ‘systemic risks’: the international institutions need to be strengthened to face future threats. Inside the EU a sole authority such as the ECB must be considered for reasons of coordinating strong actions when urgently required. Secondly, the revamping of existing legislation and introduction of new legislation which recognises the specific needs of sectors of the financial services industry, in particular Solvency II and CRD, are vital elements which contribute to the management of risk. Also, credit rating agencies are now going to be regulated. On the fiscal measures currently being envisaged by Member States, it is important to continue with sensible, balanced approaches which also do not add up to protectionism. We will face rising unemployment and falling demand. Social policies, too, have to reflect the concerns of European citizens and need to be of higher concern than seems apparent from the recommendations currently known.

 The G20 recommendations to the Working Group on Financial Services clearly call for greater transparency and regulation of credit rating agencies. This report, which was a response from the European Parliament to the G20, is the right balance.

 Peter Skinner,

 Madam President, you caught me slightly unawares as I had not seen the complete change of the timetable today, but I am very grateful for the chance to address the Chamber about a very important issue of the financial services industry, that is, the insurance and reinsurance industry, what we have done with the Solvency II report and how we have finally brought this now to Parliament in order to be able to establish what I think will be a very concrete basis for regulation across the European Union. It is, of course, something which we are coming back to. There was Solvency I, and I am grateful to Mr Ettl when previously in Parliament we discussed this at some length and we managed to come up with some basis. But now we have to modernise, and the insurance industry is amongst many financial services industries which have to be at the forefront of change. It is clear, with the financial crisis and everything that has gone along with it, that the insurance industry is something which cannot be left alone. There are several measures which come about from Solvency II which I think have helped to make this one of the leading reports, which will be a global leader at that. Amongst them is the issue of management of risk. I think it is not enough now that regulators simply tick boxes to establish whether or not the industry that they are meant to be guarding and protecting on behalf of the consumer is doing the right thing. It is essential that the day-to-day business of insurance and reinsurance companies is actually watched, managed and monitored by regulators over a period of time. It is by this process and this process alone that we will be able to establish a proper and appropriate form of regulation. It is the reporting of companies: yes, they will be doing things to tell regulators what they are doing, but regulators will have to be involved. And across 27 Member States: not each individual Member State with their own separate rules now, considering what they can apply in terms of that regulation, but indeed they will be applying a standard formula of regulation across the European Union, which will lead, frankly, to the better consumer platform of protection that we expect. Similarly, companies will manage to get economies of scale from this regulation, because now they will be reporting only in one way to each of the regulators. What they produce, what they have to say, what they do and how they report, will not just be to one regulator but it could be to a college of regulators, especially for groups, because, as insurance companies cross borders, it is now important that regulators team up and work together to ensure that the appropriate levels of reporting, the appropriate levels of figures and what information is supplied, are brought to bear to make sure that the markets are best protected. It was during the discussion with the Council that Parliament saw some interesting and perhaps sometimes even deliberate ploys to move national industries one way or another, so I cannot pretend that this has not been a very difficult dossier to try to negotiate with the Council: it has. Parliament has pushed the Council a long way. It pushed it further than I think the Council established and really wanted to go under the last two presidencies, so I am very proud and pleased to have worked with the team that I have in order to be able to get the Council to move. Unfortunately we will not have the kind of group support that we initially envisaged that we should, but because we are able to insert a review clause in this directive, we will be able to come back to group support and, three years after the introduction of this particular directive, I am hoping – and I expect the Commissioner to tell me that he will anticipate doing this as well – to be able to bring back group support in one way or another, specifically to match the economic side of this particular approach. We want a regulation that is risk-based and principle-based, but one that will also support the capacity of the industry and one that will promote the very best instincts of regulators across the European Union and abroad. I will just finish on this one note. We must also challenge regulators elsewhere in the world and recognise country-to-country regimes only. I hope the Commissioner will agree with me about that.
 Peter Skinner,  
rapporteur

 Madam President, I would like to start by saying what I should perhaps have said first of all, which is a thank you to all the services of the Commission, the Council, and particularly the Parliament, for the work that they put into this. I have to say that without their work and their help, we would not have achieved this. Like many around the room, we are quite astounded by the level of technical detail that goes into many of these reports, but let us say about Solvency II that it was forged outside a crisis to face a crisis. It has risk management in it and – as many people have heard round the room – this is a first for much of the financial services legislation. It also does – and I agree with the Commissioner – contain group supervision. Group support, unfortunately, is out, but we have heard all about that. Let us hope that we can get that back. Capital is defined as well. Many aspects of this report make it a world leader. My second point is about the strategic impact of using such legislation. In many respects, just having a regulation that works over 27 Member States is not going to be helped if we do not have the twin, which is a strategic regulator at a European level which works over 27 Member States as well. We need to overcome the differences that exist between regulators and make sure that we speak with one voice. It is particularly important when we come to recognise regimes elsewhere in the world. Just this weekend I met with Paul Kanjorski, Chair of the Subcommittee on Finance in the US Congress, and others, who are now talking about accelerating the prospects for a single regulator at a federal level in the United States. It they do that before we do it in Europe, we could be severely embarrassed by not having the regulator we need at a European level. This is a report which is at a global level and a global measure, a process about which we could all feel proud, but we also need to make sure that we continue to push for the changes on the issues thrown up by the de Larosière report and also on group support which will bring about economic efficiency. I hope that everybody can support those measures.

− For many across the EU and indeed wider Europe, the consequences of totalitarianism, with its millions of deaths, is a crucial historical point. It has helped to form many minds of later generations, but for those who lived during this period of time it represents a terrible scar in European development. Extremism is still a current threat and these extremists have an unwitting friend in the ballot box – lethargy. As politicians, awareness of the danger to our freedoms and our very lives is something we must all strive to remind current and future generations. This is why I can support this motion for a resolution.

 Mr President, I, too, voted for this report as so many of my constituents – as has been the case across the European Union – have been so badly affected by this particular problem. The requirement to have legal certainty about purchasing property is essential and is brought about by this report, which seeks to get the kinds of insurances that are necessary to see change. It also addresses the specific issues of complaints concerning illegal practices by local builders and certain local authorities. I voted for this report because I believe it is going to help secure a formal process; it is going to highlight something that I regarded in the past as being just a derogatory statement, i.e. ‘Spanish practices’. I would like to ensure that term never sees the light of day again and I would like to see the Commission, the Council and the Spanish Government deal with this issue and come down hard, so that those who have lost out can get compensation or those who are there can feel secure.

– Mr President, I particularly welcome this report and I share some of the points that were raised just now, but perhaps we should start off by formally congratulating Mr Obama on becoming President. I do not think that we have all done that here today, but it is quite clearly a breath of fresh air for what we hope will be a very positive relationship with the United States. We are very quick to point out how that relationship can work for us, of course, but we do not point out quite so often what we have to do to strengthen it and work within it. For example, trade between us, according to the OECD, is the largest between any two trading blocs anywhere in the world. It is right that it also causes us to think hard about regulation and supervision. Anything that is decided between us, both economically and politically, is of great importance to the rest of the world and often sets the global standards. I, as a member of the US delegation working on the Transatlantic Economic Council, hope that we can take further the work that we have already done there and transpose that into real efforts within this House, instead of seeing some of the silly efforts from some, on issues like chicken, which help blight that particular relationship.

 Car manufacturing within the EU depends upon reaching standards which can facilitate stronger environmental rules. This is not a contradiction to the idea of a competitive industry, but rather a contribution to its very survival. There are many European instruments which can be used to assist the car industry and its workers in particular. Among them are funds to assist training through lifelong learning. Having the right workforce which can believe in a sustainable manufacturing future is essential. I know that car manufacturers in the South-East of England now have the opportunity to take advantage of financial facilities which can promote car manufacture of the future. This must be balanced with environmental and social conditions.

The EPLP can support the main thrust of the rapporteur’s ideas and believes that many of the issues outlined are critical for a real recovery. The Commission response during the economic crisis has been muted and Parliament believes that more effective tools are required to produce recovery. In fact, an environmental approach could lead to greater innovation and spark renewed productivity whilst also having a positive effect on our environment. However, care has to be taken not to injure specific industrial sectors or reduce our overall economic possibilities, and therefore consideration of a targeted approach is very necessary. Similarly, a new approach to financial supervision denoted by the de Larosière wise men’s report is also vital to ensuring against systemic risks.

Given that small to medium-sized businesses are the strongest element of growth in the economy, this proposal helps to strengthen the conditions for such growth.

We consider that VAT reduction can make a contribution to the maintenance of certain jobs and allow for the creation of others. Each country has submitted experiences which have allowed for some belief in the fact that local conditions need local reactions; this is true of a tax such as VAT. In the UK a general reduction in VAT has led to a fall in inflation of 1% and an injection into the economy of GBP 12 billion.

 I voted against this report. The strength and security of Europe has depended for some time on the allies willing to play an active role in our defence. On Europe’s borders and across the world today it is clear that NATO continues to provide the nexus of cooperation which provides for our safety and the safety of others. Clearly from time to time changes in global strategic interests mean adjusting priorities and approaches. The need for NATO to maintain continued vigilance and be supported, especially in Afghanistan at this present time, is essential. That is why calls for more troop commitments and logistical support need to be heeded by other European nations. I also welcome the French commitment now recently announced.

 The targets set by the EU to reach a coordinated reduction are vital if there is to be corresponding change for the better in our environment. I voted to improve the structure of this coordination by use of a variety of sources – including the beneficial effects of safe nuclear energy production – all of which needs to be reviewed in the light of advice from national inspectorates and changes in technology. Given that funding is necessary I voted too in favour of ETS auctioning revenue to be used to meet the costs of any changes needed. This includes investment in new technology. An Emissions Trading Scheme for aviation, whilst it may have only a marginal effect, is still an appropriate way ahead.

− There are several reasons why this agreement strengthens the EU internal market and cooperation in standards as well as maintaining consumer protection. First among them is that science is a global discipline and advances we can share go towards increasing the sum total of human endeavour. Benefits which we can work towards are specifically and generally a positive. Whether it is the car industry working to reduce emissions, or universities creating strategic links, the success of promoting this agreement is measurable. Consumers, too, are beneficiaries indirectly, as the best minds can be brought to bear to create greater trust in the answers to our joint concerns.
 Peter Skinner  (PSE

− The EU has ambitious plans, matched against a risk that resources will be increasingly constrained as populations around the globe demand more energy. The answers, in maintaining current security of supply and developing efficient non-carbon based energy, are not mutually exclusive. Safety of our environment and avoidance of energy poverty among those people, particularly in the South-East of England who live on fixed incomes, are equally important objectives. That is why I support a mixture of technological solutions to energy supply in the EU. Whilst I respect the necessity for caution in the nuclear industry as regards safety, I believe it offers a degree of certainty: if we were deprived of this process now, it would be accordingly disastrous for many of my constituents on fixed incomes.

 I agree with the approach as set out by the rapporteur which reflects the current concerns of so many European citizens. The fact there has been coordinated European action on this issue draws attention to the fact that Europe can change people’s lives for the better even in the middle of crises such as the current financial situation. Practical measures have been understood by the rapporteur and this has assisted in making this proposal workable.

 I welcome Council’s remarks and the general approach to the financial services crisis and, indeed, I hope that we will be able to build on the recent G20 results. As you mentioned, we need to build on that movement to create global results for global regulations and particularly financial supervision. I have to say that financial supervision requires financial support as well. We have seen this. This is taxpayers’ money, of course. But supervision, to be appropriate, needs appropriate solvency, not just for banks but also for insurance companies. I wonder, therefore, if you will also support group supervision and group support as stated in Solvency II, something not mentioned in your list of financial regulations, but which was thought up outside a time of crisis and could help us in crisis. If this is the case, perhaps the presidency could explain why, on 2 December, it intends to delete group support from this proposal, and realise how unhelpful this can be.

 Mr President, perhaps if I were Mrs Lulling living in Luxembourg I might feel as strongly about not having indicative limits. Unfortunately, I live on an island where there is a lot of smuggling and much of the alcohol and tobacco which people think that they can use for their own particular purposes is in fact later sold on to other people through commercial resale. I am afraid that anything we do to end the indicative limits would send a signal and a message to those smugglers who look for the resale of alcohol and cigarettes. Indicative limits may not seem like a safe guide for consumers but they are a safe guide for children, children who often end up taking the alcohol and cigarettes sold by bootleggers and smugglers who bring them into my region in the South-East and sell them in the streets, on the back streets and on the estates, for small change, one or two cigarettes at a time perhaps, but enough to get kids started. It is this trade which needs to be controlled and can only be controlled by setting indicative limits so that we can get to the source of the people who are trying to do this and trying to smuggle it past our police and customs officers. That is why I believe that indicative limits should stay. It is not, as I say, an end to the integration of the single markets, but it certainly does bring about a better idea of social cohesion and social behaviour and, in the United Kingdom, the customs and excise officers and the police officers asked for this. They asked for it because it gives good guidance as to what people would be expected to bring back for their own personal use. Tobacco has a life of only six months, so when you stop vans packed to the ceiling with cigarettes, you have to ask the question: is that really for personal use or is it going elsewhere for resale, and often to children?

 Madam President, accounting standards are the key element of the language of financial services. For investors, the moves to converge the national standards of accounting to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are a great step forward. It means that companies will be able to publish accounts in one basic form, which should be accepted in the major economies around the world. Canada, China, Japan, the USA – and now, it seems, India as well – are in agreement in the wish to converge their standards towards IFRS. Although I welcome this, as the rapporteur for the transparency directive, I recognise that work to achieve actual convergence still has to be done. This is why I and my fellow rapporteur, Margarita Starkevičiūtė, have approved the amendments to monitor the progress of this convergence process. I trust that the Commission, in their discussions with various national authorities, can keep the momentum moving. With regard to the USA, I am keen that a new administration can be trusted and relied upon to make the substantial progress that it is needed. The Commission should keep pressure on this. On accounting standards themselves, it is vitally important to keep the underlying approach, as agreed within the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The integrity of these rules will be tested by attempts to dilute them for national reasons. This should be resisted strongly, and fair value accounting must be supported in the face of such pressure.

 Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for listening to us. Along with colleagues such as Glenys Kinnock, I have long looked forward to the day when resolutions on human rights in Burma and elsewhere do not have to be considered in this Parliament, but we continually have to return to this. I can only agree with colleagues around the House that, when we look at the attempts, time and again, to make changes in Burma, we see nothing but failure instead. We need to expose those countries that aid and bail out this corrupt regime with trade. We have announced the names of some of those countries and should do more at European level to make sure their exposure leads to real change. We need to see changes in Burma leading to freedom of assembly and association, the release of prisoners of conscience and a full transition to a multi-party democracy. We have seen off juntas in Europe. We need the world to see off the junta in Burma.

 – Mr President, the EPLP welcomes the content of this joint resolution and motion regarding the financial climate and the broader economy. As to what we might do next, it is true that Parliament has set out a series of demands – which have been a kind of a wish list, to some degree – and also concrete proposals about what needs to be done. At times we have gone further than the Commission. Indeed, at times – maybe for national reasons or for political interests – we have seen Parliament both water down text and propose good text. But those calls are quite relevant today and are germane to the condition that we are in. Supervisory structures need, more than ever, to be strengthened, but at the global level, not just at a European level. We have to look outside the European Union. For that, we also need to consider what is happening in terms of development aid around the world. We need to deepen our reserves in terms of dealing with development issues, not walk away from them, and it is hoped that, by doing this, we will reach the kinds of economic equilibrium that is needed around the world. It is our role to draw attention to these issues. It is also our role to do something more about this, and I will submit more on this issue in writing.

 The time for a centrally located single authority at European level may not have come yet. However, there are clear pressures which indicate that such thinking (while ahead of its time) is valid. I hope that during the current financial crises the EU does not shrink away from tackling any of the current shortfalls concerning supervision. The ‘college’ approach as pronounced in Solvency 2 is a key way forward and allows a kind of half-way-house.

 The EPLP believes that the upgrading of VAT requirements for financial services has been long overdue. The rapporteur has shown great diligence in his application to this task. We believe his approach has been very sympathetic to the issue of passing on costs to consumers and that he understands the problems that could be faced. We are uncertain how some points can be properly managed at a practical level – in particular, on the discretion for companies to be allowed to apply VAT. So we have reservations which could not be expressed in the particular amendments, because it was an ‘en bloc’ vote 1-28. The EPLP support the rapporteur but would have voted against Amendments 6 and 21. I would personally like to thank Joseph Muscat for his work on this report and others and for his collegiate attitude in the European Parliament. I hope his career goes from strength to strength and that we can welcome him back as a future prime minister of Malta very soon.

 Madam President, there is none so blind as those that cannot see. I notice Mr Hannan and Mr Sumberg have, unfortunately, left the Chamber at this time, but anyone who thinks that there is no financial turmoil should just pick up the newspapers and read, or watch the television. To believe that the Rasmussen report and the Lehne report did anything else other than try to adequately convey the necessity for us to be able to act and that this has to be done at a collective legislative level is to ignore the truth; it is also to ignore the reality of a global world economy. Frankly, sitting back in a little England may help some people relieve their consciences, but it does not help people meet their mortgage payments, it will not help people keep their homes, and it will not keep people in services and in industry. It is only through the European Union and through activity of regulation, where we are extremely good, that we will be able to do something about it. It is true that the markets expect us to be delicate, but they do not expect a knee-jerk reaction either. But the fact is that, if we do nothing and just stand still and say nothing, then, frankly, we will in fact be accused of cowardice in the face of strong tumult and crisis.

 Given the current and future problems affecting motor vehicle engines run on petroleum, it is clear that developments of alternatives are vital. The approval of specifics relating to this are a solid step forward. The relationship between aggregate consumption of oil through motor car use and that of increasing respiratory diseases, as well as concomitant rises in pollution, means that ‘next-generation’ vehicle design has to reflect this. Clearly, the aspect of hydrogen generation through the use of electricity raises wider considerations, including how to locate the energy for the generation of the original electricity. However, this report helps to move the debate and the industry behind the car of the future and in the right direction.

 I voted to exempt heritage railways from the scope of this directive. This continues to reflect my appreciation of the very special case which these companies represent. Had those companies had to comply with the terms of this directive it would have meant a crippling series of costs on largely volunteer/subscription organisations. Such railways as the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway and the Kent and East Sussex Light Railway (of which I am a life member) are part of the historic fabric of the tourist industry in the South East of England and across the EU. It is a shame that some in this House who purport to be ‘nationalistic’ in leaning could not support this exemption.

 I support wholeheartedly attempts that are being made by this report to label products that use additives containing Azo colours. I believe that if consumers are to be given a choice to end the use and consumption of such additives in their own families then a labelling process is a fair compromise.

 Madam President, I do not want to speak on this item but the previous item. I was trying to attract your attention. I abstained on the poultry carcass issue, primarily because I believe there is evidence to refute the claims that we need to keep the ban in place. I particularly think there is scientific evidence in place to allow this ban to be lifted. But, in any case, none of this discussion has come to the fore. What we have instead is a very expensive process in Europe for cleaning chicken carcasses. That is the real problem because any carcasses that come into the European Union would seem to be cheaper; as a result they sell more quickly and obviously suit the consumers. This is not about health claims, this is about protectionism. I think it is a very sad day for Europe that we have this particular debate in such a short and truncated way, rushed through as a resolution this week in Parliament. I abstained as a result of this and I believe our relationship with the US and with other countries is stained as a result.

 Mr President, this is a very serious issue. Iran is executing young men and women as a means of social control. It is incredible in an age of modern civilisation that young girls and boys are executed, stoned to death or hanged from industrial cranes. We ask and we call for the international community do more, but instead of actually standing together with the international community we hear cries against parts of the international community. We hear condemnation against the USA, for example; we hear differences in this House as to how we will handle it. We will never solve this crisis until we stand as one against this medieval crisis that is occurring in this country. It is something that we must do ourselves.
 Peter Skinner  (PSE

 Mr President, I would like to focus on three points. Firstly, I agree with the emphasis of the Commissioner: let us follow up on the transatlantic Economic Council and the work that we can do there. We need to show that we can take certain issues very seriously and can make the changes necessary to bring about the lifting of any unfortunate barriers, which are basic harbours for national protection. This includes poultry, and it is sad to hear a reflection in the House that we should not have that ban lifted. Secondly, we need to promote the positive agenda as well as challenge each other over the difficult issues such as climate change. Finance is a very positive story to tell, and I hope that insurance will be added to the list of progress that has been made so far in this area. Finally, the recent transatlantic dialogue in Ljubljana just got better. More was discussed and more was agreed, and like my colleagues I can agree we need to raise this now to the agreed level of the 1997 Houston Joint Declaration.

 This issue is of vital concern for many millions of Europe's citizens, particularly in the south-east of England. The most controversial issue has been the transportation of animals which is a function of this report. I welcome any impetus which can be given to improving animal welfare during the process of transportation. Of course, an element of this is that veterinary surgeons are properly resourced in carrying out checks and can be certain of an enhanced Veterinary Fund to rely on for this activity. Similarly, those farmers who deal with livestock transportation should benefit from insurance instruments which protect them for indirect losses.

 Europe's citizens have come together to enjoy the benefits of a European Union which can express itself not only in Europe but without. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the treatment of its citizens when travelling abroad. Visas are already not asked for by the USA for many EU countries. Whilst I understand the legitimate right of the USA to make up its own mind on the issue, I feel there is a rational argument in favour of extending this right to all of the EU's citizens. I feel that a properly negotiated agreement with the USA should reflect the non-discrimination approach required by the Parliament.

 As a co-author of this resolution, I am in support of the realistic intentions of the TEC process. It is necessary for the EU and the USA to undertake this search for barrier-reducing initiatives. In particular I welcome the steady progress that has been made on financial services, IFRS and the broker/dealer agreement. More has to be done and other avenues should be explored, including the multilateral approach. I am concerned, however, that both sides should not wait for remedies which may or may not close differences between us. This will take hard work instead, and this is no more apparent than in the area of insurance and, in particular, the collateral issue. The TEC is not a trade issue per se. It is about a deepening of our relationship at the regulatory level which improves the openness and efficiency of our industrial performances and which does away with the weak excuses of the past. We now face a mounting challenge in the world where the interest for the EU and the USA is in having systems which promote growth rather than protectionism and isolationism. TEC helps to bring the EU and USA closer together, but it will not do to rely on the outcomes of TEC by themselves. More needs to be done to fold this kind of approach into our day-to-day considerations at this level. Failure is all too easy to predict based on our political economies – hard work is needed to overcome this fear.
 Peter Skinner  (PSE

 Madam President, many have spoken about very serious issues. Of course it is quite important that we realise that there is always an ongoing dialogue between the United States and the European Union, but TEC really is about deliverables. It is about punching through the rhetoric and removing some of the scurrilous excuses on both sides of the Atlantic for those things that we need to do in order to be able to lift our economies and reward the people in those economies with growth, especially at the present time with the financial crisis around us. That is why I am so pleased to see that progress really has been made. I welcome the fact that many like Jonathan Evans and Commissioner Verheugen and colleagues around this Chamber worked very hard on this issue to try to move things along. International financial reporting standards have been mentioned, as have broker-dealer agreements. These are all good steps forward and very solid issues, but this cannot be a shopping list. TEC has seven priorities which should move forward and make sure that they cut through the rhetoric. Insurance is one of those and it is one which could be a deliverable – maybe not today but definitely tomorrow.

 Public oversight of bodies such as the IASCF/IASB is a controversial issue. Work towards convergence as agreed in the IFRS can bring increasing benefits for companies working on an international basis. Many millions of euros can be saved by avoiding double accounting. However, the nature of such agreements being implemented by way of an untransparent and removed process calls into question public scrutiny of this procedure. SMEs also need proper attention, and less is known as to their treatment than for large companies. Furthermore, the principle of fair value is one which does not need to be eroded by alternatives and interpretations beyond that which it is reasonable to accept.

Whilst healthy eating for many is essential for a prolonged and active life it is also essential that adequate information is provided to the consumer.

 The wine market in the EU depends upon the widest variety of choice and upon local production which is sustainable. For many, the issue of wine is as close to a cultural issue as language itself. This is why this vote today was such a contentious one. The impact of sugar labelling or of denying wineries from using sugar additives would have had a prohibitive effect on wine production in northern Europe. Many excellent wines now originate from the UK and particularly in the south-east of England. This has been the case since the Romans first brought wine to the UK. I voted to maintain this tradition and for an open market.

 There are many ways in which fiscal attitudes across the EU could be helpful in generating a series of better conclusions for the Lisbon Strategy. Simply put, the incentivisation of growth of small businesses and job creation, as well as environmental issues, is seen as a positive. This is for Member States to undertake and follow through – such is their competence. Consolidating tax bases at an EU level would not make the difference suggested by the rapporteur.

 I am convinced that there is a need for such an agreement but it has to be one which can be delivered on both sides. Airports in south-east England have had to open ‘aircraft slots’ for USA partner airlines and potentially many others. The reverse is not true in the USA. ‘Freedom rights’ are not granted to EU airlines for intra-USA flights. This means that flights emanating from Gatwick to New York cannot fly to Los Angeles, but USA flights to Gatwick can fly to anywhere they want in the EU. Similarly, there is no relaxation of the foreign ownership rules of USA airlines. There is a clear lack of balance in the first stage agreement; this lack of balance against the EU has to be addressed urgently in the second stage negotiations. I will be looking to reinforce this effort within the Transatlantic Legislators’ Dialogue.

 I voted against this report because, whilst it makes real sense to review the impact of this measure, it is important not to repeal it. The passengers that travel through European airports like Gatwick in my region are often confused and upset with the application of this rule. In particular the way in which passengers are expected to turn over their ‘duty-free’ liquids purchased at an airport to the authorities checking hand luggage. The problem seems to be with passengers in transit who buy in the ‘transit’ airport and then attempt to check through security for their further flight. I opposed a full repeal because there are still legitimate security concerns which must be our first priority. There are also alternatives to a simple repeal which might produce better convenience for passengers and maintain security.

 Mr President, the process of sub-prime lending has definitely been a huge problem causing the financial turbulence which we have witnessed this summer. That was clear, but what is less clear is the identification of investors and counterparties which may be, and continue to be, under stress, and that identity is absolutely vital for us to clear up. This is due by and large, as we have heard today, to the sophistication of financial instruments which are viewed by some as akin to alchemy. However, we need to take a careful and cautious look at what to do about these and the effects that have been caused by that turbulence. Over-reaction may be equally as damaging as what has already occurred, as we find the price of credit rising as a result. This is not good for the Lisbon Process, we should be reminded. So what has actually happened in the USA to close the door on some of these issues? It might be said that the barn door has just been closed when the horse is in the field, and that would be true to say. However, largely speaking, the sub-prime mortgage lending area was unregulated. That is a fact now which has been addressed very directly as industrial regulatory and legislative initiatives, I am told, are under way. At the same time, a high level working group has been set up under the auspices of the White House to look at credit rating agencies and sophisticated financial vehicles. What we can draw from that is that it is vital to work closely with the United States and other global markets as we share the same conclusions about the transparency in these markets. If we do not, because the global markets are intertwined so closely, we will stand to lose so much of the benefit that could be added by the conclusions which we would have to share. What has happened within the EU and what has happened within the US? I share some confidence now in the Commission, and of course with the ECB as well as with the Federal Reserve in the United States, in what they have done. They have helped to settle down the markets, which was exactly what we needed to do. I can agree, however, with some of the speakers here today on calling for proportionate responses and I can maintain that in the sense of the confidence that I have. I believe that the securitisation and special purpose vehicles, which will be under scrutiny along with the credit rating agencies, do need to be opened up to greater scrutiny and transparency, that is clear, as Ms Berès has already said. But let us be clear that the sophistication of financial instruments is difficult for many of us to understand, and the role of credit rating agencies is open. (The President cut off the speaker)

 I can support the general approach born out of compromises brought about by PES colleagues and others in the House. In particular, I am concerned that there are guarantees about universal service provision and its financing. In measuring the way that this will have impact in our communities it is vital that two things are addressed directly. Firstly, that working conditions are maintained and, secondly, that rural and peripheral areas are successfully provided for as they are now.

 – Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur and colleagues on the committee who have worked so assiduously on this case, as well as the petitioners who are present here. I am the appointed rapporteur for the House on Solvency II. Some of these points, particularly on home/host supervision, will not be lost in this debate. In fact, as I am sure most people know, this is one of the things we are taking forward. There are also considerable changes to the laws and to the apparatus of financial supervision which have occurred during the time of the Equitable Life crisis. Indeed, the company still exists today. It was not a failure as was first suggested in the report, but only a crisis – a crisis enough, which actually affected a million people. But, as everyone knows, there is still a process to continue, which of course means that British, Irish and German claimants will be able to look to the Ombudsman’s report – as somebody has already said – later this year. I hope the issue of compensation and other issues will be settled there, where they should be. Unfortunately, there were some errors in this report and it is not to my great pleasure to have to point them out. Firstly, there was no compliance – or little compliance – by the British Government as regards the issues surrounding whether or not it should appear before the committee. Ministers attended the meetings they said they could, not, as the report suggested, maybe by avoiding them. I was there. I met the British Ministers at the same time as everybody else. They even supplied correspondence which was missing from other governments, which frankly, in my opinion, should have been taken into account. Thirdly, I totally disagree that the implementation of this particular directive was a failure, if you look at the process. If it was a failure, then perhaps Sir Robert Atkins can explain how that failure actually occurred, which was when he was in government. I am afraid that this report is weak where it should be strong and could deliver, and strong where it is unable to deliver. For example in the area of supervision, where it could do something and where it will do something. I, as the rapporteur in Solvency II, promise that we will be doing something on the coordination of home/host supervision across Member States, so that victims will never be bandied about pillar to post by regulators. I look to the Commissioner to help me on that issue.

The EPLP supported the setting up of this committee because it believed Parliament could use it as an opportunity to provide clarification and learn lessons from the Equitable Life crisis and give a voice to the victims. Several of the facts of the crisis and its aftermath were not included in the report, so the final result is not balanced. The report has also been used by the opposition parties to attack the Labour government, while misleading the policyholders by falsely raising their expectations. This vote is on a recommendation to adopt the findings of the report and not the report itself, following the committee vote there were no further opportunities to amend or improve the text. Therefore the EPLP abstains on this vote.

These amendments moved away from the principle and practice of reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP). I abstained where there was no clear implication for UK interests, but where there were clear concerns for continental Member States – 'hot pursuit' being that particular vote. I also voted against eight amendments, which, when taken in combination, actually increased funds to fruit and vegetable sectors, which is against the UK Labour Party's view that support spending should be reduced and contradicts CAP reform.

 I, along with my EPLP colleagues, voted to abstain on critical issues of this report, which, even as an own-initiative endeavour, is inappropriate on certain levels. Paragraph 5 is an ambiguous reference to the Member States that have not put the text to ratification yet. There are also issues where inappropriate demands are made on a list of issues or concern idle threats to reject Council negotiations. Alongside this is a request to hold simultaneous ratification, which could present serious problems in many Member States. However, there were other serious issues which could be supported and where I could support them, I did.

 I voted in favour of this measure as so many European citizens are affected by higher than necessary roaming charges. The reduction of costs for so many people and businesses is a very useful contribution to peoples' private pockets, as well as business costs.

It was successfully carried in the face of opposition from the Liberal Democrats, who wanted to include these small craft, leading to disproportionate costs, reducing economic viability and a loss of service. I particularly condemn the outrageous press releases prior to these votes suggested by certain political parties, which raised false worries and concerns. Of course operators such as Isle of Wight ferries may have been forced to consider their economic liability because of such opportunist press releases. It is therefore welcome that, as I said before, no such measures will be introduced.

In particular, financial services is a very positive issue whereby administrations and politicians on both sides of the Atlantic have seen real progress. If the aims of the OECD Working Paper of 29 May 2005 – which was adopted by both sides – can be put into practice, there would be great benefits. The barriers it mentions, if removed, would lead to growth of over 3% GNI each year, year-on-year. The transatlantic marketplace needs hard work from both sides. Failure to do so, however, means leaving our industries behind and our peoples at economic risk in the global environment.

 Whilst one may agree with the approach of making third-party responsibility a standard approach, there are apparent inconsistencies which need to be addressed before one can proceed. Chief among these is the fact that the LLMC Convention has not been ratified by Member States, which is why there is an urgent need for the EU to act. The Council needs to affirm its commitment to the Convention at Member-State-level by ratification before it can offer a proper criticism of EU competence in this area which it questions.

 The unanimity of agreement between the committee members who actively considered this report underlines the concerns for shareholders. Institutional shareholdings by fund managers who sought to repatriate rights to owners of those shares was critical to the success and balance of this report. Similarly the level of communications and appropriate timing has renewed the connection between share owners and boards of directors, allowing questions to be put without the 'nuisance effect' which could jeopardise effective management of shareholder meetings.
 Peter Skinner (PSE

 Madam President, my congratulations to the rapporteur for his report. There are many essential elements concerning this report which we can all get behind, particularly in protecting the rights of shareholders and making the process transparent. It is nice to hear the transparency directive mentioned — which I worked on before. However, from a legal point of view its treatment is slightly different from the approach of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, where strong opinion found in favour of certain key issues, in particular necessary distinctions required in dealing with intermediaries and stock lending when, in particular, shares were repatriated in order to allow for owners to vote. The timing is vital and we are surprised, therefore, that Amendment 26 to Article 7 does nothing but confuse the situation. What happens to these shares – are they to be deposited? Transferred? Registered? What? There seems to be nothing there which allows for specific requirements. There are no specific requirements or references to them concerning the sale of transferred shares. Might this not lead to certain further confusion? There are also amendments from the ECON Committee which I have to say have been subject to what I deem the ‘recital effect’ by the Committee on Legal Affairs and to the ‘letter effect’ by Commissioner McCreevy, who suggested that later developments on these issues should be expected. Let us be frank. Nobody likes to be told that their amendments are reducible or that they can be ignored. The ECON Committee is an equal player and its remit allows it to be so. I can only say that the process has been unsatisfactory in that regard, which is partly the reason for this debate today. I hope we can come back to these issues in the ECON Committee with the Commissioner to repair some of these problems mentioned in our ECON opinion.

 This report, whilst it had many good points, could have potentially affected UK wine production in the south-east in a disastrous manner. The ‘fructose’ practice, whereby sugar is added to UK and other northern European wines, would have been banned if amendments urging this would have been passed and accepted by the House and the Commission. This is a blatant attack from inside the wine-producing industry and should be forever rejected for future reports in this area.

 On behalf of the EPLP we support the broad principles and thrust of this report given that it deals with a very urgent problem facing the European Union. The problem is oil price shocks caused by major disruptions to oil supply, whilst at the same time demand grows across the world for this increasingly scarce resource. However, we would disagree that there is a need for tax harmonisation on this issue. Whilst many of the recommendations from the rapporteur are completely acceptable and while the UK may practise the essential elements of the tax regime proposed already, we do not believe it is the role of the EU to set a rate of taxes in Member States.

.  I voted for this report because of the increasing use of rail passenger transport across the EU. Furthermore, whilst establishing a clearly more sustainable transport structure, largely helped by the TENs process, railway operators need to be cojoined by simple rules and obligations. In particular, the rights of passengers often go ‘missing’ in the debate for more convenient transport operations. Moreover, the problem of monopolistic control over certain rail routes such as the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (CTRL) leaves passengers at the disposal of just one company. In the light of this increasing the rights of international rail passenger users, I am concerned that the current approach of certain companies/operators still needs greater efforts by regulatory bodies to ensure a consistent and fair approach.

 In voting for this report I voted to put consumers at the centre of energy policy alongside an effective approach to dealing with harmful emissions such as CO2. The effectiveness of a sensible Carbon Tax Trading Scheme depends upon internationalising the market. Furthermore, strong targets for 2020-2050 for reduction of CO2 emissions as pronounced in this report are the only reasonable way ahead. However, tidying up the ETS in both methodology and targets is something the EU must crucially put into action to remain a world leader in both working for a cleaner environment as well as sustaining a pan-European energy policy. There is a danger that unless action is taken now then both our environment and our energy security will be under threat.

In particular the use of animal testing, which is of great concern to many of my constituents, has been changed to incorporate validation of alternatives. Also, a three-year review allows for the European Commission to consider whether legislative proposals covering this area could be useful to reduce further any need for such testing. Similarly, the improved text which I voted for today reflects more accurately the views of thousands of individuals and interest groups in dealing with the cumulative effects of toxic chemicals found in hundreds of household products.

I voted to keep tobacco off TV screens and to limit alcohol advertising. However, although tobacco was prohibited, alcohol failed to get sufficient votes. Given the distress caused by alcohol in many families' lives across the EU, as well as related ill-health issues, I find this result unsatisfactory. In particular we must keep youngsters from being exposed to enticements to drink.

 Because the south-east of England has suffered so much from drought orders which have affected water usage by consumers, this directive is extremely important. Some 70% of south eastern England's water comes from groundwater resources. Protection of this resource, therefore, is essential to allow for both the capacity of such resources to recover as well as for nitrates and other chemicals to be excluded as far as possible from reaching the UK's drinking water. Parliament has stuck steadfastly to its view that Member State governments must do far more to prevent this type of pollution, such as arsenic, biocides and cyanide. Parliament's approach to 'toughen up' the legislation in this field is very much welcomed.

 Although I could agree with the broad thrust of this report, particularly in the area of transparency and scrutiny, there is one issue I believe needs a sensitive touch – hedge funds. It is appropriate for all central monetary authorities to maintain a vigilant approach to hedge funds. However, the call for research to promote regulation is premature. The need to regulate could be disproportionate to any potential threat such funds are perceived to have.

 Mr President, I welcome the Commissioner and thank him for his words about the report. I believe it is the close working relationship that has developed between Parliament, its various groups and the Commission that has helped to steady the rudder on this one. Quite clearly we are entering a very dangerous time: we have two years in which to get this right, to measure the value of equivalence and reach convergence with countries around the world. So the Commissioner is absolutely right to point this out not only to the USA but also to other third countries. However, the USA is certainly the big project that we all know about. That is going to be the tough one, and we are quite clearly afraid that the billions of dollars and euros between our two capital markets at the transatlantic level will be put in jeopardy if we do not get this right. I am very positive that we are on the right route and I believe that what Parliament has put forward has helped to strengthen the methodology, also scrutinising the approach which will be involved in this particular battle. Looking at the bulk of this directive and the amendments from the supervisors and others in this House – and I am very grateful to colleagues who have assisted on this issue – I believe that we have not overburdened the business community. That is and has always been vital. You cannot use the term ‘light touch’ all the time and then overburden business. This is an important cross-border capital market issue and we need greater coherence and communication between the various operators within that market. We also need to ensure that investors are protected and that the right information is communicated to them in a relevant and timely manner. These are issues which, of course, are now left to the Member State. I think the Commissioner might agree with me that we should be using the most modern methods to communicate to investors. I do not have much time, so I shall not pursue all the issues of this particular directive. However, I should like to turn to one recital in the original directive and bend the Commissioner’s ear. That recital concerns the voluntary initiatives to help companies report what they pay governments around the world in the extractive industries. As the Commissioner might remember – and I am sure his departments will – this was an initiative which was to help end corrupt practices. It was aimed not only at places as far-flung as Africa, but also within our own borders. Companies were meant to volunteer information about what they pay governments so that we in turn would know, and investors would know, just what money changed hands between governments and companies. It was aimed at the extractive industries because it was clear that this was an area in which an awful lot of money was going abroad, away from the countries where it should have been used. My final question to the Commissioner is to ask what he and his services might do to support that initiative. I think this House would enjoy hearing again what your predecessor gave as a promise some years ago.

Whilst the EPLP believes that this is an extremely important opinion that raises many relevant points in trying to develop a Europe-wide solution linking to pollution to consumption, the EPLP believes that taxation is a matter of national competence and therefore cannot support aims at harmonising taxation at an EU level to reach these aims without full unanimity. Therefore, the EPLP has abstained from the final vote.

I agree with the general thrust of this report, but believe that there are still considerable problems with the result of today’s vote: firstly, that the impact of the suggestions is largely uncosted and has a disproportionate impact; secondly, that the Emissions Trading Scheme should include air transport but that there should not be a separate scheme which runs by its side. This would undermine the current ETS. Some of this report contradicted the very workable proposals of the Commission and as such made little sense.

I know from my own personal experience with family members that this vote today can alter the lives of hundreds of thousands of people across the EU. There is, on an alternative issue, a growing need to link some businesses with the research programmes. Too little effort is still being made to accommodate such businesses – more must be done.

Whilst we support the intention of Amendment 3 to alleviate the costs of healthcare and drugs for many of the poorest countries, this amendment is inappropriate as it provides for a blanket limit to all patent protections for products related to this field, which could distort markets at a global level and, potentially, harm further development. These issues are best dealt with at the level of the UN and WHO. The EPLP maintains its position on the issue of corporate taxation, which is not to support a recalculation of the corporate tax base. Whilst we seek greater coordination of tax authorities in trying to assist SMEs involved in cross-border trade, we acknowledge that this issue remains the competence of the EU Member States.

This is in line with many other international bodies such as the UN. There are many key issues, such as development issues, which rely upon many voices at the table to get a point of view across. Reducing the EU's voice to one may, in certain circumstances, have an explicit effect on the weight of international opinion.

The EPLP opinion is that this harmonisation of tax base could possibly lead to higher rates, with harmonisation at a later stage which is not desired. The EPLP supports enhanced cooperation if Member States wish to pursue this consolidated tax base approach, as long as the proper procedures are followed and precedence is not set for future tax cooperation.

This is, of course, a violation of the equal treatment of EU citizens, enshrined in the Treaty. It is discrimination which I call most strongly on the Commission and the President to oppose by making representations to the Spanish Government before the extradition deadline. A case must be allowed to be developed that can go to the Court of Human Rights, but this is also being denied as matters are being pushed through quickly. He is a desperate man facing a desperate plight and he needs all our support. I urge you to help in this case.

The E.P.L.P believes that although a single market for products purchased by individuals is essential, other issues affect decisions over excise duty charges. Moreover, this report on distance purchasing ignores the related concept of e-commerce. Secondly, Member States should be allowed to set excise duty rates themselves.

 Mr President, I am pleased to be able to report to you on this directive. It has been a great honour to be involved in this. We need to thank many of the people working inside and outside this institution: people such as John-Paul Dryden, who fell ill during the report drafting stage and therefore could not help us to finish it. However, Manica Hauptman, who took it over, has devoted a great deal of time and attention to addressing the very deep concerns and the details. The Commission and its staff also played a vital role. I am sure Mr McCreevy is be aware how good his staff can be. Without the help of MEPs and their staff, and I note with appreciation the support from my colleagues across the floor, we could not have reached a fast-track agreement at first reading. We went to fight an election, came back after a time and found this still on our plates and it is quite remarkable that we have managed to deal with it so quickly. The concerns expressed by the House have been eliminated largely because of the agreement and the good work that has gone into it. The first question is, what is reinsurance? It is about business-to-business, risk and the spread of that risk by the insurance industry. It covers such things as aircraft, ships and buildings. 9/11 and its effects on the World Trade Center were insured by large reinsurance companies such as Lloyds and others for the kinds of catastrophes that we had hoped would not occur. They panicked, but managed to pay their debts. This is a business-to-business directive as well. It involves competition. The central political issue was whether competition was fair at European level and beyond. It was therefore a question of collateral. Since the value of the reassured risk was collected in banks in the country where the risk was to be covered, it just collected money that did nothing: dead cash, if you like. It was neither effective nor economic. It was an old blunt instrument. It had to be got rid of, because it increased administrative costs and it raised the issue of whether or not the risk was properly covered. That question then led us to another: the timing of this directive. We worked on a formula that allowed us to consider avoiding the Solvency II discussions, which would come later. The formula would be a form of compromise, with 24 months’ transposition and 12 months’ transition, which I welcomed, through the Luxembourg presidency’s efforts, and agreed to very easily. Parliament was able to vote on this in committee. Other issues included SPVs, the insolvency issue and captives. Without going into detail on those, I can say that we now have a level playing field at European level. The reinsurance market now has no barriers to trade and it will have a strong supervisory framework across Member States when this directive goes through. Thus it will help EU reinsurance undertakings to maintain their competitive edge around the world. It is a global market and European companies are at the very forefront. In fact, Europe is the second largest market in itself, after the US. Europe needs to play a role in the rest of the world. The adoption of this text is going to strengthen the hand of the European Union in arguing for an end to the unfair, anti-competitive scam in the United States of requiring non-US companies to pay collateral within the United States, where they are regulated state by state. Do not tell me that the US is a competitive economy: in terms of reinsurance, it is not. So the US now has to reconsider and I know it is doing so. This directive enables us to speak with one voice. Supervisors and regulators can impose higher standards of supervision on third country companies from outside the EU if they wish, rather like the Americans. There is a possibility of conflict in the world’s rule-making bodies on anti-competitive measures, which we know the US would strongly resist. But there is room for compromise, efficiency and a voluntary initiative. Let us look at some of the figures. Collateral is required by non-US companies in the United States. It is counted in billions: it is reckoned that USD 40 billion is collected in the US against European companies. There are far more, at a cost of USD 500 million every year. This does not promote efficiency and it does not provide security against risk. The first blow has been struck with an EU market. With the Commission’s support, the fight will go on. We should congratulate ourselves on this European law, which has brought about significant change both inside and outside Europe.

 Mr President, I wonder whether the Commissioner is aware that there is a possible draft model law for states in the United States, which has been drafted for the legislators. What I would be very willing to do, if you have not seen it, is to pass it on to you. I think at the moment they surely are at their weakest position. It is something that comes from the strength of this report and it is worth pressing this point with the Commissioner, to make sure that we have full agreement across the floor so that a Commissioner and Parliament will be pressing most strongly to push the Americans further into the corner and see whether or not we can get the agreement from them that we really deserve.

 Mr President, my group in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety endorses the approach of our draftsman Mr Sturdy, not least in his encomia for the general rapporteur Mr Parish, and for the Commissioner and his emphasis throughout on studied vigilance rather than either hysteria or complacency. We salute him for that. The six questions that the Commissioner sent to the Community health ministers seem to me to be the right ones, but the question remains as to whether he gets the right answers from them in terms of the way we can mobilise our stocks of anti-virals prior to the development of a vaccine. I would just say in passing to Dr Matsakis, whom I greatly esteem, that I do not share his relative happiness with the outcome of the events of 1918. In 1918, death was the firewall that put an end to it; the virus ran out of victims. We cannot be in a situation where we allow that to happen again, and I therefore salute the measures the Commissioner has taken. I have just got time for one question: if low pathogen avian flu is also infectious and can mutate, how can we be certain that the import of infected wildfowl and domestic poultry is really under control? In my own country we have had examples of both the former and now today the latter. Large stocks of illegally imported Chinese chicken meat have been uncovered in the UK over the past few days. We know that epidemics run through channels of illegality and deceit – epidemics, not pandemics. Epidemics start that way, so it was with foot and mouth disease. We do not want to see it again and so I hope the Commissioner will be able to say in his summing-up exactly what the measures of preventive scrutiny will be.

. – Mr President, I agree that Commissioner Kyprianou commendably treads the narrow line between effective prevention and pressing the panic button. Our populations need to know that influenza always has been a global disease, and nowadays, of course, there are additional means by which it can be spread. They need to know that the HN51 virus has been present in some states now for several years. We need to know that the pace of spread has not actually accelerated in the way that the wilder speculation about pandemics would lead us to believe. Could the Commissioner tell us, firstly, what we now know about the incubation period in the bird population, and whether there is any sign that the virus has spread to other species? It is not yet obviously affecting humankind. What will the lead time for an effective monovalent vaccine stockpile be? The industry has communicated to us that it may take four years to produce an effective stockpile of everything we need to deal with the virus if it mutates in the way that is predicted. In his statement of 12 October 2005, the Commissioner did not mention the importation and trafficking of wild birds. We have seen in the recent case in the United Kingdom that the enormous number of birds now imported into the European Union – some legally, some illegally – is a potent source of further infection. We have seen that. What can we do throughout all the Member States to have an effective control on these imports and, indeed, their ban?

 Mr President, Mr Böge has made imaginative use of the temporary committee formula and, for the second time, I congratulate him. I have time to make one simple point. We share the rapporteur’s dilemma that we cannot provide the resources that will improve the conditions and the lifestyle of our citizen body. That will mean that in some areas for which my committee is responsible, we have a diminution of consumer protection and other issues, where we are effectively giving less and asking more. Mr Barroso talked about a cut-price Europe and the implications of that destination if we get to it. I hope that this is not going to be death by a thousand cuts. I believe that we have to keep faith with our citizens and not add to the alienation which many of them feel and which they have expressed in recent weeks.

 Mr President, I happen to be the chairman of the committee on which the rapporteur and Mr Muscat sit. I wish to begin by endorsing what Mr Muscat said. In our committee it is always very difficult to get interpretation into the mother tongue from even large countries – Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic; countries that are now at the heart of our European Union. However, if we cannot speak in mother tongue languages in this Chamber, where it is known that we have an interest in the debate taking place, what kind of European Union do we have? I just want to endorse in the strongest terms what has been said here today by Mr Muscat. I hope I will get injury time on Mr Muscat’s behalf for saying that, because I now want to make some warm remarks about the rapporteur, Mr Nassauer. I want to thank him for the work he has done at a time when he was enormously engaged in the REACH proposals, which are now before our committee. He has taken a subject of real public relevance: the security of the citizen and how best we ensure it. He has found an effective compromise and I hope our own amendments in the IMCO Committee, of which he is also a distinguished member, will support that. He has been able to tread the perilous path between alarmism on the one hand and complacency on the other. My main concern with the amendments we tabled was to ensure that ordinary consumers would not be disproportionately inconvenienced in carrying out financial transactions, whilst we know that we need to combat money laundering. This, of course, is not the first money laundering definition. I do not know whether Thomas Jefferson would approve, but the times in which we live need a balance to be struck between liberty and security. However, we do not want to exchange one category of vulnerability for another. The vulnerable citizen can be made vulnerable by excessive security measures, as well as by the processes of terrorists themselves. Just at the time that our committee was describing these matters, a terrorist bank raid took place in Northern Ireland – the largest bank raid in the history of that province. That shows the importance today of stopping up the areas where terrorists operate and finance themselves. The various draftsmen of opinions from the different committees have all provided the expertise which was properly supportive of what Mr Nassauer has done. This is a compromise to which the banks, the lawyers, the accountants, the notaries and the ordinary citizen can look with confidence. I hope this dossier will, therefore, be concluded at first reading. Terrorists cannot succeed unless they have the financial means with which to do so. We, however, need to measure our response to this unprecedented terrorism with the needs of the citizens’ own defences for the sake of civil liberties.

 Madam President, I too congratulate the rapporteur after her travails and the dedication she has shown to this task, from which she has emerged with more success than her predecessor in the last Parliament. She said that we ought to talk to the consumer groups in Europe and see what they think. Well, many of us have done so. I have a letter here, on behalf of 28 consumer groups in all of the Member States, and what do they say? They ask us to vote for Article 4 and for a sensible version of Article 11. I heard what Mrs Niebler said earlier on in the debate and I was astonished by it. What in God’s name has all this to do with the Lisbon Process? I do not know about God – he has been around for a long time so he obviously has a healthy diet – but I know what I think and that is that the Lisbon Process, among other things, requires us to have well– 
informed consumers who make real choices which increase the marketability of the products they buy. Everybody benefits from that, it is a benign circle, and to have it denounced as though it is simply an instrument of the nanny state and so on, as we have heard in the course of this debate, is absolute rubbish. I personally hope that we vote to retain Article 4. We need to have some way of dealing with the misleading claims which are made, which balance one substance against another, and only tell you about the one for which the claim could be made. The only way to do that is to have some effective template from which this can be made. The Commission has worked long and hard on this. I have many representatives of the food industry in my own constituency who have said that provided we just have that template within the Poli Bortone report, we do not then need it in Mrs Scheele’s proposals, we do not need it for fortification, but we should have it somewhere. And so we should. I cannot vote for this proposal tomorrow if the emasculation of Article 4 takes place.

 Mr President, we are all grateful to Mr Zappalà who has been our very own service provider on this important measure. It has made more progress in the last three months than in the previous three years. That is, I believe, a happy augury. The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection is now seeing the fourth successful conclusion, at second reading, of an important piece of consumer protection. I hope our fellow Members will recognise that. The free movement of professionals is an important step in achieving the Lisbon Agenda. It opens up opportunities in other Member States for dentists, doctors, construction workers and gas engineers that were often closed as a result of an effective ‘closed shop’ among the professions. I am very grateful that our three German colleagues directly address the reservations in their own Member State on this issue. This is in unmistakable terms in the light of the progress we should make. This is an advance to balance free movement and competition, and ensure health and safety and consumer protection at one and the same time. I commend it, and I hope the Commissioner will give it speedy effect.

 Mr President, I wish to congratulate Mrs Handzlik on drawing up the first report by a new Member from a new Member State in a new committee. As the chairman of that committee, I think her report has been a commendable initiative. It is right to emphasise today what the new Member States have achieved instead of to carp at the difficulties and challenges they might pose. In the old Member States we see anxieties and sometimes a state of denial about what the expansion will mean to us. That is playing out now in some of the debates about the Constitution. It is playing out in some of the rhetoric about the fear of what immigration from the new Member States may do. My own view is that it is a task for this Parliament to welcome the expansion of the European Union in the fullest terms. Recently, I have had the opportunity not only to go with the delegation to Poland, but also to go to Hungary in a business delegation with representatives of my own region. We have heard today in the voices of Mrs Handzlik, Mrs Pleštinská and all our friends precisely what their ambitions are and why they should be supported. The internal market needs to free up services in a manner consistent with empowering consumers as well as entrepreneurs and in a manner that combines social and economic goals. They cannot be separated out. I must say to our friends in the new Member States that to believe that raw capitalism will give you all you need and will be your servant is an error. All these elements need to be in balance. I would say to those who came to my country, the United Kingdom, from the new Member States: you are welcome. I am proud to say in the middle of the British general election campaign that we are right to have given free entry into our market to people from the new Member States. We will prosper, our capital accumulation will prosper, our culture will prosper, our cuisine will prosper! We welcome you, and I am delighted to be able to say that. I hope Mr Harbour will go back and tell the Conservative Party in Britain that it should take that same welcoming view. (Applause)
 Whitehead (PSE

 –
 Mr President, I am happy to follow Mr Harbour in that same spirit which characterised the committee. The tone was set from the outset by the rapporteur, and her energies and skills as a new Member of this Parliament were quite exceptional, particularly since in the last few weeks she has been crossing the Alps more often than Hannibal, with other activities in her own country also. I want to pay tribute to all those who brought this about under the Treaty provisions for consumer protection, which had not been used very frequently up to now. Everyone has to agree to a conclusion like this and any one person can wreck it. All of those who have spoken in the debate today have been contributors, both by withholding the negative power to destroy and joining the other institutions; the Luxembourg presidency and the Commission, and indeed the staff of our own committee, the Internal Market Committee, a new committee, to whom I would pay particular tribute, so that we brought about the right result here. It extends the internal market; we should not forget that, because it produces more assured consumers. And it produces them because they are protected; because the special character of vulnerable consumers is acknowledged in this legislation; because there is a clear guarantee that high existing standards of consumer protection will not be imperilled and that over the next five years we move to higher standards for those that do not yet have them, and not lower standards for those who do; because the blacklist in the annexes here is clear, comprehensive and unambiguous. The consumer knows where she or he stands. So does the honest and legitimate businessman; and so does the cold-caller with the lottery scam; the rip-off timeshare artist; the peddler of mock sales. If you sail under false colours this directive will sink you. I can think of nothing better guaranteed to enhance the image of this institution as a people's parliament for the public good than legislation like this. It opens the way for further developments, including, in time, more sophisticated use of self-regulation by a stable industry, and for the position of children, the one social category who are, by definition, vulnerable. To those of our colleagues who felt that, in these fields, we did not go far enough, I would say that we have a foundation of security which harmonisation at the highest level can now proceed. We have helped our citizens, Mr President. We have provided an object lesson for our colleagues. It is not a bad start for this new committee and for this new Parliament and Commission. I thank you all.
 Whitehead (PSE

 Mr President, this is indeed a first for most of us here. It is a first for the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, a first for the Commissioner, and perhaps also a first for a new style of politics in this Chamber, where we are now, in a way, engaging in anticipatory politics and attempting to reach agreements ahead of, or at the point of, second reading, rather than looking forward to the trench warfare that traditionally followed in the codecision procedure. If we can make progress tomorrow on that basis, it would be a very happy augury for the way – as Mr Harbour puts it – that we do business with you, Commissioner, and with each other. I do not need to repeat Mr Harbour's encomia – I merely endorse them. But I would just say to the rapporteur that we should salute him for returning from Asia and seeing and experiencing the tsunami at first hand. It is not every day, or every year, that one would want to do that. On the other hand, we want to be here, every day, doing this. I entirely agree with what has been said by other speakers. Again, I do not need to repeat that this ideally combines both the processes of the internal market and the way in which we all provide employment and interest for each other in the age of the motor car, but it also brings a measure of consumer protection in all aspects of this fifth directive. I would like to point to three things here and say to Commissioner McCreevy that, in a way, this process resembles the training of spies. There was a procedure called 'following from in front', and, in a way, we are following him from in front. We are trying to anticipate now what he will be saying to us over the rest of the week. We hear very clearly what he says about trailers. Many Member States have different definitions, but we all know that if a declaration is forthcoming, we will be able to reach some kind of agreement, over time, on a common concept of 'trailer' among the Member States. It is rather like that nice American film 'The Straight Story', where it was established that if a lawn mower travelled on roads it became a road-using vehicle, even if it was not before. Road-using vehicles have to be covered. They have to be insured. We have to make quite a gentle start on the issue of insurance. We must not pile draconian penalties on 25 Member States which, at the moment, have very different systems of insurance and, indeed, very different income levels. So we hear what you say there. My last point is on the issue of the third pillar. Here too, in terms of the alternative wording which I know you are going to put to us tomorrow, we have secured realistic options. I am confident we can find a compromise which achieves what all of us want, and can avoid what some of us fear by way of third pillar considerations. If my Member State can be relaxed about that, then anybody can.

 Mr President, I want briefly to raise two issues regarding freedom of expression. The first is the re-arrest of Mordechai Vanunu in Israel. He completed an 18-year sentence – much of which was in solitary confinement – was released and has now been re-arrested on the grounds that he associates with foreigners. As he is seeking sanctuary in the cathedral in Jerusalem it is hard for him to do otherwise. The second issue I should like to raise concerns the series of raids that have been carried out by FBI agents against 21 independent media outlets, most of them in the European Union. Most have been closed down. No clear explanation has been given for either of these actions. I would remind the House to consider that in troubled times we should be more and not less concerned with liberty and issues of freedom of expression. I hope that the authorities here can seek some explanation for these actions.
 Robert Evans  (PSE
).  
– Mr President, after 15 years this will be my last speech in the European Parliament and I think there are few more important issues than the whole question of asylum and how European countries face this challenge. There is no easy response to this issue either. If there was, some country would have found it by now. In reality, I would suggest that the only way to reduce the number of desperate people who seek refuge or asylum in a country other than their own is to address the root causes that force them to leave their homes and countries of origin. That is why it is so important that we in the EU, and in all developed democratic countries, offer advice, help and support – including financial support – to those countries that are affected by war, internal violence, lack of human rights or discrimination. Equally, we have to address the poverty around the world which contributes to migratory pressures. We should never condemn people who are forced to seek asylum or refugee status. Instead, we should offer sympathy and offer our support. That is our challenge today.
 Robert Evans  (PSE
). - 
 Madam President, my congratulations to the rapporteur and to other colleagues. But this report has to be more than just words in a document. It has to be a report for action. Paragraph 1 says: ‘Considers that the EU needs to move towards a coherent and consistent policy of upholding and promoting human rights around the world’ and to do so ‘more effectively’. I want to address my remarks to the situation in Sri Lanka, and several points in this report are applicable there. Paragraph 63 refers to the recruitment of child soldiers, which I, and I am sure other colleagues, deplore. I think it is paragraph 48 that refers to the death penalty. Since the beginning of the year, some 5 000 civilians have been killed by attacks by the Sri Lankan Government on their own territory: tantamount, I would suggest, to the death penalty and the death of innocent citizens. The Sri Lankan Government and their military stand accused of a string of human rights abuses of their own people, from bombing of hospitals, the use of illegal weapons to denying humanitarian and medical… (The President cut off the speaker.)

 Mr President, I want to congratulate both our rapporteurs. A couple of years ago I was the rapporteur for access for disabled passengers to aeroplanes. This legislation is another piece in the jigsaw to make transport as inclusive as possible or, as our colleague Mr Albertini put it, to consolidate passenger rights. In an age when we are encouraging people to travel by public transport, it is so important that we add coaches and buses, as Mr Albertini has, to this field. Some Members, not necessarily those here today, have looked for ways to make exemptions to exclude certain sections, but I have always taken as my starting point the desire to include as much as possible in this so we move towards making Europe more of a common market for people. That is why Amendment 81 is so important. The Commissioner in his remarks said we need the same rights for all passengers with no exceptions – and then he spoke about the exceptions, for example for regional transport. I do not think we should exempt regional transport, and I have done some research. In some of our Member States a regional coach journey can take up to six hours, which is longer than an international coach journey from, say, London to Brussels or Paris. So I think it should be included. I think it is right that, where local transport – as Mr Jarzembowski has referred to – is not included, there are public service contracts which mean that the companies will reach the same sort of standards. I also think we need to persuade the construction industry to build more modern buses with the needs of disabled people more in mind. Just as we have campaigned for aeroplanes to be more accessible to disabled people, so we need, perhaps, coaches with wider gangways or more accessible toilets, and we need the operating companies to make their coach terminals more accessible and to train their staff in disability and disability awareness issues. This is a good report. It is a good collection of reports, which takes us several steps forward, and I congratulate everyone who has been involved.
 Robert Evans  (PSE

 Madam President, Mr Tajani said at the beginning of the debate that this sends a good signal to Europe’s citizens. I agree, and that is the purpose of our work. I want to refer particularly to aerodromes because it is important that we bring these establishments under the umbrella of sensible European legislation. I think it is sensible, as it is protecting the citizen, and we do so by extending EASA’s remit. There are, however, a few areas where I would seek a little bit of clarification. I think it is correct that we eliminate small aerodromes just serving the recreational or leisure aspects of flying and take them outside the scope. Amendment 44 tabled by Mr Marinescu and others is important, because it changes the basis from the weight of the aircraft to the runway length of 800 m. I wonder, however, if the Commissioner or Mr Marinescu could, when summing up, give me an assurance that the definition of ‘open to public use’ is properly explained so that there is no ambiguity as to the actual definition of public use. Could they explain whether it means commercially viable, whether it means people buying tickets for flights, or whether it means ones to which the public can actually get access? That could be a future stumbling block which I hope could be cleared up.
 Robert Evans  (PSE

– Madam President, on Monday evening, the Committee on Foreign Affairs adopted a motion regarding the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Sri Lanka, pursuant to Rule 91. The situation in Sri Lanka is clearly very serious, but exactly what is happening regarding the humanitarian situation is far from clear. I am conscious that there are many differing views across this House. So I suggest that the most sensible course of action would be to timetable a proper debate, which cannot seriously be fitted in in this part-session but could be in our next part-session, which is just 10 days away. I am grateful to Mr Daul of the PPE-DE Group for indicating his group’s support for this course of action. As we are a serious Chamber, I suggest and ask colleagues to support a debate with resolution and full participation at the next part-session, to do justice to the gravity of the situation in Sri Lanka.
 Robert Evans,  
on behalf of the PSE Group. 
– Mr President, I very much welcome this debate in the presence of the Commissioner, whom I thank very much for her serious, her strong and her profound statement. It is clearly a very important subject, although it is regrettable that we are discussing it at 11 o’clock at night with so few people here. But the attendance does not, I think, reflect the interest in this topic, nor the seriousness with which many Members view it. We are, to use the Commissioner’s words, deeply concerned about the situation. Tonight’s debate recognises also that the situation has moved on and, as Mrs Isler Béguin said at the beginning, that we need to send a strong signal about the deteriorating situation that is worsening day by day. I support the original resolution tabled, with the exception of the one word ‘temporary’. I deplore the language that Mr Tannock has just used, when he said that a long-term ceasefire would be a disaster. Surely – I appeal to you – we are not interested in just a temporary ceasefire. In every case of conflict around the world, this Parliament, composed of compassionate people, has argued for a permanent ceasefire that can pave the way for diplomatic rebuilding, so that dialogue can begin – and, yes – so that we can get that peaceful, just and multi-ethnic society that Mr Tannock spoke about and with which I agree. So I applaud the Greens for their first amendment, Amendment 1, and I am sure that all decent people here, concerned about the civilians in Sri Lanka, will too. A temporary ceasefire by its very nature implies a return to war later on, which nobody wants. A return to war will mean more deaths, more suffering, more humanitarian tragedy and I cannot believe that anybody on either side of the House really wants that. Likewise, Amendment 2: I support this amendment too because it condemns all acts of violence by whoever is perpetrating them, on whatever side of the conflict. We cannot condone any violence, including the recent suicide attack which has been referred to. Then I turn my attention to Amendments 3, 4 and 5. I would like to read a short piece that I received from a Sri Lankan Member of Parliament in the Jaffna district, Mr Selvarajah Kajendren, dated 10 March. He says ‘I wish to bring to your urgent attention the civilian deaths in Sri Lanka. The Army fired artillery shells fitted with cluster munitions from 2 a.m. till 10 a.m. on Tuesday 10 March 2009’ – this week. ‘The Sri Lankan Government forces indiscriminately attacked all parts of the ‘safe zone’ using every kind of lethal shells, some of them banned in many countries. In this indiscriminate cluster shelling, more than 130 civilians were killed, including children, and more than 200 were severely injured.’ I doubt that anyone would suggest that this is fabricated. More, I would suggest that we all want to do everything we can to help bring an end to that sort of violence. He also refers to his colleague, Mr S. Kanakaratnam, who is living right in the middle of the ‘safe zone’. He says that from 1 January to 6 March this year, 2 544 civilians have been killed in these ‘safe zones’ by bombing campaigns and well over 5 828 civilians have been gravely injured. Yet the Sri Lankan army, he says, have been bombing by air and artillery fire, killing on average 30 to 40 civilians on a daily basis. I do not believe that he would be fabricating. From what the Commissioner has said, from all the evidence given by all the NGOs that have got anywhere near there, that seems to be reflective of what is happening. Amendment 6: I refer here to the report by Sir John Holmes, which was sent to me by His Excellency, the Ambassador of Sri Lanka, in Brussels. In the report, he says there is serious overcrowding in some of the transit sites. His words are reflected in my amendment and it is right that we should be concerned about these camps. I have some pictures of the camps. Anybody is welcome to look at these pictures that have been sent to me. Again, I suggest they are genuine and not fabricated. I know that the Commissioner’s office in Colombo is following this very closely and has close contacts within the real danger zone. Amendments 7 and 8 strengthen the original reference to the war zone so that civilian needs can be fully attended to. We ask for unhindered access not only to the combat zone but also to the refugee camps so that humanitarian agencies, which everybody in this House supports, are granted full access. Everybody round the Chamber would support the work of the humanitarian organisations. Finally, Amendment 9 suggests we send this resolution to the Secretary-General of the United Nations because I believe that this is an international humanitarian crisis, as reflected in the title, and that we should do everything we can. That is why I thank the Greens for putting this down and I ask all colleagues to support the amendments tabled by all political groups.
 Robert Evans  (PSE
).  
– Mr President, this is not a point of order. I was indicating to your colleague that I wanted to ‘catch the eye’ to speak, which I am allowed to do and which I thought I had done. I want to thank Mr Meijer for his remarks. He also referred to the valiant work of Mr Erik Soldheim, from Norway, whom I met 10 days ago in Oslo. I very much agree with Mr Gahler, who spoke a great deal of sense: it is the fate of the civilians that concerns us. I suggest that of all the amendments, the most important is Amendment 1, which calls for an immediate and total ceasefire, and which must be in the interests of all the people of Sri Lanka. There is much evidence. It is not circumstantial. Some of it is from the office of the regional director of the health services of the Sri Lankan Government, which talks about a humanitarian catastrophe and the substandard conditions in which people are living. This is echoed by the European Commission, the ICRC, the UN, the International Crisis Group and Refugee Care Netherlands. The title of the debate this evening is the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Sri Lanka, and we have a duty to do everything we possibly can to prevent that, which I think we can, if we find the right way forward.
 Robert Evans  (PSE
).  
– Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating my friend and colleague, Mr El Khadraoui, who, it is fair to say, despite appearances suggesting the contrary, has actually proved himself capable of producing a very sound and workable report. I am happy to add my support to it, and indeed to the underlying principle that the polluter should pay. On this side of the House, we attach great importance to air quality, about which we are all very concerned, and we all know that lorries pollute. As Mrs Lichtenberger put it, ‘there is documented evidence’. Now Mrs Wortmann-Kool, who has left, spoke about the obstacles to the internal market and Mr Jarzembowski, despite his report on the greening of transport, also expressed reservations about the Eurovignette. I would say to both of them that the biggest threat to all markets will be if we get overtaken by pollution. I do not believe that an extra 2-3% will be a huge burden, but it will show that we are taking serious steps to counter pollution. Mr O’Neachtain expressed reservations and concerns about Ireland and other peripheral countries. He seems not to understand that this is optional on Member States. It will only apply in Ireland if his government actually decides it. I think he, and probably Mr Bradbourn, will have learnt one lesson this afternoon, which is that it is dangerous – and makes you look rather foolish – to speak on a report that you either have not read or that you clearly do not understand. On another point, as an aside, I believe that we should, and could, do much more to encourage freight off the roads onto the waterways, where one barge can carry as much as 15 lorries. I therefore think that we should support the initiative of our erstwhile Belgian colleague.
 Robert Evans  (PSE
).  
– The Commissioner must know a little bit about tax havens, because Luxembourg rather falls into that category. Does she not feel that this undermines the whole principle of a common market, with lorries driving out of their way to get the cheap fuel there? Then there is Jersey, Guernsey, the Isle of Man – which are in the UK but outside the EU – Liechtenstein, Monaco, San Marino, etc. They are all little tax havens, with offshore banking, which we have just heard about, pandering to the rich. They only exist because the EU allows them to do so. These are her words: ‘a resolute policy against tax evasion’. If that were true, would not the Commission include some suggestions for abolishing these tax havens?

− Madam President, the Socialist Group in this Parliament is formally refusing to take part in this vote on Sri Lanka. Last month, Parliament held a full debate, with Council and Commission statements, on the situation in Gaza. On this side of the House, we attach the same importance to Sri Lanka and believe it deserved equal and proper discussion, but I regret that not one other group supported us in this stand. A short debate this afternoon with a handful of people on a Thursday is an insult to the thousands of people under attack and dying in the north of Sri Lanka. We wanted to call, as in the joint USA and UK declaration from Washington earlier this week, for an immediate and unconditional cease-fire by both sides, but the PPE refused to include that in the text. We wanted to condemn, unreservedly, the bombing of hospitals and aid workers, but Mr Van Orden, negotiating for the PPE, refused to condemn it. That is why it is not in the resolution before you. To him – and presumably to Dr Tannock as well – everything the Government of Sri Lanka says is a fact and just about every aid organisation on the ground, from the Red Cross to the UN, can be dismissed. Amnesty International today suggests the Sri Lankan army could be guilty of war crimes for its use of cluster bombs on a hospital – a 16-hour bombardment, according to Amnesty International. The PSE also wanted to condemn the murders of journalists and other media workers by government agents. Paragraph 4 of the resolution asks the Government – the very same Sri Lankan Government – to investigate their own serious human rights violations. Colleagues, some of you may want to associate yourselves and your groups with those kinds of sentiments, but we do not. Vote for this text and you are condoning attacks on hospitals and ignoring allegations of war crimes. I note that Mr Van Orden has not even had the courage to stand here and defend his bloody handiwork, but I am hardly surprised. In our negotiations, he just dismissed and laughed off as propaganda allegations of rape by Sri Lankan soldiers, so what you can expect? In the Middle East, millions of people – including many Jews – were outraged at what Israel did to Gaza, but that did not make them supporters of Hamas. Sadly, anyone who does not support the Sri Lankan Government is labelled an apologist for terrorism and a supporter of the LTTE. However, our motion was critical of the LTTE and their tactics. We do condemn their attacks and we do want them, the Tamil Tigers, to sit round the negotiating table, but this war must be stopped immediately. The Government must end its military campaign that has brought – as others have said – humanitarian disaster to hundreds of thousands of ordinary people in the north of the island. Sadly, this resolution does not call for an immediate end to the fighting, so we will not endorse that approach by taking part in today’s vote. We dissociate ourselves, President and colleagues, from this motion and I urge anyone else with the same views to do likewise.
 Robert Evans  (PSE

 – Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Parish on bringing this forward. Despite our political differences, and notwithstanding his very obvious deficiencies as a human being, I think he is actually very sound on this and I support him. We need this regulation to be a success and we need it to be universally in force, but I have a number of reservations and I disagree with some colleagues who spoke this morning. Mr Stevenson said that longer journeys were unavoidable – I say: not so. Mrs Jensen spoke of 24-hours transport – not necessarily. Mr Allister, the agricultural industry has to ask questions itself. As a civilised society, we need to look at the whole question, the whole purpose, the whole idea of transporting animals long distances and then killing them. If I were a meat eater, I would be asking how can the suffering en route which we know about, the dehydration, the stress and – to our Irish colleagues North and South – the sea journeys, possibly improve the quality of the product at the end? To my mind, it makes no economic sense. It does not make humanitarian sense. This is why I favour a complete ban on the transport of animals, which, I believe, would support rural economies. It would encourage local producers, yes, small- and medium-sized enterprises as someone spoke of, and it would enable consumption of food as near the point of production as possible. In the absence of that, and I know it is not going to happen in the near future, I think we need proper realistic enforcement of what we have at the moment, the regulation, and I urge the Commission to use all the agencies across Europe – police forces on motorways if necessary – to stop and check lorries to see whether they are carrying out the full requirements of this legislation.
 Robert Evans  (PSE

 Mr President, I also wish to thank Mr Coelho. This report is very important for the future of Europe and for its 500 million citizens: for their safety, their security and for anti-terrorism measures, amongst others. If the technology is there, as Ms Zdravkova said, we should make use of it. From the point of view of children, Ms Angelilli, Mr Lambrinidis and others have said that it can be a vital weapon to counter child-smuggling, for example. However, the crucial point is really in the new Article 3, which states that the purpose of biometric data is to verify not only the authenticity of the document but also the identity of the holder by means of directly available comparable features. At the moment, most countries rely almost exclusively on photographs and very few people, I would suggest – perhaps not even you, Mr President, nor even Mr Barroso – look like their passport photos – nor, indeed, would many of us want to! So I think that if there are new identity procedures and methods available, we should be prepared to use them. As for Ms Gacek and Mr Batten and their anti-British, ‘hit-and-run’ contributions – because they are not here now to hear any response – I would suggest that the UK system is probably no better or no worse than many others in the European Union. We have checks and balances, but we can do better. If new 21st-century technology is available, then we should be prepared to make use of it and, as Ms Grabowska said a few moments ago, we should be prepared to amend it constantly to make the best possible use of what facilities are around the European Union.
 Robert Evans  (PSE

 Mr President, this is an important dossier, and I am disappointed that the Council is not here, because it now has a crucial role to play as the direction of its thinking is, I understand, rather different from that of this Parliament. Ms Ayala Sender referred to concerns about the legal base. While I support the principle of cross-border enforcement, it has to be legally sound and stronger than it is now. The offences covered by this proposal are limited to speeding, drink-driving, the seat belt and not driving through a red light. Ms Fouré said that these cannot be tolerated and Ms Ayala Sender spoke of people getting away with it. I hope that, as we approach the next phase of discussion, we will address this aspect of getting away with it. People who get away with drink-driving, speeding or jumping red traffic lights are a danger to other citizens, but they are often, I would argue, the very same people who think that other rules of the road do not apply to them, whether we are talking about parking restrictions, congestion charges or, as Ms Raeva said, driving using a mobile phone. There are also those who ignore innovative measures such as low-emission zones. These are very important issues and no one should ignore them. We need cross-border, pan-European enforcement to counter them all. All the people who break the laws contribute to those 42 000 deaths which the Commissioner spoke about earlier. If there were 42 000 deaths in any field of European activity other than driving, we would be up in arms about it day after day, week after week, month after month. Colleagues, together we must act to strengthen this piece of legislation second time around for all our citizens in the 27 EU Member States.

 – Madam President, I echo the thanks of my colleagues to Mr Stockman for what I think he described as a workable compromise in the interests of 69 European airports. I also share the words of Mr Becsey, and indeed of my colleague Brian Simpson, about fair and transparent competition. I am happy that this report, as it is presented now, is a good deal, not just for London’s three airports of Heathrow, Stansted and Gatwick, but for the airports of the rest of Europe, whether it is Mr Zīle’s Latvia, Mrs Ţicău’s Romania, or Portugal, and indeed for the Commissioners – Italian airports, and I believe there are airports in Germany as well, although not many people go to them. But I think, also, it is a good deal for Europe’s passengers and, of course, airports are nothing without the citizens, the passengers. They are our priority, as – equally – is the environment, which I think is addressed by this report. Mr Batten, my London colleague, in what could best be described as his hit-and-run contribution (because he has gone away), suggested that there were going to be new bodies set up and all sorts of other scaremongering. But those bodies – the Civil Aviation Authority – exist already. So I think that is a misunderstanding on his part – to be polite to him. And, to Fiona Hall, I am not sure that Newcastle is in direct competition with London. There is a good distance between the two of them, and anybody who chooses to go into London rather than Newcastle has still got a tremendous distance to go. So I think you are not comparing like with like there. I think that this is a good, workable compromise. I think all the original concerns that we wanted to address have been covered and, as a package, it does provide the balance – in the interests of airlines and in the interests of passengers – that we were looking for, whilst allowing the airports sufficient freedom to operate in a competitive environment. I live in hope that, as a result of this, we might one day – you never know, colleagues, you never know – we might just get a decent service into Strasbourg. It is a long shot, but you never know – and it is worth working for.

 My point relates to this whole question of air safety. There have been a number of incidents reported where passengers, sometimes British, sometimes of other nationalities, have taken on too much alcohol during the flight and been a danger to other passengers and indeed the whole aircraft. Do you think that there is a case for not allowing passengers on board aeroplanes who have alcohol with them?

 Like the minister, I have no wish to make Europe into a fortress, and I want sensible security checks and to use new technology. But I have witnessed the use of these passports, and I wonder if he can tell me where I am going wrong, because what happens is a person in possession of an electronic passport comes up to a machine, places his or her passport on the reader and then walks through if the passport is in order. I cannot see how that is doing anything other than checking whether that person is in possession of a valid passport. What it is not doing is checking that the person has one that has been issued in his or her name. My understanding, therefore, is that there would be nothing to stop me using your passport, Minister – providing you were to lend it to me – to go through a check, because there is nobody there to see whether the picture and the person is the same, or I could be using the passport of a distinguished person like Mr McMillan-Scott. I wonder if you can give me an assurance as to where the check is actually taking place concerning the ownership and the actual identity of the person.

 It is a point of order in a roundabout sort of way. Mr Orban and I go back a long time, so I hope he will take this in the spirit that it is intended, because one of his answers did actually take six minutes, and I think, as we are trying to get many questions up in future, I wonder if he could perhaps try and make his answers a little bit more focused or succinct in future for the benefit of all Members.

 I thank the Commissioner, and agree with her that the election observations are some of the most useful work that the European Union does. It is high-profile work in those countries, and almost without exception it is money well spent. I have been very proud to go on a number of election observation missions over the years, most recently in Pakistan. I was actually in Sri Lanka for a delegation visit. But I wonder if I can push the Commissioner slightly on one point: during the four or perhaps five years between one election observation mission and the next, does the EU actually offer specific help and suggestions to address any deficiencies or areas where we think that there may be a need to improve and that we can offer ideas, support and perhaps finance to make sure that countries do not repeat in one election the errors they may have made before?

 Mr President, I too would like to thank Mr Kirkhope for his unfailing cooperation and support for all members on the committee. Two years ago I looked at an internet-based travel agency, a travel website, for a ticket from London to San Francisco. The website, or the computer, told me that there were no direct flights from London to San Francisco and recommended a connecting flight via New York with, I think, United. Of course there are direct flights, but it was not just in that particular website’s domain to issue them. But it highlighted to me, in a simplified form, the problem that we are trying to address with this revision: as Commissioner Mandelson said, a revision that goes back some 20 years or more. We must recognise the real changes that have taken place in technology over that period. Now a large majority of people, and indeed all travel agents, have access to the internet, and I agree with the previous speakers who have said we have a duty to ensure fairness and equal access to the market and, as Commissioner Mandelson said, fair rules, effective rules, and protect the consumers and ensure competition. But, Mr Mandelson, you also said that you are pleased with the speed at which this has all gone through. Whilst I share your aims and always want to do things as quickly as we can – and Mr Kirkhope’s aims of price transparency and consumer protection – I think that, in our speed to get this through, we have drifted away, certainly from the position that the Committee on Transport adopted at the end of May, and that the position that Council has come up with, the so-called compromise position, is different from the position that we went for in the Committee on Transport. In the Commission’s clarification yesterday, he speaks about ‘all past analyses will have to be done again under a new perspective, and the Commission will have to examine each case on a case-by-case basis’. That, I think, means it is not clear enough, and we have not got to a position where, certainly, a lot of Members on this side and in other groups would like to be, where we can say with absolute certainty that the position Mr Kirkhope hopes he has achieved has actually been such. That is why I will be recommending to my group to support a proposal that Mrs Lichtenberger, I believe, is going to make shortly.

 I will give a bit of clarification and put my question more broadly. The President-in-Office has answered some of the points that I raised and I thank him for that. He is right. My position is that I think it is an anomaly that we allow countries like French Guiana to be a full part of the European Union with all the benefits and advantages entailed – not just French territories, but Martinique and Guadeloupe come to mind. And yet within Europe – and the President-in-Office has referred to the negotiation process that is taking place with Croatia and perhaps with Turkey – we put up resistance; there are countries in the European Union which are not happy about that. But then there are other anomalies closer at hand – the Channel Islands, Jersey and Guernsey, which are not in the European Union, exempt from legislation. They are tax havens where rich people are allowed to avoid paying everything that everyone else does. Is this position, or are these anomalies, discussed in Council? Can the President-in-Office defend the situation where French Guiana is part of the European Union, and does he think this will continue, not just in the short term but in the long term? Could he look into his crystal ball and give me a bit of insight into the way the European Union is going in a global sense?

 Mr President, like many people here, seven years ago when the Olympic Games were awarded to China I had serious reservations. But they were awarded only after a string of assurances had been given by the authorities that minority rights would be respected, that there would be an end to the torture and abuses and that the well-documented human rights violations would be addressed. Fast forward to today and we know that our worries are as great as ever, if not more so. Others have spoken about the abuses. Mr Cappato was eloquent on Tibet, and Mr Cohn-Bendit and others also spoke. We know about the violations of natural justice. China executes more people every year than all the other countries in the world put together. I think it will be to Europe’s shame next month if President Sarkozy and a line of EU Heads of Governments and Presidents and princes stand there and shake hands with the Chinese leaders, thereby giving them credibility when they do not deserve it and giving them the green light to carry on in the same vein as they have been doing. The Olympic Games should be about the Olympic ideal and what is going on in China at the moment contravenes that.

 Mr President, I refer back to point 16 in the resolution where we say that ‘Afghanistan’s security problems are more complex than just a war on terror and that they therefore require more than a military solution’. This is the point that I think my colleagues Mr Rouček and Mr Pohjamo made earlier on. We know of many examples in history showing that military power can in many circumstances force an end to conflict and create a quasi-peaceful solution, but we also know from those historical lessons that only democratic institutions, with the support of the people of these countries, can secure a lasting solution. We were making progress in this area in Afghanistan, and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner is right when she says that the Afghanistan Government must now show a clear respect for human rights and freedom of expression if this is to be restored. In the last elections I saw women voting in Afghanistan, which is a major step forward. These are the sort of things we have got to build on, and we must work with Pakistan so that we can restore peace in that area.

I should like to thank the President-in-Office for that response, but I have two brief points I would like to put. To be at the forefront of the peace process the EU would have to change its policy on the travel ban, because negotiations have taken place in Geneva, which is not in the EU, and because the Norwegians, who are also not members of the EU, have also been prominent in the peace process. Is the President-in-Office happy about that? The President-in-Office gave a very comprehensive point of view about the GSP negotiations, but in light of his reservations, or of reservations about Sri Lanka at the moment, how confident is he at this stage that Sri Lanka will satisfy those 27 conditions to which he referred, which must be met before they can actually get this preferential system of trading?

 Madam President, I echo the thanks of others to the rapporteur for her work on bringing this initiative forward to Parliament. I said last night in one of the debates that we are in a week when there is a lot of soul-searching in the European Union about what the idea of Europe is for, and how we can re-engage with our citizens and really show the people of Europe that we are doing a worthwhile job and protecting them, their families and their interests. I think this is another example, where we are looking at safety measures and at using the most modern technology to help them when they come into difficulties; we are trying to argue that cars should be better equipped. Of course, this has a Europe-wide dimension, because cars are made in nearly every European country (far fewer are made, I have to say, in the United Kingdom than they were before). People drive cars that are French, Italian or German, that are made in Spain or Britain and assembled elsewhere and, of course, we must have transnational legislation to support the highest possible standards. If this means, through this initiative, that we can save lives through getting medical aid around and we can help people who might not otherwise have done to survive when they have an accident, then this is something that the British citizen and the citizens of the other European countries and Ireland should be able to gauge into. We may look at this initiative and think this is very much futuristic and not going to happen for while. But it was not such a long time ago – I am thinking of 30 years ago when I got my first car, and I look around the room and perhaps Members here may have got their first car longer ago than that – that cars did not automatically have radios in them. Now, I do not know whether it is possible to buy a car without a radio, CD player or those sorts of things. Now cars, as the previous speaker said, are made to go faster and faster and are more sophisticated than ever: satellite navigation systems, e-systems, as we are talking about here, will be in cars very shortly and they will probably be standard in 20 years’ time. This is something we should welcome, and we should spread the news. Therefore, I congratulate all involved.

 Mr President, on a point of order, I do not have in front of me Parliament’s Rules of Procedure but I am sure that your services do, so you will forgive me if I rise. This is not related to the Gurmai report because we have spoken about that. Whilst you were speaking, indeed whilst Mrs Gurmai was summing up her report, I noticed that there were members of the public coming into the visitors’ gallery. I warmly welcome them and I think it is very good and important that people are coming into the visitors’ gallery, but I am also conscious that as soon as I sit down from this momentous speech that I am making, what will happen is that you will suspend the sitting until 12.00 for the voting period. These poor people, who have come many hundreds of kilometres, will not have the benefit of hearing a debate and a speech this morning. They are getting a little bit from me, but I wonder if it would be possible for you and your assistants to go back to the relevant authorities and look for a way of ensuring that, in the event of the debate finishing at 11.30, as it has done this morning, with nothing scheduled until 14.00, something could be put in to fill the half-hour gap between now and 12 noon, whether it be the urgencies from this afternoon or something else of mind-boggling importance? I am speaking on behalf of these perhaps 100 or so people in the gallery who have come to hear people speaking and all they are going to hear at the moment is me rabbiting on for two minutes about nothing – but making a very serious point. (Applause)

 Thank you to the Presidency but obviously I am aware of all the legislation because I was the rapporteur who steered it through this House. In fact it is the national agencies who are responsible. I do not know the situation in all the countries but in the United Kingdom it is the Civil Aviation Authority. So these are national agencies and it is the responsibility of the national governments, which is why I posed the question to the Council. In a week when Europe is clearly struggling to convince all its half a billion citizens of the real value of the European Union, this is a worthwhile initiative. This is very important legislation to support disabled people and passengers of reduced mobility so I urge the Minister to go back to the Council and say to all his 26 colleagues on the Transport Council and the members that they should enforce this legislation.

 Mr President, I would like to thank first of all my friend and colleague Bogusław Liberadzki for his work on this important dossier. I would also like to congratulate our new Commissioner on his debut this evening. I will be honest with Mr Tajani: I did not vote for him earlier today. I did not vote against him, I did not abstain, I just did not participate in the vote. I should like Mr Tajani to understand it was nothing personal, it was more a protest against the system and against Italian procedures. Nevertheless, I respect his appointment and I am sure in the months ahead his will be looking to do everything he can to convince me and others of his great merits and qualities and indeed competence in the role that he brings to this House. In the last few days I think the Irish voters showed us that far from all Europeans are fully signed up or are clear about the role and benefits of the European Union, about European cooperation and why Europe-wide regulations are necessary in the first place. However, I think all of these people, people who voted ‘no’ as well, will expect their national governments and indeed the European Union to look after them. Whilst this particular subject may not be top of the list of ones that come to their mind, in fact the inland transport of dangerous goods is a serious issue, a serious responsibility and one that it behoves all of us to look after. Only now, with this directive, do we actually have Europe-wide regulations that cover the transport of dangerous goods as they move from one country to another across the continent. Mr Liberadzki was quite right to point out that in many countries there were no regulations internally or nationally. So this report will put responsibility on national governments. But any legislation is only as good as its enforcement. So in his quest to gain my full confidence, I hope Mr Tajani, by his good offices, will be doing everything he can to encourage Member States to ensure that this legislation is properly monitored, enforced, and modified if necessary, and that strong action is taken against those who contravene this directive.

 Mr President, I may perhaps be the only person here tonight who has actually witnessed first-hand the process to which we are referring. As Chairman of the Delegation for relations with the countries of South Asia, I have been to Bangladesh and seen the shipyards. In amongst the ships that were being repaired and dismantled – and the noise, I have to tell you, was intolerable – there were whole families living, sleeping, cooking meals in shanty towns. Children were playing around the boats, retrieving cricket balls from under the vessels whilst above them oxyacetylene torches were being used. It is not acceptable for European ships – and none of them were flying European flags; by this stage they had already been passed off as local ships or from somewhere else in the world – to be broken in these circumstances. The Committee on Transport and Tourism believes that the EU should lead the way and encourage global action with the clear aim of putting an end to the current practices and ways in which ships are dismantled, particularly in parts of South Asia. But dismantling should not be stopped altogether, nor indeed immediately, as Mr Blokland stated, in view of its economic importance to the countries concerned. I agree with the rapporteur when he says that we must work towards a global strategy which ensures that all those who are involved in the process of ship recycling assume their due share of responsibility for the way it is carried out – for safety, workers’ rights and the protection of the environment. Finally, I think we should also support the development of a competitive and clean European ship-recycling industry. But, in the meantime, Member States must commit themselves to a policy that state-owned vessels and old warships will be dismantled in a safe and environmentally sound way.

 Madam President, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner opened her remarks a few minutes ago by stating how serious this situation is, a view also expressed by Mr Lenarčič on behalf of the Council. All the speakers since have emphasised the severity of the current situation. I know from my visits to Georgia that the country is making real efforts to strengthen its ties with the European Union. I think, colleagues, that we should now support Georgia at this time of crisis and in the face of what a colleague a few moments ago described as Russian imperialism. Russia has never accepted the territorial integrity of Georgia with respect to Abkhazia or South Ossetia. We know from what we have heard in recent weeks that Russian and Abkhazian separatists have apparently been involved in the spy plane incidents which have led to this rise in tension and we must all recognise that one thing has led on to another. I do not know all the diplomatic measures that are taking place, but I am concerned that the European Union is not doing enough to stop this escalating violence. Mrs Isler Béguin said a few minutes ago that history will not pardon us if we do nothing. Do nothing and the whole area could dissolve into a war – a war which no one will win. So my message this afternoon – not just to this Parliament, but to Mr Lenarčič for the Council and, indeed, to Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner – is to do everything within your means, at the highest level, to ensure that everyone, above all the Russians, understands how dangerous the moves are that are taking place in this area and that we have got to stop this escalation before we have another Balkan crisis.

 The Minister said he had not received satisfactory answers from the Chinese authorities so far. In the weeks and months ahead, will he follow up forcefully what he has asked already and for which he has not received answers? He will be aware that in the run up to their Olympic bid, China made many promises about improvements to their human rights record, assurances which to date, we know, have not yet been met. Now is the opportune time to act in the pre-Olympic period because afterwards will be too late. On 15 May when they have these discussions, will they actually be discussing what positive steps they can take to press China on freedom of speech, the rights of journalists and the right to free demonstration and so on? Will he press them also on their use of capital punishment? Because what statistics there are show that China is executing more people than the rest of the world put together at the moment. We cannot have the Olympic Games there without putting this message as forcefully as possible to the Chinese authorities.

 Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for that assurance at the end of his statement that the Commission does not intend that what he described as ‘preferential treatment’ will be adversely affected. I think that is welcome. If the work as he describes it continues and he can strike the right balance, I think that will be welcome in all countries in the European Union. I thank him for that assurance. Whilst I have the floor, on a related matter, does the Commissioner have any idea when he expects to publish his proposal on a decision to accede to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which of course fits into this same category?

 Madam President, as we have heard from Mr Albertini and the Commissioner, this is a very timely and important report and we welcome it. In his introductory remarks, Mr Albertini said that this gives us a chance to outline our transport policy, bearing in mind the environment and fuel efficiency, something about which this Parliament has consistently felt very strongly and expressed its views. Mr Barrot, in his contribution, called the whole issue a huge challenge and one, I know, that all our governments are looking at. As Mr Barrot said, we have to recognise transport’s clear contribution and the need for the ‘greening’ of transport. In this respect, I am very proud of the fact that London has led the way with a number of initiatives, be it the congestion charge, the new low-emission zone or higher charges for less environmentally friendly vehicles, something which had been opposed by London’s Conservatives. Mr Barrot also spoke about the need to recognise the external costs of transport and Mr Albertini spoke about some of the amendments. However, I think there is a contradiction in the PPE-DE Group’s position – one I know the PPE-DE Group has debated internally – and there is a contradiction in this report. Recital B, for example, talks about energy consumption and highlights ‘road transport, accounting as it does for 83% [...] of energy’. Against that, Amendment 1, by the PPE-DE Group, and co-signed by some Members from the ALDE Group, is quite clearly trying to change the position adopted in committee to one that favours road transport over rail transport. That does not fit in with a package that is arguing for sustainable transport over forms that are not friendly to the environment. I ask Mr Albertini, when he winds up, and I ask the ALDE Group, which has also supported this, why they are trying to turn it round and why they are trying to favour road transport. I suggest that perhaps the person whose fingerprints are really on this is not here to answer that tonight. I must say that my group will be considering whether we would support this whole report were that amendment to go through. I look forward to it. Other than that, the principles in the report are fine.

 Madam President, I am advised by the services that each additional roll-call vote costs EUR 400, which makes the cost of yesterday’s escapade in excess of EUR 25 000. So, I would ask those who are calling for roll-call votes all the time whether they think that is a good use of taxpayers’ money.

 Madam President, as Chairman of the Delegation for relations with the countries of South Asia, I join the Council and the Commission in the condemnation of the murder of Benazir Bhutto. This Parliament has always condemned terrorism wherever it occurs and we will continue to fight for the right of politicians to express their views and to campaign in safety. In going back to Pakistan, Benazir Bhutto knew the risks and, whether you consider her to be brave or foolhardy, you have to respect her commitment to her party and her country. In her memory and the memory of others who have died in this election period, I believe it is beholden on all of us – Europeans and Pakistanis from President Musharraf downwards – to do everything we can to assist Pakistan. As Mr Lenarčič said, the key to this must be the continuing battle against terrorism. We have seen that terrorism is a threat in Pakistan as much as it is in Europe or the USA. Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner has reminded us that hundreds of innocent civilians have been killed in shootings and suicide bombs in Pakistan, so Europe must continue to fully assist and support the counter-terrorism operations in Pakistan. Some colleagues here might suggest we should leave Pakistan be and have little to do with it, but I firmly believe the contrary. As 27 strong democratic nations, we need to work collectively to support the economic, social and political developments in Pakistan. Again, I agree with the Council: the release of all remaining political detainees will be crucial to this process, as will ensuring free, fair, transparent and safe elections on 18 February 2008 and a safe and satisfactory run-up to that date. In addition to what the Commissioner said, I think the election will mean that we need to have 90 million voters with proper access to news coverage of all sides of the debate. It means making a safer environment for the media. Pakistan has become the most dangerous Asian country for the media: at least six journalists were killed in 2007, some 30 seriously injured, over 100 arrested and countless harassed. We need an end to the censorship of the print and broadcast media and to restrictions on what they can say and do without interference from the military or civilian authorities. The ban on the TV news station GEO News needs to be lifted and the government television channel PTV needs to be more balanced in its news and the information it conveys to the public. All arrangements for the actual voting, the counting and the reporting of the results need to be above board and clear to everyone, but most especially to the voters of Pakistan. A mark of democracy is also whether incumbents can accept defeat and whether political transition from one party of government to another, if it occurs, can go smoothly. All of these will be crucial factors in whether or not the elections can be counted as a true record of the will of the people and whether or not Pakistan can start to emerge from the long shadow cast by that assassin’s bullet on 27 December 2007.
 Robert Evans  (PSE

 Madam President, I too wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Costa, who is chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism and who began by pointing out that the Treaties allow policies that impact on tourism. It is therefore very appropriate that we are considering this issue. Equally, as Mr Arnaoutakis reminded us a few moments ago, at least 12% of jobs in the EU depend on tourism. The EU is much more, nowadays, than just a common market for goods and capital. It is a common market for people. EU citizens, as we know, are travelling more than ever, not least as tourists. Many, perhaps most, have very good experiences, but it is the minority – the few who have less happy experiences – that give some aspects of the tourism industry a poor name. I draw colleagues’ attention in particular to paragraphs 24 and 25, which call for a set of comprehensive guidelines for hotels that are sensitive to the needs of consumers. Those guidelines should take into account the demands of families with children. Not all hotels may be able to respond to these, but the industry really needs to make itself as family-friendly as possible. Equally, a system of classification must take into account the needs of the elderly and the disabled. The Transport Committee has argued for this in the case of airlines, and it is right to require that hotels, too, should not discriminate against this social group. Nor should they be able to make moral judgments on who qualifies as a couple, and who does not. The report is also right to point out, as it does in paragraph 48, which suggests a charter of rights and obligations for tourists, that tourists should themselves behave properly and respect hotels and the tourism business. This is a good report, it is a ‘good news’ story and it sends a message that Parliament is acting sensibly in the interests of the consumers. I hope that message reaches the people of Europe.

 Mr President, as Chairman of the Delegation for relations with the countries of South Asia, I led negotiations on this compromise text. I recognise that it is a sensitive issue and it is important that we all recognise the situation in Pakistan. I think the whole House will want to send a strong, unified message to General Musharraf. In the spirit of compromise and, I hope, to win the support of the whole House, I would like to propose the following oral amendment. In recital A, we refer to President Musharraf ‘suspending the Constitution and the rule of law and replacing them with martial law’. I would like to propose that we say that he has replaced them ‘by the state of emergency, de facto martial law’. Then, in line with the suggestions made by other colleagues, in three other places, paragraphs 1, 10 and 11, we should replace ‘martial law’ with ‘the state of emergency’. I hope that will command the full support of the House.
 Robert Evans  (PSE

 Mr President, I voted in favour of this resolution because I recognise that the free movement of persons is a fundamental principle of the European Union and one which must be respected and defended by all Member States. Furthermore, I think we are right to emphasise yet again that the EU was actually founded on measures to combat all forms of racism and xenophobia and indeed all forms of discrimination. Equally, we should all in this House recognise that the Roma people of Europe are perhaps the most discriminated against, in some countries to totally unacceptable levels. We should understand that the assimilation, social integration and protection of the Roma minority are objectives that this European Union has yet to achieve. I think that this is an aim that we should all work for, along with the spirit of free movement.

 Mr President, I would like to thank the Council and the Commission, especially the Council for its tough declaration on 8 November. I do not think that anyone would doubt that the situation in Pakistan is very serious and very volatile. It is perhaps hard to register that everything that has been going on has really only taken place in the last ten days or so, since the state of emergency was declared. Several Members here met General Musharraf some months ago, both in Brussels and later in Islamabad, and we received a number of assurances. He was adamant that he would follow the constitution and that free and fair elections would take place. I welcome his announcement that elections can take place by 9 January, but I share the Commissioner’s apprehension and beg the question: in the light of what has gone on and the present emergency measures – the suspension of certain television channels and other human rights – are free and fair elections possible in less than eight weeks’ time? Whilst I refer to the Commissioner, I would also like to draw her attention in particular to our paragraph 14 of this resolution where we invite the Commission to consider expanding aid to Pakistan for education, poverty reduction, healthcare and relief work, but channelling the funds through secular NGOs rather than directly to the government under these circumstances. We have no issue with the Pakistan people. We recognise that Pakistan is a key ally of the West, as Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra said. We recognise the important role they played in many, many areas and that they have also been victims of terrorism. But I do not think, colleagues, that means we should stand aside and ignore what is happening at the moment. My group also wanted to have a paragraph in about possible sanctions, inviting the Council ... (The President asked the speaker to speak more slowly)
 I thought I was speaking such clear English that they would manage perfectly but I will, of course, slow down. I am also inviting the Council to consider targeted sanctions, which is what the Socialist Group would have liked to have done but we did not get any support for it: travel bans perhaps, the freezing of assets. But we hope all of this will not be necessary and we hope that Pakistan can still come back from the brink, that the state of emergency can be withdrawn and that General Musharraf will step down as Chief of Army. Mr President, my apologies for going too quickly.

 Like the Commissioner, I had understood that the question was to do with road safety in developing countries, not EU Member States. Has the Commissioner travelled by road in South Asia where, with deep respect, his reference to the highway code could, in many cases, be considered laughable, because traffic goes very quickly on either side of the road and in both directions at the same time, which obviously leads to road accidents, certainly when there are lorries going around and people driving in rickshaws as well? In his discussions with the countries of South Asia, has the Commissioner suggested that the European Union – with all the advice that, perhaps, Mr Higgins could give from the Republic of Ireland and other countries – could assist them in improving their road safety, improving, perhaps, a reference to a highway code that does not exist, and help to reduce mortality on their roads?
 Robert Evans  (PSE

 Mr President, tonight, for once, Parliament really can lead the way in protecting the environment. I think, as Mr Belder said, the Commission was really a bit timid in its original proposal. The European public, I think, will be looking to this Parliament to set the highest standards and ambitious targets. As a member of the Committee on Transport, and along with my colleagues in the PSE Group, I did not support Mr Jarzembowski’s line that was pushed through with, I regret to say, the support of the Liberal Group, the ALDE Group. We wanted to strengthen the original proposal, not to water it down. So I say congratulations to Mr Liese for his report, and I quote, ‘we do not just inherit this planet from our ancestors, our parents, we borrow it from our children’. And, like Ms Lucas, I appeal to all the groups in this Parliament to think about how they vote tomorrow; be prepared to compromise, be sensible, be realistic, but above all, be positive, because Parliament has a chance to be at the forefront of protecting the environment for 500 million citizens and their descendants.

 Thank you, President-in-Office, for that quite encouraging response. You said you want to send a strong signal and that we need a global agreement. I was interested to hear about a 30% target. I agree with you that we need to be ambitious. Of course, this is an area that not only affects most European citizens but also one about which they are very concerned. I wonder if you could outline a little bit more about your thinking on what positive real steps we could be taking to encourage those countries that ought to be able to do more – like the United States – and to assist those countries – whether it is China, India or Russia – that are perhaps struggling at the moment. What more could we actually be doing to push this process forward, rather than talking? I am not suggesting that is all you were doing, but, rather than just talking about the issue, what are we actually going to do to make it happen?

 Mr President, I voted in support of this resolution because I believe in equal treatment between persons, irrespective of their racial or ethnic origin. And I believe in equality in this House, so I believe that it is people’s rights to put down amendments that do not support that. But I am still, nevertheless, surprised at the string of amendments that some Members of this House have voted to support which are contrary to the principle of equal treatment for minorities and I am surprised equally that some people abstained on those votes. This because I think the fundamental principle of the European Union is one where we respect minorities, we respect people from all different backgrounds, and I think it is an impulse of ours that we should support these, whatever.

 Mr President, Bangladesh is a country that I have visited many times and one of which I am very fond. Indeed, I have many friends of Bangladeshi origin in London and I follow the political situation there very closely. This resolution acknowledges that the situation has deteriorated significantly in recent months, such that there are now real concerns about law and order, human rights and, indeed, the mere survival of democracy in that country, which is highlighted throughout this resolution. When the electoral process was suspended in January, I think most of us hoped it would just be a matter of weeks before elections could take place, but the weeks have become months, and months have now become years, before a new democratically-elected government can be in place. In the mean time, we have the unconstitutional and unsatisfactory situation of a civilian caretaker government with the support of the military trying to keep law and order in an increasingly desperate and violent climate. Two former prime ministers are in jail. There have been riots at the university, hundreds of arrests (including of academics) and allegations of assaults and torture. This cannot be the way forward and, as paragraph 11 makes clear, I am sure we in the European Parliament stand ready to help and assist to bring the return of democracy to Bangladesh as soon as possible.

 Mr President, I apologise for this, but colleagues will recognise that this situation is changing daily and the oral amendment is not quite the same as that listed on some people’s sheets so I will read it out: ‘Expresses its solidarity with the people of Pakistan who are victims of the violence perpetrated by the armed extremists; is deeply concerned for the safety of the 1800 or more people in the Red Mosque, some of whom were held as hostages; recognises the challenges the siege posed to the Government of Pakistan; expresses its grave concern about the still unknown number of victims and supports the efforts to bring those responsible to justice’.

 This is an important and timely debate. It is interesting that there will be three UK speakers, but that reflects the communities we represent. We know that across Europe many people are concerned about the situation in Pakistan and the uncertainty that surrounds President Musharraf at the moment – his future – and we recognise that is linked very much to the future of his country. I do not intend to be as critical as Dr Tannock, but the motion for a resolution we have put down is expressed in a spirit of concern, because many of us have visited the country – we have met the President both here and in Pakistan – and we wish Pakistan well. We recognise the very real challenges that Pakistan faces, not least in the very hard task of facing terrorism on its own territory. We respect the international role they have played in the fight against global terrorism. We give them credit for what they have done already and we pledge support for future efforts. However, the fight against terrorism cannot be used as a smokescreen to cover malpractice or wrongdoing. The Commissioner spoke about the serious incident at the Red Mosque, as indeed did Dr Tannock, who also referred to the suspension of Chief Justice Chaudhry and what followed on from that. I want to pick up on the elections, which the Commissioner and Mr Lobo Antunes both spoke about. The Council representative said that we support steps to sustainable democracy – and of course we do. I recognise and welcome the Commissioner’s commitment to a subgroup on governance and human rights for Pakistan. I want today to urge President Musharraf to ensure that these forthcoming elections not only take place but that they do so in an environment that will be conducive to ensuring that a clean bill of health can be given to them by any international observer mission, whether it is one sent by the European Union or anyone else. This is vital for the credibility of any president of Pakistan, or any government or, indeed, any government anywhere. Specifically, I hope that the preparations for those elections ensure that they are conducted properly, and that includes allowing more women to stand for election. As the Commissioner said, the electoral roll must not just be above scrutiny, it must be so that people do not feel that they have been left out. We need a free and open press in an election, where journalists feel safe to say and write what they want. I hope that in the interim period, whilst the election is taking place, the interim government will be genuinely neutral. Pakistan is a large country with a proud people and a far too troubled history. I am sure I speak for all in this Parliament when I say that the European Parliament stands ready to do all it can to support Pakistan in difficult times to allow it to grow and support it as fully functioning and peaceful democracy.

 My point really was that what we decide in this Chamber – as you said in response to the last question, when you referred to EU laws that have to be respected – applies in places like Martinique, or Guadeloupe, or French Guiana on the coast of South America, thousands of kilometres away, far removed from this place, but it does not apply in places like the Channel Islands, which are between France and Britain, or the Isle of Man, Liechtenstein, Andorra – I could go on. There are all these peculiar little tax havens and exemptions that we seem to allow and where EU law does not apply. Does the Council not consider this position to be such an anomaly that we ought to look at it again and consider a more modern way forward, rather than trying to legislate thousands of kilometres away, and not on our own doorstep?
 Robert Evans (PSE
). – 
 I can advise the honourable Member that there is a hearing on that tomorrow. Picking up on what the President-in-Office has just said, does he feel that the sentiments expressed in this question are naive and include insinuations, cheap generalisations and, I would say, criticisms of valued security staff at our airports? Further, would the Council agree that perhaps, for example, paying a bit more for water and sacrificing some convenience at our airports is a small price to pay if it means increased security for passengers, lower risks of terrorist attacks and improved welfare for all people using the airports, whether departing, arriving or transiting through airports?

 Madam President, I welcome the third maritime package. This Parliament has a long history of taking maritime safety extremely seriously. After the Erika
 and Prestige
 disasters we have to ensure that nothing of this kind ever happens again and that we are working towards being world leaders at achieving the highest safety standards at sea. I specifically want to talk about Mr de Grandes Pascual’s report. I welcome this initiative to reform the workings of Europe’s classification societies and to improve the quality of these organisations. The report, I think, makes good progress on reforming the inspections, checking and certification tasks of ships carrying Member States’ flags, but I do have a few issues. Firstly, Commissioner Barrot, in your opening remarks you spoke of the need for an independent structure for quality control. I do not take issue with you over that, but I believe that this report, as proposed, is contradictory. If it is to be of real value, the new committee proposed, the Assessment Committee, must be independent, not only of the recognised organisations but of the Member States and of the Commission. Yet at the moment, as things stand, the report says that the Commission ‘may require the Assessment Committee to adopt the measures the Commission deems necessary’. It is hardly giving the committee autonomy and independence if the Commission is going to require it to adopt the measures they deem necessary. So I urge support for my Amendment 73, which, regrettably, Mr de Grandes Pascual says he is not minded to support at the moment. My Amendment 73 will tone that down and give the Commission the power to advise or suggest rather than require, because an independent committee cannot be required to do things, otherwise it completely loses its independence. Regarding Article 8, I am very supportive of the approach establishing a graduated penalty scheme for the recognised organisations and I feel that there should be no significant changes to the liability regime. Regarding Article 12, I am supportive of penalties for failing recognised organisations and this is a much fairer system than the current decommissioning. This is a more flexible way of working and it will allow for a corrective action to be taken swiftly, should a recognised organisation be failing. I wholly support a maximum penalty of 5%, as against the original 10% figure, and I support the position in Article 20 on the mutual recognition of certificates by recognised organisations. I think we are making progress here. I hope that the report can go through with my amendment and I will be one of the first to support it.
 Robert Evans (PSE

Mr President, I would also like to commend Mr Costa on his report. As he said in his introduction, we all want to travel safely and securely. Both Mr Higgins, just now, and Mr Bradbourn, before him, referred to the alert over liquids in the UK last summer. Unlike Mr Jarzembowski, most of us think that this threat is not just ever-present, but that it is one that is changing all the time. We cannot let up or compromise where aviation safety and security is concerned. European countries need to work together to achieve the highest possible standards, and yes, that does mean that some countries may wish to go further and put additional measures in place. But on other aspects passengers are confused. Why are some airports seemingly more secure than others? Why is there no European agreement yet on hand baggage allowances – on what is permitted and what is not? Mr Barrot, you said that we need to guarantee that safety rules are applied, and that is crucial. But you also spoke about fair competition, and I am not sure where competition comes into this debate. Competition could mean compromise and, as others have said, there is no compromise when talking about aviation security. We all have to work together in this field.
 Robert Evans (PSE

 Mr President, staying in the same part of the world I would like to bring to this House’s attention the worsening situation in Sri Lanka, where the ceasefire is all but non-existent. I believe this is a tragedy. Over 200 000 people are now displaced by the renewed fighting. Over 3000 civilians, and of course a number of soldiers on all sides, have been killed. One thing that this Parliament could do is call for independent human rights observers to monitor any abuses and the many abuses that are being committed by the Sri Lankan security forces, by the LTTE and by the other armed groups that are all over the island. I believe that this European Parliament must act to support the people of this wonderful island, bringing about a peaceful solution and an end to this conflict as soon as possible. Thank you very much. 47 seconds! (Laughter)
 Robert Evans (PSE

 President, my UK Labour colleagues and I did not support some items in this resolution and we voted against it in the final vote because we believe that the draft agreement is far too imbalanced in favour of the United States of America. If this draft is accepted by the Council in its present form, the US airlines will have virtually complete access to the EU internal market, whilst European airlines will still not be able to fly internally in the US. In addition, US interests will be able to own up to 49 % voting stock in EU airlines, whilst the reciprocal agreement allows just 25 % voting stock for EU interests in US airlines. So the draft agreement, to my mind, is little better than the one from November 2005, which both Council and Commission said was imbalanced. As the Americans achieved their prime negotiating goals in this draft agreement, there will, I suggest, be little incentive for them to liberalise further in the future. I am afraid that it is the UK that pays the price for this deal. It grants hard traffic rights to the US airlines with full access to Heathrow, which is already 40 % of the transatlantic market, and despite the fact that four airlines – not just American – fly across the Atlantic from Heathrow already. So I think that, for the UK and for the whole of the European Union, this is a very poor deal.

 Mr President, as others have said, I think this is a good report and I congratulate my colleague, Mr Leichtfried, not just on the report but on the way that he has involved other colleagues in Parliament in the discussions and in the debate. We are looking at an extension of the European Aviation Safety Agency. I think it is a good idea, but only if it is done properly. If done in the wrong manner, it would not be positive. We, as members of this committee and this Parliament, know that air travel – and many of us use air travel more than we would like – is actually one of the safest modes of travel available. I think that we need a sensible response and in a single market it is quite appropriate that we should have a European response to safety. Having said that, there are issues in this report about which I have concerns and I would like to draw Members’ attention to some of these. Indeed, the rapporteur is aware of some of my concerns. Amendment 17 highlights my concerns about fines and penalties. I do not believe you can compromise on safety, so I do not think that fines and penalties are an effective measure for correcting safety problems. If there were a safety concern about a particular airline, I would be much happier if that airline’s licence were suspended or its certification revoked. I do not think that we can have half measures. I do not think that a fine or a penalty would make an airline improve in the way that a withdrawal of its certificate would. (Interjection from Mr Jarzembowski)
 Well, let me carry on and I will not interrupt you. I could not hear a word you said, so it may have been important but I missed it completely! I also have reservations about fees, because I believe this Agency needs to have a secure footing. The funding needs to be there, they need to know it is going to be continued and I do not think there can be arbitrary limits on the setting of funds. Another reservation I have – and Mr Leichtfried spoke about this – is the management board. I think that citizens expect the board members to pay a full role in ensuring their safety. Member States should be able to nominate and vote on qualified people to ensure that their interests and obligations are met. My final point concerns Amendment 1. There is a difference between safety and security. They are very separate and it is not clear to me – and I wait to be convinced – about what benefits would be brought by bringing security into this measure, which is to do with air safety. Air security is equally important, but it is a very separate issue.
 Robert Evans (PSE

 Commissioner, still on the question of unethical bank charges, could I ask you what you feel about the exorbitant fees charged by some banks for cross-border money transfers into the eurozone? For example, it costs up to ten times more for a British person to transfer money to a eurozone bank, which is obviously just at the touch of a computer button. Do you agree that this is exorbitant and do you think the whole question of cross-border money transfer needs some regulation to be consistent with the principle of free movement of capital within the EU?
 Robert Evans (PSE
). – 
 Thank you Commissioner for those remarks. I would like to draw to your attention that yesterday evening Air France cancelled the evening flight form Gatwick to Strasbourg, quoting technical reasons, but refused support to passengers and refused to provide hotel accommodation for them. Will the Commissioner take this opportunity to make it very clear to Air France and indeed to other airlines that current EU legislation – this legislation – applies to them and that they should not look for loopholes and try to wriggle out of it, but should respect EU legislation and support passengers when flights are cancelled, as they were yesterday.

 I thank the President-in-Office for her answer. It was perhaps more than I expected and I am very grateful. Iceland, as she and everyone here knows, is not a member of the European Union; it is, however, a member of EFTA and a member of Schengen – although that is obviously not related to this. However, it really proves the point that Iceland has close connections with the EU. I would urge the President-in-Office, in the time that she and her successors have left, to do everything they can to urge Iceland to not continue with the unnecessary and, I would say, cruel slaughter of one of the world’s great mammals for unproven reasons. I applaud what the President-in-Office has said about not allowing whaling in Community waters and banning the import of whale products. Keep up the good work and push the Icelandic authorities even further.
 Robert Evans (PSE

 Mr President, I wish to begin by saying to Mrs Sinnott that it is clouding the issue to raise points like that, which are entirely separate from what we are discussing here today. Approximately 2500 Tibetans – possibly more – annually flee across the border from the Himalayas into exile. They are certainly escaping from the brutality of China’s occupation, but it is not necessarily as Mrs Sinnott suggests. It is difficult to know how many are caught or shot by the Chinese border authorities, because the allegations have generally remained uninvestigated. This particularly horrendous shooting incident on 30 September is in violation of the basic UN principles on the use of force and firearms by law-enforcement officials. It is interesting that there are guidelines as to when law-enforcement officials can shoot, but these require that they should not use firearms against persons except in self-defence or defence of others against the imminent threat of death or serious injury. Those of us who have seen the video clips of this incident know that the situation was not one involving grave threats to life. It appeared to be an unprovoked attack. That is why the motion for a resolution before us is very important, in particular paragraph 8, which urges the Council and the Commission to reiterate their position regarding dialogue between the appropriate authorities. That is a position we must echo this afternoon: dialogue to resolve this situation.
 Robert Evans,  
on behalf of the PSE Group
. –
 Mr President, this item on the agenda, as we know, is about debates on breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law. The situation in Sri Lanka at the moment is tragic, and there have indeed been many breaches of human rights. This motion refers to the work of the Sri Lankan Monitoring Mission. That independent body has blamed the LTTE for the attack on 15 June and, as Mrs Lynne has said, it has blamed the Sri Lankan Government for the murder of the 17 aid workers in Muttur at the beginning of August. This shows the seriousness of the situation. Regrettably though, some people involved in the debate – not just the one this afternoon, but also others – are trying to assign all the blame to one side or the other. We have to accept that in any conflict situation there is grave fault on both sides, and that the military responses have in many cases been disproportionate. What started out as a little local dispute over water supply has cost hundreds of lives, displaced thousands of people and brought the country to the brink of civil war. All sides – the LTTE, Colonel Karuna and the Sri Lankan Government – must realise that there can be no military solution and that peace negotiations without preconditions are the only way forward. It is in this spirit that Amendment 5 seeks to keep the negotiations open. Everyone accepts that the LTTE is a player, and yet the EU has effectively washed its hands of negotiations through its proscriptions. Let me make something clear. Just because I am saying this, and because Mrs Lynne said something similar, as did Mrs Lambert and Mr Meijer, that does not make us terrorists or apologists for terrorism, which we condemn. It just means that we need to keep negotiations open. Equally, we need to do everything we can, as mirrored in Amendment 4, to help the ordinary people of Sri Lanka, who have suffered for so long and need a peaceful solution.
 Robert Evans (PSE
). – 
 Mr President, this is a technical amendment. I am advised that the final part of Amendment 5, which refers to the fact that ‘… Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner shares this concern’ would read better as ‘… this is a view shared by many international bodies’.
 Robert Evans (PSE
). – 
 If the Council says it is inappropriate to comment in any way, it is probably difficult. However, I wonder if I can tease something out from the Council, perhaps in a broader sense. Does the Minister not feel that the mood perhaps changed in Europe after the negative referendums in France and the Netherlands, and that some people in certain countries have a fear of enlarging the European Union and perhaps see that calling a referendum would put a block on any future enlargement?
 Robert Evans (PSE
). – 
 Commissioner, you spoke a moment ago of the stalemate in this situation. I tend to agree and perhaps there are also certain parallels with the position between Transnistria and Moldova, which we touched on yesterday in Parliament. I visited North Cyprus recently for the first time and found it enlightening to say the least. Notwithstanding all the other issues, but bearing in mind the fact that the people of the North of Cyprus voted for membership of the EU, could the EU not, at the very least, see its way forward to allowing direct flights to Northern Cyprus?
 Robert Evans (PSE
). – 
 Mr President, I voted on the Lucas report in support of measures to lessen the impact on climate change. It is vital that all industries play their part, including the aviation industry. However, we need to ensure that measures we propose are both sensible and practical. Merely increasing taxes will not by itself reduce emissions. Neither can the aviation industry trade emissions with itself: it needs to do so in cooperation with other industries. Of course, air travel has increased over the years, as it is no longer restricted to just the middle classes and the rich. For example, in the UK alone, 30 million people – i.e. half the population – travel by air at least once a year. These people all welcomed the European initiatives that encouraged low-cost airlines and forced the major carriers to reduce their fares. Thus the European public do not support the aim of some colleagues in the House to outlaw low-cost budget airlines or force them out of business. This same public, though, is concerned about climate change. They want a fair and sensible taxation system and measures that must be taken in cooperation between government and industry. All these measures must be considered in relation to the needs and wishes of these consumers in a way that ensures that environmental concern is at the very top of the agenda.
 Robert Evans, Mary Honeyball and Linda McAvan (PSE
),  
in writing
.  Labour MEPs fully support action to combat the climate change impact of aviation. We support the principle of inclusion of aviation emissions in the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and ask the Commission to come forward with workable proposals. We abstained on some paragraphs in this report which were contradictory or whose implications have not been fully costed or worked out.

 I should like to correct you, Madam President. You said that the question concerns the ‘problem’ of Montenegro. I believe it is a challenge rather than a problem. I am delighted to hear the Commissioner say that the Commission is considering opening an office in Podgorica. I welcome that initiative very much. Does he feel that this would be helpful in promoting tourism in Montenegro? I believe that the Adriatic coastline there offers great opportunities. He spoke about possible membership of the European Union. Has he any idea of the timescale? What sort of period would he like to see before an application for EU membership came from Montenegro?
 Robert Evans (PSE
). – 
 Thank you very much, Commissioner, for that comprehensive reply. If should just add that – as you are probably aware – if you pay by credit card for something in a shop or for a room in a hotel, that information cannot be used retrospectively, with more charges being added on. However, this does seem to happen in the car hire industry. There are many companies who also charge people for damage that has not occurred or is very minor. This is an industry that affects Europeans who are travelling around Europe, so I very much welcome your commitment to look again at the consumer directives, distance selling, unfair aggressive practices, and hope very much that my colleagues and I can work with you, introduce amendments and address the current car hire situation

 Mr President, I think we need to be positive. Mr Posselt, who spoke just a moment ago, was far too negative. We should echo what Mr Mulder said and look on the events of the last few weeks as a turn for the better. We in the European Parliament and the EU as a whole must do all we can to support the moves towards democracy. As the resolution says, we must continue to highlight minority rights, and, as we did this morning, we should vote so as to support the ideas in the Howitt report. We should support the government to make certain there is democratic control of the military, and reinforce the call made by my colleague, Mrs Gill, for lasting peace. If this is to be successful, we in the European Parliament must do everything we can to address the root causes of the conflict in Nepal and ensure that there is much greater economic prosperity and much better redistribution of wealth throughout Nepal. That would be positive and could be the route to lasting success.

 Mr President, this joint resolution contains many points and I, like others, support some and have reservations about others. We all condemn the violence taking place in Sri Lanka and we all bemoan the loss of life. We have highlighted the points we have in common and, having worked on a joint resolution, I really regret the inflammatory remarks made a few minutes ago by Mr Van Orden, who seems to have made a ‘hit-and-run’ contribution and left the Chamber. It shows a fundamental misunderstanding not just of the process in this House but also of the severity of the situation and of the way forward. Mrs Lynne highlighted a couple of points that need to be re-emphasised, for instance, for a peace process to be successful, all parties have to be involved in it. Perhaps we were wrong to talk in the resolution only of the LTTE and the government, when there are plenty of other organisations. There have been too many unexplained deaths in Sri Lanka, whether it was that of Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar or the Tamil MP Joseph Pararajasingham, both of whom I and others had met and both of whom had been present in this Chamber. We hear about many deaths, but too many go unreported. We must give full support to the peace process, but we must recognise, as Mr Pflüger and others have said, that unfortunately, in a civil conflict like this, a lot of people are involved. We need them all around the table and we cannot apportion blame beforehand. Paragraph 17 on prescription will have a serious and negative impact on the process.

 I thank the Council for that very comprehensive response. I am still amazed that the situation is allowed to continue. Liechtenstein must be a drain on Austria in the way it flouts the system so close by. I am amazed that the larger EU states allow these anomalies to continue outside the EU but within the wider area. These states are extremely dependent on our benevolence. Andorra uses the euro, the Channel Islands use the pound sterling, but they pick and choose which laws they want to follow. They exploit loopholes that the EU allows, and we continue to allow that and enable a few rich people to exploit the system, making a mockery of our EU regulations. Despite everything the President-in-Office has said, I still think it is amazing that we allow these anomalies to continue. I would have thought there is a need for even more action than he has just spoken about.
 Robert Evans (PSE

 Mr President, in his opening remarks Mr van den Berg – and indeed others – picked up on the huge amounts of money we are talking about. In this Parliament we have to be realistic about what we can do. The report looks at some of the aspects where we can make a difference. I would like to concentrate on the role of parliaments. The European Parliament has well-established links with parliaments in many of the countries around the world, the countries with which we are concerned. Sometimes parliaments are the problem. I accept that. But in others, as the previous speaker has mentioned, national parliaments can be excluded; they can be bypassed in the process and corrupt officials can get hold of the aid without the involvement of government. Therefore, I believe we should do more to support democratically elected governments and help them to reinforce the mechanisms in their countries for distributing the aid and making sure that the money donated is widely used. Mr Ryan referred to a very interesting point in the report: that there is evidence that corruption falls as the proportion of parliamentary seats held by women rises. We can encourage that. We can do more in democracies to make sure that more and more women are elected. I was very proud to be part of the European Parliament’s delegation to Afghanistan to support their first parliamentary elections. There we saw women voting to elect other women. The more we can do to help women and parliaments to develop, the better.

 With enormous respect to the President-in-Office, I have to say that answer was very inadequate, because all he did was repeat the European Court of Justice ruling, of which I am fully aware. We have had this, but still airlines are avoiding payment. I have a file full of casework on airlines which are not paying compensation that people are clearly entitled to. You said the Council is looking closely at this, but that does not help. As I asked in the question, what is the Council doing or what action is it considering to ensure that the decision is enforced and that consumers are helped and receive the rights to which they are clearly entitled, as proven by the ECJ ruling?

 Mr President, I am sure everyone appreciates that we are at a very crucial time, with the peace talks due to start next week. I may be the only person here who has seen at first hand the damage that has been done by the war in the north and east of Sri Lanka: the devastation to property and lives; the real suffering – of the Tamil people in particular – and the dreadful attacks on Colombo, Kandi and other places in Sri Lanka. The deaths of many leading figures and ordinary people have gone without investigation. The tragedy and misery have been compounded by last year’s tsunami. Now there is a real chance to restart. I hope that all those involved in the peace talks will appreciate how important these are, recognise their responsibilities and be prepared to compromise and not look for recriminations. Nobody in Sri Lanka would benefit from a return to conflict. Personally I regret the absence of representatives of the Muslims, Buddhists and Colonel Karuna’s forces there, which I believe will make things more difficult. The ban on the LTTE people travelling to the European Union makes it rather anomalous that we have to have these talks in either Geneva or Norway. Nevertheless, we in the European Parliament should do everything we can, with the Commission and the Council, to assist, not hinder, the negotiations. I wish them well.

 Thank you, Commissioner. Can I push you a bit further on that last point you made, because up until then I was a little disappointed with what you were saying in implying that the legislation was already there. I could give you any number of examples about which I am concerned, but I shall give you just one. Nestlé ‘Cheerios’ is a breakfast cereal which has 21% sugar and a great deal of salt. They produce their own colouring book and encourage children to eat more and more of this product according to how much they are colouring in. The EU already legislates, as you outlined in your remarks, but you also implied that this legislation was the basis that could be used. If no new legislation is necessary, can I urge you to look again at the existing measures and self-regulation – which I am not at all certain is accurate – and see whether they are working or whether they need strengthening?

 Mr President, I would like to thank my colleagues for that very warm endorsement of my report, which marks a major step forward in the rights of disabled people and passengers of reduced mobility. It is a tremendous vote in favour. It was interesting that there were six people who decided to vote against it, but through the joys and wonders of technology we were able to name and shame them. I am sure the House will welcome the fact that the way Parliament voted means we will be able to get an agreement at first reading. All 25 governments and the Commission have indicated that they will accept all the amendments Parliament has passed. In thanking colleagues, allow me to mention that people will also welcome the fact that this is a major achievement under the British Presidency. (Applause)

 Mr President, I should just like to make a point about linguistics, something that colleagues will be interested in. The word ‘transportation’ is an American word; the English word is ‘transport’. Bearing in mind the nature of the report, we ought to have it in English. (Laughter and applause)

 Mr President, I first visited Romania for a skiing trip during the Christmas/New Year period in 1989. The Romanian flags being waved then had holes where the symbol was cut out in the middle. Sixteen years on, we have Mr Moscovici’s report which shows quite amazing achievements and huge progress. I speak now as one who has been a Member of the EU-Romania Joint Parliamentary Committee since 1994 and who has visited many times, seeing the significant advances, particularly in the fields of freedom of expression, justice, minorities and children. What we are talking about is reuniting the people of Europe. People who share a common culture, a common heritage, a common history and who have great linguistic links. Romania is European in every sense; its mere name gives that away. I look forward to the day when Romanian colleagues are in this Chamber as elected Members of this European Parliament. (Applause)

 Madam President, I am very pleased to be able to present my report to Parliament tonight, the first major piece of disability legislation for air travellers. I should like sincerely to thank the shadows, the Parliament and Group staff, my own staff, the Commission, the various disabled organisations and aviation groups with which I have been privileged to work and the UK Presidency, without whose sterling efforts my anticipated historic first reading agreement would not have been possible. Too many people – the elderly or those with disabilities – complain of being neglected or, worse still, maltreated at Europe’s airports. Fundamental rights for disabled passengers when travelling by air ought to be something we take for granted. However, the reality can be very different. One example is Ryanair and the insulting manner in which it treats disabled passengers. It is probably the best-publicised culprit, but there are plenty of others and not just the low-cost carriers. Madam President, you and I were speaking recently about your issues with Lufthansa; I have had other issues with Iberia, to name but two. Only yesterday, on my flight to Strasbourg, Air France blamed the one disabled passenger for the one-hour delay in boarding people. Of course, against this, as Mr Twigg has said, many people’s experiences are positive, and many airlines and airports offer a good service. However, it was against a background of complaints and a service which can at best be described as patchy that, earlier this year, as the Commissioner said, his Commission presented proposals for improving the rights of persons of reduced mobility, to which, despite some opposition early on, I am very pleased we have now been able to add disabled people. During its passage through the European Parliament I have also been pleased to be able to present other improvements. Most importantly, ensuring that the proposal is for a seamless service for passengers, from any point of arrival at any of the airports in the European Union, to destinations – including transfers, which are often the most traumatic experiences for people. At my suggestion, the committee also amended the Commission text to give airports the overall responsibility for ensuring an efficient and effective service with, as Mr Twigg again mentioned, the ability to contract it out if they so wish. I am also very pleased to be able to amend the proposal to allow guide dogs or service dogs on long-haul flights, because I am advised that the owners of those dogs are in the best position to judge how long a flight the animal can cope with. In the report we also requested that planes and airports be better designed in consultation with disabled people’s organisations and that the airport and airline staff be given real disability awareness training. In addition, I think there is a real need for reservation systems, including websites, to be much more user-friendly and effective. The aim is to ensure that people with reduced mobility and disabled passengers enjoy the same rights when travelling by air as you or I, without incurring any additional costs – the costs being spread across every passenger handled by the air carrier and included in the price of the ticket. Airline statistics suggest that up to ten million passengers in this category are assisted at Europe’s airports every year. Therefore, it is essential that the guidelines are clear and agreed at European level. It would be pointless if one or a few of the 25 EU Member States had good legislation and the others had poor legislation or none at all. Travelling by air is now almost as common as travelling by car, with up to half the population expecting to fly at least once a year. Without this sort of watertight legislation, some airlines will look for loopholes to avoid providing for disabled people and those who need a little extra help at busy airports where the distance from check-in to the boarding gate can be up to a kilometre. Many airlines have made improvements under a voluntary agreement. However, without proper legislation, there will always be some who, by negligence or indifference, ruin the holidays or trips of vulnerable people. I hope colleagues will support this proposal, because it is long overdue. It is much anticipated and, above all, it is a good news and positive European story. I repeat my thanks for the incredible endeavour of the UK Presidency, because I know the vast amount of time and effort that has been put into it. I thank the President-in-Office warmly for his presence here tonight at nearly 10.10 p.m. All 25 EU governments and all the major parties in the European Parliament are in support of this package that will be presented. We should be very proud when we vote on this report on Thursday and achieve, as I hope and expect, an agreement at first reading.
 Robert Evans (PSE
). – 
 Mr President, the Commissioner spoke earlier on about our international obligations. I would argue that the so-called international agreement is at best ambiguous. I am no legal expert, but the Commission must agree that there are serious legal inconsistencies between this proposal and other EU policies, to which both Mrs McAvan and Mr Blokland, from different starting points, have drawn attention. Mr Maaten mentioned the Habitats Directive. However, there is also the protection of laboratory animals in research. These and others are serious and sound policies for the protection of wildlife and animals that are sadly used in laboratories. This is an important subject; it cannot be left merely to the luck of the toss. Air in the atmosphere and the air we breathe is rightly considered a subject necessary for environmental legislation at EU level. I would say to the previous speaker, Mr Fjellner, that this proposal falls into the same category of being important and necessary, but at the moment it fails to take account of many previous decisions. As Mr Schnellhardt noted, we have to work with other countries in the world – the United States, Canada and Russia. However, for our own credibility, I would argue that we can do better than this and we have to do so. I commend the rapporteur for her work and, speaking on behalf of this Parliament’s Intergroup on Animal Welfare, I too call for withdrawal of this proposal, because, sadly, it will do nothing for the welfare of animals. In the light of what the Commissioner has heard tonight, I suggest that to avoid humiliation tomorrow, he withdraws it before it is put to the vote in plenary.
 Robert Evans (PSE
). – 
 Mr President, I believe that this is a good agreement. It achieves most of what the committee wanted. It is also a good-news story, as Mr Twigg and Mr Smith said. It shows the strength of the EU acting together, acting to protect the consumer and, as has been emphasised by several people, acting with speed. Sometimes, however, there will still be differences between Member States. Airlines use different aircraft and different crews to fly to particular parts of the world. These variations will mean that standards vary. Indeed, opinion as to safety itself can vary, but this report sets benchmark standards. I hope and believe that this is not the end of the matter. I expect that some countries will want to go further and set higher standards and that this will push standards even higher to protect consumers. More and more people are flying. I am told that some 30 million people in the UK – half the population – fly at least once a year. With the increasing use of the internet, they may not be aware of the carrier that they are allocated. They may book with company A and find that it is actually company B operating the flight. If company B is blacklisted for safety reasons, then, as Mr Jarzembowski said earlier on, they will have the possibility of not flying. No one at all, I suggest, will board a plane if it has been blacklisted. They will have the option and they will not take the option of getting on a plane that has been blacklisted. That will push up standards; it will improve things for consumers; it is a good-news story. I congratulate the rapporteur. We should be talking about it and explaining it, but not at eleven o’clock at night!

 Madam President, last month’s elections in Afghanistan were an important milestone and I echo the tributes paid to Mrs Bonino and her colleagues for all the work they did. After all, these were the first parliamentary elections to be held there since 1979. The turnout, greater than 50%, compares favourably with other electoral contests around the world. There were problems, but those – not necessarily in this House – who want to criticise need to remember the starting point, and the Commissioner’s words ‘chaos’ and ‘devastation’ really summed it up. Whilst Afghanistan may now still be far from perfect, it has come a long way. We, as an election observation team, were very proud to witness not just women coming to the polling stations to vote – many choosing not to wear the burkha, as is their choice – but many women election officials and women standing as candidates. We know now that many women were elected. So Afghanistan, for all its problems, has come a long way. On the list, one of the first names to be announced as elected was the women’s rights activist Malalai Joya. She will be one of 62 women members in the parliament, a major achievement and unthinkable a little while back. Some of them were elected in their own right, and some of them by virtue of the ‘25% women’ rule. However, some of the ghosts of Afghanistan’s brutal past have re-emerged as other results have trickled in. When we were there observing the elections, President Karzai explained to us his choice, or the
 choice, of electoral system – to which the Commissioner has also referred – based on a single non-transferable vote. This entails no public political party support on the ballot papers but presents the voters with a list of quite literally hundreds of names from which to choose. Hidden in those lists of names are people who could best be described as having less than satisfactory records, some implicated by human rights groups in war crimes. Former Taliban governor Mawlawi Mohammadi, who, if not personally responsible, at least oversaw the destruction of the Buddha statues, was elected in one province on less than 10% of the vote, which arguably is a flaw in the system. Mullah Raketi, commander of a Taliban military unit, was elected in another. So the task now facing President Karzai is not an easy one. It is to help those disparate forces form a useful, workable and effective legislative body. One of the challenges facing them, but a vital one, is to address the country’s serious drug problem, to which the Commissioner again referred. The army, the police and the law enforcement agencies need to work together with all the international bodies to look at alternatives for the poppy growers. Another is to address the frightening availability of weapons, which was very visible to us in Kabul and around Afghanistan. Last year, the Dutch Presidency made much of its plans for supporting and helping Afghanistan. These plans must not be forgotten. The Election Observation Mission of which I was proud to be part must be part of a longer, deeper process of support for Afghanistan.
 Robert Evans (PSE

 Thank you very much for that answer. Like you, I am very familiar with the ruling of the 2001 Council, to which you referred at great length. However, putting that to one side. Would you consider personally that it is a matter of concern that international banks are making huge amounts of profit at what is now the touch of a computer button for people transferring money within the internal market?
 Robert Evans (PSE

draftsman
. – Mr President, I do not want to say very much about this report other than to echo some of the remarks that have been made by the rapporteur. Since the break-up of the Soviet Union, the South Caucasus countries have clearly been through a very difficult period and some of them are making better progress than others. I think we all want to see the human rights situation improved. There are a number of internal conflict situations that are causing considerable concern and I think that we in this Parliament should be adding our support to the President and to the authorities in Azerbaijan. My Group will be supporting the first, but not the second, part of the Verts/Ale Group amendment after recital J. However, I urge all colleagues to give their support to this resolution and we should do what we can to assist the people of Azerbaijan.
 Robert Evans (PSE

 Mr President, this is a question for you. You will be aware that over the last few part-sessions in Strasbourg there have been any number of serious problems with flights to and from Strasbourg airport. You are not listening but never mind, I shall carry on. Strikes, diversions, cancellations and all sorts of other reasons have meant that MEPs have been seriously delayed or diverted. As the City of Strasbourg and the French aviation authorities seem incapable of providing a consistent or reliable service to this great city, and in view of the clear wish of both Members of the European Parliament and the peoples of Europe that we do not waste any more of their money, is it not time seriously to consider once and for all the future of the monthly plenary sessions held in Strasbourg? This afternoon I am asking you personally what your proposals for action in this field are, both in the short term and in the long term, or is it perhaps a question you prefer to avoid?
 Robert Evans (PSE
). 
 –
 Thank you for that response, even if it was not quite the one I wanted. Surely, this is not a matter that needs 25 countries to act individually; it is a very serious issue. Our relations with the United States are not just about trade and businesses making money and, equally, this is not just a United States issue, nor one solely concerning American citizens, as there are a good number of Europeans teaching at these American institutions. Now I understand that the provost of Columbia University in New York has issued instructions on how he would like graduate teachers dealt with and punished. I would say to the presidency, in solidarity and in defence of international labour law, that we should not remain silent on this and we should not just stand aside and allow a flagrant abuse of workers’ rights. Although this is happening in the United States, it could also be affecting European citizens. I would urge him to go back and see what more can be done.
 Robert Evans (PSE
). 
 –
 Thank you for that response. You indicated that this might be ready by August, which misses this year’s summer holiday period. I think you will agree with me that most European people expect support if the airline goes bankrupt and they appear to be stranded. They imagine – or believe – that they will be supported and that the airlines will give them assistance. They think that they are supported by their travel insurance, when in fact most of them are not; they think that if they have used a credit card to book it or have done so on the Internet, they are covered, but, again, they are not. Do you feel that the Commission ought to do some sort of publicity drive in advance of this summer holiday period to encourage people to have proper insurance? If they are not covered, and an airline goes bankrupt, they will be put in a dire situation. People expect more of the airlines than they are apparently getting at the moment.
 Evans, Robert (PSE

 –
 I would like to thank the President-in-Office for that response, and very wholesome it was too. May I draw your attention to the last point, where I refer to the power of the oil industry, which to my mind tends to ride roughshod over governments and strangle new initiatives in this field. I wonder whether you agree with me, either personally or in your capacity as President-in-Office, that if similar investments had been made in alternative energy sources, funded by the oil industry, then we might have made the sort of substantial progress that Council is now making. Do you think we should put pressure on the oil companies to reduce our dependence on the world's diminishing supplies of fossil fuel?
 Evans, Robert (PSE
). 
 – Mr President, like my colleague, Mr David Martin, I found this to be a difficult vote. I voted against this resolution with a heavy heart but I did so for practical and sensible reasons. I was very disappointed by the Commissioner's lacklustre explanation and her rationale for rejecting Parliament's amendments. They were amendments that would have moved the vote in the right direction. Nevertheless, I believe that the proposal was a flawed gesture from the EU and not the sort of aid we should be intent on sending. I was in the north and east of Sri Lanka recently. I saw at first hand the devastation. I saw boats ruined and lives devastated, but I saw nothing to make me believe that discarded, old, unwanted European vessels would be of use to them. Nor can I believe it is economic to try to transfer them: a few hundred boats to replace thousands that were lost. The people of Sri Lanka and elsewhere in South Asia need real help. Eight-and-a-half weeks on from 26 December, here we are offering a few clapped-out boats. I believe in real aid; helping the people to rebuild their lives themselves. Give them the tools to build their own boats, suitable vessels. Lend them the labour, by all means. Help them make nets for continued fishing and everything else that they need. At the moment that aid is not getting through in the way that it should. We should not be in the business of just making gestures, however well-meaning they are.

 Mr President, on several occasions there have been lengthy discussions with both the Dutch and the Luxembourg presidencies and an informal trialogue to reach an informal agreement within the procedure under Article 251 of the Treaty. I am a little surprised, therefore, that the ALDE Group, having been involved in this, have asked for a split vote. If we do not vote in accordance with the block compromise we would be unpicking everything that had been agreed, or the basis of the agreement, in the compromise. So I urge people to go for the block compromise and support the first two parts in its entirety.
 Evans, Robert (PSE
). 
 –
 Mr President-in-Office, I am referring to places such as the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and others – places that are hardly independent countries or, if they claim to be so, they still rely entirely on the goodwill of the European Union for their continued existence. In spite of that these places are not subject to all European Union standards. They are exempt from legislation, even money laundering legislation, and they are duty-free tax havens. Is it not time that we addressed this situation? Surely a genuine free market has no loopholes.
 Evans, Robert (PSE
). 
 –
 Mr President, I also wish to thank the rapporteur and the Commissioner for his interesting remarks. This is, as others have said, an important piece of legislation for maritime safety and for forcing ships to act responsibly. As Mr Piecyk, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, Mr Papadimoulis and others have said, most oil pollution does not come from the disasters which get the headlines, but from deliberate discharges. It is vital that we combat these illegal acts together in a vigorous way, and this compromise is a positive step forward. Cooperation on European issues to counter criminality or carelessness is important and I yield to no one in my determination to do all that we can to prevent pollution and protect the environment. We will also achieve far more if we work together as a European Union rather than as individual countries. Therefore, as Mr Blokland has said, we will await the feasibility study on the issue of a European coastguard with great interest. At present, as I understand it, the functions of national coastguards vary considerably from country to country. Some are concerned with border protection and countering illegal immigration; others to counter pollution along the lines we have described. In some countries their responsibilities include search-and-rescue operations, which might be the responsibility of the military in others. From the UK's point of view, its coastguard functions include search-and-rescue and its borderline of responsibility, the zone, abuts those of the United States and Canada. Therefore the area of responsibility for UK coastguards is somewhat larger than that of some of the other countries. I therefore look forward to this feasibility study with interest. We can reflect on this after the report has been adopted tomorrow and then move forward.

 Mr President, my report amends the current legislation on the recognition of seafarers' certificates, making the legislation more appropriate and ironing out the anomalies that currently exist. I had a number of meetings about the report with the Commission, the Netherlands and Luxembourg presidencies, Parliament's Secretariat, the United Kingdom Government and my colleagues, and I am grateful to everyone for their contributions. I can confirm that the Council has given me an understanding, in accordance with Article 251 of the Treaty, that if we vote according to plan tomorrow, we can adopt this without further ado. The starting point of this legislation is safety. The safety and security of seafarers is important not just for those involved in the industry, but also for consumers, whether they are travellers on ships or buy the products of the sea. As the Commissioner said, the maritime industry is in general decline. Going to sea is no longer the attractive career that it might have been. The decline of the shipping and fishing industries means that wages are usually low and opportunities are few. Against this there will still always be a demand for travel by sea, both for industry and passengers. In spite of diminishing fish stocks in the waters, there will always be a demand for fish. Therefore the industry will always need workers. However, as Mr Barrot has said, there is a shortage of workers at the moment. As countries and companies strive to balance supply and demand with regard to ship crews, the role of the European Union becomes more important. We need to provide for a common European system of freedom of movement. The current lack of availability of local staff means there is a vacuum which, as in other industries, will be filled by migrant labour. These workers need protection and standards that are equal to those enjoyed by existing workers. My report is a timely measure, updating the existing European directive that dates from 2001. It aims to reduce the current administrative burden, combat discrimination and promote the mobility of workers in the maritime sector. European rules should, as far as possible, be in line with existing international agreements. In this case, the Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers Convention gets rid of European red tape. This has been an important point and one that the trialogue has shared as a joint objective, which is how we have been able to reach this informal agreement before the debate. The training and certification requirements for seafarers are laid down by the International Maritime Organization, which also contains agreements on the recognition of certificates. At the moment, the system of recognition for certificates from third countries has been simplified, which leads to a rather unsatisfactory situation in which it is easier and simpler to get recognition for certificates from outside the European Union than it is to get recognition for certificates from within the European Union. This is discriminatory, restricts the free movement of seafarers and is an anomaly which needs to be removed, especially as we are dealing with a diminishing number of workers. I would like to stress, however, that the mere possession of a certificate of any sort does not in itself give a guarantee of employment, no more than a driving licence gives you the right to a job as a driver. On language proficiency, which has been a thorny issue, we have agreed that a satisfactory command of language is necessary. In this case, English is the language involved. This will also apply to workers from third countries who might be affected by accidents if no provision for language proficiency was established. The prevention of fraud is a very important issue. All 25 Member States will be required to pursue their efforts in the context of the IMO towards the worldwide combating of fraud so as to ensure that safety standards are as high as possible. It is beholden on all of us to get our own fleets and regulatory processes in order, to ensure high standards throughout the IMO. Finally, my report states that the Commission should prepare an evaluation report after five years. We heard in an earlier report of shipwrecks off the European coast, and the European Parliament has repeatedly put safety at the top of its agenda. We will be setting high standards on safety, high standards for workers and for certification. I am sure my colleagues will be able to support this report in the vote tomorrow.

 I would like to thank the President-in-Office for an extremely comprehensive reply to my question. He referred to the Kok report, as I do in my question, but the report further recommended – as he will probably be aware – establishing a European research council, rather on the lines of the National Science Foundation in America. This would be an independent body, run by scientists and academics and providing grants for science, engineering and social sciences. It is something which might need funding of about EUR 2 billion a year. Will the Council be considering this at the meeting to which he referred in March? Does he personally think it is a good idea? And, if so, will he put his personal commitment behind it to persuade his colleagues in the 24 other countries that this is an idea worth pursuing.
 Evans, Robert (PSE

 I thank the Commissioner for giving me information on the ILO and various other organisations and activity which is already in the public domain. I wonder whether the Commission is actually considering a more positive agenda with regard to companies who are making profits out of this at the moment, by perhaps insisting that unless European companies – and do not forget that Europeans and North Americans consume most of these cocoa products – can give a guarantee that they are not making their products and profits on the back of child labour, then they cannot import them into Europe. Has the Commission considered that and will the Commission consider it?

 Mr President, I very much agree with Commissioner Nielson that 2003 was a sad year for EU-Cuba relations, and one of lost opportunities. I was in Cuba recently with colleagues on an ad hoc delegation. I saw for myself the enormous potential of that country – a potential unrealised at present as a result, among other things, of the US sanctions and the current situation with the European Union. I also agree with Commissioner Nielson that we need a constructive EU policy towards Cuba. Others in this House do not seem to have been listening. Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra is not listening to me now, but he said a few moments ago that we should stand firm in demanding freedom. Mrs Malmström said that the Cubans have a right to democracy. Do they believe that people on this side of the House do not believe in human rights? They were not listening to Mr Martinez earlier on. We have made it clear that we do believe in human rights. No one in this House has ever defended the death penalty. However, we have to be realistic. After 45 years, changes will not come quickly. Some people in this House will also argue that we should never talk to political opponents if we disagree fundamentally with their political and military tactics. Where has that ever got anyone? Can anyone think of an example where that has improved the situation? I think that some people have a fairly naive understanding of democracy and the way things work. I could respond to Mr Tannock's rather pathetic remarks, but it belittles this debate to bring in all sorts of other issues when we are talking about Cuba. I would remind Mr Tannock and others, when they are looking for parallels or examples around the world, that in different circumstances the UK Government never got anywhere with the Irish situation until we were prepared to enter into very difficult negotiations with our political opponents, people with whom we disagreed fundamentally. That is the only way we are going to achieve peace in the Middle East. We have to have dialogue in countries like Cuba. That is why I would argue that we need an exchange of ideas in order to promote change. The present EU policy, founded on the issue of who is invited to summer parties – or not – does not help Cuba or Europe, and needs to be changed. I urge Members to think very carefully and support a sensible and realistic compromise text that will move the EU forward, will help Cuba and will help the world.

 Mr President, in your opening remarks you mentioned anniversaries. Before we gather again in Strasbourg there will be another anniversary. On 3 December, it will be 20 years since the Bhopal disaster in India. The death toll from that tragedy – more than 20 000 – is still rising at the rate of one every day. Over 120 000 people were injured, and the survivors and the children born since then are still suffering appalling injuries, symptoms and disabilities. However, for the last 13 years, Dow Chemicals – the American owners of the Union Carbide factory – have ignored a summons to face charges of culpable homicide in the Indian courts. Compensation has been pitiful, responsibility accepted negligible. I hope you, Mr President, and colleagues here in this Parliament will support all measures to get justice and real help for the victims.

May I thank the Council for its very brief response, though I had been hoping for a little more. The floods in Bangladesh, and I have seen them, come nearly every year, but this year have caused some USD 2.2 billion damage. This is a huge amount of flood damage: the European Union has very kindly sent EUR 4 million in aid. I know that the Netherlands, with its long experience of beating back floodwaters at home, already supports considerable projects in Bangladesh, but I wonder what more can be done in the future. Some 36 million people have been flooded, which is more than the population of the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark and Ireland put together. Flooding in the Low Countries of Europe is not permitted to get out of hand: the Dutch Government has made great efforts to fight back. They do a great deal already in Bangladesh, but I wondered if we could know a bit more of what the plans are for the future.

 I was quite alarmed by the implications of this question and, indeed, by the contribution we heard from the other side of the House. The honourable Member mentioned protecting the secular character of the European Union, and, in its response, the Council referred to the position in Turkey, where there is a separation of church and state. Nothing could further emphasise the European Union's determination to commit itself to being fully secular in nature than the accession of Turkey, a large country with a large number of Muslim people. Yes, Turkey presents challenges for the European Union. Yes, there are issues to be answered on human rights and a whole range of other aspects. But I do not believe that religion should be part of this. I, for one, welcome Turkey's accession to the European Union in the course of time.

 Mr President, I have great respect for Spain, which is one of my favourite places in Europe. However, I am concerned to learn from the Health Protection Agency that out of 6000 salmonella cases in the United Kingdom, the majority can be traced back to eggs from Spain. I am not sure whether experience in the egg industry features on your lengthy CV, but I wonder whether I could urge, through you, that cooperation take place between the Spanish authorities and the Commission to try and resolve the situation, so as to avoid people calling for a ban on the import of Spanish eggs. I would also like to ask you, President, when the practice for this period of one–minute statements changed from a 'catch–the–eye' system to one where Members have to put down their names in advance. In the past, the President could use his or her discretion: for example, you, Mr President, could have chosen to limit the number of right-wing Catholics that you wished to allow to speak, thus giving a better balance. When did the system change from catch–the–eye to putting down names?

 Mr President, in order not to interrupt the flow of the vote once you start, I would like to inform the House that the Socialist Group is withdrawing the third part of Amendment 62, that is the part concerning points b and c of Article 2(1).

 Madam President, we were originally promised a full-blown employment summit this week but, instead, what we have is a half-day troika. What a dreadful message that sends to European citizens, who are joining unemployment queues at an alarming rate! What a negative message it sends to the many more who are in fear of losing their jobs! Projections show that by 2010 up to 27 million could be unemployed in the EU, and I fear it could be even worse. I very much hope the June Summit will devote at least one full day to looking at how we respond to this challenge. Instead of pretending that the answer lies only at national level, we need strong, coherent, European-wide responses, coordinating actions at the European, national and regional levels. We need urgent action to retain viable jobs wherever possible. Lay-offs should be a last resort: intelligent work-sharing and reskilling should be used instead. We need to invest to create smart green jobs in the knowledge-driven, low-carbon economy. We need to invest to give workers the skills to work in that new economy. We need strong, active labour market policies to quickly reintegrate workers laid off and we need strong and viable social protection systems to support those who find themselves unemployed through no fault of their own. That is more than enough to fill a full day at the June Summit. This half-day troika is a pathetic response. And finally, Philip, I will miss you – a bit like a toothache! (Laughter)
 Stephen Hughes  (PSE

 Madam President, it is really bizarre that the Council should blame Parliament for the breakdown in these talks. Parliament made all the running; it made all the compromise proposals. Late in the day, the Commission came forward with a compromise proposal, but the Council did not budge one inch, so it should not blame Parliament for this breakdown. Now we have Philip Bushill-Matthews talking tonight about freedom of choice for workers – the freedom to work the hours they want. Well, Philip, look at the situation in the United Kingdom, the very Member State that has used the general opt-out the longest. According to the European Labour Force Survey, there are 3.5 million workers there working more than 48 hours per week on a regular basis. According to that same survey, 58% of them – almost 60% – say they would like to work less than 48 hours per week. 2.2 million of those 3.5 million in the UK receive no payment for that additional work they do each week. They are not crazy, but are of course being forced to work those hours, and have been put in a position where they have to work additional hours. That is the reality of the use of the opt-out.

 Madam President, we need to reject this proposal from the Commission for three clear reasons. Firstly, they argue that Regulation (EC) No 561/2006, on driving and rest time, covers everyone and therefore there is no problem excluding the self-employed. This is wrong. Driving time represents only half – on average – of the working time of a driver. Those not covered could indeed end up working 86 hours per week, every week of the year. Secondly, the hundreds of thousands of drivers driving vehicles of less than 3.5 tonnes are not covered by the Regulation. Worse still, if they are excluded from this directive there will be no limits at all on their working time. Thirdly, the Commission makes a distinction between self-employed and ‘false’ self-employed, and says it does this because you cannot inspect or control the working time of the self-employed. If that is so, how will they control the working time of the ‘false’ self-employed? This is an abdication of responsibility and an open invitation to unscrupulous employers to constantly search for new forms of ‘false’ self-employment to avoid the law. We need to reject this proposal from the Commission.

 Mr President, Nissan has announced the loss of 1 200 jobs at its Sunderland plant in my North-East England constituency. That is about a quarter of its workforce, and to that will be added an as yet unknown number of jobs in its supply chain. Nissan’s Sunderland plant is widely acknowledged as the most productive in Europe. If the plant with the highest productivity in Europe needs to lay off a quarter of its workforce, then heaven help us when this crunch fully hits the less productive. A recovery task force has been set up in my area involving all major regional actors. The measures they are planning – assisting job search, training and retraining, starting small companies, assisting self-employment – are all ideally suited for support from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. I welcome the Commission proposals to simplify that fund. It needs to be urgently simplified and mobilised on a massive scale as part of a coordinated European response to the crisis in the car industry. Only a tiny fraction of that fund was used last year. Let us not hoard it. Let us put it to work to put our people to work.

 Mr President, many people are under the misapprehension that if we adopt the position proposed by Alejandro Cercas they will not be able to work an additional hour of overtime beyond the 48-hour average each week. That, of course, is not true. We are against the opt-out in principle, because this is health and safety law, but we have proposed the 12-month averaging of working time rather than the four-month current averaging period. This gives phenomenal flexibility for individuals and firms in the planning of working time. In fact, so much flexibility that the Council itself looked to put in a fixed limit of 60 or 65 hours per week, depending on the averaging period. We did not do that. The amount of flexibility included here is far better than the use of the opt-out; it is a far better choice for firms and for individuals. I hope that message goes out very strongly from this debate.

 Mr President, first of all, many thanks to the rapporteur. Though the amendments voted through committee were not what he wanted – in fact he wanted no amendments – he nevertheless defended the committee position in the negotiations which led to this first-reading agreement. Many thanks also to Mr Cremers, our shadow rapporteur, who was the real architect of the content of the agreement. The three additions to the points agreed by the social partners in their advice note – on sanctions, on transnationality and the removal of the threshold for the special negotiating body – are important in themselves, but many of us, as has been said, still feel cheated by this recasting. We were promised a full revision of the directive almost 10 years ago. Other serious deficiencies need to be addressed, and we insist that the Commission should bring forward that full revision during the next mandate. Another serious concern about the handling of this recasting was the crossover between the social dialogue and legislative tracks. The social partners were consulted in accordance with Article 139 and eventually signalled their inability or unwillingness to negotiate a framework agreement. But just as we began our legislative work, they did signal that they would like to open negotiations. They then agreed an advice note, which has no standing at all in the Treaties, but that gave our rapporteur, Mr Bushill-Matthews, the opportunity to pretend to be conciliatory by accepting the content of the note, but nothing more. Rather than acting as a spur to our work, that advice note almost became a straitjacket. The Article 139 and 138 procedures need to be kept clearly separated. It is wrong if either undermines or constrains the other, and it is the job of the Commission to ensure that separation. Even as we speak, a similar crossover is being allowed to derail a legislative amendment we have been calling for to address the problem of needle-stick injuries. I repeat, this is dangerous and can only lead to resentment and distrust between the social partners and Parliament. Nevertheless, this is a step forward in terms of information and consultation rights for workers, and I welcome it.

 Madam President, I congratulate Mr Andersson on an excellent report. I would like to start with a partial quote from paragraph 12 in the report. It says ‘believes that the intention of the legislator in the Posting of Workers Directive and Services Directive is incompatible with the interpretations given by the Court’. I agree with that. I was a legislator on both of those directives and never expected that they – when looked at alongside the Treaty – would lead the Court to the conclusion that the economic freedoms take precedence over fundamental rights for workers. When this sort of thing happens the legislator should act to restore legal certainty. We are a co-legislator and this resolution makes it very clear what we think needs to be done. But, Commissioner, we cannot discharge our duty as legislator until you exercise your right of initiative. I co-chair and co-convene the trade union intergroup in this place. This includes all of the main political groups and brings me into contact with many trade unionists – not only in Brussels and Strasbourg, but out in the regions – and I can tell you that there is widespread and spreading anxiety because of the imbalance thrown up by these judgments. Commissioner, this is very serious in the approach to next year’s European elections. If trade unionists out there decide that Europe is part of the problem, instead of part of the solution, that could be very damaging for all sections of this House and for the democratic process itself. I am glad to hear you say that you think the Posting of Workers Directive needs improvement, because one of the things we want is a revision of that directive to at least make it clear how collective agreements can be used to put minimum terms and conditions in place and to say how collective action can be used to protect those rights. So, Commissioner, please listen to this directly elected institution. We do have our ears to the ground. Use your right of initiative and show that you see the need to act.

 Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Špidla for the fact that we have a social package at all because, as I have said many times before, his task in the Barroso Commission cannot be easy. The package itself actually illustrates the tensions inside the Barroso Commission, between those, on the one hand, who want to stick to the neoliberal agenda come hell or high water, and those on the other who see an urgent need to make Europe matter to its citizens. Our people need to be assured that Europe is part of the solution, and not part of the problem, when it comes to tackling the issues raised by globalisation, demographic change, climate change and other global challenges. If that is what we need to do, I am sad to say that this package simply is not up to the task. It is a grudging package of too little, too late. Even the good elements are spoiled by the knowledge of just how grudgingly they were included. The horizontal directive to combat discrimination is a good example. It is in the package, but we all know just how bitterly President Barroso opposed its inclusion, right up to the 11th hour. The European works council directive proposal is another example. The content is extremely weak when compared to the earlier communication from the Commission to the social partners. I think that the neoliberal forces in the Commission and their allies here need to wake up and recognise the reality we face. Many millions of our citizens are living in fear, poverty and exclusion, and more and more have joined them during the Barroso years. All in all, I see this as a belated attempt by President Barroso to persuade the Left here that he has a social conscience, and that he is worthy of support for a second term as Commission President. Well I am not fooled, and many of my colleagues are not fooled either. As I have said, it is much too little and much too late – much too late, in fact, to guarantee safe passage of the sparse worthwhile elements before the election next year. President Barroso is insulting the intelligence not only of the Left in this House but also of the millions of citizens out there who deserve better.

 Mr President, I think Philip Bushill-Matthews’ criticism underlines just how good Elizabeth Lynne’s report is! I think she is to be congratulated. She has done a very good job of underlining the poor level of implementation and transposition of the two directives adopted back in the year 2000 on risk and discrimination in employment. But back then, Commissioner, you and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs here recognised that discrimination does not stop at the office or factory wall. We recognised then the need to act more broadly to introduce a horizontal directive to combat all forms of discrimination throughout the whole of society. You publicly stated that you supported that idea; your President, President Barroso, publicly committed himself to such a horizontal directive. We are therefore very disturbed to hear that back-pedalling is going on inside the Commission, reconsideration, perhaps a focus only on disability. I am hearing that three possible options are being considered in the Commission at the moment: the horizontal directive, which is still alive; secondly, a specific directive on disability or, the third possibility, a directive on disability and one other form of discrimination. Where the logic is in that final option I just do not know. We need a strong advocate right now, Commissioner, for that horizontal directive that you committed yourself to. As Elizabeth Lynne said, there can be no hierarchy of forms of discrimination within the European Union. All European Union citizens are equal and need to be dealt with as such. We cannot tolerate any discrimination on any grounds against any section of our Community. I heard it said at a meeting last week in Brussels, and you hinted at it yourself today, Commissioner, and Philip Bushill-Matthews did so just now, that we should not act because infringement proceedings have been launched against a number of Member States for failure to comply with the earlier directives. We cannot take that line of argument. We cannot allow Member States to force us to act at the speed of the slowest in terms of implementation and then enforcement. You, Commissioner, have the right of initiative. You need to exercise that right. We need to act rigorously. You need to act rigorously to ensure full compliance and not allow Member States to enter into a conspiracy that would cause us to move at the speed of the slowest. We also need to focus clear attention on the need for remedies and enforcement, strong remedies to make sure that Member States do indeed comply fully with those directives agreed back in the year 2000. I fully commend Elizabeth Lynne’s report.
 Stephen Hughes  (PSE

 Mr President, let me say how much I agree with Mr Brok and how much I disagree with Mr Bushill-Matthews, but I will come to that in a moment. I would like to thank the Commissioner for the recommendation adopted on 3 April. It is an important step in the right direction. I believe that the more effective exchange and access to information and the exchange of best practice will certainly help, but it was one of those strange quirks of timing that the recommendation was adopted on the same day that the Rüffert judgment was handed down. I think the Laval and Rüffert cases in particular require us to go much further than that recommendation now. Those cases raise the prospect that the economic freedoms can be interpreted as granting undertakings the right to evade or circumvent national, social and employment laws and practices. The only protection, it seems, are the provisions of the posted workers directive. If that is the case, then it is clear that we need to revisit the directive. In particular, we need to clarify the scope for collective agreements, to set mandatory standards, and for collective action to enforce those standards. I think we need to do a number of things. We need to ensure that host country collective agreements can provide for higher than minimum standards. We need to make mandatory what are currently only options for Member States, such as applying all generally binding collective agreements to posted workers. I think we also need a clear time limit for the definition of a posted worker, so that there is a clear idea of when a posted worker ceases to be a posted worker. Finally, for now, I think we need to broaden the legal base of the directive to include freedom of movement of workers, as well as the freedom to provide services. That was a proposal which was rejected back in 1996, but I hope we can see now how important it is. It is the Court that has said that the right to strike and the right of association are fundamental rights, but not as fundamental as the economic freedoms. Trade unions might be forgiven for thinking that they are suddenly living on Animal Farm. We owe it to them to restore a proper balance. I think these modest proposed changes to the posting of workers directive would be a start.

 Madam President, I would like to speak about needlestick injuries, because I was responsible for the 2006 report on this issue. I wonder whether the Commissioner would agree with me that, where a risk is identified that needs to be tackled at European level, then there is a need for the Commission to ask expeditiously. If he does agree, I wonder whether he can explain why it took a full year for the Commission to manage and assess the first round of consultation with the social partners on needlestick injuries, even though there were only 10 responses in that consultation. I wonder whether he can also assure us that work on this issue will proceed faster in the year ahead. One million workers a year are affected by needlestick injuries. That means around one and half million will have been affected since the report was completed by Parliament. Could the Commission please act a little faster in future?

 Mr President, I offer many congratulations to the rapporteur. I have four points, the first of which is to the Commission. First in its Green Paper on labour law and now in its communication on flexicurity, it puts the emphasis on employment security rather than job security. We put the emphasis on both and that is because we recognise the needs of flexible firms. A flexible firm is one that needs to change a production line every six months or IT configuration every four months and that needs an adaptable, well-qualified, loyal workforce – and you do not get that at all from a fragmented, segmented, casualised labour force. Secondly, flexicurity needs a whole range of factors in place to work properly: a good, stable macroeconomic climate, investment in good, active labour market policies, well-developed social dialogue and high-quality policies for social protection. All these elements are important, and one thing is clear: they do not come cheap. The Commission therefore has to recognise that flexicurity can only be put in place in some Member States over a considerable period of time. Thirdly, a balanced form of flexicurity needs to be built around the principles included in paragraph 15 of this report, and those principles need to be incorporated into an amended guideline package. They need to be given visibility and they need to be applied. Otherwise, all of the good work included in this excellent report will have been for nothing. Finally, both the Council and the Commission talk endlessly about the importance of flexicurity, but how can the Council be taken seriously while the directive on temporary agency work remains blocked? How can the other institutions be taken seriously while exploitative forms of atypical work continue to proliferate in all of our Member States? For too many millions of our workforce, flexicurity is all about flexibility and nothing to do with security. This report sets out ways in which that can change.
 Stephen Hughes  (PSE
). – 
 Madam President, this has been a very wide-ranging debate and at the end I would like to bring it back to a focus on social policy as a productive factor. The launch of the integrated guideline package was supposed to lead to a balanced delivery of the economic, social and sustainability strands of the Lisbon process but in practice, when it comes to the employment guidelines, it has been a case not of integration but of subordination. The employment guidelines have become virtually invisible, hiding the very wide variability in Member State performance against the range of indicators and targets they are supposed to meet under the employment strategy on youth unemployment, integration of older workers – a range of factors. In some Member States, spending on lifelong learning and active labour market measures has actually declined over the last five years – not improved but declined. That is disastrous for the Lisbon process overall. The employment strategy therefore needs to be given much greater visibility in the next Lisbon cycle. One other point – the joint resolution that we are debating here today in several places emphasises the need to deliver decent work and to focus on improving the quality of work. This focus is not helped by the Commission’s concentration on the idea of employment security as opposed to job security, which is repeated in both the Green Paper on labour law and the communication on flexicurity. In our work on flexicurity in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs we make clear that both employment security and job security are important. What a fast changing flexible firm needs – a firm changing its production line every six months, its IT configuration every four months – is an adaptable, skilled, loyal and dedicated workforce, not a casualised and fragmented labour market. So we will do our best to help produce a good set of principles on flexicurity but they must then lead to an amendment to the guidelines. President Barroso said earlier, ‘If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’. Well, it is broken and it needs fixing.

 Mr President, EURES has tremendous potential, but much of that potential has yet to be realised. It still has a number of limitations. Our question says that the portal should become a one-stop-shop for workers’ geographic and occupational mobility, but we should be honest in accepting that it has a long way to go before it could become such a thing. It should, however, be possible to build such a one-stop-shop in this advanced electronic age. Workers planning a move across the EU in pursuit of work need access to detailed and localised knowledge to give them the confidence to move with their families – detailed information right down to the level, for example, of schools to be found in a particular locality, the performance of those schools, student numbers and vacancies. The same applies to healthcare, housing and a host of other issues. The portal includes information under these headings, but it is of a very general nature and gives only a brief national snapshot. It might seem like a huge task to build detailed and localised information into the portal, but that is not necessarily the case. A lot of this detailed information already exists on the websites of local authorities, health authorities, local education authorities and government departments. Web links to these sites can be embedded in the portal to take users requiring more detailed information to those sites. Increasingly, information being made available at local level is also held in a range of languages. In my own area, for example, we have everything from information on how to register to vote to finding accommodation available in Polish and a range of other languages. Finally, that information is often held in a range of languages of third countries, which ties in with the point addressed by the Commissioner. Inward migration from third countries cannot solve the difficulties demographic change poses for the EU, but it can help. I have therefore been pleased to hear what he said about the plans to equip EURES to play an important part in that process.

 Mr President, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs would have preferred to make the full accomplishment of the postal internal market subject to a new prospective study, showing that universal service could be maintained in each Member State, and looking at how to maintain or improve the employment situation in the postal sector. However, sometimes politics is about the art of the possible, and I know my good friend Brian Simpson negotiated the best possible deal he could with the rapporteur and the other shadows in the Committee on Transport and Tourism. We are pleased at the clear emphasis placed on maintaining the provision of universal service and on the number of safeguards built into the report in the form in which it will come before this House. We are also happy about the report’s focus on the need to ensure good social and employment standards as liberalisation begins to unfold. This is an important point given that even Deutsche Post has expressed some disquiet over declining employment standards amongst some new entrants to the German postal market. We accept that this was the best achievable deal at this late stage in the liberalisation process.

 Madam President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report. The report includes a very long resolution running to 94 paragraphs, but for me its essence is summed up in two paragraphs. Recital V states that ‘in order to strengthen the competitiveness of the European Union in a socially sustainable way, it is important to improve productivity by promoting decent work and the quality of working life, including health and safety at work, a better balance between flexibility and security in employment, lifelong learning, mutual trust and participation as well as a better conciliation between private/family and working life; combating gender discrimination and all other forms of discrimination’. Paragraph 6 calls for ‘a better mobilisation of the internal and external policies of the EU on the promotion of the decent work agenda, especially in matters of development, external assistance, enlargement, neighbourhood policy, trade, migration and external bilateral and multilateral relations’. If these two paragraphs were fully implemented, the EU would have made great strides in promoting the decent work agenda, both here at home and globally. Other paragraphs of importance to me include paragraphs 46, 48 and 51, which broadly cover the need for European multinational corporations to behave in a socially responsible fashion in their global operations. These build on our earlier work on the subject. A number of paragraphs set out the need for the EU to use its trade and economic power as levers to promote the decent work agenda globally. For example, paragraph 8 calls for the full and proper implementation of GSP+, in line with the debate we promoted with Commissioner Mandelson on the subject last year. Finally, I want to highlight paragraph 47. This calls for the development of ‘a label for products that are produced under conditions that respect the principles of decent work and conform to core labour standards, and that specifically exclude any child labour input’. Let us empower European consumers to drive forward the decent work agenda in their daily choices.

 Mr President, Airbus, Alcatel, Lucent and Delphi Systems are just the latest in a never-ending stream of instances of major restructuring that have led delegations of workers to come to us complaining of breaches of EU information and consultation laws, not just the Works Council Directive, but others too: directives on collective redundancies and transfers dating from the 1970s, and the Directive establishing a General Framework for Information and Consultation of Workers. We have quite a body of information on consultation laws, but the inconsistencies and contradictions between them and the loopholes in them mean that they are often avoided altogether. There is often no attempt at meaningful information or consultation in good time in avoiding or mitigating job losses. We urgently need a clear definition of the concepts of information and consultation in EU law. We have different definitions in several different directives. The Works Council Directive does not define either notion clearly, while the later directives on a company statute and the general framework have different definitions. This is an open door to abuse and avoidance. The need for a revision to the Works Council Directive is now glaringly obvious: it was due for revision eight years ago. The deficiencies and loopholes are well known: failure to provide timely information and consultation, to fully recognise the role of trade unions, to provide expert support, the inadequacy of sanctions, the misuse of confidentiality rules to withhold information and so on. These deficiencies must now be addressed to give workers the effective tools they need. I know there is a view that a revision should not be launched because we might end up with a weaker, not a stronger, instrument. The view of my group is that the avoidance and abuse of this legislation is now of such scale and breadth that we have nothing to lose in insisting on a revision. I urge the Commissioner to bring that provision forward as a matter of urgency.
 Stephen Hughes (PSE

 Mr President, we are delighted that there will be a statement on Wednesday evening from Commissioner Špidla on information and consultation. We would certainly like an opportunity to table a motion for a resolution to recall the often-repeated position of this Parliament: we think that the European Works Council Directive needs to be reviewed. We understand the position of our Liberal colleagues, however. They would prefer to hear what the Commissioner has to say before pinning themselves down to a resolution. We therefore request that the motion for a resolution be attached to the statement, but not voted on until the next mini-session in Brussels.

 In voting for the Giusto Catania report (A6-0052/2007
), I very much hope to see a marked improvement in international cooperation between police forces to counteract violence associated with football matches. Innocent fans and families from Middlesbrough were caught up in violence in Rome in March 2006 on the occasion of the Middlesbrough/Roma fixture during the European Cup. Three fans were stabbed during unprovoked attacks by Roma fans. Parliament’s Petitions Committee considered a petition from Middlesbrough fans last autumn. I very much regret that, a year after the violence in Rome, the chairman of the Petitions Committee has still not received a reply to a letter he sent to Italy’s Interior Minister seeking assurances that the mistakes which allowed the violence to happen would be avoided in the future. I very much hope that, even at this late stage, the Minister will take the opportunity to reply and convey a clear apology to the people of Middlesbrough.

 Mr President, in looking to the future development of Europe, the Berlin Declaration quite rightly underlines the importance of solidarity and social cohesion in a European model combining economic success and social responsibility. It reminded me of another declaration entitled ‘Enhancing Social Europe’, adopted by nine EU governments shortly before the Spring Summit this year. That declaration is aimed at rebalancing the policy mix in favour of action in the employment and social fields. In response, the Spring Summit conclusions included a clear reference to decent work, workers’ rights and participation, equal opportunities, safety and health protection at work and the need for a family-friendly organisation of work. The importance of social cohesion was also underlined and stress placed on the need to fight poverty, particularly child poverty. The importance of the social dimension was therefore highlighted in the clearest terms. The conclusions also recalled the Treaty’s social provisions, in particular its attachment to the improvement of employment and of living and working conditions. That is part of Article 136 of the Treaty, which was celebrated on Sunday and serves as a preamble to the very clear legal bases available to the Commission to make proposals to improve employment and living and working conditions. I think it is a timely reminder from Berlin and from the Spring Summit that the Commission needs to relaunch a social agenda with content because, looking at the Commission’s work programme at the moment, it seems to have forgotten that it has any legal bases to allow it to act at all. We want the Commission to respond as a matter of urgency. It could make a start by giving substance to the current game of smoke and mirrors around the subject of flexicurity. Let us have fresh legislative proposals to tackle exploitative forms of atypical work. Let us see flexicurity being given positive meaning for the millions of workers who currently see it as a cloak for exploitation. Finally, I hope the German Presidency will keep social Europe centre stage in the approach to, and beyond, the June Summit. In that way, the Berlin Declaration will retain credibility.

 Mr President, it is a very straightforward oral amendment. In the second line there is a phrase beginning ‘have made it clear that no source of energy must be left unused’. We want to insert three words so it would read, ‘have made it clear that no sustainable and safe source of energy must be left unused’.
 Stephen Hughes (PSE
). – 
 Mr President, we cannot afford to be complacent that the unemployment rate is currently reduced. The Lisbon Strategy calls for both more and better quality jobs. Currently, the concept of ‘flexicurity’ is seen as a threat by many millions of our fellow citizens. It means for them and their families ever-greater insecurity. The Commission’s proposal on the employment guidelines notes this, saying: ‘a more comprehensive approach is necessary, better combining flexibility and security’. That is often repeated, but in reality things are getting worse, not better. In its Green Paper on modernising labour law, the Commission highlights some of the issues ‘through non-standard contracts, businesses seek to remain competitive in the global economy by avoiding the cost of compliance with employment protection, notice periods and the cost of social security contributions’. That does not sound to me like the path toward competing through quality and high added value in a globalised world. The Commission also notes that fixed-term, part-time, on-call and zero-hour contracts, contracts for workers from temporary employment agencies, freelance contracts, etc. have become an established feature of European labour markets. It notes that they are on the increase, up 4% between 2001 and 2005, and show that a significant minority, round about 16%, remain trapped in a succession of short-term low-quality jobs, with inadequate social protection. Thankfully, we now have directives covering part-time and fixed-term contract workers. But those initiatives date from a time when the Commission still believed it had a role to play in establishing minimum standards, when it believed in using the legal bases available to it. But what about those other proliferating forms of insecure, low-paid, low-quality, atypical jobs? The best the Commission can do nowadays is to ask a series of rhetorical questions in its Green Paper on how to rebalance ‘flexicurity’. Well, maybe it is time the Commission returned to a social agenda with legislative content; a signal is desperately needed to the Member States.
 Stephen Hughes (PSE
). – 
 Mr President, I have only a short time, so, as both joint rapporteur on this subject and a member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I should like to do something we do not do often enough: focus on some of the social, social cohesion and employment aspects of Lisbon. Under the heading ‘Creating employment and opportunity’, our resolution underlines the need for a balanced approach to flexicurity. We agree with flexibility for enterprises, but also with the necessary degree of security for working people. For too many millions of our fellow citizens, flexicurity is seen as a threat. We have to make it an opportunity. We urge those Member States so far lacking effort to cooperate with social partners and do much more to create employment and raise the labour market participation rate of the young, female and older workers. Specifically, we ask them to ensure that every school-leaver is offered a job, training or other employability measure within six months; to provide wider access to training for the unemployed, particularly for the least-qualified; to raise investment in comprehensive and affordable childcare, to further reduce the tax burden on employment; to combat social exclusion and discrimination; to invest further in education, professional training and lifelong learning so as to boost the Union’s skills base; to improve the match between the educational system and the needs of the new labour markets, including entrepreneurship in educational curricula; and, finally, to allow older workers to remain in the labour force on a voluntary basis and modify tax and social security systems to encourage a longer active working life. These ideas are as old as the Lisbon Strategy itself. All we need is for Member States to act on them. Finally, I would also underline the need for both the Council and the Commission to break the current deadlock in employment and social policy. The current Lisbon policy mix is seriously unbalanced. If we are to reconnect with our citizens, we need to restore that balance in favour of social and employment policy.

 Mr President, I have three brief points. I am pleased to see that the Commission is looking to use the structural funds to help deal with the social implications of this dreadful development. However, questions have been raised over whether the Globalisation Adjustment Fund can be used or not. Well, I hope this week’s news that Volkswagen is to build plants in both India and Russia will show that there are global considerations and that the fund will be used to intervene. Second, I welcome news that production of the Audi A1 might move to the Forest plant to save some jobs, but the workforce has already been warned that such a move must involve a drop in labour costs. I hope this does not turn out to be a cynical move by VW, taking away with one hand and giving back with another, but in the meantime dramatically driving down wages and terms and conditions. VW should be aware that we will be watching developments very closely in the months ahead. Finally, a question to the Commissioner. If the directive creating a general framework on information and consultation and the European works council directives are in force and are being observed in Belgium, how can this news have come as a shock last week? Unless the Commission assiduously ensures the application and enforcement of social laws, social Europe will fall into total disrepute, and citizens will quite rightly turn their backs on the EU. I am glad to hear, Commissioner, that you are now taking action, but quite frankly it is a little late for the workers at Forest. Finally, I hope that the PPE-DE Group is solidly behind the Globalisation Adjustment Fund. That is not what I have been hearing. I hope we see full support in the vote two weeks from now.

 From the employment and social standpoint, I find this work programme very disappointing. Yet again we are promised little more than a raft of Green and White Papers and communications, recycling the same old material. We are about to get a Green Paper on labour law that lists questions that were put and answered ten years ago by Allan Larsson while he was the Commission’s Director-General for Employment. The communication hails flexicurity as a means of realising opportunities offered by European labour markets. In reality, it has been shown to have no positive meaning for working people. For millions flexicurity is a weasel word, a codeword for exploitation, insecurity and uncertainty. We need an EU legislative framework to tackle unfair and exploitative employment and quasi-employment relationships. All workers in all regions deserve access to decent work to give them and their families the chance of a decent life. In the meantime, social Europe is at a standstill. The last piece of EU legislation in the social field was adopted over three years ago. The Commission’s lack of ambition reflects its own imbalanced policy perspective. Better regulation means no legislation in the social field but also reflects the poor prospects for any proposal in the Employment Council. Employment ministers need to begin to play a positive role and they could start by doing something positive on working time and temporary agency work. Lisbon promised more and better quality jobs. What has been done to deliver that promise for working people? Precious little. So my message to both the Commission and Council is this: let us stop the rhetoric and start to deliver. (Applause)

 Madam President, my thanks go to Mrs Jöns for bringing this issue back before the House. This disease is not only a women’s issue, as Mr Bowis and Mrs Záborská have said. Hundreds of thousands of men, hundreds of thousands of families, are affected by the disease each year. My mother-in-law died of breast cancer and my wife’s eldest sister was diagnosed with breast cancer ten years ago, but thanks to early and successful treatment she is alive and well today. I am sure you can imagine the shadow this disease casts over me and my family. But, as we have heard, it is a particular ordeal for the 275 000 women who contract the disease each year and, tragically, the 88 000 women who die of the disease each year in the European Union, and their families. These are figures which can and must be radically reduced. We need further research into prevention. But it is particularly shocking to me that mortality rates vary by as much as 50% across the Member States and that mastectomy rates vary by up to 60%. That too is unacceptable. There is clearly a pressing need for best practice to be spread evenly across the Union into every region and that best practice needs to be built around the European guidelines for quality assurance in breast cancer screening and diagnosis. Another pressing issue is the fact that an increasing number of younger women are developing breast cancer – 47% under 55 years of age. Add to that the fact that up to 20%, a fifth of former breast cancer patients, do not return to work and it becomes clear that something needs to be done if we are to meet the Lisbon target for women’s participation in the labour market. I therefore fully commend the resolution’s call – and I am pleased to hear Commissioner Špidla respond positively to it today – to draw up a charter for the protection of the rights of breast cancer patients and currently sick people in the workplace to facilitate their reintegration into the world of work. Their working hours need to be tailored to their treatment pattern and their reabsorption into the workplace needs to be built around their rehabilitation. Five women per day are diagnosed with breast cancer in my own region. I hope that, with proper research into prevention, that figure will be reduced. I also hope that our work can come to mean that those diagnoses will not represent a death sentence; rather a diagnosis needs to become a trigger for early, sensitive, humane intervention, successful treatment and re-entry into the world of work and a full and fulfilling life.

 Mr President, I wish to congratulate both rapporteurs, who have done excellent work. Last autumn, during the British Presidency and in the run-up to the extraordinary summit at Hampton Court, members of my own government were saying two contradictory things about the idea of the European social model. On the one hand they said there was no such thing as a European social model – we have 25 different national social models – while on the other they said that if there was such a thing as a European social model then it was a continental phenomenon and a millstone around the necks of a number of Member State economies. Mr Helmer has reminded us of what Mr Blair said in this House. In fact, a number of ministers have said the same thing, and are obviously reading from the same script - i.e. do we really want a social model that throws 20 million into unemployment? If Mr Helmer was listening to the debate then he would have heard an answer to that assertion from Mr Blair, because this report nails those lies. The very first substantive paragraph underlines the point that we indeed have a European social model which reflects a common set of values based on the preservation of peace, social justice, equality, solidarity, the promotion of freedom and democracy and respect for human rights. The report makes the point that far from the model being a burden or a millstone, social policy should be seen as a positive factor in the European Union’s economic growth, not only by increasing productivity and competitiveness but also by generating social cohesion, raising living standards for citizens and ensuring access to fundamental rights and freedoms. That is absolutely correct, and if we see it in that sense, social policy becomes a productive factor – the theme of a Dutch Presidency some years ago. The report also recognises what a number of people have said, which is that there is a clear need to modernise and adapt the model to respond to the wide range of challenges we face: demographic and technological change, globalisation and so on. The rapporteurs also stress that reform and modernisation of the model must preserve and enhance the values associated with it. That is of vital importance. In Britain a number of people engage in headshaking about what they see as the over-slow progress in modernisation and reform in a number of continental European countries. What they tend to forget is the brutal, inhumane and destructive way in which reform was managed during the Thatcher years in Britain. What a number of continental countries are trying to do is to engage in that reform process through consensus, while preserving the underlying values of the European social model. That is the way to do it, and it is one I very much admire. One final point: I regret that the PPE-DE Group has tabled an amendment to paragraph 23 aimed at removing a specific reference to the need for the Commission to bring forward a framework on services of general interest. I very much hope that amendment falls, because had we had that framework the Services Directive itself would have had a far easier passage. We still need it and I hope the Commission will heed the call for it made in the report.

 Mr President, you are quite right, I was at a meeting in Luxembourg this morning and had to dash back for this vote. I am therefore grateful, in one sense, that the vote was deferred. On the other hand, however, no one could perhaps have foreseen such a catastrophic reduction in the numbers present. I will be guided by your services, but if memory serves me correctly, there is a rule by which I can request deferral of the final vote until the next voting time. If that is the case, I would like to so request. (Applause)

 Mr President, I congratulate Mr Őry on producing an excellent report. I should like to make three brief points, the first of which concerns paragraph 1. As it came out of committee, it now calls on Member States to abolish the transitional measures in force. For many that has become the main focus of the report. I know that the rapporteur has felt pressured to table a compromise saying that Member States should consider abolishing those measures and specifically mentioning the three Member States that did not introduce them in the first place. Many in my group support the text as it now stands, feeling that we should be against any continuation of transitional measures. However, in saying that, they are reading it alongside paragraph 14, which says that Member States that continue to use such measures should take all steps to ensure that they do not continue beyond 2009. My second point concerns equal treatment. The rapporteur and others here today have made the point forcefully that it is not just a question of making sure that A8 workers have the right to freedom of movement of labour, we have to ensure inspection and enforcement regimes grant them full equal treatment and prevent exploitation in the 15. There have been serious breaches in both the UK and the Republic of Ireland. My final point relates to Directive 2003/109/EC, referred to by the Commissioner. It grants full access to the Member States’ labour markets for long-term resident third-country nationals. Parliament’s Legal Service has said this poses no danger of creating a situation where third-country nationals have greater access than A8 citizens. The Legal Service points out that Article 11 of the Directive says that Member States ‘may’ restrict equal treatment for third-country nationals in certain cases. Saying that Member States ‘may’ is not the same as saying they ‘must’ or that they ‘will’. The only way to guarantee equal treatment is to end transitional measures.

 Mr President, I would like to join those who have already congratulated the rapporteur. I think he has done an excellent job of work. This directive will benefit workers exposed to risks from artificial sources of optical radiation in a wide range of working environments: everything from electric arc welders to workers using advanced industrial lasers. When I was rapporteur at first reading on this proposal well over ten years ago, the use of industrial lasers was pretty much in its infancy, but now they are very widespread and exposing workers to varying degrees of risk. It is a useful piece of legislation and again I would like to say ‘well done’ to the rapporteur. I have to say, however, that he produced good work despite, rather than because of, the help of his own group. At one time this institution took its work on health and safety subjects very seriously, but a rather worrying trend has developed in relation to recent directives. When we dealt, for example, with the directive on vibration, we were told that we must exclude whole-body vibration because – and this was used in the tabloid press – what we were trying to do was to prevent farmers from driving their tractors for more than three or four hours even at the height of the harvest, which was nonsense. When we dealt with the noise directive we were told that we must exclude music and entertainment because what we were trying to do was to force members of orchestras to wear Mickey Mouse ear protectors and that we were about to ban the use of the bagpipes in Scotland. Again nonsense, but it grabbed the tabloid headlines. In this proposal we have had a determined push by a number of Members in the rapporteur’s group and elsewhere to exclude a particular phenomenon from the scope of the directive. They pushed for that without realising that the risks arising from this phenomenon are clearly covered in the placing of clear obligations on employers by two earlier directives: the framework directive and the directive on temporary and mobile work sites. The phenomenon I am talking about is, of course, natural radiation. The rapporteur made a valiant effort and we tried to help him to give legal certainty to employers when it comes to solar radiation. They are now lacking that legal certainty and still have the full implications of the framework directive and temporary mobile work sites directive to deal with. Hopefully, common sense will prevail at Member State level, as it has so far. That would mean, for example, that a travel agency in my region could quickly discount the risk for employees working indoors in its shops in the north of England, but that it had better take very seriously the risk facing its staff acting as company representatives in Mediterranean resorts throughout the summer months. That is the difficulty now facing employers. We have not given them legal certainty. We will have a number of more difficult cases to assess for employers between those two extremes that I have given as an example. I hope that in future we can again focus on producing good, serious health and safety legislation and not on producing tabloid headlines.

 Mr President, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his work, which, of course, was not appreciated by the Committee on Transport and Tourism. I too regret the violence that we saw yesterday, but we must understand the frustration that the dockers are feeling at the moment. This is a most ill-informed proposal from the Commission. It is an absolute insult to Parliament that it was brought back in virtually the same form within 18 months of its initial rejection. It is a real insult to the only directly-elected democratic institution at European level. The Commission should have thought very carefully after that initial rejection. (Applause)
 As was the case with the Services Directive, there is some really flawed thinking at the centre of this directive. The idea of self-handling is ludicrous. It is a recipe for disaster and a health and safety nightmare. What we need in the loading and unloading of cargo is a dedicated, trained, experienced set of people, not an onboard workforce which would be exposed to the dangers of hurriedly loading and unloading cargo. Pilotage was included in this proposal. I represent Teesport in the north-east of England, which is one of the busiest ports in Europe and serves a massive chemical industrial complex. Highly volatile cargoes enter and leave that port every day. The notion that you can tender for piloting services for ships of that description in order to secure the lowest price is, again, ludicrous. It would put in danger not only the workers involved but also the entire population of my region. The Commission should have done the sensible thing: it should have revised this proposal completely before it brought it forward. I hope that it will readily withdraw it when we reject it tomorrow, as I am sure we will. (Applause)

 Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his statement. We too are in favour of the scrapping of needless or redundant laws, but we do have some concerns, partly fed by the way President Barroso came out shooting from the hip in the Financial Times
 on the subject of deregulation. The main concern for me is the persistent rumour, just repeated by Mrs Lynne, that either now or in the near future the Commission will include the withdrawal of the directive on temporary agency work. Will you agree with me, Commissioner, that if that happened it would be a major blow to attempts to balance flexibility and security and would damage the balanced pursuit of Lisbon? Can you assure us that the Commission is not considering the withdrawal of the directive on temporary agency workers?

 Mr President, I thank Mr Őry for his excellent work as rapporteur. He worked very closely with all the shadow rapporteurs, improved an already pretty good common position and produced a good draft report for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. It is only a pity that that good work was put in jeopardy by the stance taken by his own group, the PPE-DE, and a faction in the Liberal Group on one aspect of the proposal: the provisions relating to the occupational risks arising from exposure to natural radiation. Sadly, we have come to expect totally misleading and sensational press releases from the right, misrepresenting important pieces of health and safety legislation. When we worked on the issue of industrial noise, we were accused of trying to ban bagpipe playing in Scotland. Our work on the risks of whole body vibration was evidently to stop farmers from driving tractors after only three or four hours, even at the height of the harvest. Now our work on this proposal is presented as an attempt to force citizens to carry umbrellas. This is absolute nonsense. The Commissioner himself said that the original proposal envisaged a far lighter-touch approach to natural radiation than artificial sources. However, this time I sense something more than an attempt to grab cheap tabloid headlines, something more ideologically driven. I believe that those sitting behind Mr Őry and trying to undermine his work think that, with the stalling of much of Europe's social agenda, they have a chance to push for deregulation and the renationalisation of important elements of the social legal base. If that is so, then let me tell them that they should think again. We will do all we can to stop them in their tracks and continue to improve, and not undermine, worker protection. In reality, our amendments on natural radiation have nothing to do with the ridiculous stories fed to the media. We are trying to do three positive things. First, to make explicit what is already implicit in the proposal. We are not talking about expensive duties being imposed on employers. Where the employer finds a risk associated with natural radiation, information will be provided to workers. In the vast majority of modern occupational settings there will be no risk. Secondly, by taking the sentence from the Council, granting Member States a role in determining the criteria to apply to the risk assessment in the light of national circumstances, we are acknowledging the obvious fact that, as both speakers have already said, the risk from natural radiation is somewhat lower in Newcastle than it is in Naples. Thirdly, we are trying to provide greater legal certainty for employers. Although the right try to deny it, the 1999 Framework Directive clearly imposes a duty on employers to assess all occupational risks. The 1992 directive on construction sites certainly goes further and specifically mentions environmental considerations. We should use this proposal to introduce greater legal certainty. That is exactly what we are trying to do in our amendments, by seeking to highlight the provision of information to workers. We are talking about a very serious risk. According to Cancer Research UK, skin cancer is one of the most common cancers in the UK. Cases of skin cancer there have more than doubled since the 1980s. The UK now has more cases of skin cancer than Australia. More than 69 000 new cases are diagnosed in the UK each year and over 2 000 people die each year in the UK from skin cancer. That is not specific to the UK. In Germany, skin cancer among agricultural workers has risen by between 15% and 20% over the last decade alone. Please take a look at the statistics in your own countries. This is a global, not a national, phenomenon. So let us use the EU-wide legal base we have to provide greater protection for all our workers. (Applause)

 Madam President, I congratulate the rapporteur and all who have helped him in this work. There are two crucial points in the report: they are the twin proposals to phase out the opt-out, while opening a way to the annual calculation of working time. In that way we will maintain workers' safety while continuing to allow businesses the flexibility they need to thrive in the modern marketplace. An opt-out from a piece of health and safety legislation is wrong in principle. It needs to end and we need to bring about a proper balance between working and family life. Our leaders pledged to make the European Union the most dynamic, knowledge-based economy in the world, with more and better quality jobs and greater social cohesion. We will not achieve that by opening the door to a universal opt-out. That would be the path to a long-hours, low-pay economy, which is the exact opposite to what we are trying to achieve. If we do not end the opt-out, we should simply repeal the legislation and stop pretending that we want to put in place any sensible minimum standards at all on working time. I would stress this: people have told me that this has nothing to do with work/life/family balance. It has. In 1996 the European Court of Justice ruled that this is a health and safety directive and that health and safety is about the total social, psychological and physical wellbeing of individuals. Family and working life balance has to do with the social and psychological wellbeing of all workers within the European Union. So let us nail that particular argument.

 Madam President, it is significant to me that tomorrow, the day we will vote on this report, is International Workers’ Memorial Day. That is the day that commemorates the 60 000 workers per year who die globally from job-related injuries or illnesses and the many millions more who are injured. For the European Union 15, the figures have been steadily improving over the last decade, but there is still nothing to be proud of. Some 4 500 workers die each year as a result of accidents at work and many more from work-related illnesses. Over four million still suffer significant injuries at work each year. This is the important backdrop to our debate today on the Bilbao Agency. As I have said, the figures for the EU 15 have improved over the last decade and I am convinced that the key health and safety directives that we have put in place, and the work of the Bilbao Agency itself, have made an important contribution to that improvement. As the Commissioner has said, we are discussing the review and updating of the regulation governing the operations of the Bilbao Agency. That review was called for in the original regulation. It is a little later than it might have been, but that is because there has been a full external evaluation and a full consultation of all stakeholders, which has informed the Commission’s proposal and indeed the recommendations from the Council. As the Commissioner has also said, the other imperative for change has been the enlargement of the European Union, which has meant an increase in the Board of the Agency from 48 to 78 and has therefore necessitated a streamlining of administrative and management processes. The amendments that we have proposed fall into four main categories. The first are intended to clarify the objectives and tasks of the Agency, improving the link with the priorities of the Community strategy, strengthening the Agency’s capacity for data analysis, focusing more on the needs of SMEs and providing accessible and comprehensible information to final users. Secondly, there are amendments intended to take account of the enlargement of the Union, clarify and improve the functioning of the Governing Board and strengthen its strategic role and the executive role of the Bureau. Thirdly, there are those intended to reinforce the role of the social partners in the Agency’s network in the Member States – a very important point – and those intended to reinforce cooperation with other Community bodies in the social policy area. We have also, of course, tabled amendments to try to ensure a proper gender balance in the management structures of the Agency. I shall pick out one or two of the more important ones. First, I would like to say that I am grateful to Giovanni Berlinguer and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for an excellent opinion. I have taken up a number of their suggested amendments, for example Amendment 2, which underlines the need for the Agency not only to collect and disseminate information, but also to analyse that information, identify risks and good practices, and promote preventive action. It also underlines the role of the Agency as a risk observatory. Amendment 4 concerns gender balance and the governing and management structures of the Agency. Amendments 5, 6, 7 and 8 concern in different ways the added value the Agency should bring to the data it collects and collates through analysis, evaluation, identification of best practice and dissemination of that information and best practice to where it is most needed, particularly with small and medium-sized enterprises. Amendment 7 also underlines the need for the promotion of the harmonisation of statistics on work-related accidents and illnesses, a crucial point. A series of amendments then look at a number of technical and administrative matters concerning the composition of the board and Bureau and their respective roles and responsibilities, and the interrelationships between the two bodies. We think these amendments will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the operation of the Agency. The final point is the one the Commissioner mentioned. That is Amendment 23, dealing with the appointment of the director. I know the Commission is not happy with it, but it reflects the procedure followed by the other agencies in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs’ remit. The Commissioner has also intervened recently in the appointment of directors at certain agencies. Therefore maybe the amendment better reflects current reality. In short, the report seeks to strengthen the role and function of the Agency, which has already done excellent work. I commend the report to the House.

 Mr President, this House unanimously adopted a resolution on this very subject just over a year ago. The outrage expressed from every quarter last year caused ThyssenKrupp to reconsider its decision to close its Terni plant. It went further: in June 2004 it signed a new agreement with a new investment plan. This plan, as has already been said, promised to make Terni a centre of excellence in magnetic sheet steel production, which is strange in light of what Mr Langen has just said. In return it would receive infrastructure and energy cost benefits under an agreement with the Italian Government. These were in addition to the substantial benefits the company received directly or indirectly from Europe's Structural Funds. Just seven months later, ThyssenKrupp has torn up that agreement – and that is the issue we are considering here this evening. It has gone ahead with closure, bypassing the social partners, the Italian Government and others who were party to the agreement. The company is the latest in a long line to make a mockery of EU laws on worker information and consultation. Commissioner, you mentioned the Social Agenda adopted just two weeks ago. Let me quote a heading from that: ' Moving towards full employment: making work a real option for all, increasing the quality and productivity of work, and anticipating and managing change'. I am sure those words will ring hollow in the ears of the workers hit by this decision. I am not criticising the Commission; I applaud many of the ideas Mr Špidla has included in the new Social Agenda. Let me remind you of some. The Agenda underlines the need for a proactive approach to the positive management of industrial change. It talks of the need to reinforce social dialogue, update legislation on collective redundancies and update and consolidate existing laws on information and consultation. It launches the idea of transnational collective bargaining. Finally, in the context of this debate, it underlines the need for improved corporate social responsibility. The outrageous behaviour of ThyssenKrupp in Italy underlines the need for all these things and more to be done as a matter of urgency. What do I mean by 'more'? Let me say two things in closing. The first is that although the new Social Agenda foresees the creation of a number of high level groups, it fails to include a number of good ideas from past high level groups. How about the recommendations of the 1998 Gyllenhammar Group on Industrial Change that companies should produce annual managing change reports, and that any company dismissing workers without safeguarding their employability should be barred from access to public funds? Only when CSR includes such provisions, will companies like ThyssenKrupp take any notice of it at all. Finally, Commissioner, you say that the Commission is powerless. When the closure was announced at the beginning of last year, the Commission and its President joined Parliament in roundly condemning the decision. I hope, Commissioner, you can give us the assurance this evening that you will do the same.

 Mr President, on 9 June 2004 the College of the Commission decided to dismiss 43 language teachers with almost immediate effect. Nine days later the officials responsible reported this decision to the teachers themselves at a general assembly in Brussels. I should like to quote directly from what two of the teachers said on that occasion: 'We denounce the flagrant lack of openness on the part of the Commission, who waited until today to announce the breaking of the teachers' contracts. In a Europe which claims to be social, we also denounce the cynicism of the Commission, which has plunged these workers into great difficulties - workers, some of whom are main bread-winners with children, many of whom are women. Most of these teachers are of an age at which it would be extremely difficult to find suitable employment. In the March 1997 trialogue agreement the teachers showed their willingness to collaborate in return for a promise by the Commission to maintain their contracts until retirement. Not so long ago Miss Morelli, in charge of training in the Council, in the presence of Commission representatives, reaffirmed on several occasions that the jobs of the teachers were guaranteed until they retired. We wish to record formally the breaking of these promises by the Commission.' I believe that lengthy quote sums up a sad story very well. I have met with the dismissed teachers many times in recent months and have read a great deal of documentation from the time leading up to their dismissal. From that a number of things stand out. First, that for the teachers this decision came like a bolt from the blue. They were given absolutely no prior information about the plans for their dismissal. They were not consulted at all about those plans. Documents from throughout 2003 and the first half of 2004 show that at a whole series of meetings the teachers were given the impression that everything was fine, it was business as usual. One set of papers from mid-2003 actually dismisses rumours of planned restructuring. Other papers show the perfectly normal forward-planning of language training for the 2004-05 period but suddenly, in June 2004, the teachers learned of their abrupt dismissal. Secondly, it stands out that the Commission clearly feels that it is above and beyond the law. Any private entity behaving in the way that the Commission has would find itself in breach of EU laws on information and consultation, collective redundancies and transfer of undertakings. No doubt we will be told today that the Belgian laws giving effect to these EU directives do not apply to the Commission as a public administration, and yet these teachers were employed on Belgian employment contracts that are subject to Belgian employment law. This is the same institution that asks the corporate world to act in a socially responsible way and yet the way in which it has handled this matter so far has been totally socially irresponsible. Thirdly, the Commission has shown a total lack of regard for the plight of these people. Over 60% of them are aged over 55. Six months after the Commission decision their worst fears about not finding work at their age have proved only too real. Worse still, because of the restricted hours they were allowed under the contracts the Commission agreed with them it appears, according to a document I have received, that: 'the teachers may not be entitled to unemployment benefits, early retirement and social security cover'. That would leave them without cover until the age of 65, when their entitlement would become about EUR 500 per month. Clearly a number of the families dependent on these teachers face the real prospect of poverty. Finally, in relation to the trialogue agreement of 1997, the teachers and their representatives had the clearest understanding that they would be employed until retirement in exchange for agreeing new work practices and to work being put out to outside firms as teachers left. This was widely published at the time – in trade union newsletters, for example – and no-one from the Commission seemed to have contradicted that. A Commission official said something telling to us when we questioned her on this in committee. She said that sometime after the trialogue agreement the Commission's legal service was asked to give an opinion on whether such a guarantee was possible. The service said that it was not possible. An important question arises from that. Why was the legal service asked to give an opinion if such a guarantee had not been given at the trialogue? It seems clear that, whether committed to writing or not, such a guarantee was indeed given and that the Commission, having sat silent at the many meetings at which that guarantee has been mentioned since, was quite content to allow everyone to continue with that understanding until it became opportune to go back to that legal opinion. The Commission has behaved in a disgraceful manner. However, it is never too late. I understand that a meeting will take place tomorrow between the Commission and the unions in Brussels. I hope that will be the first step towards reinstatement of these teachers.

 Mr President, I am pleased that both the President-in-Office and Commissioner Verheugen stressed that the Kok report is not an end-point but a starting point for the mid-term review of Lisbon to be concluded at next year's spring summit. I am glad about that because the early drafts I have seen of the Kok report would be an inappropriate conclusion for a mid-term review as the balance is wrong. I disagree with Mr Evans on this point. Quite correctly, the report makes much of the need for improved growth and competitiveness, but you have to read well into it before you come across the notion that social policy can be a productive factor. It is a productive factor. We need improved competitiveness to maintain our European social model, but that model is a productive factor in itself for achieving competitiveness. Rather than talking in grand terms, let me give a specific example. I read recently that in the new Member States, as many as 40% of workers are affected by ill-health or injury related to work. The figure in the former 15 Member States is much lower, at 25%. I think that is in large part due to the comprehensive framework of health and safety laws we have had in place in Europe for over a decade. We need to bear that in mind. That is social policy as a productive factor, contributing to competitiveness, contributing to quality at work, quality jobs, and maintaining people's active involvement in the labour market. Let us maintain the Lisbon balance overall.
 Terence Wynn (PSE

 Mr President, I congratulate Mr Mulder on his report, primarily because within this 2004 discharge he continues the momentum that we created in the 2003 discharge about national declarations. The wording within those paragraphs is very significant, especially in paragraph 26, which mentions encouraging national parliaments to be involved in monitoring European Union funds. I would hope that the Committee on Budgetary Control will pursue that and encourage our colleagues in national parliaments to have a real dialogue with us on this. I say that because of what the Council’s attitude has always been towards this. We have also to congratulate our colleagues on the trialogue who got the agreement within the interinstitutional agreement on the declarations – although they do not use that particular word. However, I am informed – and perhaps Mr Kallas could confirm this – that five Member States have said that they will not comply with what has been agreed in the interinstitutional agreement. Among those Member States I am told that Spain, Belgium, Germany, France and perhaps Italy have said that whatever it says in the IIA about giving annual statements, they will not be doing it. It would help if we could have some clarification from the Commissioner on that.

 Mr President, I rise under Rule 108. We are about to vote on a resolution which is in response to an oral question tabled to the Council last night. This is an extremely important issue for Parliament to try to ensure that taxpayers’ money is managed and supervised correctly within the Member States. Within the oral question there were six specific questions and there was also an additional verbal question which was: will the Council discuss this with Parliament? We had a ten-minute statement from the Presidency which answered none of the seven questions. Whilst I would ask Members to support this text in its entirety, could I ask the President to ask the Council if we could have the answers in writing, please. (Applause)

 Mr President, the oral question includes six specific questions to which I hope the President-in-Office will respond. However, there is also an equally important seventh question: it is the old issue about national declarations. Will the Council actually sit down and discuss this issue with Parliament, so that we can seek a common objective? That is the one aspect in this old debate that has been missing since we voted on the discharge in this Chamber. At the time, we made the recommendations which this oral question refers to. We asked the Member States to get their house in order, to give us an assurance that the control systems they were putting in place were adequate and sufficient and that when EU money was being spent, it was being spent correctly. The problem we have is that when the Court of Auditors reports every year and cannot give a positive statement of assurance, it is because of problems within the Member States. Unless we are going to have a Commission official monitoring just about every item of European expenditure in the Member States, we are never going to solve the problem. It is incumbent upon the Member States to help us ensure that European taxpayers’ money is being spent correctly. I have to thank Commissioner Kallas in particular for the way he has encouraged Parliament by persuading the Commission to take on board those recommendations and to produce the roadmap towards getting a positive statement of assurance. In that process, we had a two-day hearing organised by the Commission and the previous Presidency on how this could or could not be achieved. I attended that hearing on both days. I was saddened at the negativity of some Member States who just wanted to continue with the status quo. They claimed nothing was wrong and nothing needed to be changed. Two things were clear from that hearing: there might have been other minor problems, but there were two major problems. The first major problem was that the supreme audit institutions of the Member States feared that somehow or other this was a takeover by the European Court of Auditors. Hopefully that fear has been allayed. I attended the annual gathering of the supreme audit institutions along with the European Court of Auditors in Stockholm, and I am led to believe that there is an acceptance that it was not the intention. I am also led to believe that the supreme audit institutions are prepared to play their part in helping us to solve this problem. The other major problem that occurred from that two-day hearing, and probably the biggest one, was the fact that we had asked for a political signature from the Member States to actually give these national declarations. For some Member States, such as the Netherlands, that is not a problem. This task falls on the Minister, and no one else would argue that it should be anybody else. However, for a lot of Member States it was a major problem. On reflection, I have to say that if we had left out the words ‘political signature’ in our discharge report we may not have scared the Council as much as we did. We are now in a situation where we need to come to an agreement with the Council on how to get national declarations that can actually satisfy not only the European Court of Auditors, but the Commission and the Member States themselves, to ensure that we can show European taxpayers that their money is being spent correctly. I would hope that the President-in-Office gives us clear answers to the six questions listed within the oral question and that he does not give us the answers that Ecofin gave us on 8 November 2005. Quite frankly, that was not leading us forward. I should also like him to answer the seventh question, which I shall put orally: will the Council sit down with Parliament to discuss this matter in the hope that we can get a resolution to it? (Applause)

 Mr President, on a point of order under Rule 108, this was an oral question with six questions; I added a seventh question verbally this evening, and we have not had an answer to a single one of them. Could the Presidency at least give us those answers in writing, please?

.  We very much welcome the reform of the sugar regime, but there are many parts of this report drawn up for Parliament by its Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for which I will not be voting. The sugar regime had been in need of reform for at least 15 years when the Court of Auditors carried out an extensive study on the sugar regime (Special Report 4/91) and concluded that the system suffered from oversupply and inefficient production patterns and that it was not budget neutral. I cannot accept the call for the 'introduction of modifications'. We need radical overhaul, not just modifications. I cannot vote for lesser price cuts, increased compensation, and less quota cuts than proposed by the Commission. I will not vote for structural or social cohesion policy instruments to be used to cushion sugar farmers. Large amounts of CAP funds are already available for EU farmers. I agree that we need to control imports from Lesser Developed countries (LDCs) and guard against triangular trade, but we are talking tiny amounts here: 125 000 tonnes from LDCs. EU sugar production is around 17.4 million tonnes. Why are we focusing so much on LDC imports here? Market imbalance is not going to come from LDC imports.

 Madam President, I should like to say to the Commissioner that when she first presented her proposals to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I applauded. I realise that I was the only person who applauded in that committee, which put me at odds with many of my colleagues. I applauded because I have wanted reform in this sector ever since I read the 1991 report by the Court of Auditors. I have sought changes in the regime from a budget control point of view, from a budget point of view, from a development point of view, from a WTO point of view and from a consumer point of view, which puts me at odds with Mr Fruteau, for whom I have the greatest respect and whom I genuinely admire. But quite frankly, we should not accept the call for ‘the introduction of modifications’. What we need is a radical overhaul, as the Commissioner proposed. We should not vote for lesser price cuts and increased compensation and less quota cuts than those proposed by the Commission. We should not vote for structural or social cohesion policy instruments to be used to cushion sugar farmers. All ACP producers were being offered the same. Large amounts of CAP funds are already available to EU farmers. Let us not forget that sugar producers, processors and refiners are not the poorest people on this planet. I agree that we need to monitor imports from the less-developed countries in order to prevent fraud and guard against triangular trade, but quite honestly, we are talking about tiny amounts. EU sugar production of 17 million tonnes will not be distorted; there will not be a market imbalance because of LDC imports. Amendment 61, on the Everything But Arms Agreement, should be opposed. What we are trying to do to the least developed countries is unacceptable. We should follow the line that Mrs Kinnock has given, making sure that, whatever we do with these reforms, the developing world is not jeopardised.

 Mr President, a week ago the Ecofin Council rejected Parliament’s proposals for national declarations, which in effect means that we will not see a positive DAS in the foreseeable future. The Ecofin proposals are a poor substitute for real action and came out of a two-day panel of experts meeting which I attended. It was a meeting that reminded me of Margaret Thatcher’s comments at a similar meeting when she complained of being surrounded by people who found every reason for not doing things and not changing things rather than giving her solutions to the problems she had. Parliament needs to know which Member States agree, and which disagree, with its position. In all seriousness, the comment from the UK Independence Party should not be disregarded. Why, indeed, should we agree a new financial perspective when supervisory and control systems are so blatantly flawed within the Member States? That is a message that must be conveyed to the Council loudly and strongly.

 Mr President, may I begin by saying that Reimer Böge has done a really good job with this report. He has managed to reflect the position of the committee faithfully. Not everyone will agree with the full contents of the report, but overall it is very good and he is to be congratulated. Different views are represented in this House, whether it be on agriculture, structural funds or whatever. You cannot please all of the people all of the time, but that is not such a bad thing. You have not pleased us, because, as you would expect, the main point of departure for the British Labour delegation is the implied reference to the United Kingdom rebate. In this part of the debate I seem to be a voice in the wilderness, but I will carry on. I refer to recital N, which I totally disagree with, and also to paragraph 8 and the fifth indent of paragraph 51. I have always made it clear in the temporary committee that own resources and the Financial Perspective are two separate issues, and never before has there been an attempt to link them under any of the previous IIAs. That is why the British Labour delegation is hesitant about supporting the report. The report will certainly give Parliament a good starting point for negotiations with the Council, which I welcome. Of course, until we know Council's agreed position, if there is one, it is difficult to say how those negotiations will go. I suppose it is still possible in theory that the Council will agree with Parliament's figures, or even go higher. Some of us live in hope. However, from the beginning when Members raised the issue of linking the Financial Perspective with a new system of own resources, I have used the phrase "get real" on at least three occasions. We have to ‘get real’ about what the Council will do. This is not going to happen. In the remaining three weeks of the Luxembourg presidency, for all its skilful diplomacy I would be surprised if this were to be part of any package, if indeed the Council has a position. I personally believe that the present own resources system is opaque and we need something more transparent, so that taxpayers can understand how the EU is financed. That discussion and decision will take place in a different House at a different time. I know that will not please colleagues in my Group, but we have to live in the real world and recognise the limits of our competencies. If the British delegation abstains on this report, it is for the reason that I have outlined. As for the future, I wish you well when you start the conciliation negotiations.

rapporteur

 Mr President, I consider this report, which we will vote on later today, to be one of the most important reports that this Parliament will vote on during this session. I say that not because it is in my name, but because of its content and the great deal of hard work that has gone into it. I thank those from the Court, the Commission, those Member States with which I have had dealings and also the secretariat of the Committee on Budgetary Control. Without them this report would not be the document that it is, and I give them heartfelt thanks. If its recommendations are implemented by the institutions, then the Holy Grail of a positive Statement of Assurance – DAS – will be in sight. However, to get to that point we will need some real commitment and cooperation from the Commission, the Court of Auditors and the Member States. From paragraph 25 onwards, the report outlines the lack of perfection within the DAS methodology. It makes the point that the money within our accounts can be totally legal and regular but that, at the same time, it can be absolutely wasted. That is one of the main failings of the DAS and why the report’s recommendations encourage the Court to improve upon the changes it has already made. From the Commission’s point of view, whatever the DAS methodology improvements may be, the Commission and the Member States still need to make changes. The Commissioner must do several things. As with every report this Parliament votes on, we always ask the Commission to do extra things. And apart from such items as implementing a Community internal control framework, we are asking that. Here, however, a contentious matter in certain areas, certainly within the Commission itself, is an issue raised in paragraph 8 and Amendment 4. I would wholeheartedly call on Members to support this amendment, which calls on the Accounting Officer to sign off the Commission accounts. It must be said that until that is agreed, the Commission will always be attacked, and Amendment 4 spells that out quite clearly. I have a lot of respect and regard for Commissioner Kallas and I am encouraged by his positive attitude. I call on him not to let the battle of hierarchies within the directorates-general prevent this from being implemented. It is a key part of these recommendations. However, whatever we ask the Court and the Commission to do, the positive DAS will not be attainable unless the Member States accept their responsibilities, which include their political responsibilities in the control and management of European Union funds. Paragraph 16 outlines the problems quite clearly. The Disclosure Statement, as described in paragraph 19, shows how the problems can be solved. This report is trying to anchor the Member States’ responsibilities not only at administrative level but also at a political level. This is, after all, a shared management process. It is about time that the other half of this shared management began taking its responsibilities more seriously. In that context, the report states – near the end of my section – that progress is not possible without Member States’ active participation. That is why the committee and the report, if it is adopted, proposes to invite you, Mr President, in your speech to the next European Council, to address the need to improve Member States’ financial management of funds from the European Union. I hope you can do that. For me, this report has been a fascinating exercise. It is the culmination of ten years of trying to see a positive Statement of Assurance. Ten years ago I said that there would never be a positive DAS with the systems that were in place, and these included the DAS methodology. Today I can say that if this report is adopted, then I am confident that a positive DAS, that Holy Grail I mentioned before, is certainly within reach. (Applause)

 On behalf of the EPLP I would like to outline why we will not be voting in favour of the Fruteau/Daul resolution. This resolution follows an oral question from the Agriculture committee, ands aims to give a de facto EP position on sugar ahead of the Commission's legislative proposals. The Development, Trade, Budgets, Consumers and the Environment Committees are all concerned by this complex issue. We need reform in the sugar sector not only due to WTO pressures but also because we need a competitive EU food industry, to maintain jobs and a viable industry. We need a proper single market in sugar which this resolution does not address. We need to help the least-developed countries by allowing them access to EU markets, but this needs to be discussed fully not determined by an oral resolution. We need to support the Commission in their efforts to bring this complex sector into line with other CAP reforms not argue to retain the status quo.

 Mr President, at the beginning of this part-session we quite rightly held one minute's silence for the terrible losses in Asia. At times of such major devastation, smaller tragedies tend to go unnoticed. Over the past weekend, the city of Carlisle and the region of Cumberland have witnessed horrendous flooding following severe storms as well as the deaths of elderly people. I should like to ask you in your capacity as President to send a letter to the Mayor of Carlisle expressing our solidarity with the people of the city and of the county, and also to ask the Commission whether it can afford any help at this time of crisis for those people.
 Wynn (PSE

 Mr President, ten years ago I was the rapporteur for the discharge and ten years ago I made the statement that we will never have a positive statement of assurance – DAS. I said that because, regardless of the failings within the Commission or whatever was wrong as regards irregularities, we could see quite clearly ten years ago that there were two incompatible systems: the system being used by the Court to do its audit and the system being used by the Commission in the way it functioned. Changes have taken place over the last ten years. The Court has changed its methodology – it has moved to the four-pillar system – and the Commission has had the Kinnock reforms, but I still remain convinced that, even from 1 January next year with the new financial regulations and the new accounting systems, we will still not see a positive DAS because of the way things are organised. I would like to address one comment to Mr Titford. In your own country the Department of Social Security has failed to get clearance of its accounts for the last 14 years. The American federal budget has failed to get any clearance of its accounts for the last six years. This is not a unique organisation and it would have helped, Mr Titford, if you had actually taken part in the hearings we held – all six of them. At least Mr Mote turned up on some occasions and put some questions, but then again Mr Mote is an independent UK Independent, not a UK Independent as Mr Titford is. But anyway, back to my script. What we have is the Commission saying that it uses the clearance of accounts because that is what it says in the financial regulation. That is how it controls such things as agricultural expenditure. So its attitude is that they can recover the funds – why does the Court of Auditors not include that in the DAS? A point worth making is that when the clearance of accounts is used the money is actually recovered from the Member States. It is not recovered from the farmers or receiving organisations, which means that national taxpayers foot the bill for any irregularities or fraud. Then the Court says that to recover is good, but we should have a system where you do not need to recover. The system should be better. Well that is quite understandable. So the Commission then says: yes, but to do what the Court actually wants will cost so much money that it simply will not be cost-effective. That I can also understand. I will be looking at a variety of conclusions from the Committee on Budgetary Control’s six hearings with the Commissioners and the Court. It is obvious to anyone that one of the main problems is that of shared management. As one of the Members of the Court said in the hearings, it is not a problem of control, it is not a problem of audit, it is a problem of management. So I am beginning to think that we need a system which makes the authorising bodies in the Member States responsible for giving assurance on legality and regularity. It seems strange that in a shared management system only half of the partnership needs to be responsible. That will mean changes to legislation and it will mean the cooperation of the Council and the Member States. From the Court’s point of view I have yet to be convinced that two of the four pillars as mentioned by Mr Fabra Vallés are reliable. I have real concerns about the amount of transactions inspected and I also question the extent to which other auditors’ work is used. We need a regular activity report on the work done with national audits to be sure that the four pillars give a transparent DAS. There will also be the perennial request from Parliament that the Court should sectionalise its DAS so that the budgetary authority knows exactly where the problems lie. We are in a situation that sees a set of rules from the Court that can never be met by the Commission within reasonable costs no matter what it does, compared with the benefits to be gained. I am not trying to bend the rules, I am trying to make them fit. I am asking the Court to try to establish a set of rules that can be played by. Imagine Barcelona playing Manchester United in the European Cup Final. There is a crowd of 70 000 and all eyes are on the pitch and on the players. The whole of Europe is looking at this. On comes the referee, he walks to the centre spot and he places at the feet of Wayne Rooney not a football, but a rugby ball. As the players try to point out the problems that they may have with an oval ball, he says never mind the ball, get on with the game! That, quite frankly, is the attitude that the Court has towards efforts to change the system. It is never mind the ball, get on with the game. However, let us be clear: this analogy does not mean that the Commission or the Member States should be seen as the elites of public administration. I have a final point. Thankfully I am on the temporary committee for the new financial perspectives. We should not agree a new financial perspective until we have resolved this problem of reliability and accountability from the Member States.

deputising for the rapporteur

 Mr President, as Vice-Chairman of the Temporary Committee on policy challenges and budgetary means of the enlarged Union 2007-2013, I am speaking on behalf of the Chairman, Mr Borrell Fontelles, to put his question to the Council, and I welcome Mr Nicolaï being here. As the Council knows, Parliament convened this temporary committee and Mr Böge is its rapporteur; so far we have eight working documents and because as yet they are only working documents, we have not taken any formal positions. Hopefully the questions that we put before the Council and the responses that we get back will help us reach some conclusions. Having said that, to be perfectly honest, I hope that when Parliament does make its decisions there are certain items that it will be resolute about. In the previous Parliament, in a report that was voted in my name, we set out certain conditions, certain priorities, one of which was quite simple: there will be no interinstitutional agreement without the agreement of Parliament. The Council is well aware of this but it needs to be stressed, as it is in the text of this oral question. We have also the issue of the length of the proposed financial perspective and Parliament will, I am pretty sure, bring it down to something like five years rather than seven years. More important is the position of a fallback. Mr Böge asks in one of his working documents: what are the options if we cannot come to an agreement with the Council? Do we go for Article 26 of the IIA or do we go for Article 272 of the Treaty?’ Having been in this Parliament for the past 15 years and involved with the Committee on Budgets for all that time, I am pretty sure that Parliament will go for Article 272. That message needs to be got across to the Council. I know that you, Mr Nicolaï, are well aware of that and also of the consequences if we do not reach an agreement. Therefore, it is incumbent on both our institutions to make sure that we reach an agreement. Moving away from the oral question for one moment, I am now the rapporteur for the discharge, and it is becoming obvious that Parliament’s budget gets a bad press every November when the Court of Auditors report is produced. I would hope that the institutions – and if not the institutions then at least I hope Parliament – can make a decision that we will not conclude an interinstitutional agreement until the budgetary authority has agreed a solution to the audit, to the legality and regularity of the European Union budget. It is no use concluding a financial perspective that will be seen by the general public as being misspent, misused and irregular throughout the next five, six, seven years or whatever period we agree to. I come now to the questions; they are there for everyone to see and are quite simple. The first one is: ‘How does the Council intend to cooperate with Parliament?’ We are talking about how we are going to work together. Hopefully we will not work as two separate organisations and there will be some work in tandem, so that we can share our ideas and make sure that the building-block approach of the Council matches our own approach as set out in Mr Böge’s working documents. There is also a question about the calendar of the Presidency, when you hope to conclude, what your present Netherlands Presidency hopes to achieve, and what you think the next Presidency will achieve by the middle of next year. We mentioned the issue of trialogues, but it is fair to say that after an informal meeting we had this morning, Mr Nicolaï, you may give us a response to that. Parliament’s position right now is that we should be having monthly trialogues, but I am sure your response will enlighten us on your thinking on this. I personally go some way towards your sentiments on this. An important issue is the question regarding the ‘Prodi package’. We really need to know where the Council is coming from. What is the basis for your building blocks? What is the basis for your working documents? Is it the Prodi package or are you taking a different approach? Finally, the last question: ‘In the Council’s view, what connection exists between the Commission’s proposals on the new financial perspective and the issue of own resources?’ Some of us, being British, are not bothered, but for the majority in this House it is a crucial issue. On that, Mr Nicolaï, we would appreciate some answers.
