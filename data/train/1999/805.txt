 Mr President, Commissioner de Palacio, I will just focus on a few of the aspects relating to updating the priority projects, in particular on Project No 29 and more specifically on the Ionian/Adriatic intermodal rail route which, over time, has been shortened by a section that today should have instead been reopened, the Bari-Varna route. We believe that this is an issue of great importance if it is true that the European Union and this Parliament intend to attach importance to the integration of the Balkan area into the trans-European networks too. It cannot be said that this is not a project of European interest because it brings major added value – facilitating the mobility of goods and people – and because it will contribute to territorial cohesion of the European Union. An objection is being made to the impossibility of using the structural funds because these countries are not currently within the European Union. This is, however, an objection that, in my opinion, can be easily overcome only if there is a will to suggest access to the EIB funds or a more prudent reworking of the funds already earmarked by the European Union for the whole Balkan area. The Balkan area is very important, not just in terms of transport, but also in terms of security, and transport can help the issue of security, especially in an area where illegal immigration represents a constant danger for the border countries such as Italy and, in general, for the whole of the Mediterranean area. This is why we hope that the three institutions, as the Commissioner mentioned, want to agree in the most rational way on a number of guidelines provided through the modernisation programmes listed in Annex III.

 Mr President, President of the Commission, I would like to start by apologising to President Prodi for the improvised nature of this speech, which will be a series of brief reflections on what I have read or heard. Clearly, over and above the indications given in the work programme for 2003, we cannot expect the Commission to do everything immediately and, ideally, properly, in the space of just one year, but it is right that guidelines should be laid down, as has been done. I feel that, at least in general terms, these guidelines are sufficiently acceptable. I listened to your speech, President Prodi, and I very much appreciated some of the points which you stressed with your usual enthusiasm, particularly the social considerations, which are very relevant at a time when we are discussing security, solidarity and measures which could even include a new direction for the world of work. Therefore, if I may, I would like to call upon the Commission and the Community institutions in general to reflect either formally or informally on a number of policies which I believe are of vital importance for the future of Europe, particularly for the future of an enlarged Europe which is genuinely united as regards its fundamental principles. Well then, yesterday, we held lengthy formal and informal discussions with many members of parliaments whose countries are aspiring, if I may use that expression, to become a full members of Europe, and, together, we discussed our desire to work towards achieving a Europe which is genuinely, essentially and, ideally, politically united. However, in order to be politically united and cohesive, Europe needs to address issues of momentous historical importance transparently. Mr President, I believe we need to reflect very deeply on the issue of immigration. There can never be enough discussion of the subject of legal immigration, just as there can never be enough discussion on the integration of immigrants. I often reflect – and I still do not know the answer – on the problem of integrating immigrants into society, and I sometimes wonder whether integration is not another, new form of oppression of cultures which are different from ours and should therefore be fully respected. One of the speakers mentioned the subject of an interesting debate just now, which took place both in Florence and in my own town, Lecce, a town where we have to have no fear of dialogue or the presence of people who do not think in the same way as we do. Here, too, we must listen to what is being said about globalisation, about new forms of poverty which genuinely exist, on north and south, east and west. We must reflect still more – I reiterate – on the way we may, to some extent, be oppressing immigrant or emigrant peoples which, I imagine, would like to return to their homelands and regain their identities and their cultural roots, but which certainly do not want to go back to economic poverty. Therefore, if we have to take economic measures, it is essential that we ensure that these do not lead to the oppression of cultures. With regard to this, therefore, I would like to draw the attention of the Commission to the issues of immigration and employment, in order to avoid employment, rather than being a uniting factor, becoming grounds for fresh dispute between the immigrants in our States and those who need to convert their business activities. Consider the industrial crisis in our country, President Prodi, and the resulting need to retrain the work force through substantial, genuinely incisive, large-scale training measures. Training is also something which depends on culture, and it must be promoted if it is true that Europe wants to continue to grow, as you maintain.

 Madam President, we would stress that the principle of solidarity and economic and social cohesion must be the basis of the Community institutions’ political action if it is to achieve the goal of a European continent based on shared values, and we would also like to mention the great importance our group attaches to the impending enlargement, to the pillar of economic and social cohesion and to the ever-increasing endeavours in the field of cohesion. We therefore feel that the proposal, already called for by Parliament, to phase in the Structural Funds and to introduce the Cohesion Fund in the new countries at a level of at least a third of the total allocation for structural measures is highly appropriate, for it will be a considerable contribution towards improving the absorption capacity of these countries which are, still today, effectively without genuine administrative capacities. We have already, on other occasions, requested increasingly careful monitoring of the committed resources on the part of the Commission, and this is becoming still more urgent and pressing if we consider that prolonging access to the Cohesion Fund in this way to improve implementation of structural measures in the candidate countries must be seen as a completely new strategy and that it therefore cannot be understood to be a permanent facility. We therefore support Mr Böge’s proposal to monitor the trend of improvements in Structural Funds implementation carefully, proceeding, where implementation is improving, to reduce the Cohesion Fund quota gradually. We hope that the problems encountered in the implementation of the ISPA, Sapard and Phare instruments, for example, despite the fact that the Funds were trebled as of 2000, can be overcome or, at any rate, diminished as the institutions are strengthened too. I will conclude by saying that, while, on the whole, we welcome the Commission’s action, we share Mr Böge’s concerns and confusion regarding the financial perspective, which does not necessarily have to cover the 2007-2013 period if we take up the option of prolonging by a short period the current interinstitutional agreement and financial perspective.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is always revolutionary to discuss the situation of women, but a few facts need to be made clear first. Fundamentalisms affect more than just the lives of women, they affect the lives of people in general, and for that reason they must be opposed and rejected on principle for they are at the root of a vision of society that is based on conflict. It is precisely because of this intrinsic nature that they have such negative consequences for women, becoming a sort of ethical justification for abuse and violence. Clearly, respect for fundamental human rights is a cultural even more than a legal heritage, which is shared by the Member States of the European Union, a common value which has to contend with practices, customs, religions and cultures with which Europe comes into contact mainly because of migration. I would like to make it clear, however, as a Catholic, that I am absolutely convinced that Catholicism is not guilty of the forms of fundamentalism that the report appears to suggest it is. I fully support the call for the adoption of a universal moratorium on executions and the death penalty, an effective, incisive action, a campaign against mutilation, flogging and stoning, such as we have carried out and will continue to carry out for cases such as that of the Nigerian woman, Safiya Husseini. I would like to draw your attention to a number of issues which I feel need to be addressed, calling upon the Commission and Parliament to reflect on them once again: to reflect on the right of the family, on the minimum conditions for the right of asylum, on integration, with regard to which we need to move away from a form of hypocritical rhetoric which drifts between full integration with the Member States of the European Union and respect for identities, and on the need for a clear separation of Church from State, or rather of religion from politics. To sum up, we confirm our rejection of any form of violence, particularly violence and oppression inflicted on human beings, be they men or women. We call upon the Commission not just to guarantee that the Community acquis on women’s rights will be respected in the talks, but also to analyse all these problematic issues further, for there are at least as many unresolved issues as issues which have been resolved.

 Mr President, Parliament must make an assessment of the quality of projects according to the results achieved a priority, and the Commission must ensure that Parliament is in a position genuinely to carry out careful monitoring. In this sense, the proposed informal working group will be useful. Sometimes, however, the Commission does not respond within the time allowed and certain States are guilty of this too, particularly in the negotiation phases. It is therefore appropriate to pause and take stock of the situation in order to enable the Commission to provide responses more quickly, to achieve uniformity of provisions on the different funds as quickly as possible, to ensure that we progress along the road of streamlining bureaucracy – making increasing numbers of regions and local communities accountable and providing them with consultancy services – and to speed up the automatic decommitment mechanisms so as to allow swift reallocation of funds and the drawing up of an annual detailed, specific report which will make it possible to proceed with full knowledge of the facts from evaluation to programming. Moreover, a bridge programme should be envisaged allowing certain States, including Italy, to make use of the unused funds from the 1994-99 programming period, similarly to what happened at the end of the 1993 programming period.

 I fully agree with the conclusions reached by Mr Turchi. I would reiterate the points made by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism with regard to the lack of information on financing provided by national, regional and local bodies and by the private sector for the completion of TEN projects, since 95% of the financing still comes from outside the EU. There is also a lack of information on specific investment in modes of transport via EIB loans, the financial instruments for third countries, other public and private programmes and the Structural Funds themselves that is broken down by transport mode. Indeed, the Commission only provided information broken down by transport mode for budget heading B5-0700. We feel we should also point out that, in future, the Commission should attach to the report a clear, simple table containing dependable, transparent data which can not just be used to monitor the correct use of the amounts already made over but will also improve the scope for planning. This is a monitoring procedure which the Commission’s report reserved exclusively for the 14 priority projects established at Essen which, as we know, are not the only ones on the list. Finally, I feel I must draw the Commission’s attention to the need to address properly, once again, the issue of Corridor 8 – which does not even feature in the White Paper – and peripheral regions, which are isolated even more by the excessive focus on Trans-European railway lines and the neglect of the air transport crisis.

 Mr President, after the shock of 11 September, the tragic scale of the crisis in the aviation industry and its related services was already apparent, but the situation has become even more complex with the events of recent days. We are now faced with a problem: the problem of the crisis in general and a problem of safety too, which, if the theory on the plane crash should prove to be true, would prompt us to focus more closely on the issue of servicing of aircraft for safety purposes. Without a doubt, the state of war and the economics of war then precipitated events into a genuine crisis for the airlines which has already had extreme consequences for Sabena and Swissair. As has already been pointed out, the crisis, due to many different causes, not least – there is no doubt – clear strategic mismanagement of the sector, with airlines (which we might describe as too individualistic) unwilling to form consortia, which would have allowed them to streamline human, structural and financial resources; we have seen pricing policies which are misguided and often seeking to evade competition law; there are airports – such as Malpensa, to quote an example from my country – which are unreliable in terms of safety as well. It is clear today that, in the current situation, the issue has reached dramatic, critical proportions, with the loss of at least 30 thousand jobs in Europe and 180 thousand jobs worldwide. In Italy, my country’s national airline company has contemplated recapitalisation. It is preparing itself to take draconian measures, with a further 1 000 job cuts on top of the 2 500 already announced. Italiatour, Eurofly and the IT services company Sigma Travel will be drastically reduced in size, if not abolished. The recapitalisation will have to be endorsed by Brussels. The Commission had already authorised, on 17 October, payment of a public subsidy of EUR 387 million, but Alitalia needs EUR 1.5 billion and we do not know how useful the shares created by the Treasury by issuing bonds will be. Strengthening commercial links with Air France or joining the Skyteam consortium are likely to be more effective in terms of structural reform. In conclusion, we endorse the joint motion for a resolution and we feel that the situation calls for various different types of action from the European Union, extremely urgent action which, with the precious help of the European social partners, will succeed in firmly stopping the severely critical situation from further deteriorating now. Subsequently, however, it will be necessary to plan action to modernise and streamline the sector and to take clear, incisive measures to boost tourism, which, as has already been pointed out, is a sector which, all too often, to be honest, is discussed at length but in which very little is as yet being done. Lastly, we hope that the forthcoming reflections on the White Paper on transport will lead to resolute, incisive undertakings to support the transport and tourism sector’s economy, helping the many workers and their families, in particular, who must not be allowed to suffer further misfortune.

 Mr President, there is absolutely no doubt about the major role that has been played by the Cohesion Fund in the development of trans-European networks and in environmental operations in the four beneficiary States, and it is certainly very important for the convergence of the economies of the European Union. The results achieved, however, are not the same across the board, and it is worth exploring the reasons for this. In reality, strangely, there are bureaucratic problems and mechanisms which are still poorly defined, particularly as regards the time frames for the disbursement and use of the funds: this applies to the Cohesion Fund, of which all the appropriations for 1999 were not used, and it applies to the Structural Funds, which did not achieve the 100% expenditure target both because the majority of the resources were committed only just before the end of the programming period and because of the slow rate of disbursement of the appropriations available. These factors make the process much more burdensome for those implementing the programmes. The delays certainly do not contribute to the overall improvement in socio-economic and employment conditions in the regions concerned. In this sense, a crucial moment for both funds is the evaluation, not just an ex ante
 analysis but also, most importantly, an ex post
 evaluation, which is no use if it is not carried out within the correct time frame, the correct time frame being before the programming of the subsequent operations, which cannot be carried out rationally if the final evaluation of the previous programmes cannot be taken into account. Moreover, the evaluation is necessary in order to verify that the principle of additionality is being respected according to the clear indications of the Court of Auditors, which should be observed. Linked to this is the point that it would be beneficial if the Commission were to provide clearer, more comprehensive information of an essentially social and economic rather than accounting nature on the evaluation of projects, highlighting whether the aim of reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions has been achieved; the European Parliament needs to receive this information in due time, not – as has happened this time with regard to the Cohesion Fund – two years late, for that clearly makes it impossible to correct shortcomings and reprogramme operations in useful time. And this is an operation that is becoming still more necessary in view of the now impending enlargement. Finally, we must demand a more active role for Parliament in the evaluation of the effectiveness of the operations and the goals pursued.

 Mr President, several times over the last year I have addressed enquiries to the Commission for news about the large consignments of extra-Community oil imported into Italy via third countries. I have requested that a Community database be set up for oil and that Regulation 2568/91 be revised, in order to check analytically for the presence of hazelnut oil in the olive oil imported into Italy. Unfortunately the answers have never been reassuring, and sometimes they have been quite alarming. The observations made in the explanatory statement in the Peres report are all true, highlighting once again the demand for a guaranteed income for farmers and respect for the space and special character of the Mediterranean environment, the strong demand to prevent aid per tree by supporting aid based on production, and the valuing of the quality and genuineness of the product to protect the consumer. It is clear that Parliament’s position is not yet in tune with the Commission’s, and I hope that at least some fundamental amendments in the Peres report will be approved to clarify the important function of the producer organisations as a useful presence on the market, to value interprofessionalism, to protect the consumer from any abuses by preventing the blending of olive oil with other vegetable oils, to establish the place of production of the olives as the place of origin, and lastly something which particularly concerns the south of Italy and the Puglia region: to add some cultivars to the genetic mark, preventing them from being regarded as defects of organoleptic characteristics whereas instead they are expressions of techniques and special characters that can be found in the production specifications of protected denomination of origin olive oils

 Mr President, I will say immediately that the Commission's position is unacceptable, from the point of view both of protecting farmers' incomes and of protecting consumers' health. Clearly there is no wish to call into question the Blair House agreements, which reduce 
the amount of Community land available. We are in an odd situation, on the one hand, the ban on the use of animal meal to feed production animals too has increased the requirement for plant protein; on the other hand, as of the next growing year, there is to be a sharp reduction in the amount of protein crops being grown. We feel that these crop productions must be guaranteed to protect the farmers and oilseed producers. The Commission needs to present a comprehensive report on the effect of the Agenda 2000 decisions on the management of the land dedicated to oilseed crops in the different production areas of the Community, and a proposal regulating the labelling of feedingstuffs containing GMOs. We feel that sufficient incentives must be provided for the production of plant proteins in the interests of the environment, of the meat consumer, who has to be able to trust the Community production chain, and of the oilseed production chain, which has made specialised investments and which is in danger of a sharp fall in employment. It is worrying that the Commission says it considers that it makes more economic sense to increase imports of soya meal. In this case, the economy is in open conflict with the interests of the Community agricultural sector and, in particular, with safeguarding the health and confidence of the citizen, which is not economically quantifiable. Yesterday, Parliament adopted an amendment which reads: “Health should not be considered as a commodity, which can be the subject of political or financial compromises”. Today, the Commission has told us that this is not so.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the events of the last few hours have been most alarming. Europe is making great efforts to keep the peace in South East Europe and many individual countries are also doing just as much, in terms of financial assistance and cooperation. However, peace is unfortunately a long way off; in fact, corruption is growing; elections – if there are any – often lack transparency, and emigration from Kosovo, Montenegro and Albania has reached overwhelming proportions, those remaining on the territory being the worst of the criminal population. The European Union probably ought to devote more attention to making return immigration easier, ensuring that there are active populations in those countries who are genuinely committed to redevelopment and pursuing a process of peace and tranquillity in their homelands. Therefore, it is not just a problem of military security at the frontiers. The ethnic minorities are becoming increasingly demanding and violent towards the inhabitants and the peacekeeping forces, thus demonstrating the still very evident fragility of local governments, particularly the Albanian Government, which ought to uphold the rights of the political opposition more firmly, and the fragility of relations with the European Union and with some non-governmental organisations. We are convinced that the solution to the Balkan crisis must be a political solution, but it must be accompanied by full, transparent affirmation of rights and a genuine will for tangible and intangible reconstruction. The European Union must commit itself wholly to achieving the aims of peace and stability in the Balkans, but it must be increasingly clear about the fact that genuine financial assistance has to be closely linked to the pursuit of these aims, in the short term and without further tolerance.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I will refrain from defining intermodality, adopting the definition which the Commission itself has used in the past instead. However, the operations supporting intermodality are becoming ever more urgent for a number of reasons: the need to rationalise traffic and optimise transportation times, and economic and environmental requirements, for intermodality is a key element in sustainable mobility. As matters stand, intermodality poses a series of drawbacks stemming from the lack of integration between the various modes of transport, together with deficiencies peculiar to some of these modes. The development of intermodality hinges primarily upon the level of efficiency provided by the rail services on offer, which unfortunately, in many Member States, rate poorly in terms of quality, efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Moreover, as the Commission has pointed out on several occasions, the development of infrastructure continues to focus on unimodal systems, whereas intermodal transport requires a network-based approach 
focusing on complementarity and connections between the various modes. Lastly, open intermodal information systems able to manage intermodal transport and network services efficiently and to guarantee a rational and constant real-time information and message flow have yet to be put in place. A specific analysis of the friction costs allied to intermodal freight transport reveals that the main drawbacks compared to traditional unimodal transport can be identified as high costs, longer time frames, inferior quality, higher risks of damage to goods, restrictions as to the types of goods that can be transported, and more complex administrative procedures. These friction costs can be attributed first and foremost to the absence of coherent system networks and connections linking the latter, leading to a loss of efficiency and an increase in transfer costs. Furthermore, the differing profitability and service quality levels amongst the various modes of transport do not sit easily alongside notions of customer satisfaction and real-time goods transfers. The culprit is the absence of broad electronic message 
systems 
linking different partners in the intermodal chain and the lack of an identification and information system for goods 
organised on an intermodal basis. Lastly, the entire system is dogged by a series of bottlenecks stemming from the absence of harmonised time frames and timetables amongst the various modes of transport, as a result of which the needs of the freight transport chain do not correspond to the operational demands of the resources employed in the process. By way of illustration, the working hours of drivers and crews do not tally with intermodal operations, and terminals are not always able to accommodate round-the-clock train and shipping timetables. Clearly, the intermodal transport framework in Europe varies somewhat, with totally contrasting circumstances apparent in the various Member States. Hence the need to accord priority to the monitoring of the different circumstances, with the support of the Transport Intermodality Task Force, with a view to singling out specific lines of action designed to address emerging priorities in individual Member States. The aims which the EU intends to pursue through the development of intermodality relate to the need to establish an integrated system comprising the various transport modes which offers seamless, customer-tailored door-to-door services, makes for efficient and cost-effective use of the transport system and promotes competition between operators. In its communication on intermodality and intermodal freight transport in the European Union, the Commission highlighted the objectives to be pursued in the intermodal transport sector and divided them into priority areas for action, known as "key actions": infrastructure and integrated means of transport, interoperable and interconnected traffic operations, and services and regulations common to all transport modes. The objective is to establish an information system providing for real-time transport management, as well as the use of electronic transactions in transport, by means of the development of real-time electronic information and transaction systems, the harmonisation of transport message, procedure and document standards 
using Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) systems, a uniform liability regime 
designed to offer the end user a clear set of transparent conditions and procedures with regard to liability for cargos which may be damaged or lost during transportation, the development of information society technologies 
of benefit to intermodal transport, through the creation of an open structure which makes it possible to follow the movement of goods along the entire intermodal chain, and paperless transport, involving the harmonisation of document regulations and the creation of a single electronic window. The Commission has also planned a series of horizontal measures, using research and technological development projects to introduce innovation aimed at utilising new technologies to develop innovative services and increase productivity. Clearly, a discussion on intermodality requires, at the same time, a sharp cultural change in the culture of enterprise. 
The globalisation and liberalisation of the markets are already producing a substantial increase in the demand for the transportation of goods and commodities. The high growth rates are inducing competition which will increasingly affect the volumes transported and, therefore, mergers and other forms of association between operators in the sector will be absolutely inevitable. Finally, I would like to thank the Members who contributed actively to the preparation of a resolution acceptable to the majority of the committee. I should also like to inform you that, as far as the few amendments tabled are concerned, I essentially endorse all of them, with the exception of Amendment No 3, with regard to which I am somewhat perplexed by the reference to State aid.

 Mr President, there was an extremely serious occurrence in Italy yesterday. On the grounds that pills do no harm and that "Marijuana is a treatment for tumours", the Minister for Health undermined the dignity of the individual by calling for the drug to be legalised. All this has happened while we are preparing for Nice with a Charter of Fundamental Rights, the preamble to which affirms that the European Union is founded on the indivisible, universal principle of human dignity. The incident also coincides with a Community action programme on the prevention of drug addiction which, precisely because it is a preventive action, identifies the drug as a phenomenon which should certainly be avoided and, I feel, should not be supported. Pino Arlacchi, Under Secretary-General of the United Nations and Executive Director of the UN Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention, condemned the Italian Minister for Health's speech, for the Minister was clearly ignorant of the good news on prevention recorded in the United States, Spain and even Bolivia and Peru, and Mr Arlacchi called upon the Italian government ...

 We welcome the liberalisation process taking place in the sector, for we are convinced that the creation of an extensive European market will lead to significant growth and improvement. We support the Council’s common position because it represents a balance which marks a new stage in the opening-up of the rail market, pending the adoption of provisions ensuring balanced competition between and within modes of transport. The railways are the product of a permanent and technically efficient combination of activities carried out by different operators – infrastructure managers, railway undertakings, station managers etc – with many different functions. These operators can perform the roles of both infrastructure manager and railway undertaking if this is economically more efficient. There is nothing to indicate that completely separating these functions improves the openness, efficiency or safety of the system. Complete separation is not a necessary condition for opening up the European single market railway market. The existence of firms which perform the functions of both infrastructure management and railway undertakings at the same time is not a barrier to the opening-up of the market, in that transparent, non-discriminatory procedures are established and monitored by an independent regulator. What is more, an integrated company is generally in a better position to develop new technologies relating to both the infrastructure management and the railway undertaking. A railway company whose decisions are oriented towards achieving the best possible technical and economic situation is in a position to implement the necessary innovations rapidly and to assume the responsibility of the investment risks. The railway system is a technically diversified system which, in any case, whatever the organisational solution adopted, requires substantial coordination. There is a greater guarantee of safety when the management of the railway system is entrusted to an integrated company for the following reasons: -	the company controls all the elements of the system and their interaction; -	it receives quicker and more detailed feedback regarding events affecting the system; -	it gives the authorities the security of there being a single body responsible for the safety of the system. Respect for the principles of fairness and transparency in the allocation of capacity or in pricing is essential, but it cannot just be assumed that the separation system is the best way of ensuring that these principles are respected. In effect, an integrated company system, a railway authority, as provided for in the common position adopted in March, would be perfectly capable of guaranteeing non-discriminatory network access and guaranteeing fair line prices. In addition to the contribution of the State supervisory organs which already exist to some extent, more effective and extensive supervision of competition in the European railway transport sector would thus be provided by the railway authority envisaged in the Council’s common position. Finally, with regard to the derogation, I fully support Mr Collins’ view.

It is now nine years since the 1991 directive was produced and it is time to update it. However, it would seem that the new directive is limited almost exclusively to the tasks, roles and responsibilities of the self-employed and does not evaluate sufficiently the growth in illegal trafficking which is, sadly, linked to uncontrolled and uncontrollable mass migration, particularly in the Balkans, which has consequences not only in purely financial terms but also in the wider social context in the countries which are already part of the European Union. It is therefore necessary and appropriate for us to avail ourselves of the results of the work of the money-laundering task force without delay. The Commission proposes in the directive to lay down an obligation to provide information, but we are worried about the handling of the information. It might be appropriate to set up an authority or permanent monitoring centre, considering the considerable diversity of types of money laundering. The reference to banks or art dealers or auctioneers is too narrow in its scope, for not only tax havens but also Albanian pyramid companies and small commercial activities could be included which are a cover for illegal trafficking. Clearly, prevention has not been sufficient to date, so the alternative is now to resort to the budget to establish penalties. Finally, it should be noted that money-laundering operations should also be included in evaluations of respect for human rights because illegal activities are often linked to the arms and drugs trades and the trafficking of women for prostitution and children for paedophilia. Therefore, an evaluation of whether to accept a candidate State for enlargement should include careful investigation of its illegal money-laundering activities!

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have just come back from Tunisia where, for a time, I was the guest of a Member of the Tunisian Government, and on no occasion did I see evidence of any of the points which have been mentioned during this debate. I did, however, see a country which is firmly committed to modernisation and I witnessed the great enthusiasm with which the sectors of environmental development, land reclamation, agriculture, tourism and the construction of large infrastructures are being identified.  I saw that they are attempting to boost their economy in order to avoid further migration which could certainly affect relations between the Mediterranean countries and the countries which are now part of the same European Union as well. I personally witnessed cultural exchanges taking place between universities and saw that the country is regaining a strong cultural identity and is committed to restoring historic town centres, rural tourism and craft trades.  I noted the high level of involvement of schools in educational programmes with a series of interdisciplinary activities. And I saw absolutely no evidence pointing to an absence of associationism. On the contrary: very strong, living associationism exists between young people and women, in particular, and there is also a remarkable spirit of partnership between institutions.  I learned from a question that we are lamenting the fact that the local press refuses to report cases of human rights abuse. If this is so and censorship is taking place, it means that the freedom of the press does exist there, to the extent that the local press can even refuse to report any of Tunisia’s positions which do deny human rights.  Well then, I do not feel that the situation is so bad. Rather, I suspect that the European Union is taking political action against not just Tunisia but also the Balkan countries, for example, in deciding to provide greater or lesser financial incentives for the countries depending on the internal policy adjustments which the countries can guarantee. This would indeed be an operation totally removed from the real meaning of applied and shared democracy; it would have very little to do with human rights and still less to do with relations between potential enlargement countries and the European Union itself.

 Madam President, I absolutely agree with the rapporteur’s analysis and I would also like to thank the chairman of the Committee on Culture, Mr Gargani, for his praiseworthy work in a mediation process that was also, considerably difficult.  Of course, we felt the need to simplify and consolidate the previous programmes, but everyone hoped that the Culture 
programme could help to promote, for example, the unique features of each cultural sector, even – and I could say especially – of the unique features of less well-known sectors. We hope that this, at the least, will come about during the evaluation process.  We sincerely believe in the validity of cultural action, among other things in terms of making a contribution to the social, as well as economic, development of a people. And a fully-fledged Europe can compete with the rest of the world and fully rediscover its roots, highlight its common cultural heritage and enhance and restore dignity to cultural and linguistic islands that until now were less well-known. As for the important educational task which the European Union must carry out as regards culture, one of the programme’s most obvious limitations is the level of funding – we have heard this several times – which censures the fact that the Council at least – certainly not the Commissioner – is not completely aware of the importance of cultural action: the document which prioritises the economic factor over social integration also bears witness to this.  The overall growth of the European Union and the awareness of being European citizens: this is why we believe that the Culture 2000 programme, albeit with a scarcity of funds, can make a considerable contribution to this great common goal.

While Article 158 of the EC Treaty aims to promote the harmonious development of all of the Communities, we must say that the goal of eliminating disparities is still a long way from being fulfilled, or rather in some cases, as with Italy’s Objective 1 zones, paradoxically, disparities are being exacerbated, particularly because of the continuing weak approach of the structural apparatus to Community procedures and the persistent muddle of procedures; despite the changes to the rules, the Community structures have not yet been streamlined. In the first place, if administrative procedures are not simplified, it will be hard to attain Community objectives on reform, with a view to greater efficiency and concentration. In this respect, the Commission document has shortcomings, as it makes no recommendation to the Member States to simplify procedures and national legislation for the presentation and examination of projects by the national authorities, and for their funding, execution and monitoring. SMEs, micro-enterprises and craft businesses in particular are still “weak operators”, given that it is precisely for them that the regulatory and administrative constraints imposed by some Member States, including Italy, are major obstacles to accessing Structural Funds.  A considerable stumbling block is the fact that the regions and other operators find it impossible and are incapable of making plans in time. In view of this, in accordance with the decision on the 97/99 guidelines (Howitts report), the Commission should have consulted Parliament in time. In fact, 
it found a sort of convenient excuse in the shortening of the programming stage in the Member States, and it published the guidelines back in July 1999, even before the new Parliament had taken up its legislative duties, thereby preventing Parliament itself from having any influence on the current content of the guidelines. This is why the mid-term review, provided for under Article 42 of Regulation 1260/99, will be of considerable importance.  In general, the current guidelines cannot be considered as clear or transparent. They merely touch on the – nevertheless important – issue of the possibility of assessing the progress made in relation to 
verifiable objectives which are completely consonant with the strategies followed in Community policies, and they do not pay enough attention to the implications of enlargement, so much so that they do not contain specific provisions or clarifications as regards either regional and national authorities, or candidate countries. That said, the differing approach adopted in the guidelines, which are not geared to geographical objectives, but rather to policy areas, can be considered as positive. While in theory this may meet the need for concentration and therefore the efficiency of interventions, we cannot help wondering whether the current situation of the Objective 1 zones allows, in practice, a policy of integrated 
interventions, for which an operational instrument to coordinate the appropriations is necessary. We could then, theoretically, also support the Commission’s call for a management unit for structural assistance in the Member States, with the task of coordinating the implementation and administration of structural assistance there, 

provided that this unit does not become a centralising instrument at supranational level, but guarantees real help for those zones – and I stress this once again – which, owing to a whole string of converging negative factors, have not yet harnessed Structural Funds to sufficient levels, with the result that replacing the geographical objective with policy areas could, in fact, amount to a negative intervention.  The guidelines, as adopted by the Commission, are very limited because, instead of meeting the aim of providing guidance, they are providing a shopping list of possible measures, a shopping list which, as it fails to set priorities in ascending order, could even put the Member States on the wrong track by guiding them towards a series of proposals that is at odds with the desired concentration.  We could say that, in this state of affairs, we have once again missed the opportunity to really strengthen sustainable urban development by ring-fencing ever-increasing urbanisation and, hence the destruction of the countryside. There has been no appropriate assessment of the importance of the global grant instrument, which could prove to be extremely useful in redressing the balance between urban and rural zones and, moreover, would accord proper status to local bodies which, being independent, could bring about the conditions for territorial development more quickly, and make a practical contribution to the efforts to reform the Structural Funds and to achieve the objectives of efficiency, concentration and administrative reform. Rural areas must truly be seen as a resource which should be increasingly invested in, by encouraging young people to remain in rural areas in order to prevent their economic and social disintegration.  It is now a fact that in order to attain this goal, rural areas need to see the creation of new jobs, which are no longer solely connected with agriculture, in the traditional sense – although this sector is important for the protection of the environment and the preservation of biodiversity – but also, for instance, in rural tourism, sport and cultural activities, environmental projects, SMEs, services, and so on. A genuine flaw in the guidelines are specific guidelines for the orchestration of coordination between the ESF and employment strategy. The fact that this coordination is being put into effect for the first time during the 2000-2006 programme period implies that the Member States really do need "guidelines". I must also stress that once again the Commission is, in fact, skirting the issue of practical action on equal opportunities. In conclusion, the document is not particularly satisfactory, and in some aspects is disappointing.

 Mr President, I hope that what the Danish Member just said will never happen, and that families will retain their traditional structure. No, no, I do not think there is anything to laugh about: in my opinion, families must not adopt a structure that is not part of the normal order of society. We are talking about an extremely sensitive issue, relationships within families, especially as regards citizens’ mobility within the boundaries of the European Union. Essentially, what we are dealing with is the protection of minors, which is already very difficult when they live in families that we could define as normal, or rather traditional.  I think that a particularly sensitive aspect is that of listening to children. Many of us, the different Member States of the European Union, have already addressed the issue of using children’s guardians at a time when families are going through a particularly difficult time in their lives, such as when couples separate, with all the repercussions – especially in psychological terms – that affect the children involved.  In the very short time I am allowed I would like to emphasise just a few points. Something that is of particular interest is parental authority, especially in relation to nomadic peoples who are now present in large numbers throughout Europe. Very often, as local administrators as well, we are faced with situations which are particularly regrettable and which are not covered by legislation.  This regulation certainly represents a significant step forwards – and we are grateful to the rapporteur for this – but we need to return to the issue with particular reference to nomadic children, to Roma children, and therefore to everything related to the internal problems of these families, including, precisely, with regard to mobility in Europe.

 The fact that the Commission has waited until the last minute to ask for negotiations is certainly regrettable, especially considering the overall course of the whole affair, which already, in recent years, has experienced a conflict created in the institutional consultation framework, with regard to Parliament’s role in an agreement which has significant budgetary implications. We are fast approaching 30 November and the new agreement appears to be at the conclusion stage. The Commission has therefore given little attention to the economic level of the Objective 1 and 2 regions which, as they depend to a large degree on fishing, are seriously concerned about maintaining employment in the sector. No-one wants to call into question efficient instruments for cooperation with Morocco through negotiations, which reinforce, where possible, the interests of both the Community and Moroccan operators and emphasise the sense of solidarity which, moreover, even in sectors that are not purely economic, has been shown daily, especially between the countries of Southern Europe in the Mediterranean area. The European fishing fleet which, I may add, is so careful to fish in accordance with specific legislation concerning the environment – closed seasons, fishing groups, bans on fishing with sweep nets and trawl nets etc. – needs socio-economic compensation measures following an agreement which further limits its activity, including compensation for the processing industry. One thing must be clear: the compensation must not be to the detriment of the agricultural sector, which has already suffered notable cuts in its budget. In this sense, the new FIFG regulation is fairly reassuring as it covers unforeseen events in the fisheries sector as well as the consequences of international agreements.  Finally, a remark on the role of Parliament, whose Members must act as observers in all the negotiation procedures in order to fully protect the interests of the European fishing fleet.

 Mr President, when speaking of Kosovo in the address she gave this morning, President Fontaine said: ‘The guns have fallen silent, the horrors have ceased, but peace still remains to be built’. The guns may well have fallen silent, Mr President, but the anti-personnel mines continue their butchery; the horror of war is over but not the horror of the discovery of mass graves day after day, a tragic, heart-rending testimony to a contempt for the right to live of individuals and populations, a right which is no less than respect for the diversity and identity of a people for whose affirmation we will fight both here and in our national parliaments. ’It is not acceptable that in the very heart of Europe, human rights should once more be flouted in such a barbaric manner, ’ declared Mrs Fontaine once again. We are in agreement on this point as well, reaching forward as we are to be part of the process of solidarity between nations through a common foreign and security policy for which my group has fought right from the start of its representation in the European Parliament. Starting with the Balkans, with the urgency and determination which today"s situation demands, the Common Foreign and Security Policy will allow us to achieve the objectives of peace, economic stability and the certainty that human rights are being respected. NATO has won the war and Europe must build the peace: this is the challenge which we must take up immediately, in the loud and clear definition of the role that Europe will assume in the construction of the peace process, in political wisdom, in the quality of the steps that it will take in order to prevent the migration flows which it is currently suffering and will continue to do so in the years to come, from causing religious, economic and social conflict, especially in areas in which unemployment is increasing at an alarming rate. Of course, the establishment of an agency will not in itself solve the problem. However, all remains to be seen. How will this body, which we hope will guarantee rapid, efficient, useful, rational and fair measures, be structured and made operative, with the appropriate participation in the reconstruction, above all, of all those areas such as Italy and, in particular, Puglia, whose tourist trades have suffered extensive economic damage from the war and the effects of migration. It is true that the war has left deep wounds: they are clearly visible. They can be clearly seen on territories and on the people who lost their lives in or were driven from those territories; but it has also harmed certain governments, which are left without a clear foreign policy. In any case, it has displayed the failure of ten years of diplomacy and highlighted the oversights, the shortcomings and the squanderings, of international co-operation. Europe"s undertaking, then, cannot be understood as merely revolving around the reconciliation of the parties involved in the conflict, but the measure of its performance will depend upon the overall ability it displays in reconciling the Stability Pact, reconstruction and ever-increasing unemployment. In his statement, the President of the Commission undertook to spend money on reconstruction, not bureaucracy. Let us hope that this reconstruction will be more than just material. We must rebuild roads, schools, ports and water systems, but we must also restore the faith of peoples who for years have been deprived of the right to live with their loved ones on their own land with their own jobs, and who are now hoping to enjoy the peaceful life denied to them for years. If Europe were to pursue the aim indicated by Professor Prodi of providing the Balkans with a clear political and economic future, it would certainly achieve a great deal, but it would not be performing the whole of its task, which includes making a substantial contribution to building a path for democratic, and of course economic, development, but essentially social and cultural development, in the knowledge that reconciliation is all the stronger and more stable, the higher the level of tolerance and respect for diversity of the parties is concerned.

 Mr President, I would like to begin by complimenting Mr Bowis on the professionalism, determination and timeliness with which he concluded the drafting of this important report. I also congratulate the rapporteur on his immense efforts in negotiations with the Council to reach an agreement at first reading. I believe, in fact, that it is of the utmost importance that the Centre is operational as soon as possible in order to guarantee the health monitoring and the rapid alert system which must be provided by the Union in order adequately to tackle the challenges brought about by its imminent enlargement and by a globalised world which is increasingly unprotected against the spread of diseases still unknown to us: SARS in 2003 and the very recent bird flu are specific examples. I therefore consider that 1 January 2005 has to be the ultimate deadline for the launch of this Centre. Another point that I would like to stress is the initial and refresher training for all health personnel in the Member States of the Union, and the Centre should be responsible for this. Ready for the entrance of ten new countries, the Union should aim to provide all health systems with the instruments, means and knowledge to create an effective synergy between all Member States and, in that way, to guarantee the coherence of the Union’s action proposed by the Centre. I will conclude by mentioning that the ability to respond adequately to an international health threat depends, to a large extent, on pre-emptively adopting preparatory plans for rapid action, coordinated at European level. The Centre should provide this essential service.

 Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank all the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, who have made a valuable contribution to the drafting of this report, which is important in both scientific and social terms. As I have already had the opportunity to reiterate on other occasions, I believe that public health should increasingly be treated as a matter of primary importance in European policies, not least in view of the forthcoming enlargement. This recommendation is the first step towards the harmonisation and coordination of policies regarding the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Sadly, cancer is the main cause of death in industrialised countries, affecting patients, families and operators themselves. The socio-economic impact is therefore enormous, not just in terms of the cost of treating and supporting patients but also in terms of the emotional strain involved. In addition to the human tragedy, the situation causes a continual decrease in the proportion of the healthy population whose productivity and know-how are the mainstay of European society. We can deduce from the most recent statistics that the average age of onset of these diseases is getting lower and lower: the younger the patient, the more aggressive the disease. Thus, the possibility of treating cancer undeniably depends on how early it is diagnosed; besides, late diagnosis of cancer requires aggressive and invasive forms of treatment, which are costly and have a high psychological and social impact. Although the Member States are responsible for health policies, through their national health systems, it is unthinkable that such an important prevention campaign, in both the social and public health spheres, should remain a national or regional project dependent on the economic and cultural potential of each country. The impact of this disease on society should be borne and coordinated at European level, guaranteeing equal opportunities for treatment and therefore good results across the board. The current capacity for radical treatment in oncology seems to depend more on the opportunities for prevention, based on epidemiological and etiopathogenetic knowledge and early diagnosis, rather than on surgical techniques and radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy. For example, we might take the example of gastric carcinoma, for which the five-year survival rate ranges between 95% in patients with an intramucosal carcinoma to less than 10% in patients with an advanced invasive carcinoma, despite therapy. On the one hand, a correct and adequate screening needs a maximum capacity for identifying even the smallest lesions (sensitivity) and a good capacity for distinguishing them from benign lesions (specificity) and to ensure that the diagnostic investigation is non-invasive for the patient and itself entails an almost zero risk of damage, since the procedures are, by definition, carried out on asymptomatic individuals, who are only potentially ill. Of course, the new instruments for early diagnosis, before being offered at European level, should be examined and validated carefully by means of trials. Last but not least, the excellence of ‘good practice’ in screening should be checked by analysing the mortality figures collected in all Member States and preferably entered in a European databank. Financial resources must be mobilised to increase the number of diagnostic centres and ensure that the workload entailed in screening does not jeopardise the quality of the testing or increase waiting times, which would lead to a deterioration in the quality of care for patients already suffering from cancer. It is therefore essential that European action is organised on four fronts: firstly, information and health education for European citizens; secondly, carrying out forms of screening which have already proven their worth; thirdly, periodic checks on the quality of screening; fourthly, research into the applicability of new screening methods. This recommendation will allow Europe to take unified action against what is a widespread, cruel and socially destructive disease. The urgent need for strategic action to combat cancer at European level is demonstrated by the alarming etiological fact that one European in four has or will have a malignant tumour in the course of their lives. Finally, in addition to European-level screening there ought to be guidelines for the treatment of diseases.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since 12 August, the date of his abduction, there has been no news from Dr Arjan Erkel and we do not know what has happened to him. He was kidnapped in Mukala in Dagestan and nothing has been done to free him. I feel that the European Parliament and the European Union should take action with a view not only to getting information and calling for his release but also to protecting the institutions that provide voluntary services in territories where the health situation is absolutely disgraceful.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, information technology is the backbone of the future development of every country in the world and it is based on technology – hardware – and science – software. At present, all technological innovations are protected by their patentability; but software development gives rise to copyright which protects its intellectual property. To make this clearer, let me draw a parallel with the music world. An electronic computer is an instrument which is used to create music, not composed of notes but of codes and commands, alternating with rhythm and a composed sequence, made by the developer, giving rise to different actions and results. What would happen to music if, one day, you could patent scales, chords, trills and everything else that makes the world of classical music so rich and exciting? Information technology would suffer the same fate: with patents, every command, every sequence of codes and algorithms would be protected, and the market transformed into a web of restrictions. If all existing patents had to be validated, then all software development would be restricted, limited and increasingly inhibited, since all small and medium-sized enterprises and programmers would be forced to buy rights or licences and virtually pushed out of the market. The intellectual property of a painting or a book is not protected by patenting the subject or argument, but by guaranteeing its distribution subject to copyright laws, stimulating other minds to produce original works, similar but not copies, improving, where possible, on the original work or reinterpreting it on the basis of different or more interesting models. An expanding market, open to new horizons of lively criticism and fantasy, such as the European market, cannot allow itself to impose more regulations which would, in actual fact, further constrain development in the European nations. We firmly believe that the McCarthy report cannot be accepted, since supporting it would seriously jeopardise the technological growth and development which can be generated only where people have a free spirit and mind.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Jöns, on her report, which is rich in content and promises very good results, and I know what I am saying because I am head of a breast centre in Italy. I fully endorse all the calls to the Member States to achieve a rate of voluntary participation in breast screening programmes by women of over 70%, a level which no country has yet reached. I consider to be important the call to promote and disseminate in the Member States technical and care training initiatives and initiatives to provide patients suffering from breast cancer with psychological support, and to promote at Community level training and specialisation courses which – and this is my addition – are underwritten by university institutions, second level Masters degrees. These courses could even be financed out of the training funds. I can support the call to create European registers on tumours as soon as possible so that reliable, comparable data is, at last, available throughout the European Union on tumour growth in general. It is right to call upon the Member States to use resources from the Structural Funds to fund the creation of infrastructure in the health sector. I fully endorse the rapporteur’s call for health insurance for, inter alia
, aesthetic aids such as bra prostheses, wigs and whatever else a patient needs to restore their appearance as closely as possible to how is was before the illness. In many states, reimbursement is not provided for these aids. There are, however, a number of points which give cause for concern. I would like to point out first of all that a point is missing from the report produced by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities which is essential if that committee is to be able to claim the title ‘Equal Opportunities’. The rapporteur has made no reference to cancer in men. I regret to say that this type of cancer affects men too: basically, one man per 100 000 people between the ages of 58 and 63 develops breast cancer. I would add that the prognosis for men is more unfavourable than for women precisely because men are not subject to screening and the cancer is diagnosed late. I wonder whether it would not be appropriate for the committee to grant men at least the same right to information as is accorded to women. Male cancer accounts for 1% of all breast tumours and I realise that its incidence is not economically significant enough to think about providing specific screening. I do, however, believe that an awareness campaign directed at the male population would be appropriate so that men can have the same chance as women of having their lives prolonged and their quality of life increased by early diagnosis. Young men are the most likely to develop breast cancer because of the wide use of female hormones and metabolisers, which spark off gynaecomastia which often goes untreated. The second point on which I would like to focus concerns item 7(g) of the report in question. I feel that informing patients that they can exercise the right to lodge complaints against doctors for malpractice is unnecessary, in that this right is already laid down in the European Charter of Patients’ Rights, and that it is dangerous, for it could jeopardise the relationship of trust between doctors and patients on which studies and research have shown that half the success of treatment depends. I feel it would make more sense for these kinds of controls on the appropriateness of the quality of treatment to be carried out by dedicated institutions such as, for example, the European board for monitoring centres of excellence – specialist breast units.

Thank you, President-in-Office of the Council, for attending today and for the information you have given us. The forthcoming Thessaloniki Summit is of considerable importance for the future of the Union, both in the medium and the long term. It is important to lay the foundations so that Europe, or rather the Union, soon to complete an enlargement process which is unprecedented in its history and in the history of the world, can increasingly combine economic power with political dignity. It is to do justice to the latter that I would like to talk about the policies neglected by that same Union, something which is even more serious as it grows in importance. Health, for example, is one such policy. With reference to Article 152 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, I acknowledge national autonomy for health issues, but a Europe which is heading for enlargement to include 25 countries cannot underestimate the impact which the social and healthcare problems of these countries will have on the political and social economy of the Europe of the future. This is why the UEN Group recently met in Turin and discussed precisely these enlargement-related social and healthcare issues, producing a document that has already been submitted to the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi. The results of this work were not reassuring, so much so that our hope is that, during the six-month Italian Presidency, public health will be included among the Union’s priorities as soon as possible. The globalisation process could see ill people and diseases knocking loudly on Europe’s doors, finding us lacking, as has already happened with regard to SARS infection: a situation which tested our health coordination and cooperation abilities, a matter which the forthcoming Italian Presidency must address if it truly wishes to prevent emergencies and tackle the health service divide that the individual nations are experiencing and which will induce people to travel en masse
 to countries with health service facilities and centres of excellence, which, in turn, might be in danger of paralysis. I hope that the Union will decide to give consideration to this and that the next Presidency of the Union will put forward proposals in this respect.

Mr President, Minister, members of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, on 7 April last, we 
addressed the issue of the SARS crisis in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus, a matter which concerned more or less all the Member States and other countries as well. I must point out that the proposals advanced to the Commission by the UEN Group on that occasion have almost all been adopted by some of the Member States, including Italy. In the same speech, I warned that the virus could be transmitted via goods and animals from infected countries which were not yet known to be carrying the infection. After that difficult period of heated discussion between optimistic and pessimistic viewpoints on the possibility and necessity of stopping the spread of the virus, the European countries are now paying more heed to the issue, and more preventive measures are being taken too, but the time has come to concern ourselves with another factor. The problem which is gradually emerging in many Member States is that of public healthcare – are there enough staff, resources and facilities available to assist SARS patients? It is time to ask ourselves whether each Member State has these resources and appropriate centres for treating virulent infectious diseases such as SARS; if they do not, then all the measures taken to delay its arrival in Europe will be in vain. Today, I would add, the issues which need to be addressed most urgently are these: the lack, not to say complete absence, of negative pressure isolation rooms, necessary to prevent nosocomial infection, in the principal hospitals of the States of the European Union; the impossibility of quarantining a patient highly likely to have the disease but who refuses to be placed in isolation, due to the fact that there are no laws imposing enforced hospitalisation except on grounds of mental health; we need to start thinking about training, setting up specialised healthcare teams in the individual states to treat patients with diseases such as SARS, who cannot be given specific treatment but only adjunct treatment and who require input from a wide range of specialists – lung specialists, virologists, anaesthetists, resuscitation specialists, internists, dieticians – and nursing staff capable of managing and caring for patients suffering from SARS. I would like to invite you to consider this viral disease as proof for Europe of the possibility of the transmission of diseases which are currently unknown to us or which we have stamped out in the past but which globalisation could bring back to Europe, as I said in my speech on 14 November 2001. The European Parliament and, in this case, the Commission – which I am addressing here – must learn from this experience and recognise the crucial role played by public health services.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make a number of points on behalf of the UEN Group. A year and a half ago, I tabled a question to the Commission stressing that such incidents can occur, for viruses, bacteria and toxic substances are used and manipulated throughout the world without our knowledge. The present viral infection, known as SARS, has caused a veritable wave of panic throughout the world in case it spreads quickly. The fears derive, first and foremost, from the fact that we know little about the infection at present or, at any rate, not enough to be sure that we will all escape infection. The source appears to be in the Guadalong province of China, from where the infection spread to the major cities of the Far East: Hong Kong, Singapore, Bangkok, Shanghai and Bejing, and then throughout the world, causing infection and death. As you all know, there is not much control in these areas in terms of either hygiene or the use of appropriate drugs to fight these diseases. We do not know the causative agent of the viral infection in question. It was probably formed when an animal virus, a coronavirus, mutated. It is thought that a virus escaped when a scientist was manipulating it to create the vaccine or modify it. It appears that the scientist died from the virus. What we do know about this syndrome is that infection takes place by – take note – direct transmission but also environmental transmission. The only way of diagnosing the syndrome is as yet symptomatic, for there are no clinical diagnosis kits available. There is no applicable treatment. Infected patients can only be given adjunct treatment, since doctors have not yet identified the active antiviral agents which would be able to fight it. Clearly, since it is not yet possible to identify the causative agent, the people of the European Union and the rest of the world are faced with major difficulties in terms of what action to take, not least in view of a number of major factors which are responsible for the spread of the virus. The source of the spread of the virus appears to be one of the largest financial centres of the Far East, through which large numbers of people and a lot of goods pass: China, a country which has only consented to take part in the exchange of information today – there is no Internet connection between Cuba and China. For all these reasons, we call upon the Commission to take a number of measures. Firstly, to set up a task force of experts – not 
a body 
or a committee – to monitor the spread of the disease within the EU. When I go into the operating theatre, I choose a deputy and an assistant; I do not want a school. Secondly, to define, together with the WHO, a standard isolation procedure for suspected cases in EU citizens, to be applied in all the Member States, so that the Member States are not all left to decide on their own national procedures. Thirdly, to call upon all the Member States to set up a database of people who have passed through or stayed in the areas at risk in the last three months, monitoring their state of health, so to be able to take prompt action should they prove to be infected. Fourthly, to lay down, together with the WHO, procedures and time frames for quarantining and disinfecting people, animals and goods coming from the areas at risk, thus avoiding different levels of protection being adopted in the different States. Fifthly, to establish an emergency health fund similar to the funds which used to be set up in respect of natural disasters, so that each Member State can equip itself to face this potential epidemic. These organisation and information strategies are essential if we are to be able to take immediate, focused action when a vaccine becomes available.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mrs Stihler on her report. As an oncological surgeon and university research scientist, I read the report very carefully and support many of the proposals it contains. I feel, however, that the tone is excessively alarmist and I will tell you why. For 50 years or so, silicones have been widely used in products for large-scale consumption such as drinks, puddings, cakes, drugs, paediatric materials, pacemakers, cardiac valves, lipsticks, creams and fabrics – and it has been proved that none of these cause cancer in humans. For 40 years, silicone breast implants have been used throughout the world for both aesthetic reasons, as in the case of serious psychological problems, and for reconstruction, as in the case of mastectomies carried out to remove breast cancer where there are no age restrictions. In 1986, the University of Los Angeles examined 3000 women who had had implants for at least six years and found no risk of increasing neoplasia 
or to mobility. In 1992, the University of Calgary, examining 11 000 women, reached the same conclusions. The American Association of Rheumatologists also promoted two studies on the risk of autoimmune pathology in women with silicone implants, which recorded good tolerance in all cases. It was discovered that the average life of implants is between 15 and 25 years and spontaneous rupture is often asymptomatic. There are therefore no sufficiently serious grounds for preventing the use of implants, except in young women less than 18 years old. I must point out that the report makes no reference to breast implants inserted as preventive treatment in cases where the results of predictive genetic tests have shown a high risk of carcinogenesis in patients, tests carried out particularly on the children of mothers who have suffered from cancer, which is a practice which will become increasingly widespread. As regards paragraph 10a, I would like to point out that patient consent forms are already in use in all the States of the Union. It is compulsory for the patient to sign a form after receiving all the necessary information, before any treatment is applied, including implants. I therefore feel it superfluous to mention a passport. I also feel it would be useful to set up European and national registers containing data collected on both aesthetic and therapeutic breast implants. Furthermore, it is important for an annual check to be carried out by a breast specialist and a free echography performed, without the need for invasive examinations such as mammographies or CAT scans,
 which still subject patients to radiation and are practices which are on the expensive side for national health services. The collection of data on implants and regulated follow-up would contribute to the production of a valid survey allowing a more precise assessment to be carried out, which would certainly be reassuring for all women.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my compliments to Mr Mario Mantovani, who has carried out the onerous task of determining the difficult challenges which health care systems and public health polices in European Union countries will have to face, in view of the ageing of the population, and, not least, in view of enlargement. Although the provision of health care in general and care for the elderly in particular is essentially the responsibility of the Member States, it is right that we look to broader European cooperation in order to face these problems, given the extremely difficult situation which countries continue to experience. One of the difficulties is the nursing shortage: in fact, an ever-increasing number of nurses will be needed. The increased life expectancy of the European population, with a growing adult proportion, will create the difficult question of the staff who must care for them, staff who must, moreover, be increasingly qualified owing to the specific nature of the diseases which affect the elderly. Employment of nursing staff has already increased by more than twice the average in the last five years: a level of employment which, however, is still not enough to meet the demand. Secondly, it is easy to foresee that this shortage will be felt particularly keenly when, thanks to enlargement, there will be increased mobility of patients from the CEEC, whose health systems provide less than those in the Community, because they will automatically turn to cross-border health services. From this point of view, an issue comes to the fore: ensuring a high level of human health protection, as set out in Article 152 of the Treaty of Amsterdam and as specified by the goals of the Community action programme in the field of public health, which, moreover, calls for universal and equal access to health services, the constant improvement of these services and promotion of the social inclusion of people with disabilities and people in the most vulnerable categories. Qualitative principles in the field of health care can be put into effect through the creation of specialised higher training for nurses, financed by European training funds, which encourage people to obtain further professional qualifications in important areas such as oncology, transplants, heart surgery and all the age-related diseases. With the launch of this higher training, we will ensure access to health services for European citizens, the provision of high-quality care and financially sustainable care systems, which is included in the three objectives proposed by the Barcelona European Council. In order to ensure care for all, however, the European Union Member States need to take steps to raise young people’s awareness of paramedical professions. The solution to this problem must be implemented quickly since it concerns all the Member States. It is all well and good to raise awareness of the profession among young people of the Member States but, up to now, this has been on too small a scale, so much so that there are far fewer qualified nurses than the countries need. This opportunity should therefore also be extended to CEEC qualifications, in order to resolve a twofold problem quickly: to respond to the nursing crisis in the Member States and to respond to the situation of countless immigrants seeking work in Europe. What I am about to say may sound like a provocation, but I cannot avoid talking to you about another serious problem which concerns citizens from every European country, that is the 500 000 job cuts in the engineering industry over the next four or five years, a figure I have been given by an international trade union source. This employment problem could be resolved in part though the transfer of qualified resources from one sector to another. The mobility and retraining of the unemployed engineering workers who hold an advanced secondary education qualification could be achieved by providing them with access to information on nursing. I would close by calling on everyone to reflect on what has been said regarding the need to remedy as soon as possible the nursing shortage in the European Union, the need to meet the quality criteria for care specified in the Community action programme by providing higher training, and the need to respond to the specific employment needs of the citizens of the Member States with solutions such as mobility and retraining, looking, where these prove inadequate, to human resources from the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.

 Madam President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines on her particularly important report, for, as she herself has stressed, before us is the first document dedicated by the European Parliament to universities as recognised institutions. I fully agree with Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines that the time has come for Europe not just to fund but to manage and promote a model of education without frontiers at European level, restoring research to its institutional home, the university. I therefore feel I must stress the importance of consolidating the European higher education area, an assuredly important goal which, although involving the individual universities of the Member States, would affect neither their autonomy nor their cultural history while providing for what will, I am sure, be high-quality teaching. Moreover, the movement of students, researchers and lecturers is an excellent way of bringing about exchanges of skills and of developing critical faculties, and has great social value, with a view to ensuring successful cultural integration in the future. I deeply believe that the establishment of a network of higher education and the results of research will not only bring reciprocal evaluation of performance but will make any monitoring process more cost-effective too. It is therefore becoming increasingly important for the European Union to implement a support policy through the programming of funds for university research, bearing in mind that the task of a university as an institution is not just to teach but, above all, to carry out research and experiments, thus enhancing the role of researchers who would otherwise seek more professionally rewarding activities elsewhere, specifically in the United States. Looking back at the funding hitherto appropriated for research by the European Union, I note that a huge amount has been dedicated to small and medium-sized enterprises, which are certainly important in the overall economies of our countries, while the sector of university research has been neglected. I am afraid I must point out, on the basis of this analysis, that much of the research funded was then subcontracted precisely to university researchers for its implementation. I realise that many resources have certainly been made available to the European Union’s universities thus far – the Fifth Framework Programme, the Sixth Framework Programme, Erasmus etc. – but we have a further task: to further convince those working on this document that it is time to restore to the institution of the universities their supreme role in research, acknowledging that they have performed this role for over 600 years and achieved excellent results, offering them for the benefit of the whole world without claiming property rights.

 The European research area is happening: it is an ambitious goal of the European Union, which is proposing to coordinate research activities through the Sixth Framework Programme in such a way as to enable Europe to compete against the other large nations of the world in the field of science and technology. The actions carried out within the framework of the Sixth Framework Programme for research and technological development 2002-2006 will, for the first time, be implemented in line with the general research objectives set by the Treaty establishing the European Community, namely: -	strengthening the scientific and technological basis of European industry; -	encouraging it to become more competitive at international level; -	promoting research activities in line with principles of the Treaty establishing the European Community. The priority thematic research areas proposed in the Sixth Framework Programme have been defined on the basis of ‘European added value criteria’, which are: -	the intention to assemble and concentrate a critical mass of financial and human resources, limiting dispersion as far as possible; -	the need to link the various complementary competences present in the different countries of the Union and to carry out comparative studies on a European scale; -	the creation of links with the Union’s priorities and interests; -	the need for specifically transnational research.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to bring to your attention a matter which is far from unimportant and is closely connected with the enlargement of the Union. It is the matter of the protection of human health, which has always been a primary objective in all the development policies of the countries of the European Union. The Treaty of Amsterdam, in fact, lays down that a high level of health protection is guaranteed in the drawing-up and implementation of all Community policies and activities. To this end, we are making every effort to ensure that the citizens’ health is protected by means of a common, efficient, high-quality health system, as proposed by the Community Action Plan for Public Health 2001-2006. Given that to achieve such objectives we need to develop specific policies aimed at ensuring the ongoing improvement of professionalism and scientific research in the health structures of the European Union Member States, and given that the current status of the health structures – and health policies – in the candidate countries for enlargement is clearly backward compared with the situation in the European Union, I believe we should urgently take steps, by means of studies or simulations within the Member States, to identify the possible consequences of the enlargement of the Union on public health. Furthermore, we should verify that the Community acquis
 on health has been effectively adopted in the Countries of Central and Eastern Europe, and we must take into consideration control measures to prevent the entry of the candidate countries from leading to a fall in standards of health care in the countries of the Union, in view also of the recognised shortage of medical and nursing staff.

 Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Pack on her report on the Socrates programme, which has provided me with the starting point for a number of observations. We can certainly say that the main objective of developing European citizenship and, in particular, of improving the quality of the educational systems, has been fully achieved. Evidence of this are the considerable benefits derived from the programme in terms of increased cultural awareness and the overcoming of cultural prejudice and stereotypical concepts and, following on from this, the language skills acquired by those receiving Socrates grants. Despite that, the analysis revealed a number of weak points such as the integration of the Socrates programme with the Comenius, Lingua and Leonardo da Vinci programmes, which will require considerable adjustment and greater coordination and consolidation. Something which I feel demands a great deal of reflection is the financial support given to the successful applicants for Socrates grants: the appropriation is insufficient to support the students because of a quantitative grant distribution requirement that has resulted in the available sums being too small. Indeed, the situations in the Member States differ widely in the face of a global reduction in the size of the grants allocated to each student, while the parental contribution is tending to increase. As the report has already pointed out, this trend clearly generates the danger of growing inequalities between students. In this regard, the basic resources provided need to be sufficient to enable students to be independent and live without relying heavily on support from their families, considering that study grants should not be differentiated according to the country of residence of the students or the country which they visit under the project. This financial discrimination would make the programme available only to a group of individuals who can count on parental support. A further highly negative aspect of the allocation of the grants is the bureaucratic financing procedure, which is currently seriously behind schedule. This must of necessity be rectified.

 Mr President, since this is the first time I have spoken in this House, please allow me to greet the presidency, the Council and my fellow Members. The possible use of military technology and biological and chemical weapons by subversive groups is no longer a remote risk but a real civil defence problem. The loss of military secrets, experts and materials has now been verified and is the real basis that the strategy of terrorism can use to strike against the civil population, which is defenceless in the face of such new aggression. To address this new scenario of warfare, in which the enemy is well concealed in the meshes of civil society, protected by the very rights of freedom he is fighting against and where the targets are no longer just the armed forces but the civil population, it is vital to know what threats may be hanging over the safety of the citizens. In view of the fact that some nations have not signed up to the Geneva Convention on chemical and biological weapons, as we have heard, and have continued to develop these technologies of warfare, we appeal to the United States and the republics of the former Soviet Union, as well as all those states that have not taken part or signed up, to provide the international community with detailed information on the biological and chemical agents they know about which could, in some way, be traced or stolen by terrorist groups. The aim of all this is to acquire useful data as soon as possible to prevent the creation, stockpiling and spread of such means of mass destruction, and, at the same time, to prepare the necessary information measures for the staff of civil and paramilitary institutions to equip them to deal effectively and rapidly with these new scenarios of disasters caused by people without any scruples at all.

 Mr President, I too would like to thank Mr Garriga for the work that he carried out and also for the cooperation that we had in the Committee on Budgets. My thanks also go to Mr Wynn, for the whole period that we have worked together, to Mr Walter and all the Members of the committee. 2005 will, perhaps, be the first full year for the new Europe of 25 Member States – and I believe that the Commissioner, whom I thank, must not forget this. It will, therefore, be the first year in which the EU budget will be fully drafted taking into account 25 Member States. We are faced with new challenges, given that spending levels must, anyway, be maintained in order to guarantee a certain level of growth, while taking into account new requirements, always and in any case on the basis of financial discipline that must be respected, above all through parliamentary control. We hope that all this is realised and in the near future too, even more so in an enlarged Europe of 25.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that what is currently happening in the Middle East is very different from what we might have thought until a few days ago. In fact, I believe that the Middle East is gradually getting closer and is even right on our doorstep. We can see this in speeches with which, in some cases, I could not disagree more, such as Mrs Morgantini’s speech, but not just hers. Indeed, I believe that the terrorist attacks that we are witnessing within Europe must be taken into account. We cannot suddenly just consider the issue of the murder of Sheikh Yassin. As a Catholic, I reject any idea of one day hitting someone: not killing them, but just hitting them. In my opinion, this is not, however, the point. I believe that if we want to guarantee our citizens peace, tranquillity and serenity in the future, we need to draw up a very different proposal and follow very different lines of thinking. Europe, as such, cannot just be a mouthpiece for a message in terms of European funding for the Middle East area. Europe must put forward a genuine and specific proposal. I believe that this can be done, and in this case I appeal to Commissioner Patten and the Irish Council Presidency to call for an end to the conflicts. I believe that this could once again give politics a real voice and not just an issue on which to speculate in this Chamber. For those who, like me, have experienced terrorism – a different type of terrorism, ‘red terrorism’ – and have seen a bomb in the house and a brother get out through a window, political words meant nothing at the time, in the eighties. The answer that we found – as a young person at the time – was unique and truly incredible: there was a unity in purpose to achieve a single objective: to combat terrorism. I believe that this can only be done if we, as Europe, are aware of this and at the very least now compile a list of terrorist associations to be assessed at an international level. I believe that everything else is just idle chitchat.

 Mr President, in my opinion, the whole of this debate goes against the history, culture and identity of the European left wing. Why are we talking about such an issue, for what reason? We are not talking about something in order to contribute to the peace or to bring the sides to the table, but rather we are talking about a legal loophole with no repercussions, not even economic. What will this lead to? What should we do tomorrow morning with the new labels? Do you think, then, that tomorrow morning there will really be a major violation of international law on this matter? Or, should we then talk about the violation of international law in the form of the claims made by Abu Ali in our institution a few days ago, when he defined Hamas as a normal and general political force, rather than as a factor contributing to international terrorism? That constitutes a violation of international law and not a debate on subjects of this nature. Furthermore, the hard-fought-for settlements that have been brought to the table so often in this discussion about associated products are not helping to put an end to peace, that much is certain. It is certainly terrorism that prevents the parties from coming to the negotiating table. Now we are talking about something serious. I say to everyone: let us contribute to peace. I say to the Commission: let us not make absurd allegations when discussing this, when we still have to clarify the issue of funds allocated for humanitarian aid: where did they really go? I believe that when we start to discuss legal matters in this House, the dialogue ends; or we hide behind legal pretexts. So then, let us avoid this.

I would like to thank Mr Prodi for presenting this programme, which can be seen as important, and it is certainly different from what was suggested by the rumours that were going around beforehand. Of course, we cannot, however, claim that it is a great success to have established the same reference figure – 1.24 – that we already had before. I would like, however, to thank the President of the Commission for having reached an agreement, albeit an incomplete one. That being said, I must, as a young Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, certainly be anxious and express my fears for agriculture, culture, the TEN projects, technology, research, the universities and all the programmes that we launched and announced so enthusiastically. I believe that, in view of the imminent enlargement to the East, we cannot definitely say – and, above all, the Council cannot say – that this is a major agreement. We can simply say that it is a watered-down agreement. I think that Mr Colom i Naval, whom I thank for his contribution, Mr Wynn and also the President of the Commission will be able to support a young man like myself when I say that I would like to recall the words of a great personality, Ignazio de Loyola, founder of the Jesuits. He said that he feared the day when no one fought him any longer. Well, I think that we must all fight with this same spirit to see a Europe that is certainly stronger, but one that develops more and is able to have more resources for our projects.

Mr President, I also want to express my thanks, not because it is Christmas, but precisely because it is only right to acknowledge how useful it has been having a chairman like Terry Wynn, even if all these words of praise sound like a ‘beatification’ of Terry who is, on the contrary, a lively and warm personality as well as being extremely pragmatic. I want to thank all my fellow Members and coordinators for the hard work carried out in recent years. I also want to thank the Secretary-General and above all Mr de Feo, who is Italian, and all those who worked with him. Even though we have had lively exchanges within the committee, thanks are also due to the Commissioner: The fact is that young people like me want to have a revolution but in the end we cannot and so we attempt to contribute in some way. Thanks also to the Directorate-General, now skilfully led by Mr Romero, and those who worked with it. I should like to say that the work carried out by the rapporteurs in the context of the present budget has been of real importance. I would like to stress my agreement with the proposal to place administrative expenditure in the reserve, in particular for job creation, on the grounds that we must have more information. The funds for the Info-Points, which we managed to have reinstated only by recourse to the conciliation procedure, should not be granted for this year alone but also in following years. As regards TENs, I want publicly to thank everyone for the assistance this programme received, even if I do not agree with the criticisms made this morning against Mr Lunardi which may, in part, have been voiced because of jealousy harboured by a political group. I believe that the work carried out with the Italian Presidency over this period in relation to my report is something unique which I want to emphasise. Finally, thank you for supporting the amendment concerning the Centre for the Disabled, which will be presented during the budget vote. This is something I consider essential.

 Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for this report, which is, inter alia
, technically detailed. We will give our full support as regards expenditure, so much so that, for my part, I have sent a letter signed jointly by myself, as Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, and the Chairman of the Committee, supporting the Commission’s proposal on the IDA programme as regards raising the maximum funding level. What is the reason for this? We feel that 10% is only a symbolic gesture whereas raising the figure to 30% is a tangible action, which will show people that Europe is close to the citizens rather than far away, particularly where TENs are concerned. As the rapporteur for this subject, however, I would like to speak about TENs in general. I feel that raising the maximum level is important for trans-European networks in general. We started with 10%, we raised the figure to 20% at first reading and now we are talking about 30%: this is significant. In addition to this, however, I feel that we need to amend the report on TENs so that it provides the possibility of introducing a subsidised system, with regard to all the networks included in the TENs in all sectors, including telecommunications and including IDA, in order to give the States the option of doing all this on the ground where they have problems with local authorities. I believe this is something that could streamline the procedure and provide an increasingly smooth channel for funding to reach the territory. In addition, I must mention what is known as e
-rewarding, which we already see as a comparative document and which should, in the future, reveal the good States and the bad States and, above all, make it possible to intervene where it is necessary to use the funds in question. Lastly, I would state that we certainly do not support what is known as the quick shortlist, in that it runs counter to the procedures of the Treaties. That area is not the responsibility of the Commission but the responsibility of the Council and Ecofin, on the one hand, and the European Parliament, on the other.

 Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, the Commission, Mr Wynn and the Secretariat staff, excellently led, as always, by Mr de Feo. This budget, ladies and gentlemen, with which the Europe of 15 comes to an end, is historic because it brings us, at last, to a Europe of 25; furthermore, it can be seen as a pre-election campaign budget. The solutions that we found apply to everything and everyone. What I am concerned about in this case is what happens next, what I am concerned about is definitely the accession of ten countries. How will we cope afterwards? We must start thinking about this today, endeavouring to revise the Financial Perspective, endeavouring to inject new resources, endeavouring to thoroughly revise our procedure, because there will, inevitably, be some complications when there are 25 of us debating matters rather than 15: we need to start today, now, and not when we find ourselves in a state of emergency or urgency. I want to stress this point because we could have serious problems, irrespective of the political line-up. There are three things I would like to focus on. Firstly, Iraq. There is a huge debate on the proposed amendment, but I do not see why there should be outrage. We have provided over EUR 1 billion for Palestine, we have provided over EUR 1 billion for the Balkans, we have also provided a lot of money, EUR 1 billion, for Afghanistan. I do not believe that appropriating EUR 200 million, and then asking the day after to increase this figure to EUR 500 million, is outrageous, unless we want to treat international crises differently according to our political assessments, which would not affect us politically but would affect the people in question. Secondly, I would certainly like to focus on investment in the TENs, which is important and which we must try to support because it means development and jobs. I would, therefore, like to thank you for supporting this amendment, but I would call, at this point, for even more resources to try to make TENs become a political instrument across Europe and not just a technical decision. Thirdly, one of the amendments tabled is extremely important, and I would ask all the political groups to take notice of it: an amendment regarding the accommodation centre for disabled officials, the Les Castors 
centre. We are going to vote for the amendment and I would ask everyone to raise awareness on this matter. We will be proud of it and we will do ourselves credit, both now and in the future.

 Madam President, as rapporteur for TENs, I would like to start by thanking Mr Antonione for being here today, and I would like to thank Commissioner De Palacio for her work in general on this renowned project. In the few minutes available to me, I would like to say that the experience I have accumulated in the field of TENs has led me to draw two conclusions. Firstly, we could say that we are dealing with a pipe dream, something that was decided many years ago but was not then implemented when it came down to it, perhaps because of a lack of resources but perhaps because of a lack of will too. Secondly, a series of debates has been launched in the individual States on the different resources, on the reference legislation, on the question of whether to focus the TEN project on rail transport or on priority objectives; ultimately, however, of all the original projects – the famous 14 – 11 have yet to be completed. On the other hand, what we are attempting to do – and I would express my appreciation to the Commission here for its endeavours – is, thanks to the work of the Van Miert High Level Group, review the TEN objectives and, in particular, the resources. I believe that all the individual States would like this project to be important in terms of the expansion of their economies, of job creation, of attempting to create a genuine network across the 15 nations, soon to be 25. It is therefore important to appropriate more funds. We must therefore endeavour to achieve about 30 or 40% in non-returnable funds; we must aim not just at EUR 600 million per year but at achieving between EUR 6 billion and EUR 8 billion per year for the next ten years. We all hope that this will be possible and I believe that, with the help of the Italian Presidency in these six months, we will be able to succeed.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on a general note, this is a historic budget, for we are preparing for eastward enlargement. I would like to start by thanking my committee and its chairman – from whom I have learned so much – the staff of the Secretariat, my fellow Members and the rapporteurs, both for this budget and for the budgets of previous years. As a young Member, I have been able to accrue a great deal of experience in the field, even becoming vice-chairman of the committee. I believe that, as far as we are concerned, this is a fundamental budget, for it lays the foundations for the future Europe and for the future European Parliament, and I feel that, in political terms, the crucial issue is precisely expenditure for eastward enlargement. In this respect, the budget has the full support of both our committee and all the Members of the House, but only where expenditure related to staff and structures for eastward enlargement are concerned. I would, however, like to focus on what may be a painful aspect of the budget – we must exercise caution when it comes to the appropriations for Iraq. Personally, I have some misgivings about these appropriations: there is a danger that they will grow out of all proportion. Moreover, I would call for there to be close monitoring of these funds, an effective monitoring structure which will prevent reoccurrence of what has already happened with respect to the PNA – the Palestinian National Authority – whose funding is currently being analysed in depth. I would like to flag this point because this kind of monitoring will be essential. I believe that an experimental phase will be necessary for the new Financial Regulation too. As a wide-ranging, complex instrument, it will inevitably cause mounting tension in the Commission above the level of Director-General, although I hasten to add that I have greatly appreciated the way we have worked together over this recent period. Lastly, I must mention the initiative that has led to a major debate within our committee: health insurance for Members of Parliament. This is an issue which we will be able to address when we get the results of a study we have commissioned. In this and in all other matters, I would like to wish the Council, in particular, good luck in its work, proud to be able to say that I, too, am an Italian representative.

I would like to start by thanking the Commissioner and the High Representative for their presence here in this Chamber and for their reports. To start with, I would like to make a few comments on what I have heard, briefly for I do not have much speaking time. Firstly, as regards our European policy, I do not believe that the essential, initial priority for those with a political message is the rebuilding of the PNA. It is important, but it cannot be taken as a basic starting point, or we would be showing bias. We need to combine it with other points. The Commissioner cannot establish it as the main priority. Secondly, I do not believe – and I am addressing Mr Barón Crespo here – that it should be we who are seeking out the Israelis but, seeing as we are the ones who want to become interlocutors, it has to be we who approach them. Thirdly, I do not believe – and I am addressing Mrs Morgantini here – that it is for us to define rights, when we can see that the law is being ridden roughshod over by people throwing bombs and killing seven-year old children on the other side. What I believe we can do as the European Union – and it is important at this time, especially now when Abu Mazen and Ariel Sharon are continuing to talk, although both sides are acting and reacting – is to legitimise the role of Abu Mazen: in this difficult situation, the more legitimacy we give him, the more successful we will be in creating the conditions for relative peace. Moreover, I would like to take the opportunity afforded by the presence of the Iranian delegation to call upon Iran, precisely because of its long history and its role in the Middle East, to recognise the State of Israel: let it do so, if necessary, through the European Union, but let it recognise the State of Israel. This is important and essential, not least in terms of the recognition of human rights and of economic and, therefore, political development too within Iran. I am sure that this would help to pave the way for a genuine, lasting peace process in the Middle East.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in my view, this debate must allow us to reflect on our foreign policy relations, and therefore our economic relations too, with NAFTA and, in particular, with the United States 
and in the context of transatlantic relations. With regard to the famous CFSP, I hope and believe that the Convention will resolve the political gap, appointing a Minister for External Affairs and avoiding losses of international credibility such as that which we have suffered as a result of the Iraq crisis. With regard to the economic sector, however, I think the best solution is not so much to intervene via any WTO agreements as to draw up a single list which addresses the issues in terms of tax and trade concessions, for that will allow us to avoid further instances of bureaucratic chaos. Otherwise, I cannot see us achieving anything. The so-called partnership agreements relating to what is our primary market in terms of both investment and trade will play a major role if we are able to reinvigorate them, simplifying the issue by compiling a list, an agreement that could be concluded by the Commission with NAFTA, first and foremost. On the eve of enlargement, I believe this is a significant way of boosting our economy and the political content of our foreign policy.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, first of all, to greet our fellow Members from the states which are no longer candidate countries but are not yet full Members. We are delighted to have them here, to complete what has been a lengthy, at times difficult process, but at the end of which, I am glad to say, the desired result has been fully achieved. The preliminary draft budget presented today by the Commission is, by force of circumstances, an atypical draft, in that it is to be considered to be in two separate parts. The first part will enter into force for the current 15 Member States on 1 January 2004. The second part, however, will apply to the Union of 25 and will enter into force as of 1 May 2004. Assessing it is therefore not an easy task, and there are some political aspects which, in my opinion, must not be underestimated: first and foremost, the age-old question of payment appropriations. At EUR 100.6 billion, the volume of expenditure has been increased by hardly 3.3% of the 2003 figure; moreover, the 2003 budget related solely to the Europe of 15. This extremely small increase is explained by a reduction of approximately 2% in the volume of expenditure laid down for the European Union of 15. All this is absurd. Indeed, not only does the Commission not intend, once and for all, to concentrate on resolving the problem of the RALs, which has been one of Parliament’s priorities for years, but, what is more, it is presenting a draft which will lead to exactly the same situation being repeated with regard to the countries joining the Union as of 2004. Then there is the question of heading 3. The increase in the ceiling, obtained by Parliament, is a significant result, which will allow us to finance some particularly sensitive policies with an easy mind, but I still feel it is not sufficient. If we genuinely want a political Union, a direction for all the political groupings present in the Chamber – which we can all endeavour to follow – then we must also give them the working tools they need, the instruments necessary to achieve our goals.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start, if I may, by congratulating this year’s two rapporteurs, Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck, on their excellent work. The 2003 budget has not been a simple budget, nor has it been easy in political terms. Indeed, it is a budget in which there is tension between demands which absolutely have to be met now, such as the financing of the administrative expenditure to prepare for enlargement, and political priorities such as support for 
Afghanistan. There is tension between commitments which must be made good, such as the funding of the restructuring of the Portuguese and Spanish fleets – on which, at last, we appear to have reached agreement – and new urgent measures, such as the need to fund the European Union’s participation in the Global Health Fund. It is a budget which, in my view, suffers throughout from the failure to revise the Financial Perspective established in 1999 at Berlin: a Financial Perspective which I believe is now inadequate and can only become politically more unacceptable in the coming years. Nor can the – albeit significant – results achieved in conciliation in November lead to any lasting change in the 
situation. For example, the joint declaration whereby the Council undertakes to consult Parliament before taking any decision which might involve financial commitments in the field of common foreign and security policy is, over and above any possible objections, an important milestone, a further step towards the full involvement of the European Parliament in a strategic sector, towards the development of a more powerful, more secure Union. That, however, does not change the fact that the Heading 4 ceiling is still too low, not to say stiflingly low. What will we do when the Council asks us to authorise it to make a financial commitment because of new international political developments? Will we refuse to give it the authorisation on the grounds that there are not enough funds or will we accept the challenge and undertake to find the money, somehow, somewhere? Now, for example, we have to find funds for the problems in Galicia. What would we have done, for example, in the case of Afghanistan? What would we have done in the case of the Balkans? Not to mention Heading 3. Indeed, the European Union’s commitments increase every year in the field of internal policy too. With every passing year, there are new, costly multiannual programmes of huge political import which, as such, must be processed and adhered to. What, however, will we do when there is no longer a margin for any political initiative that Parliament might want to set in motion? What will we do when the distinction between compulsory expenditure and non-compulsory expenditure is reduced to a distinction between expenditure on which Parliament does not have the ultimate say and expenditure which Parliament cannot alter for fear that the European institutions will lose face? And that is just to mention two headings. I therefore call upon all the Members to make representations to their delegations and to their governments to ensure that the situation is avoided where, subsequently, when all is said and done, everything we have planned for in this budget, in this conciliation, is frustrated because of lack of resources, and to ensure that it becomes the joint objective of each one of us, irrespective of our political affiliation.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in this debate on the first reading of the budget for the financial year 2003, I do not wish to focus on the technical aspects. Indeed, I have taken the floor on several occasions in recent months to condemn what I consider to be the shortcomings and historic inconsistencies of the Community budget such as the RALs or the financing of internal policies and external actions, and also to draw your attention to the specific problems which have only come to light in recent months such as, for example, the ceiling for the administrative expenditure heading, which is too low, and, more generally, the inadequacy of the Financial Perspective agreed in Berlin in 1999. Today, I want to try and address the situation from a political perspective – if it can be described as such – rather than a technical perspective. At a historic time such as that we are currently experiencing, when the international system is continually changing, on the one hand, and with enlargement and the debate on the future of Europe taking place, on the other, I feel that we too, who are experts in financial matters, should start to think about the role we want the European Parliament to play. The question is as follows: should we agree to be mere implementors of rules, rules for the most part written by others, or do we want to be able to change things? For example, how do we feel about the fact that the Council was able to obtain a legal basis from the Commission regarding the issue of natural disasters, for instance, which is an extremely important matter? Would we not also like to be in a position where we can contribute to the Commission’s work? Ladies and gentlemen, very often, we hide – and I am talking about us as a whole political class, of course – behind respect for rules and procedures without even attempting to make genuine changes to them or to the way they are applied. Changes that would be for the better, of course. This is the message I want to be conveyed as an addendum to this debate. The 2003 budget is proving to be a good one, and I congratulate the rapporteurs on their commitment, all the effort they have put in and the results achieved, thanks, not least, to Commissioner Schreyer, the entire Commission structure, the secretariat and the draftsmen, but I can only emphasise that this is a technical budget in which our role has been primarily that of making the figures add up, lacking as we do the strength, the courage and the will to introduce genuine political measures. It may be that we younger Members want to change the world sometimes, but, this time, I would be content just to change a few tiny elements of our European budget.

 Madam President, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, almost two years ago, in December 2000 in the Strasbourg Chamber, I pleaded my cause and the cause of a small number of other Members, calling precisely for the reestablishment of a budget heading for emergency financial assistance for peoples of the European Union who are the victims of natural disasters. This budget heading had existed up until 1997, when it was deleted from the Community budget as a result of what was, in my opinion, a distorted interpretation of subsidiarity policy. Two years ago, I came up against the stubborn opposition of those Members who were using the lack of a legal basis as an excuse and denying me their support, despite the fact that I pointed out to them that genuine natural disasters ultimately affect environmental, agricultural, infrastructure, economic and social policies, as well as all the other Community-level policies. Lastly, two years ago, I tried to make this House understand even just the psychological importance for the European citizens of being entitled to receive financial assistance from the Union, even if the assistance is only symbolic, at extremely sensitive times such as those when they have lost everything and, in many cases, find themselves having to rebuild their entire lives. A personal example of this is the earthquake which took place in Italy a few years ago. Clearly, two years ago, my arguments and political endeavours were not strong enough to convince the House. In summer 2002, however, everything changed. The tragic disasters which affected a number of both the Member States and the candidate countries unexpectedly changed our concept of subsidiarity policy. An astute political initiative – and I would like to thank you, Commissioner Barnier, in particular – turned the impossible into reality and, as a result, not only was a legal basis created in the space of a few months but, in addition, a new interinstitutional agreement was signed bringing about the immediate, guaranteed payment of these funds. I can only rejoice: let that be quite clear. When I reread the letters and speeches I had written during the 2001 budgetary procedure, I wondered whether I was suffering from the curse of Cassandra when I saw how often the fears I had expressed had subsequently become reality. I certainly welcome the fact that the Union has, at last, decided to shoulder what I consider to be one of its responsibilities. I welcome the fact that we have shown ourselves to be capable of speedy, timely, well-targeted action. I must admit, I am also glad that a good precedent has now, at last, been set, which will stop us trying to use the lack of a legal basis or similar arguments as an excuse for not doing something we do not want to in the future. I am also, however, annoyed because, yet again, all this had to go via the Council, it was not the result of our own action, whereas Parliament can and does make itself heard when it wants to. It is capable of acting on equal terms with the Council or at least – I am no fool; I too am familiar with the Treaties – it can do its best. There you are, that is what we must do and we must be constant in our endeavours. In any case, I would like to thank the Commission and the Council for everything they have done.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as early as the part-session last May, I expressed my concerns during the debate following the presentation of the 2003 PDB about a budgetary procedure which was proving, yet again, to be utterly inadequate to meet the needs of our Union. In May, my criticism of the Commission was based on two considerations: the level of RALs and heading 5. In July, Parliament and the Council came to an agreement on heading 5 which rejects the Commission’s request for more staff to deal with the challenges of enlargement in an attempt to balance the accounts. I would rather not return to the subject of the RALs because time is lacking and because none of us wishes to hear information which we know to be completely unviable financially but which, nevertheless, is produced year after year in the budgetary procedure. Ladies and gentlemen, at the risk of repeating myself, I have to say once again that all this is quite ridiculous. Here I am yet again, calling upon this House and, through this House, upon the Council and the Commission to give due consideration to the possibility of revising the financial perspective, which, on the basis of my relatively little experience, appears to be the only conceivable sensible and responsible political move we can make. Article 19 of the 1999 Interinstitutional Agreement states clearly that the financial perspective can be revised on the proposal of the Commission in the event of unforeseen circumstances, and what could have been less foreseeable than the impending enlargement of the Union to include 25 Member States in 2004? I must stress: over the next three years, up until 2006, we will have to establish the budget for a 25-Member-State Union according to a financial perspective calculated on the basis of the needs of a 21-Member-State Union. Ladies and gentlemen, where is the sense in all this? Why are we continuing along this absurd path? My proposal is, therefore, as follows. After the December Council, which will have to establish which and how many States are to enter the European Union in time for the European elections in 2004, the Commission should present a proposal for revision of the financial perspective, a proposal which the two arms of the budgetary authority will have ample time to adopt – in accordance with Article 20 of the Interinstitutional Agreement – before the start of the 2004 budgetary procedure. I feel that this is the only path we can take, the only path which, with due regard for budgetary rigour, will allow us to continue to do our job properly. I do not feel that the solutions hitherto adopted have yielded sufficiently positive results,
 and whereas, thus far, we have only had to explain them to citizens who are, at heart, well-disposed towards us, whereas, thus far, we have only had to uphold them before voters who are, paradoxically, almost more European than we are, in a few months we will have to explain them to people who have suffered just to be part of this Union and who will view us with an extremely critical, vigilant eye, with even closer scrutiny than the current Member States, to see whether or not we have done a good job.

 Mr President, I would like to point out a linguistic problem concerning Amendment No 11 to my report, which was put to the vote yesterday. Out of respect for grammar and the institutions, the amendment should read as follows: “The financial framework for the implementation of this Regulation for the period 2000 to 2006 shall be EUR 4700 million and shall be subject to a mid-term review based on the implementation of this Regulation”. The rest of the amendment remains as before.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Färm, for his work. We are all aware of the difficulties involved in the management of the budgetary procedure and the pressure on those who are responsible for it each year. If I might venture an opinion, however, the situation this year appears to be much more complex and problematic. In theory, it is two years until enlargement actually takes place but, in reality, the machine has already been set in motion and funds will have to be set aside from the 2003 budget to finance the changes necessary, especially at administrative level. We all know that we are not ready, that our budget is inadequate to deal with the current situation, that it is inadequate for the financial perspective for the current period and will leave us at the mercy of any unforeseen developments. That is why I feel that we Members must be bold and demand a political response to the current impasse during the conciliation procedure, not accounting tricks or half promises, which are unworthy of our responsibility. It is tedious to go over the same ground again and again but, at the risk of seeming extremely boring, I would stress once again my position, which is based on one major assumption: we Members of Parliament and our institution have exactly the same dignity, as a branch of the Budgetary Authority, as the Council, and this means that we are by no means bound to bow to the decisions of the Council without making our mark. There is no law saying that our role is merely to limit the damage done by a short-sighted political structure which is only more powerful in its own opinion: we are politically and morally accountable to millions of the European electorate for our financial management of the Union, and we are certainly not going to say to our citizens ‘We knew all along and we said so at the time but the Council would not listen’. This is why I would stress that, even now and especially considering the heading 5 problems facing us and more long-standing problems such as the RAL, we must force the Council to find a political solution and follow it through as necessary. It is better to be bold now than to be sorry later.

 Mr President, the trans-European networks are one of the driving forces for the achievement of growth, competitiveness and employment within the European Union. The December 1994 European Council in Essen in gave a decisive political incentive to the TENs by adopting a list of fourteen priority projects. A number of financial instruments were set up by the Community and the European Investment Bank in order to achieve these objectives. The main purpose of Community assistance for TENs is to help to surmount the financial obstacles which may arise when a project gets under way. In principle, Community assistance is currently restricted to 10% of overall costs, with the exception of Galileo, which can receive up to 20% of its funding from the Community. The rest of the expenditure is due to be co-financed through either local, regional or national budgets. Regrettably, however, work is not advancing as rapidly as expected. Of the 14 ‘specific’ projects approved at the Essen summit, only three have been completed. Six others should be finished by 2005. As to the remaining five projects, no clear indication has been given on their timetable. Where, then, do the problems lie? In the first place, the pace of investment has been too slow. The Commission estimates that if the rate of funding does not increase between now and 2010, there is a very strong likelihood that the network will not be fully completed, in particular the railway components. The longest delays are generally on cross-border projects since the Member States have given priority funding to the national sections of the trans-European network in their investment decisions. These delays can mainly be attributed to the lack of an integrated approach to the planning, assessment and funding of cross-border infrastructures. Moreover, the Community’s budgetary resources and legal instruments do not enable it to do anything on its own to speed up these cross-border projects since, under the Treaty, the national authorities are responsible for the implementation of a project on the territory of a Member State. The areas most seriously affected by the persistence of bottlenecks are the international corridors in which North-South trans-European traffic is highly concentrated, natural barriers such as the Alps and the Pyrenees, the outskirts of major conurbations and trading centres in which long-distance, regional and local traffic meet and are concentrated and a number of European Union borders, in particular those with the accession countries. The Commission therefore proposes to focus Community activities and projects on the reduction of bottlenecks. During the past few years, the Commission has been able to maintain a relatively high level of implementation and, since early 2002, the backlog has started to decrease. The Commission has now presented a proposal to modify the general rules for granting Community financial aid in the field of TENs. As a result, Community support would be increased from 10% to 20% in order to have a leverage effect and to attract private investors in particular. This modification would be aimed at three categories of projects: cross-border rail projects crossing natural barriers such as the Alps and the Pyrenees, projects aimed at eliminating clearly identified bottlenecks at borders with the candidate countries, and the 12 priority energy projects. The first two categories fall within the scope of the trans-European transport network as established by Decision No 1692/96/EC. An additional amount of EUR 100 million in the period 2003-2006 would be assigned to the transport TENs budget line (B5-700) to complement support provided through ISPA. The TENs financial envelope set for the current financial perspective (2000-2006) would therefore have to be revised. Finally, the Commission proposes to reallocate EUR 50 million in favour of the cross-border projects within the current transport TENs envelope. As to GALILEO, it will continue to receive 20% of its funding from the Community. My comments? Amendments Nos 1, 3, 5 and 6 establish the general framework, restoring the balance of the Commission’s proposal, which tended to emphasise the importance solely of projects involving the candidate countries. Amendment No 2 calls upon the Commission to prepare an evaluation on the Member States’ responsibilities. Amendment No 4 introduces the possibility for Member States who wish to do so to have recourse to private capital and stresses that the economic and social added value of projects and their compatibility with the objective of sustainable mobility should also be assessed when selection takes place. Amendment No 7 states that the increase in the financial framework should be compatible with the financial perspective and not cause any restriction to be placed on other programmes. I therefore call upon the Commission to consult the budgetary authority again prior to the reallocation of funds within transport TENs. Amendment No 8 lays down the terms for the implementation of the proposal as regards the trans-European transport network, as established by Decision 1692/96 adopted on 23 July 1996. Amendment No 9 authorises the Commission to demand reimbursement of the sums awarded for projects not completed within the space of 10 years. Amendment No 10 deals with comitology and, lastly, Amendment No 11 concerns what is known as the ‘sunset’ clause. I hope that, although this presentation has been brief due to time constraints, it has covered all the salient points, and I hope that we will succeed in completing the development of the TENs both for our own sakes and, above all, for the future of Europe.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Costa Neves, for he has certainly made a major contribution to the work of our committee in recent years and his input has always been positive. As the rapporteur has rightly pointed out in the explanatory statement, the supplementary and amending budget which we are to vote on tomorrow has two distinguishing features. Firstly, it budgets for 2002 a preliminary amount of EUR 10 billion of the surplus carried over from 2001. This surplus, which is mainly the result of underspends in the areas of Structural Funds and Agriculture, is equivalent to a ‘reimbursement’ to Member States as it will decrease their payments for the 2002 Budget. Secondly, it recalculates the financing of the 2002 Budget on the basis of the new Council Decision on own resources and, as a result, the share of Traditional Own Resources in collection costs that Member States are allowed to keep has increased from 10% to 25%. However, what interests me most at the moment is the first feature of this budget. If we do not allow our attention to be diverted by the populist view that it is good to save money, the full gravity of the situation becomes apparent: in other words, the European Commission, the symbol – rightly or wrongly – for millions of European citizens, of Europe, of integration, of the future, has proved incapable of implementing the budget as adopted by Parliament and the Council, and is now left with a surplus of 12 per cent. However, there is another side to the matter: the Member States, which are constantly asking for more money for structural actions and which, on the eve of enlargement, are fighting tough political battles in order not to lose Community structural support for their citizens, have been unable to implement the commitments undertaken and have not asked for payments which have already been appropriated. Clearly, ladies and gentlemen, the problem is fairly universal and it is one that needs urgent resolution, for it is an offence to our fellow citizens and genuinely exposes us to the ridicule of a public which is becoming increasingly less disposed to understand and increasingly more liable, on the other hand, to let itself be influenced by summary criticism.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating all the rapporteurs involved for their work on this vast subject. In my opinion, the discharge procedure is a fundamental part of our work and is one of the distinguishing powers of our institution: the power by virtue of which we verify, year after year, that the good intentions and resolves, and also the expectations of the citizens who elected us and for whom we are responsible first and foremost, are fulfilled. This subject is both extremely technical and extremely political, and the consequences for both sectors of decisions taken in haste or under emotional stress can be – and, unfortunately, do often turn out to be – disastrous. That is why I feel that we should ask ourselves before the vote, each year, not so much whether everything has been done perfectly but rather whether we are going in the right direction, whether we are setting ourselves the right priorities, whether, in the executive action of the Commission and – to a much lesser extent – all the other institutions, there is evidence of the intention to implement the will of the two arms of the budgetary authority as well as possible. Concentrating especially on Mr McCartin’s report and, therefore, on the Commission’s budget, I feel that three points warrant particular emphasis; indeed, the rapporteur himself has already stressed them. Firstly, the financial year 2000 has been characterised by an exceptional level of overspending with regard to the budget, which shows that the budgetary forecasts were severely short of the mark. Secondly, although 2000 marked the start of a new programming period for the Structural Funds and preacession aid which stretches until 2006, this cannot have been very successful given that so many difficulties were encountered in implementation. Lastly – and this point may well be more important than the previous two – the rapporteur was right to point out the need to establish, on the one hand, the features of Community management which should be the basis for effectiveness but are deficient, and, on the other, the components within the system which are conducive to fraud and irregularity These are, in my opinion, the areas we must address if we are to achieve proper, sound implementation of the budget in the coming years.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteurs, Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck, on their work thus far. I feel that before us are two sound documents which identify precisely what the budgetary priorities should be for the coming financial year. Five political priorities have been identified: enlargement and preparation for enlargement, external assistance, internal security, reform of the institutions and reform of the Commission. I feel that we can all agree on these points, particularly in view of the imperative need to provide the Union with adequate financial instruments for it to be able to see its priorities through. In fact, to be honest, the growing battle against the Council and the Commission itself is not over which actions we should concentrate more on, namely combating terrorism and the reform of the institutions – which are indisputable priorities; the problem arises when Parliament and the Council have different views on how these actions should be financed, when the Council refuses even to contemplate revising the financial perspective, when we continue to treat the flexibility instrument as an instrument whose use can be planned from year to year. Clearly, there is something wrong! In my opinion, this is the principal battle that Parliament will have to fight in the coming months, a battle in which we will have to succeed in presenting a united, fighting front. Then at horizontal level – to use a technical term – three particular needs have been identified: the need for further budgetary monitoring at technical and political level, for example by means of budgetary hearings; the need for the Commission to improve its spending capacity and, consequently, implementation considerably, in an attempt to prevent the creation of new RALs at source; lastly – what the rapporteur wanted to point out to the Commission and the Council – the fact that they are bound to consult the European Parliament on all initiatives with significant budgetary impact, particularly in the context of non-compulsory expenditure. On all three matters, I feel that the rapporteurs should be able to count on the support of us all.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Title XVII of the Treaty establishing the European Community, particularly Article 158 thereof, includes among the Union’s political priorities the promotion of the Community’s ‘overall harmonious development’, aiming at ‘reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and the backwardness of the least-favoured regions, including rural areas’. Personally, I feel that it is necessary to continue to pursue this objective with a coherent, continuing, sustainable policy. The second report on EU cohesion presented by Commissioner Barnier depicts a situation which has improved but which has certainly not been resolved. It is clear that the progress made has not been uniform and that severe regional disparities remain which – as rightly pointed out by the rapporteur – are increasing rather than diminishing. With regard to the objectives, I fully support the position of my fellow member, Mr Musotto. The criterion for deciding which regions are eligible for receiving aid lays down the threshold of 75% of average Community per capita
 GDP. My personal feeling is that, as of 2006, it would certainly be more appropriate to use the unemployment rate as a measure, for the entry of poorer regions which are in greater need of aid will certainly not raise the level of the regions currently under Objective 1.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as draftsman of an opinion on the Galileo proposal, I would like to focus essentially on two financial aspects of the Commission’s proposal, leaving the rapporteur and the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism the task of discussing its merits. The Commission has presented a proposal for the setting-up of a Joint Undertaking to complete the development phase of Galileo; this would provide a single management structure with legal personality which would be flexible and capable of concluding the necessary contracts. The founding members would be the Commission and the European Space Agency, which would contribute a maximum of EUR 520 million and EUR 550 million respectively. The European Investment Bank and any private company providing a minimum sum of EUR 20 million could be further members. The cost of this phase is estimated at EUR 1.1 billion, to be split equally between the European Community and the European Space Agency, with an extra EUR 200 million coming from the private sector, pledged through the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding in March 2001 by representatives of the main industries concerned. The Community’s financial contribution will come from two budget lines: from B5-700 – Trans-European Networks – and from a token entry under the B6 Research chapter pending a final decision on the 6th Framework Programme. Out of the amount financed by the European Space Agency, EUR 50 million would be paid in cash and EUR 500 million in kind, as stated in the European Space Agency’s Statutes. I have tabled two amendments in my opinion: the first concerns the possible future participation of the candidate countries in the development phase of Galileo, as called for by Parliament in its resolution of 3 October 2001. I have called for instruments to be identified in the budget which will allow them to participate, not least in order to avoid further widening the existing gap. The second amendment concerns the role to be conferred on the Budgetary Authority; I therefore call upon the Commission to inform it on a regular basis on the implementation of the development phase of Galileo, and for the annual report on the activities of the Joint Undertaking to be sent to Parliament and the Council and not only to the Court of Auditors as proposed by the Commission.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s annual report on Trans-European Networks provides a general outlook on Community assistance in the three main areas of TENs (transport, energy and telecommunications), which are financed either through the general Union budget or through other Community sources such as the EIB and the Cohesion Fund. I believe that, overall, it is a good report, if one also takes into account the fact that 1999 was a pivotal year for this sector, in fact, 1999 saw the modification of the financial regulation, the approval of the financial framework for 2000-2006 and the creation of ISPA; this year, 50% of the funding was devoted to transport infrastructure works and the emergence of Galileo as a new and priority TEN project. This does not mean, however, that there are no criticisms to be levelled at the Commission; these derive above all from the type of report it has given us and not from the implementation of the Trans-European Networks. The first criticism I intend to make about the report concerns the lack of references to the qualitative development of TEN projects. Very often, the initiation and completion of projects have taken much longer than expected because of procedural differences and a lack of coordination. In several cases, Member States have had different priorities, while the notion of public or private partnership is not yet well developed. In future, therefore, the Commission should attach additional information on the projects to its reports, such as, for instance, the original plans, timetables and the results achieved. This would, first and foremost, increase transparency and thus also permit more effective and productive monitoring of the situation. Secondly, the financial evaluation of TENs should include information on funding through local, regional and national budgets and also through private resources, since roughly 80% of the total funds comes from these sources. It would thus be possible to obtain an overall view of the state of funding and to check that the commitments undertaken by Member States are maintained. Thirdly, I believe that the financial resources available for TENs are too limited in view of the continual challenges faced by the transport sector. The percentage of TEN activities funded by the general budget is constantly falling, while EIB loans cover more than three-quarters of the funding in this sector, and this is highlighted. My view is that the funding package for transport TENs should be reviewed and adapted to actual needs, especially in light of the reductions in other sectors, such as the environment. Lastly, I believe we must properly address the problem of road traffic, the constant increase in which runs contrary to the objectives that were proposed when TENs were created. I think this is due to a lack of cross-border cooperation, which necessarily undermines the interoperability and promotion of rail networks. To get round this problem it will, I think, be necessary to gradually shift the emphasis away from the Essen priority projects and national infrastructure projects towards transit and cross-border projects, so as to strengthen the policy of sustainable transport and promote integration between different modes of transport. In conclusion, I should also like to mention the budget that we are about to vote on. I believe we have come to the end of two not inconsiderable political problems which reflect the additional needs which have emerged in view of the changed international situation. In second reading, we have left an ample margin for assistance to Afghanistan and neighbouring regions, and with the Council we have agreed on the figure of EUR 488 million for cooperation with developing countries in Asia. Once again, then, we have given evidence of our political sensitivity and lent our support to the common foreign and security policy. It was unthinkable that the Union might absent itself at a time like this, and it was also unthinkable that Parliament might default after the explicit request by the Council. This does not, however, mean that everything is fine and that no criticisms should be made. Nevertheless, I must especially congratulate the rapporteurs, Mr Costa Neves and Mrs Buitenweg, as well as all the Secretariat staff who have helped and supported us through both good and difficult moments.

 The fight against the fraud that damages the Community’s financial interests should, for obvious reasons, be one of the European Commission’s main priorities for action. The Union for a Europe of Nations Group can only be delighted at the good results achieved by OLAF during 2000 and, moreover, hopes that such actions can bear even more fruit in the coming years. The citizens of Europe, the Member States themselves and, of course, all the Members of the European Parliament, it is fair to assume, are demanding this. The UEN Group and the Italian delegation, in particular, however, finds it impossible to vote in favour of the Bösch resolution, although it obviously agrees with that part of its content that shows the political will to fight fraud more effectively. In particular, we very strongly oppose the inclusion in the resolution of Paragraphs 32 and 35, which constitute unacceptable interference in the domestic affairs of one of the Member States. Indeed, ‘points to recent changes in the law in Italy’ – Paragraph 32 – and ‘calls on the Italian government to stop blocking leave of absence for Italian public prosecutors to take up executive functions with OLAF’ – Paragraph 35 – are in both form and substance unacceptable criticisms of the exercise of sovereign powers by a Member State, performed in full compliance with all democratic rules. We therefore strongly deplore the inclusion of the two paragraphs in the resolution, for that sets a dangerous precedent in the relations between the European Parliament and the Member States; these relations must always be characterised by mutual respect for the other’s positions, even when the positions differ.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I know I am repeating what others have already said when I say that the tragic attacks of 11 September have changed the course of this century’s history for ever, but I feel that I can never stress enough how true this is, that the international Community is now faced with a crisis that is as great as it is unprecedented and unfamiliar, with rules and trends that not even the most experienced of political analysts is able to predict. However, at a time such as this, it is important for the European Union to show itself to be as, and more, united than before and as, and more, capable than before of reacting with one voice. At a time such as this, when all our worst fears are unexpectedly realised, we realise the importance of this Europe that we are integrating, the importance of being united and having coordinating structures able to operate in real time, of being able to think and act all together and in respect for all the positions. It is certainly true that we still have a long way to go: the common foreign and security policy is not yet operative and there are still complex issues to be ironed out in its operating mechanism, particularly in the area of national sovereignties, but we now need, more than ever before, to speed up our work. I therefore cannot fail to congratulate the rapporteur, the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, Mr Brok, on his report and on the priorities he has set for the forthcoming year in this area, particularly with regard to what – as we have been witnessing in recent months – will be the real challenge of the new millennium: preventing conflicts, finding a non-military solution to the crisis and, most importantly, combating terrorism. You see, the greater the possibility of seeing Europe united in terms of foreign policy, of making our foreign policy practical reality, the more successful Europe’s internal politics will be. Quite frankly, the acceleration of the euro, acceleration on the economic side of things, has not been matched by acceleration on the political front. Well then, there must be acceleration in political matters, and the foreign policy is crucial if that is to happen, particularly at this time. If we do this, we will achieve a stronger, more resilient Europe and a stronger euro, and we will certainly be able to take a better approach to enlargement and, moreover, to compete on equal terms with the dollar and NAFTA – Canada, the United States and Mexico – the Agreement as it stands, a market which already exists and already presents important political points of reference. We must act and we must be fully confident in what we are doing: the foreign policy will become vital in the short-term future, especially for the new generations.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for the reasons I expressed yesterday and considering the fact that you have adopted my legislative amendments, I call upon you to postpone the vote on the legislative resolutions until the possibility of an agreement with the Commission and the Council increasing Parliament’s role, pursuant to Rule 69 (2) of the Rules of Procedure, can be ascertained. I therefore call upon you to vote on the motion which is not a legislative resolution, to make the political positions of this House on the matter quite clear.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets on the Commission communication on GALILEO, I will confine myself in this speech to the financial side of the project. At the current stage, GALILEO does not comply with the statement on financial programming, which was adopted by the three institutions on 20 July 2000. According to this statement, ‘the budgetary authority must have accurate 
information about the financial consequences of each new proposal presented by the Commission, in order to be able to assess the impact of the proposal on the ceilings of the financial perspective (…)’. Furthermore, at a meeting of EU transport ministers in April 2001, it became clear that the Union had major problems finding the extra EUR 1.5 billion required from private sources for the deployment phase (2006-2007) of GALILEO. On the other hand, the Commission states that when it issued a call for an expression of interest in order to establish the conditions needed in order to set up a public-private partnership, several European industrial consortia responded to this, without reference to any further problems. I would like to make it clear that I support the Commission’s approach in principle. Nevertheless, I would warn that GALILEO may have a much bigger impact on the general budget than initially expected. I consider that the budgetary authority should have a clear picture of GALILEO’s source of funding before it can commit appropriations to the project. The identification of the sources and amounts of private funding should be concurrent with the identification of public funding. Financing needs should be met by 2002. Then, Parliament should demand prior consultation of the budgetary authority in the event that the expenditure to be financed from the general budget is to be revised. This would ensure that no restrictions are placed on other activities financed under heading 3 if GALILEO does not attract the investments foreseen by the Commission. However, following my approach, in a situation of crisis, the European Union would have the possibility to use the satellite navigation services provided by GALILEO without having to rely on other (primarily military) satellite systems operated by the United States and Russia such as GPS and GLONASS, although it would still be compatible with them.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the framework proposal before us establishes the succession of the European Community to the ECSC. According to the proposal, the net revenue deriving from the investments of the assets of the Coal and Steel Research Fund would constitute revenue in the EU budget. This revenue would be earmarked for a specific purpose, namely for financing research projects in the sectors related to the coal and steel industry. The Research Fund would be managed by the Commission. Out of the amounts yielded by the Fund, 27.2% would be allocated to the coal sector and 72.8% to the steel sector. This breakdown could be modified only by a unanimous decision by the Council. Lastly, the proposal states that the administrative expenditure resulting from the liquidation, investment and management of the Research Fund will be covered by the general budget. Ladies and gentlemen, in this brief summary I have not forgotten our role: quite simply, in its future form, what was the first European Treaty, the first stone set in place for the creation of a united Europe, completely abolishes our institution. I am firmly opposed to the approach of the Commission, whose framework proposal provides for Parliament merely to be consulted on matters concerning the fund’s financial and technical guidelines. Such a passive role is envisaged for us that it is completely contradictory to the present-day requirements of transparency and accountability, and Parliament would have even less power than it does in budgetary matters. In my report, I made a number of demands to the Council: firstly, I asked for the codecision procedure to be applied; secondly, I requested the full budgetisation of the annual interests of the fund as preallocated revenue, through the creation of a specific budget line in the revenue and expenditure side of the budget following the principles of budgetary specificity and neutrality, in line with the provisions of the Interinstitutional Agreement and the Financial Regulation; thirdly, I requested that the related administrative costs, estimated at around EUR 8.4 million, should be included in this budget line, for otherwise they would have to be met from the general budget. In addition, I included the possibility of revising the ratio of appropriations dedicated for coal and steel research respectively, as production will increase as a result of enlargement. I have noticed that the resolution tabled before the House still contains a reference to the ECB, which I would ask you to disregard: this is an amendment which I have withdrawn and which has remained in the resolution due to a technical error. With regard to the request for the codecision procedure to be applied, I would stress that the Commission’s legislative proposal is based on the Treaties and on the Nice Protocol, which states that the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission after consulting the European Parliament, is to adopt all the necessary provisions for the implementation of this Protocol. In practice, Parliament is deprived of any power, despite the fact that the administrative expenditure of the Coal and Steel Fund would have to be met from the general budget. This means that Parliament would have to approve this additional expenditure and give discharge to the Fund without having any influence at all over the implementation of its activities. My request for the codecision procedure to be applied is not, therefore, a request for a different legal basis to be used, just for reference to be made to a different article. Indeed, the Commission’s document refers to the Treaty establishing the European Community, without specifying any particular article, and to the Protocol annexed to the Treaty of Nice, Article 2 – under which the European Parliament has consultation powers only – a Treaty which, however, is not yet in force and which it is highly unlikely will become effective before July 2002. Consequently, we are in a very fluid situation which has never occurred in the past and will never occur again, since the ECSC Treaty is the only Treaty to have an expiry date, and I would stress this. Moreover, even if the Protocol annexed to the Treaty of Nice does come into force, it only refers to the procedure for approving the package as a whole and makes no mention of the multiannual decisions. I therefore propose to request that the codecision procedure be applied, as laid down in Article 2.5.1 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in this I believe and hope I can count on the same support from this House that I received in the Committee on Budgets. Then, with regard to the full budgetisation of interests and the possibility of the administrative costs being met from this budget line, Parliament gave its consent in 1998 for all the interests of the Fund to be used for research. Ladies and gentlemen, as I said before, the situation which we have to address is highly unusual and will certainly never be repeated: we are dealing with the only Treaty to have an expiry date, the succession of the European Community to which depends largely on a Treaty which has not yet been ratified and may well not be ratified in time. In my opinion, and in this I am supported by the coordinators of the political groups in the Committee on Budgets, if the line I have taken in the legislative amendments is endorsed by this House, before expressing the European Parliament’s opinion, we should enter into negotiations with the Council and the Commission, seeking to increase our institution’s role. Therefore, when we have voted on the legislative amendments, I will ask the presidency to postpone the vote on the legislative resolution until the possibility of an agreement with the Commission and the Council increasing Parliament’s role can be verified. I hope that you will agree with this line of approach.

 The natural, technological and environmental disasters that repeatedly cause devastation throughout entire regions of the globe have always given rise to requests for urgent measures to make civil protection interventions at Community level more effective. This has been achieved through the proposal for a decision, which I feel able to support. As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, with regard to this proposal, I would like to stress how this Community mechanism for the coordination of civil protection intervention was set up on a permanent basis to respond to specific emergencies. In fact, the proposal seeks to create a body within the Commission which will coordinate the actions in the Member States.  The mechanism will cost EUR 1.5 million per year, which will be charged to the B4-3300 budget heading entitled ‘Community cooperation for civil protection and situations of environmental urgency’ for which there exists another legal basis that authorises a multiannual programme (2000-2004), whose grant is EUR 7.5 million. In accordance with the joint declaration of 20 July 2000, I have taken note that this additional cost is now compatible with Heading 3 of the Financial Perspective, without existing policies being cut. I am, however, still confused on two points, which I asked the Commission to clarify in my report. First of all, the distinction between economic, actual operational costs such as the intervention teams and the assessment and co-ordination teams, and the structural costs of a more administrative nature; secondly, the risks of duplicating the actions financed under co-operation in civil protection, which also provides for exercises, exchanges of experts and the mobilisation of specific competencies. In any case, I feel that this proposal for a decision is to be supported, and I announce that my group will be voting in favour.

 Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteurs for their work. I would like this year's budget to be rather more far-sighted than last year's, which we had requested should contain an appropriation for what subsequently proved to be an international crisis, BSE. I would venture to say that it has now caused collective neurosis, and this is a sign to all of us policy-makers that we must staunch the flow, so to speak, and endeavour to provide the citizens with food safety. With regard to the various aspects of the budget, I would stress, on the one hand, that it would be appropriate for the ECSC to try to incorporate the annual income produced by the assets into the general budget, in order to comply with the provisions of the Interinstitutional Agreement and the Financial Regulation, and, on the other hand, the need to create two separate budget headings for budget revenue and outgoings. In the field of culture, we will have to fully support the enhancement of educational and professional skills. As regards a fundamental area such as agriculture, we will have to support it more and more in the future, particularly in the face of the now imminent eastward enlargement, together with the small and medium-sized businesses, which are the real core of the European economy. Let us take note of our weakness, now, in economic terms, and let us endeavour to produce a budgetary policy which will reinvigorate our economy and boost its development.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not want to go back over ground that has already been covered, and so I will refrain from describing the content of the amending budget proposed by the Commission and already adopted by the Council. Instead, I would like to take this opportunity to ask you to reflect on what I believe are two extremely relevant points which featured in the amendments tabled in the Committee on Budgets in the context of this debate. Firstly, the obligatory costs. As we are all aware, Parliament does not have much power when it comes to these costs, which include agriculture. It is the Council which has the last word, for the CAP has always been synonymous with the European Community and the now the European Union. I feel that the time has come to move on and to grant this Chamber greater powers: we have been elected by the European citizens and, as such, we have the duty to represent their interests in all fields. As part of the budgetary authority, we should have the right to exert weighty influence on all budgetary matters. The second point is the splitting of the costs between the Member States and the Union. The Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party has tabled a series of amendments on this point, seeking, as you are aware, to revise the intervention percentages to achieve a 50/50 split between the Union and the Member States. I do not feel that this would be the right thing to do, and I will tell you why. In the first place, given the difficulties the political world is currently experiencing as a result of the BSE crises, such a decision would appear in the citizens' eyes to indicate withdrawal from the problem by the European institutions. In other words, the Union would soon be accused of being ready to intervene to ban State aid or set milk quotas, but just as ready to wash its hands of crises in the moment of need. Take heed: when I say citizens I am not just protecting the farmers, who have been directly hit by the crisis, but also and above all the individual consumer who has, quite frankly, been in a state of terror for months now over a situation which is getting worse every day. That is who we must protect, and it is certainly not by offloading the financial burden of the situation onto the Member States that we will do so. Secondly, if we were to support this political position we would be encouraging the renationalisation of the common agricultural policy, which would be an absurd thing to do at a time when the post-Nice debate certainly does not provide for the cancellation of Community policies.

 The purpose of this proposal for a European Commission decision is to implement the provisions of the new Article 129 of the EC Treaty, introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam with the intention of intensifying cooperation between the Member States in the area of analysis, research and verification of labour market policy, while developing a knowledge-based economy, identifying best practice, promoting exchanges, transferring experiences and implementing an active information policy in the said sector. It was important to emphasise the need for a European strategy that would be accessible and transparent. This report also calls for a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the effects of that strategy, and an analysis of needs, so as to put in place a made-to-measure plan which takes account of overall economic policy. It therefore emphasises the possibility of using the strategy as a method to be applied to other areas and establishing an analysis of the types of factors which indicate the employment trend. In order to consolidate the employment strategy at local and regional level, the rapporteur suggests using part of the appropriations at that level to promote cooperation, improve knowledge and the exchange of information and good practice, and evaluate the results of the application of national programmes benefiting employment at local and regional level. The text, unanimously adopted in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, also highlights the need to guarantee consistency and complementarity with other Community measures and initiatives. I also support the topping-up of appropriations for the implementation of the activities, to provide an overall figure of EUR 65 million rather than the 55 set by the Commission. It is the duty of all Members of Parliament to work to boost employment for the good of our countries and Europe as a whole, to give the rising generations fresh hope. That is why the Union for a Europe of Nations Group has supported this report.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I certainly greatly welcomed Mr Naïr's report, which does not contain any fabrication but gives an unbiased description of a problem which needs to be resolved, first and foremost at political level, and also Mrs Muscardini's report, which is in-depth and gives just as true a picture. It is, of course, no longer necessary to remind the House of the role, the function and the importance of the Mediterranean in the very origins of European culture and the way that it is both the cradle and the vehicle of our civilisation. However, we cannot ignore the fact that, thus far, our joint action in this major geographical area has not been effective and has certainly not been exhaustive. Poorly managed programmes, maladministration, even a certain lack of clear thinking and political timeliness have prevented us from making what is – I am sure – the will of our institutions a practical reality, that is from achieving the three objectives focused on at Barcelona: an area of peace and stability, an area of shared prosperity through free trade and greater understanding between peoples. As a Member of the Committee on Budgets, I can only hope that the Commission will be willing to change the way it runs the MEDA programme and the very structure of the programme, in the manner indicated by Mr Bourlanges, that is, basing its approach on radical streamlining of the cycle of procedures, greater recourse to macrofinancial support, and less complex commitology. The Commission, which is already presenting the initial draft budget, also needs to endeavour to be more transparent by producing an annual document highlighting the expenditure commitments which can be made for each country. This is an area we must tackle if we genuinely want to implement our policy.

 Mr President, I would like to start by stressing the fact that this year's budget is due in particular to the work of all the Members of the committee itself, in addition, of course, to the work of the committee chairman, Mr Wynn, who has steered us with wisdom through the various situations, and tense moments which we have experienced. I would also like to thank Commissioner Schreyer. However, this does not mean that we could have done more or better. I will focus on one aspect at a time. Firstly, the positive side: the approximately EUR 60 million of agricultural funds allocated for testing, which is a significant although, in my opinion, not conclusive step; the earmarking of around EUR 450 million for small and medium-sized businesses, for we have at last realised that the European economy is not based on multinationals but on small and medium-sized enterprises, which will give new impetus to development and employment; then the fact that the increase in expenditure is only 3.5%, and the increase in appropriations for the Balkans, which is of political importance. In this sense, our committee has made a fundamental achievement. I would now like to focus on two points which I feel require some attention and give cause for concern: firstly, the possibly excessive use of flexibility which, like all excessive things, is a negative factor, which means that we must not use it as a safety net; secondly, the fact that the creation of the new jobs is simply due to early retirements. This must not become a precedent in our institutions. Finally, I urge the committee to adopt increasingly a budgetary strategy aimed particularly at strengthening and protecting our currency, the euro.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for a youngster like me, Nice certainly represents a great hope for a new Europe, in political as well as institutional terms. Indeed, the wide majority vote returned only yesterday in the Italian Parliament is evidence of the unity of intention and preparation for this Council. However, we certainly consider it essential that the list of topics to be voted on by qualified majority voting is not extended and that the principle of one Commissioner per Member State is followed when establishing the composition of the Commission. Another essential factor is that the irreplaceable role of the national parliaments is retained in the Treaties, precisely because this will facilitate the establishment of the new Europe. It takes no great genius to work out that 700 Members of Parliament can no longer be sufficient for a Europe of 27 or 28 nations, or the smaller countries will be at an unfair disadvantage. On the other hand, I would stress the considerable importance of providing our Europe with strong institutions to fill the institutional void being created by progress on the economic front with the euro. 
As a result, the high dollar is benefiting NAFTA, Mexico, Canada and the United States. Having said this, in my opinion, Nice needs to be an historic Council, for ourselves, our nations and the very future of Europe.

 Mr President, the different areas of the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue must, in my opinion, be tackled from the social, political and cultural perspectives, in continuation of that process – the Euro-Mediterranean Conference – which was set in motion in Barcelona in 1995 when we first started to talk about Mediterranean policy, although the complexity of the subject caused some difficulties even then. The world is moving inexorably towards globalisation and, as a result, is having to organise itself into large blocks which act as protagonists on the great stage of world competition. This is prompting the Europe of national States to form a single political, economic and commercial entity in order to organise and boost a market of over 350 million consumers and set it on a level with other markets. To this end, we need to establish suitable structures, which could be both political and economic. However, first and foremost, we need political strategies which are free of bureaucracy. Europe is the guardian of great values: peace, freedom and social progress, values which must be protected day in day out precisely because they are the result of victories won at the cost of great sacrifice. Europe's economic progress is now under threat from the current globalisation process, and our continent is in serious danger of a recession caused by competition from South-East Asia – where the cost of labour is a tenth of the cost of labour in Europe – the USA and Japan. The Mediterranean policy is now operating in a world of extremely varied interests and latent stabilisation, and it must therefore include certain elements such as the development of peace-keeping initiatives – but it must not, I would stress, be limited to this – and the creation of partnership projects which involve northern and southern Europe, precisely because the objective of making the Mediterranean an area of dialogue, tolerance and cooperation and a guarantee of peace and stability cannot be achieved without firm political will or without the lasting, well-balanced social and economic development of less-favoured peoples and the social development of the coastal peoples, improving their employment possibilities, in order to put an end to the multitude of problems caused by the tremendous number of emigrants leaving the Basin and now affecting all the countries of the Union. We are therefore convinced that the Union's Mediterranean policy must take account of the Mediterranean Basin and therefore treat the Mediterranean as a project, mindful of the fact that the rights of peoples take priority over the rights of individuals, if only because, when all is said and done, conflicts between nations harm the life and development of the individual citizens. Braudel's ‘Mediterranean of a thousand things’, the ancient civilisations which, for years, have regarded each other with hostility across the Basin, now have the opportunity to start afresh, setting off along a common path which, through political will and the power of dialogue, will lay the foundations for genuine progress and economic and social development.

The budget that Parliament has today approved at first reading could be described as uncontroversial and unspectacular. It has to be said that it is a budget that has been improved along the way, thanks to the efforts of the various political groups who have persuaded the rapporteur to revise the inflexible stance that she initially adopted. Parliament has been able to rectify, at first reading and without proposing any disproportionate or unreasonable increases, the somewhat reductive approach that the Council adopted in July. The funds earmarked for vital sectors of the economy in the Member States, such as agriculture, structural measures and external actions have once again taken on a more fitting scale, and this will enable the Commission to see through its commitments. We would also like to welcome the fact that Parliament has shown itself open to an initiative which, in our opinion, warrants the attention of this House. We refer in particular to the new pilot scheme to finance information measures in the fight against paedophilia. The Budget for 2001 still comprises obscure items that shower funds on a host of associations and cultural centres, the actual need for which is still to be fully proven. The review of the Financial Perspectives that Parliament has been demanding for some time in order to honour new commitments in the Balkan region, including Serbia, also continues to cast its shadow on proceedings. We realise that this review represents, once all the available instruments have been employed, from the redistribution of funds to the use of flexibility margins, the only way of addressing onerous and unforeseeable commitments. However, this revision must not, as is quite possible, result in further substantial cuts in the agriculture sector. Our group will strive to ensure that this does not happen and for this very reason has, in abstaining from the vote, adopted a cautious position on the Haug report that accompanies the 2001 Budget.

Mr President, this year’s budget is, in my opinion, neither very negative nor very positive. Why is this? Clearly, although, on the one hand, a constructive relationship has been maintained with the Commission, thanks to Commissioner Schreyer and to Mr Wynn who chaired the Committee with the patience of a saint, on the other hand, the Council tried to monopolise our budget completely. It may have arrived at the same result but, in political terms, it certainly did not acknowledge the results achieved by our Committee on Budgets. Going so far as to hold back on the decision on the operations in Kosovo and Serbia at a time of such pressing urgency while advancing mere formal issues is certainly not a good image for the Community to be presenting to the rest of the world in political terms. I would nevertheless emphasise, in particular, that, six months ago, one of the political priorities was stressed in this Chamber. I quote the exact words of Parliament’s resolution: ‘The European Parliament requests the Commission to pay special attention to structural problems of an economic or social character caused by natural disasters and to look favourably on measures to help solve these problems; Stresses the need to re-establish line B4-3400 (urgent aid for natural disasters within the European Union) so that urgent needs can be addressed immediately, fully respecting the principle of subsidiarity’. Well, none of this has been achieved. Quite the contrary. At a time in which, with the approach of enlargement and the euro crisis, we need to reinforce the bridges created over the last 50 years between the peoples of the European Union and the Union itself, a Community intervention to assist the peoples who are victims of natural disasters is, at the very least, politically appropriate, and is morally urgent. The same Mr Casaca, who tabled an amendment similar to mine which has my full support, pointed out in a letter – which you have all received – that paradoxical situations have arisen in the past and are in danger of arising in the future, in which urgent operations to assist disaster-stricken areas within our Union are carried out by American marines rather than by Europe itself. This is just one of the potential situations. Another scenario is that the Member States are left to do entirely as they please. By acting in this way in the name of subsidiarity, the Union is, in actual fact, shirking one of its responsibilities, as it has in recent weeks both in northern Italy and in Spain. My observations are frequently criticised for lacking a legal basis. Well, I am going to give you a few references. How many entire families are at death’s door? Is one of the Union’s objectives not to protect health and safety? This is part of Title 13 of the Treaty. How many entire road and other transport networks are becoming unusable? Is one of the Union’s objectives not to make them usable once more? That is what Title 5 of the Treaty says. We could also cite Title 7 and Title 8 of the Treaty on industries and firms which are forced to close down. Are we not going to jeopardise the common economic and employment policy? I refer you to Title 2 of the Treaty. As for harvests which are wiped out in the space of a few days, does this not come under one of the pillars of the Union? So let us stop trying to hide behind a pointing finger and do something instead! Where is the problem? Does this House really feel that a Community intervention in this sector would be contrary to the principle of subsidiarity? I do not think so, and I feel that it is morally right to support the amendment upon which we are going to vote on Thursday.

 Enlargement has been a recurring theme in our debate and our discussions today: each one of us, even those who have not spoken, will surely have been moved to reflect upon what Europe means for them, for their party and for the State that they represent. For me, enlargement is not a question of whether to endorse the entry of certain countries into Europe. Europe and the European Union are two different things: the European Union is a political entity conceived 50 years ago whereas Europe is a geographical, historical, political, cultural and social entity whose origins lie in the mists of time. To become part of the European Union one needs to apply, whereas one becomes part of Europe by birth, through a blood tie which unites all the people of this wonderful continent. Let us not forget this when we discuss enlargement. We are here – and this is right and proper – to assess economic, political and social criteria, but we must be careful not to empty of all significance an act which is in many respects inevitable and preordained. Take Poland, Hungary or the Czech Republic, to mention but a few of the 'candidate' countries: how could we deny that they share our history, our culture and our origins? This is not, of course, an invitation to shirk our responsibilities: we cannot forgo evaluating the transposal of the Community acquis
, just as it is necessary for the Union to make good the commitments it has made to these States under the pre-accession strategy. We must not underestimate the need for healthy pragmatism in our handling of this extremely delicate transition stage, to avoid unnecessary clashes of principles. In general, we are all in favour of enlargement, but this will only fully come about when the candidate countries have carried out the necessary structural reforms, when the European Union's institutions and decision-making processes are capable of handling such a situation and, most importantly, when we at last realise that Europe is not a question of political status but, more than anything else, a story of roots and common history, blood, sweat and tears, dreams and visions, which unite us above and beyond political and economic issues.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Haug report is a good report, particularly the part that deals with cuts in agriculture, which, in my opinion, are the key issue. It is a mistake to make cuts in heading 1, for agriculture is an essential factor in our economy, the economy of the European Union. Agriculture is certainly a fundamental part of any debate on boosting development or employment, not because any of us are agriculture lobbyists but because agriculture must not lose its funding. This point must be stressed, although the report also stresses the difficulty of finding sources of funding for that most remarkable and certainly important operation to be carried out in Kosovo. My question is this: is it possible to carry out the Kosovo operation without taking funds away from other credit lines in our budget? And the answer is that yes, it is possible, it can be done without cutting other credit lines or interfering with sectors which are fundamental for the development of the economy within the European Union but rather giving them financial security for, if we do not do so, we will certainly weaken the European market and the euro against their competitors, NAFTA and the dollar. Therefore, since we profess to have an ongoing budgetary policy which must certainly be focused chiefly on boosting economic development and the economic growth of the individual countries, it is not at all sensible to be financing operations such as the Kosovo operation 
if this means that we cannot predict the extent to which we will be able to finance budget credit lines. Moreover, the very fact that the Council is setting a precedent by including Special Envoys and all our special interventions in its own budget lines is a serious matter. This must stop. It must be seen as highly negative. In my opinion, if we invert this trend, we will be doing a great favour to both our economy and Parliament.

 Mr President, the Maaten report on today’s agenda has lead to this interesting debate. However, we must not forget that our business here is politics, which is quite a different matter from merely sitting here listening to technical arguments or pressure from the varies lobbies such as Philip Morris or the large multinationals: we should be thinking about the future of Europe! In my opinion, the Maaten report, which is certainly technically sound and lays down appropriate parameters, represents a move towards the political will to protect the right to health, a right which must be protected and guaranteed for each and every European citizen. It is, in effect, all part of the realisation throughout the world that smoking is harmful, and we have the figures to prove it. 
Having established that, we can then discuss any other justifications we may wish to. Smoking is harmful and we must use the Maaten report to regulate tax reductions, labelling and the other initiatives proposed in the report which are certainly, for the time being, important but not decisive 
measures.  I feel that the main point to be stressed is the need to create a ‘non-smoking’ culture. Last century, smoking was part of the culture. It was important and provided a sense of security. Now, however, we have to turn that culture on its head. Of course, we must also stress the freedom of each one of us, of all citizens, to choose, and in this case I hope that we will choose the freedom not to smoke, freedom which, however, does not hide the harmful results and dangers of smoking itself. On the other hand, I also have to consider the 400 000 workers and the 150 000 or so tobacco growers of the tobacco industry. In this past century, we have succeeded in changing nuclear energy into something different, into clean energy. It would seem absurd not to be able to change or contribute to the transformation of such industries into equally productive industries which will develop economically and socially in the future. It would be completely absurd, especially at the dawn of a new millennium, in an era in which man landed on the moon, if we do not manage to bring about a change in this industry or to provide accurate information regarding the genuine harm caused by smoking. Well, in my opinion, we have two main tasks: we must endeavour to provide accurate information and give everybody the chance to choose whether to smoke or not, and I hope that they will choose not to – my own family has suffered bereavements through this – and, at the same time, we must bring about a change of culture in the relevant industries.

 Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mrs Haug and Mr Ferber for their reports, which are doubtless comprehensive and very detailed in terms of all the guidelines. I would also like to stress from the outset that, if we want to boost employment in the European Union, it is of fundamental importance to build on the role of small and medium-sized enterprises for, when all is said and done, they are the hard core of our undertaking in Europe. With regard to the reference to the cultural economy and new technologies, this should also be included in the Lisbon report, and my view is that we will be able to use these bases to boost employment substantially. We often talk of a new economy, but if, then, at the end of the day, we ourselves do not focus on the potential core factors, which, in this case, are culture and new technology, then we will certainly not be able to produce solutions.  In addition to this, I welcome the fact that the item of natural disasters occurring within our nations has been reinserted in the budget. Why? Because in this way we can help Member States when they suffer natural disasters, such as earthquakes, for example, because otherwise people will fail to understand why it is that we intervene in countries such as Kosovo, and yet do not seem able to intervene in our own States. And so I welcome the reinsertion of this item in the budget as a major step. However, on a more antagonistic note, I have to point out that we cannot make cuts in agriculture as a matter of course. Naturally, we must finance the Kosovo mission as a fundamental political objective, in order to erase the effects of the war and to prove the existence of a political objective, but we cannot always do so at the expense of agriculture. I would also stress that we need constant guidelines from the Council and the Commission, for we cannot manage on the same budget as last year. It was only thanks to the patience and tenacity of President Wynn that we were able to reach the end of the year. We cannot go on like this. Finally, I would stress the need to restructure the budget – for example, we could axe TAOs – and thus secure new resources.

 Mr President, I would like to stress that, in an age of significant technological changes – just look at what is happening in the information technology sector and other sectors such as energy and transport – safeguarding competition will be of fundamental importance for our future. From the point of view of economic growth, and therefore of increasing employment and wealth, safeguarding a competition policy in the Member States is becoming a crucial factor, and one that is certainly very important for our future. This is why I give this report my full support. Recently, I have noticed that the Commission has been working hard to ensure that this principal is respected in a proper and effective manner, precisely in order to safeguard market flexibility, both for products and for services. I would emphasise that this is going to be extremely important for our future, for Europe’s economy, and, above all, for the protection of our wealth and technological development in Europe in general.

 Mr President, first of all, I would like to say how much I appreciate the report by Mr Bourlanges, who has done a commendable job throughout this period, regarding the budget but also, in my opinion, regarding two of the main issues we are faced with.  The first concerns Kosovo. Kosovo has become, objectively, an important political message for the Commission – and quite rightly so – with the aim of relaunching the political proposal put forward by Europe on the international stage, in order to show that there is in fact a serious intervention by Europe, a Europe that is not just about the economy. We have all approved this political message, but right now, we are discovering that the funds, for their part, do not exist. My disapproval is aimed precisely at this type of behaviour, because the responsibility cannot be off-loaded onto the House for expenditure which should have been budgeted for. We do not agree, either myself personally or my delegation. I would like to emphasise this, so that we will not be given this responsibility in the future, a political responsibility that should not be seen merely in economic terms.  Secondly, I would like to emphasise the promise we were made not too long ago, at the start of the presentation of the budget, on administrative reform of the so-called TAOs. In my opinion, we might manage to find funds to allocate in the future for the various budget lines if we manage to carry out a fair reform meant to support the various departments which provide praiseworthy support, both on a personal level and for research. The reform must be carried out straight away, immediately following the adoption of this budget, in order to allow us to proceed to fair planning. If this is what happens, we will have the chance to intervene, to influence our economies and reach one of our objectives as MEPs: relaunching and developing our countries.

Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for the excellent report that we have all read. In my opinion, the Millennium Round is taking place at a very special time for the European economy, and the international economy in particular. Indeed, globalisation is now a subject that is discussed on a daily basis. It has lead to the free market and to victory over any economic theory. Having said that, I do not mean that we have a perfect market and, precisely for this reason, being aware of both the benefits and the corruption, we must seek to establish standards and regulations by means of agreements such as those proposed by the WTO in order to insure all of us against excesses of any type. Just think of the financial speculation that can overwhelm entire geographical areas, reducing them to poverty or even causing institutional upheaval. Having said that, the WTO round of negotiations is not being used to create something that is supranational, as is often feared, something that circumvents international rights or does not want to let the free market fluctuate, but it is being used to set out, in particular, specific rules for all of us, at the same time safeguarding certain fundamental rights such as the right to health, education and social duties in a framework that protects the rights of each individual citizen.  However, as far as the prices of products and services are concerned, we must ask for not only a tariff reduction but, above all, we should also make a request in terms of the quality of the products and services themselves, as a means of protecting small and medium-sized enterprises. This will be increasingly important in the future, and there is also the increasing need to emphasise the central importance of agriculture within individual economies, and – and this is stressed in the report, but increasingly, each one of us needs to press forward resolutely with this – to protect small and medium-sized enterprises with appropriate legislation. If we manage to comply with these obligations and improve quality of life with sustainable development, both in economic and environmental terms, we will have laid strong foundations for a better society in the next millennium.

 Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank Mr Bourlanges for his competence and the great balance he has shown in preparing this budget. However, I must emphasise the fact that this year’s budget cannot fulfil the objectives set at the beginning, that is, a revival of the Union’s economy and, above all, growth in employment. Indeed, if we start by cutting back the budgets by 10% and we hit sectors like industry, trade, transport and in some cases, even agriculture, we will not be able to revive our economy and become more competitive with regard to competitors such as the United States and NAFTA.  We must not forget that these are our real competitors and that therefore, only budgetary policies aimed at protecting investments and economic growth will allow us to lay the foundations for a Union which will certainly be stronger from a structural and economic point of view. In view of this, I therefore propose that during the next period, we no longer analyse the programmes and their related credit lines for periods of four, five or six years but for shorter periods – one or two years at most – as the rationales of the market and investment in a now global economy no longer correspond to the criterion which the budget itself was built on. In fact, everything is moving much more quickly and much more competitively on the market. This will allow us to intervene immediately in specific sectors and, at the same time, to verify whether our budgetary policy is on course, moving in the direction we set out.  In short, this is a budget which must be revised by including new credit lines with regard to international interventions. I therefore agree with the line set out in Mr Bourlanges’ report, although nothing must be taken away from the other credit lines that have already been allocated. At the same time, however, we must endeavour to alter the content and rationale of the budget to take into account the challenges that the Union will have to face over the coming years, in particular the fact that the real enemy to be overcome within the individual States is unemployment.

 Mr President, first of all, we must analyse the first period of the ECB’s activities which, as we know, began a year ago in the hope of becoming, in time, the main institution for intervention in the economies of the Member States of the Union. On the one hand, we have all noticed the greater role played recently by this institution – and indirectly, at the same time, the whole Union – in terms of economic policy and, especially, employment policy. On the other hand, this was not sufficient to ensure that the euro was not affected by speculation or weakened in the face of our competitors – which, of course, we must definitely not ignore – which are the United States and NAFTA. In fact the euro, which started with a strong position in the money markets, after a few months was exposed to attacks which were, to say the least, speculative. We must take note of this signal and always ensure that the focus behind major political, budgetary and monetary strategies is not the new single currency but a long-term view taking into account the need to give the euro and the Member States stability, and above all, to relaunch the Union’s economy and the employment situation which concerns each of us in this Parliament so greatly.  Therefore, we must continue along the path which President Duisenberg is establishing within his role and the institution itself. However, at the same time, we must monitor price stability so that we can control the greater evil with which we are all familiar – inflation – and at the same time keep interest rates low to stimulate investments and relaunch the European industrial sector, making it more competitive with regard to the other States. In doing this, we would bring prestige to a new institution like the ECB and we would gain political credibility internationally.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it will seem incredible or maybe simply a coincidence, but just yesterday evening, I was given a statement on behalf of the Kurdish authorities on the continuation of the armed struggle. In my opinion, this should be condemned in the name of both democracy and mutual civil respect of populations. I am saying this because this is the real Turkish problem, along with the relations between us as the Community and the Turkish State.  Before the Öçalan case, nobody questioned the wisdom of the best possible relations with a State which had always declared its desire for an ever-closer cooperation with the Community, even to the point of asking to accede. Mr Poettering himself stated just now in his report that at the time of the customs agreements, he was in favour of this step. On the one hand, both as a Catholic first and as a politician second, I must stress the need in Turkey for more genuine respect for civil rights and fundamental values, especially as regards human rights. But on the other hand, we have to consider that all the commitments made by Turkey to the Community in recent years in terms of foreign policy, cooperation, economy and also in the cultural field, have always been honoured. So in my opinion, we need to press both the President of the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council, as well as ourselves in this Parliament, to make sure that all the agreements made with the Turkish State are upheld and complied with. And also that the competent Community bodies continue the timely and very thorough task of checking that the democratisation process and the peaceful resolution of the differences with other States are actually going ahead and are not mere words spoken by the Turkish State.  If we continue with the goal of enlarging the Community and, at the same time, of ensuring it complies with fundamental principles and values, this institution will assume its true role once more, which is fundamental in terms of foreign policy and international credibility.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when we are declaring that, together with the new Commission, we must give a central role to the European Parliament, it is only natural that we should consider relaunching Parliament’s foreign policy at the same time. The crisis in Russia gives us that opportunity. Indeed, at a time when the international community and the world press are emphasising the importance of the scandal taking place in Russia, we must take the initiatives necessary for understanding the gravity of this scandal, the explanations of the Russian Government regarding these accusations and our position with regard to the Community’s financial aid for Russia. Of course, Commissioner Kinnock’s report is studied and significant, but above all we need to consider the political aspect of what is happening in Russia at the moment. In the near future, all this could destabilise international politics and also the Community’s trade relations with Russia itself, not to mention the serious consequences for the Community’s entrepreneurs who have invested in this country. We must remember that the current scandals are rocking the Russian Nomenclature and institutional representatives. Moreover, the United States decided in Congress to launch an inquiry to ascertain the use of money given as financial aid to Russia and whether it has been used instead in an illegal way. Having said this, the Community’s Institutions must, in my opinion, ask the competent Russian authorities to clarify how funds intended for the development of the country and for its food crisis were used.  The services of the Commission, which oversaw the aid to Russia, are drawing up a report on the way the funds were used. In short, they are requesting a committee of inquiry, made up of the Council, the Commission, the European Parliament, the EIB and the EBRD which will verify how much aid was sent to Russia, which funds were used and if it was spent in the planned way. Take the TACIS programme for example. Just yesterday, President Prodi referred to the concept of transparency in his Commission and at the same time, co-operation with the European Parliament. If this is the first commitment, we must immediately clarify our relations with Russia and clarify the bilateral relations between the Community and the Russian Government. If we do all this, we will give our institution political significance and we will regain credibility in the eyes of the world.

 Madam President, Commissioner Liikanen, two years ago when Parliament began looking at the regulation in question, it seemed truly unthinkable that the legislative process could be settled with almost unanimous agreement. Yet, with the vote tomorrow and the conclusion of the second reading, we can say that the process is essentially concluded with the agreement of all those concerned. It must be said that the initial Commission text radically reformed the provisions in question, yet the amendments made to the original text were not at all minor. The definition of ‘surfactant’, additional tests, the derogation from authorisation, labelling, more and better information for consumers, are all aspects that genuinely broaden environmental protection and human health protection and that take into consideration the well-being of animals within the context of research for the development of products. It must also be stressed that the text in question considers the difficulties of small and medium-sized enterprises, for which the procedures have been simplified, without disregarding the necessary protection. I will not expand any further my explanation of the text that I hope Parliament will tomorrow be able to adopt with a large majority. Instead, I would like to thank all the groups and their shadow rapporteurs who, during this long phase, drew up the text in question after very effective dialogue. I feel that everyone can find reason to be satisfied with aspects or sections of the text in terms of what was constructively contributed and that they will, therefore, find they can agree with the overall text in terms of the afore-mentioned assessments. Furthermore, I would like to thank the Commission for being willing to reconsider its proposals and for the commitment there was to harmonise a text, which is certainly not easy, to make it satisfactory in view of all the respective points of view. I must add that, even when faced with a continuous exchange of proposals and with understanding everyone’s demands, we also prepared a legislative product with the Commission that met with broad satisfaction. It is true that an important contribution was also made to this text by the Council, which, faced with the immense commitment of the Italian Presidency that has just come to an end, effectively followed the text’s progress and intervened at once, just when it seemed that the common position, which was aimed precisely at opening a second reading, would be delayed; nor do I want to forget the commitment and interest shown by the Irish Government delegation long before it assumed the current Presidency, thus showing a real desire to best define the text in question. Having said that, as a signal of the long road together, I refuse to believe that the only point on which there seem to be differences can really be a reason to start the conciliation procedure. I am referring to the provision for revision where the Commission commits to providing Parliament and the Council with a report on the anaerobic biodegradation of surfactants and on the biodegradation of other components within five years, and to put forward proposals on phosphates within three years. The problem, however, does not seem to be so much this, but the possibility of this happening in the next parliamentary term, and this because the standard phrase on the entry into force of the current regulation would, in fact, prevent the afore-mentioned commitment being made good within the next parliamentary term. As we know, compromise texts have been presented on which there is, as has been said, general agreement. The solution to the problem that I have just explained is contained in the afore-mentioned texts. I am sure that all of the groups will be happy with this solution and, appealing to the Commission, I would like to hope that the matter could be happily resolved so as to conclude a somewhat problematic procedure in a generally satisfactory manner.

Mr President, first of all, it should be said that the contents of the compromise that appears to have taken shape lately cannot be said to be acceptable, just as various aspects of the original proposal were unacceptable. We can certainly support the principle behind it: to give every MEP the same dignity and, above all, a constant reminder of a single point of reference for the exercise of their mandate, with the same common rights and responsibilities. Many aspects of the proposed law run counter to this principle: the first concerns the time when this law would come into force. In my opinion, rivers of words and of ink have already been spoken and written on the enlargement of the European Union, to support and comment positively on the many facets of the procedure; I do not intend, therefore, to add my positive thoughts on the matter. Nevertheless, it has not been uncommon, especially recently, for the Community institutions to adopt legislative provisions and with many expressions of regret acknowledging the need to involve the future Member States only in the conciliation phase. Since that is the case, it is difficult to understand why it is a matter of such urgency to adopt the aforementioned Statute, since this would be done without the contribution of MEPs from the future Member States. I mean that we are being deliberately ‘forgetful’. Furthermore, if the principle is one of equality, indeed material equality, it is difficult to understand why MEPs, from whatever State they may be, when carrying out their mandate, which is at least equal to, if not higher than, that of a national MP, may have fewer prerogatives than the latter. In emphasising this point, I am, of course, referring to the national systems that provide the highest guarantees, because I find a system of rights that, in practice, tends to dumb down the guarantees provided for, is unacceptable. There is, however, more and it concerns points that are, if you like, less noble, but that also call the concept of dignity into question. Certainly, nobody would object to a single source being responsible for the payment of salaries, but there is no doubt that one of the major problems here is the size of the salaries, that is, the reference to the amount that should, in the future, be paid as against current remuneration, whether this be higher or lower. In terms of ethics within their own country, I cannot see how one could justify a European Parliament Member suddenly receiving a higher, and in some cases much higher, salary, even from a source other than the current one. Similarly I cannot imagine how other Members could contemplate receiving a lower salary than the one they receive today, especially in consideration of the higher salaries received by national MPs, if not, indeed, by regional advisors, in the same State. If, for a moment, however, we examine the principle of equality and see it as a positive factor, the concern expressed about taxation would mean falling back again into the trap of extreme disparities. Then the compromise on the age of retirement does not seem to be worthy either. The overwhelming majority of the Member States currently set retirement in public organisations at the age of 65 or over. Thus, either we have the courage to ignore the fact that, because the pension scheme for MEPs is practically self-financed, it falls outside the pension costs of each Member State and, for the sake of pure political consistency, we opt for a retirement age limit of 65; or we show similar courage in admitting that the fund is, in substance, of a private nature and that the only valid rules are those dictated by actuarial statistical calculation. I think that, in the event that the two other institutions fail to address this, the first to place themselves in a position of subordination will not be Parliament so much as its own Members.

 Madam President, I would like to start by expressing my appreciation of the wearisome work carried out by the rapporteurs, and I am completely serious in saying this, for it has certainly been no mean feat to reconcile positions which were initially so very far apart and achieve the present position, which has backing across the board. However, I have to mention the fact that today’s consensus is the result of a compromise which is not really particularly satisfactory, adopted purely because of the unyielding reluctance of the Commission and, in particular, the Council, to build a better basis. Indeed, the resulting framework certainly cannot be said to be complete. That is not so much because the issue continues to be addressed by 35 different reports without even the slightest attempt being made to link them, nor because, for the present phase, it has been decided to split the matter into three different regulations – one of which is not to be debated in this part-session, moreover – as because the framework which emerges is in itself highly dysfunctional, a fact which has been purposefully disregarded in the name of the urgent need to regulate the matter. I could cite many examples, such as, for instance, the fact that authorisations are to be valid for ten years and the obligation to keep correspondence and the results of tests carried out for only 15 years. In addition, it will be a long time before we have identification codes and the sampling techniques are random, with no standardised procedures, while, what is more, there is the recommendation to monitor the life of GMOs and products produced from GMOs closely, without, however, it being possible to require additional risk assessments. There is one example, in particular, which I feel is absurd: so-called co-existence. I know there is no point in going back over the arguments raised in the debate on this matter, but the fact is that the path chosen – the decision to require the Member States to produce rules governing the area before the Commission has had time to give its opinion – is surely highly unusual. I hope I am wrong when I say that it will not be the benchmarking techniques which stop pollution, in addition to which there is no mention of the ‘polluter pays’ principle, while, moreover, the acceptability criteria of 0.5 – 0.9, which caused so much debate, are completely invalidated. In conclusion, we certainly needed to move on from the current derogations, but that could have been achieved with more meaningful and, above all, more coherent provisions.

 Madam President, Commissioner, I do not want to use my speaking time to give a technical account of the work carried out and its significance because I believe you are all familiar with that; this is certainly not presumption on my part but an acknowledgement of the clearly prodigious efforts of the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, manifested, first and foremost, in the tabling of a large number of amendments. I can only thank them for this, for there is no doubt that, over and above the general intention of introducing one’s own ideas into a report, the ultimate goal is to improve the report itself and its effectiveness in the common, general interest. Likewise, I cannot fail to thank the shadow rapporteurs from all the political groups for their sensitivity and for their goodwill in drafting at least eight compromise amendments to take account of concepts, objectives and proposals. My personal opinion, therefore, is that the product of the work of the Committee on the Environment, which is now before the House, has much broader backing than might have been expected when the Commission first submitted its proposal to Parliament. As I said before, I am not saying this out of pride but in order to give credit to all the members of the committee who have worked on the report. Of course, we cannot claim that the report covers all aspects of the issue of detergents. We still have to analyse and express a position on a number of points. We have to decide what line to take on phosphates, for example, what line to take on the anaerobic biodegradability of surfactants, and again, what level to set with regard to the biodegradability of other components of detergents. Incidentally, it therefore appeared necessary to all concerned to set a deadline within which to ask the Commission to express its opinion on the rest of the matter. It can be said, however, that our primary objective in amending the proposal in question was to make the text and related instruments more usable, more functional and more cohesive. This, in any case, was the line we followed in our work. I must stress that, as well as seeking to make the rules proposed more usable, functional and cohesive, we took care to pursue two further objectives. The first was to employ practical sensitivity with regard to small and medium-sized enterprises, a particularly good example of this being the establishment of the derogation, without – we trust – giving any less consideration to the need to provide ever-increasing protection of the environment, public health and animal welfare. The second, in the context of the – at last binding – labelling system, concerns the goal of increasing the awareness of consumers when they make choices, without in any way detracting from the valuable work of consumer protection organisations but, on the contrary, enhancing it. That said, I would like to focus briefly on the fact that the regulation in question certainly does not cover all the questions related to detergents, and I am not criticising the Commission’s work here but pointing out two further characteristic aspects of both this and previous provisions on detergents. The first – as I suggested at the start of my speech – is the underlying approach to the issue: the Commission took the approach of phasing in the legislation. The second, which almost justifies the first, is the need for recourse to a third body, in this case to a scientific committee, to implement the legislation. When amending the regulation in question, we have attempted to assess the tasks entrusted to the committee and bring those considered to be political rather than technical before the House for it to study and vote on. The rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs worked together to achieve this undertaking too. Since, however, there are both technical and political aspects – and there are – and since it is true that the work carried out in the Committee on the Environment has been productive and enjoyed remarkably broad support, then I find it difficult to understand why some of my colleagues, without wishing to undermine everyone’s individual right to do so, have tabled further amendments in plenary. In any case, in this regard, I have to say that I support Amendments Nos 47, 52, 53 and 60, which indisputably make additional important contributions which complement the current provisions. I also have to say that my feelings are essentially neutral as regards Amendments Nos 56 and 61, which merely change the position of points within the regulation itself, whereas I have to express firm rejection of the remaining amendments, certainly not – to conclude – because I disapprove of their content in principle, nor even because they partially belie the consensus expressed in committee, but because, should they be accepted, they would not achieve what is undeniably the desired objective of the text to be issued, namely providing better protection, but would compromise the cohesiveness, functionality and usability which I mentioned earlier, which is consistent with that phasing-in of the legislation that is based on the scientific approach.

 Mr President, although different, Mrs Patrie, Mrs Thyssen and Mr Whitehead’s reports appear to express a faint, common feeling of disappointment which – if it is actually there – we endorse, as we do the content of the reports. Indeed, the Commission’s statements to the effect that the fragmentation of European and national rules on consumer protection prevents the smooth functioning of the internal market cannot be disputed, nor can the fact that many consumers’ lack of confidence, for example in cross-border transactions, is caused by the existence of divergences between bodies of law and, to an even greater extent, maybe, by lack of awareness of the protection available. Similarly, therefore, an indisputable need arises for a simple, standardised legal framework comprising a limited number of fundamental rules that are applicable whatever the nature of the commercial transaction 
and provide protection throughout the cycle, including in post-contractual and after-sales relations. We therefore welcome the line taken by the Commission as regards the need for a global approach to the issue which, on the one hand, seeks to set out obligations, starting with fair commercial behaviour, and, on the other hand, is based on objective criteria in order to avoid different interpretations by the Member States. However, although all this makes sense, it is impossible not to notice inconsistent behaviour on the part of the Commission itself occasionally, starting with but not confined to an excessive acceleration of the rate at which we are addressing the issue. As we know, the 2001 Green Paper on Consumer Protection, for example, opened a period of widespread consultation and a valuable debate on the future of Community consumer law. Yet, 
even before the results of the consultation process are known, the Commission has presented a proposal for a regulation on sales promotion in the internal market, which, on the one hand, pays little attention to the views of the European Parliament on the global approach, and, on the other, gives the absurd impression that we would prefer to continue to take a sectoral approach. Again, the different approaches to issues which are ultimately similar such as – by way of another example – the issue of labelling, in which the presence of identical substances is being regulated differently only a few months later, fall short of the ideal. We believe that there is no cause for objection where preparations primarily intended for healthcare applications are used in other fields. A recent example is that of cosmetics and detergents. To stay in this context for a moment longer, we believe that consumers need to be informed of the products used but we also believe that, to this end, they need to have access to useful information, information which can put them in a position where they can make choices, not least ‘political’ choices themselves. That does not mean we do not value – for we greatly appreciate it – the major work carried out by consumer protection organisations. However, if the idea is to pursue a high level of protection while seeking, at the same time, to achieve acceptable harmonisation of internal market rules, there appear to be two courses of action, one of which will follow on from the other. The first is that mentioned by Mr Whitehead, when he states that a case-by-case analysis would be appropriate to assess whether, when amending existing legislation or developing new legislation, minimum or maximum 
harmonising provisions are more suitable. Once this has been determined, the other is the correct transposal and practical enforcement of Community law by the Member States. Here, once again, the Commission has a decisive role, although it is true that, from a general perspective, only five States have thus far met the targets set by the Barcelona European Council on implementation rates.

 Madam President, Commissioner, there is no doubt that Mr Mann has done an excellent job. Indeed, his proposals are based on the highest Community tradition in social matters and employment policy and, in terms of proactive measures, incorporate a broad range of innovative points and fields such as the knowledge-based society and its strategic implications. I am certainly not making the points that follow out of a desire to criticise, therefore, but, if anything, in order to share our hopes, although I fear that they may be quite insubstantial in areas such as small and medium-sized enterprises, with regard to which a number of different points have been made. Indeed, we all know that, as regards taxation, if we want to implement the recommendations made we have three options, which can either be treated as alternatives or employed in parallel: the Stability Pact and its durability, particularly with regard to the possibility of complete exemption for SMEs for the first three years, in view of their substantial contribution to national GDP; a review of the areas covered by the subsidiarity system; or, again, a review of the areas requiring a unanimity vote in the Council. I am not being pessimistic here, just realistic. Another good example in the area of financial matters is the proposed policies for making credit available to small and medium-sized enterprises, which would appear to be in contrast with the contents of the 2002 Basel agreement, which does not allow the necessary raising of sufficient venture capital for small and medium-sized enterprise and for the internationalisation thereof. The same may be said of incentives to promote employment, as the rapporteur calls them, which are considered to be a different matter from flexibility and bureaucratic relief. If they are, then they are direct examples of State aid pursuant to Article 87(3)(a) and (c) of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which, as the rapporteur is aware, only apply in areas identified in 1998, apparently without possibility of amendment, not even where situations have changed with the passage of time. The role of the social partners, however, which the rapporteur has rightly emphasised, is a consideration worthy of mention. Called upon to implement forms of local partnership and contractual flexibility within a coherent framework of principles, the social partners are now, despite the European social dialogue, in a position where they do not, in practice, have the bodies or policies to lay down minimum social standards for enterprises, particularly in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, notwithstanding, inter alia
, the fact that a great many of these enterprises originate from current Member States. This is a situation which, in these countries, usually combined with lower taxation and a gradual increase in the consideration given to the Community acquis in environmental matters, is certainly creating new jobs, although it does mean that there is no hope of narrowing clear social gaps, even in the medium term. A further point concerns the knowledge-based society itself, aims and objectives of which we support. As the rapporteur is aware, the knowledge-based society cannot be achieved just by increasing the number of computers in families and schools or by introducing better, more focused training, although that is needed, but it is based on both the full, appropriate exploitation of useful information and the availability of this information. In conclusion, what I fear is that, despite all the emphasis continually and repeatedly placed on the importance of employment and social policies and their horizontal integration with other policies, they will remain merely a kind of by-product, a by-product which, within the Member States which are unmindful of the content of the European social agenda, combines the sterile display of positive or negative quantitative results with, I am sad to say, constant rhetoric and equally persistent erosion of quality.

 We voted for Mr Berenguer Fuster’s report. Indeed, it would be difficult not to, considering who the beneficiaries of this aid are and the goals of simplification and transparency that the Commission has set itself. The issue we need to reflect on, however, is the fact that, as the Commission is quite aware, in some regions of the Member States of the Union, the difference between being in an area receiving aid under Article 87(3) and not being in such an area is a tax reduction in excess of 12%. The question is then the content of Article 4(3) of the draft regulation, with reference precisely to the above-mentioned regions, for we believe that the method of determining the areas does not produce a wholly accurate definition of which areas are genuinely disadvantaged and that the Commission is aware of this. Consider the method used by local employment systems to define these areas and how it has been disregarded in some cases. We therefore believe that the current maps should be revised to ensure that they are consistent, irrespective of whether the regions themselves have used them. Otherwise, even with the planned 10% increase on the upper limit, the draft regulation would, in those cases, essentially serve the purpose of – covertly and only partially – remedying the errors made.

 Mr President, the motion for a resolution tabled by the UEN Group and the motions tabled by the other political groups seek essentially to create a credit line in the Union’s budget to help to deal with the damage caused by the natural disasters which have occurred recently in a number of Member States and in the candidate countries. Moreover, the need for emergency Community action was blatantly obvious if we consider the exceptionally widespread effects of the atmospheric phenomena which have affected the whole of Europe. When he visited the disaster areas, President Prodi himself could only, in expressing the Union’s condolences, declare its ready availability to intervene with both exemptions and financial aid. In our opinion, there are other considerations which point to the need for the creation of a stable credit line. Although many would not admit it, I am afraid it is becoming obvious that our world’s climate is changing, and it is not necessary to subscribe to the theory of alarmism to see this. Of course, meteorological statistics through the years have consistently done their best to show us encouraging comparisons, making the scale of disasters seem less large, but it is not their – still large – scale which is disturbing now so much as the increasing frequency with which they occur, on the one hand, and the fact that they repeatedly occur out of season in Europe, on the other. The creation of a stable credit line in the Union’s budget would, therefore, help the States to take the necessary action to address the damage caused by these events. There is no doubt, however, that the other, more important part of the Community’s action must relate to prevention. It is certainly useful to reconsider at both national and Community level agricultural production policies, forestation policies and policies for managing hydrological risk areas. In any case, the key issue, the essential consideration, is certainly the greenhouse effect and its harmful consequences,
 which, I am sad to say, have been scientifically proven beyond all reasonable doubt. We must reflect on the fact that the issue of the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions – addressed for the first time as early as 10 years ago in New York and for the second time six years later in Kyoto in the famous Protocol – is still far from being resolved in any significant way because of the failure of a sufficient number of States to ratify the Protocol. The call for Russia to ratify the Protocol is certainly an important step, but it falls within the scope of the political and economic relations which are being established with that country. We still have an unquestionable duty 
to insist more firmly that 
the candidate countries ratify the Protocol, starting with Poland.

 Mr President, we are not totally against GMOs and their use. However, we are in favour of their use being regulated, as, moreover, the international situation demands: 50 million hectares of land are cultivated in the world using GMOs compared with only 12 000 hectares in Europe. This should prompt us to investigate the state of European research, and the role of Europe in the WTO and the – often unregulated, uncontrolled – use of products containing GMOs in developing countries. Similarly, it should draw attention to the importance of safeguarding biodiversity and of providing guarantees and ensuring consumer safety, for science is not yet able to do this with certainty. However, this is not the right occasion for this. What disturbs us, however, about the proposals before us and the related work of the rapporteurs is some of the ways the principles of the Cartagena Protocol are supposed to be interpreted. Indeed, it would appear that precautions and transparency, which are the basic elements of the Protocol, are to be interpreted in a way which, at times, even distorts their meaning, especially if we read the second regulation, the regulation on traceability and labelling. There is no trace of a uniform method guaranteeing that operators have taken all the steps necessary to avoid contamination, nor is there a requirement for an authority certifying that these measures have been carried out, nor, moreover, is there consistency between the levels of contamination permitted. The same may be said of the samples to be deposited together with the authorisation application, it being left to the discretion of the applicants for the authorisation whether to take a sample or not. Moreover, it would not appear appropriate to require economic operators to provide evidence of the quality of scientific tests, which, moreover, would be a unilateral requirement since not even the Cartagena Protocol gives any significant consideration to the issue of accountability, putting off any analysis even of the principles until after 4 years from the Protocol’s entry into force. Again, if the objective is traceability, as far as the precautionary principle is concerned, we fail to understand why an authorisation granted has to be valid for 10 years under one regulation while, under the other regulation, the supporting documentation only has to be retained for five years. We hope, with regard to the work carried out by the rapporteurs and, in particular, Mrs Scheele, who has, nevertheless, succeeded in improving the Commission’s proposal, that the points giving cause for concern will be amended, so that consistency which is at least functional can be achieved.

 Mr President, there is no doubt that, between them, the Council and Commission statements and Mr Brok’s valuable work have painted a full picture of the enlargement process and the progress of the negotiations with the candidate countries. The concerns voiced here, however, although, it is true, expressed by confirmed believers in the historic importance of the enlargement process and strategy, relate to the apparent haziness of the situation surrounding the process itself. To be sure, almost all the candidate countries have put up a commendable performance in developing their legal systems and economies quickly. In any case, respect for the Copenhagen criteria and assimilation of the Community acquis – which, however, we feel should be interpreted in general terms – are compulsory. However, what we do not fully understand, less than two years off the first wave of entries, is whether the final decision will depend on practical results or whether it will be affected by the pseudopolitical, not to say paternalistic attitudes which have reared their heads, which are not indicative of the great overall willingness to cooperate which the Union ought to be showing. Moreover, it is not clear what the result of the entry of – presumably 10 – countries in 2004 will be, in the sense that we do not know what impact the overspending on the part of four countries will have on the current financial planning and therefore on the treatment that will be reserved for the new Member States. Certainly, a sure response needs to be given at least with regard to the size of the Structural Funds commitments that will be set aside for them in the short- and long-term future, not least to give them time to find responses to the respective problems of social and economic cohesion which are emerging in some of those countries and develop an effective social and employment policy and a code of good practice for undertakings. Border security, respect for minors, civil rights, the own-resources funding system and an effective judicial system are certainly extremely important, but it is equally important for each of the candidate countries to involve its citizens in the process, to provide them with the right information and to be able to convince them that it is worth making temporary sacrifices now as an investment for future prosperity, if this last is actually the object of the exercise.

 Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on her excellent work, although some of the issues she has dealt with have caused some confusion. With regard to the majority of them, we believe that we cannot make any exception to the fundamental ideals relating to growth and civilisation in which we firmly believe and which Parliament has never failed to uphold. This applies to animal experimentation, amongst other practices, where continuing to fail to apply a limit, thereby delaying research into alternative methods of experimentation, means failing to encourage research itself and continuing to use practices which are in conflict with those goals of prosperity and civilisation. The only point in Mrs Roth-Behrendt’s report which I do not understand is the point relating to Amendment No 28, previously Amendment No 26, to the Commission text, which contains the list of allergenic substances. Clearly, the respect to be shown towards animals must also be shown in equal measure to human beings, and it is therefore our responsibility to place a limit on the use of substances with proven allergenic capacity. Out of the 23 substances listed in the amendment, there are certainly 13, as the rapporteur rightly points out, with proven allergenic capacity, and it is therefore justified to place a limit on their content in products. Then there are another 13 whose excessive toxicity has yet to be proved, as the rapporteur implies, moreover, specifying that the Scientific Committee has recommended limits to be placed on their use, purely as a precautionary measure and pending more thorough analysis. This is an indirect precaution in the sense that there can be absolutely no risk of toxicity – always assuming that their might have been – in the use of these ingredients according to the limits laid down. The fact is that these last 13 substances include 11 defined as natural essential oils which may as well not be used at all as be used in the quantities laid down, and the concern is therefore not that the quality of the product will suffer but that local farming economies, particularly in the south of Europe and particularly in France and Italy, which produce the basic ingredients – jasmine, citrus fruit in general and bergamot, in particular – will be wiped out.

 The Commission should be congratulated on its timely decision to address the vital issue of promoting a European framework for corporate social responsibility. We endorse the White Paper, the resulting consultation process and the enormous response it was given, and the relevant debate promoted by numerous Commission initiatives. Mr Howitt, whose work we endorse, has highlighted many specific aspects, starting with the need for the Commission to table, within the framework of the forthcoming review of the European Works Council Directive, amendments requiring checks and monitoring of the most significant social and environmental consequences of corporate activity. Of particular interest is the proposal to create an EU platform for corporate social responsibility that brings together the various stakeholders, making it possible to register codes of conduct, and offering arbitration between companies, individuals and the Community whenever the codes are violated. With regard to the European awards, we would call on the Commission to encourage the Member States to provide incentives for national awards for corporate social responsibility too. These awards, intended as a reward for firms, could provide a significant incentive to adopt appropriate management procedures and to speed up the training and readaptation process for managers and employees, in order to provide them with the qualifications and skills they need.

 In her report – which I voted for – the rapporteur has rightly described the proposal for a regulation before us and the additional proposals as innovative. It is indeed innovative in terms of the consolidation and simplification of the various rules in existence on the matters in question. Nevertheless, the rapporteur also poses the question of whether – our food security system having been described as one of the most rigorous in the world – there are not too many gaps in Community legislation or whether, on the other hand, it might not impose too many rules. In actual fact, we need Community legislation that is more conceptual and less regulatory in that, precisely because of its regulatory nature, gaps – if not contradictions – start to appear in our legislation in the medium to long term with the progress of science and technology and also as a result of new developments in the fields covered by Community legislation and/or changes in the underlying approaches. In any case, two considerations need to be stressed both with regard to the matter before us today and, if possible, in unprecedented cases which arise in the future. The first is the need for precise definition of the roles, competences and responsibilities of entrepreneurs, Member States and the Commission. The second is the need for a greater and more effective role for Europe – for the Commission, if you prefer – in international contexts, starting with the WTO. It is also true, however, that, to achieve the latter, Europe needs institutional reform. (Text cut short pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)

 The Commission deserves credit for having appropriately addressed an issue which is crucial to social cohesion in a 15-Member State Europe, soon to be a 27-Member State Europe. It must also be complimented on having done so adopting a line and principles which, preserving the subsidiarity criterion, facilitate the creation and development of common guidelines and goals through the open method of coordination and the national action plans on pensions. However, we believe that, although the Commission communication covers a wide range of aspects, it fails to give adequate consideration to the scale of the issue or, therefore, to its future assessment. Mr Fatuzzo, whose work I support, has stressed a large number of specific points, starting with the need to codify in future indicators what is actually pension provision and what, on the other hand, is welfare provision although, by mere political whim, a burden on pensions saving and therefore on the resources of the underwriters. Two further points deserve a mention: the first concerns the removal of taxation on pension schemes, the second essentially social cohesion within the individual States. With regard to the first point, it would, in fact, be absurd to consider, as happens in some States, the gross amount of pension expenditure when we know that that amount is subject to taxation in any case, irrespective of the different levels applied. With regard to the other point, cohesion, there is no doubt that the disadvantaged territories of the Member States can and must benefit from incentives for the development of local economies and therefore of employment.

 Mr President, Mr Trentin’s work deals very clearly with important matters for the future of the Union, and it does so by appropriately combining economic and social approaches, in a context of involvement and participation, in order to maintain a social security framework, and of innovation as well. One passage among so many seems significant, however: the one about the need not to wait for the effects of the American recovery. Among the various reasons for agreeing with this statement is that we do not believe fully in the soundness of the revival across the Atlantic. The reversal of the unemployment trend and an upturn on the Nasdaq contrast, in fact, with the sharp rise in oil prices, perhaps because of the winds of war blowing through the oil-producing countries. Each of these aspects taken alone supports the points raised in the report before us, but they also support the need for it to have a wholly European focus, which includes maintaining the Stability and Growth Pact, because another perplexing aspect in the USA is, paradoxically, the increase in floating capital, perhaps as an intentional inflationary nudge to level off the huge public investments that have been made. This is an aspect that Europe cannot allow itself, with fifteen economies that are sometimes profoundly different from each other. Of course, the expectation is that as soon as possible the Union will achieve effective open coordination – in social as well as economic policy – with joint consideration of fiscal policies, but with the warning that without constant, real grass-roots participation there will be no economic growth that can be enjoyed by the general public. The reference to greater participation by local players is explicit, as the second report on cohesion has shown, but from the standpoint of enlargement there is also a clear reference to wider enjoyment, or at least greater access to information regarding Community support, since the fact is that the EAGGF, for instance, has reported significantly low take-up rates in the Member States. Similarly, what is needed for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, besides the hoped-for transparency about future action and the procedures for it, is the constructive requirement that the ways in which pre-accession funds are used should be better monitored, bearing in mind that in these countries, still coming to grips with setting up an own resources system, there are generally not enough funds available to support cofinancing. It is, in fact, extremely difficult to justify scientifically, as the Union demands, the inclusion of environmental sites on the Natura 2000 list before the Trans-European Networks are built. In the latter respect, more and better participation by the countries of Central and Eastern Europe in Community plans and programmes would be welcome, as would their greater participation in transport policy, including attention to Community corridors. In conclusion, what I am trying to say is that not only are the economic and social plans extremely opportune, but so is the harmonious and integrated way they are implemented, with a vision that goes from the new, near borders… (The President cut the speaker off)

 Of course, I welcome the content of Mr Mayol i Raynal’s report, which I voted for, just as, moreover, after the Ecofin Council request in September 2000, I welcome the Commission’s intention to establish, at last, a labour cost index whose validity and usefulness are supported by a legal basis and recognised throughout the Union. That said, I wonder what the Commission will do with the future data and what its actual significance will be. In particular, I have reservations regarding one part of the Commission’s text, which states that labour costs are a potential source of inflation. The rapporteur himself raises this concern too, for if there is any question to be posed in that regard it is whether a mere four categories are sufficient to provide all the elements necessary to achieve the complex figure we want. We are all aware of the significance, within a production category, of the labour cost per product unit, linked as it is to the extent to which machines are used and, therefore, of the importance of geographical location. Again: we need to be able to ascertain whether any areas that might be penalised by higher labour costs per product unit benefit from State aid or the Structural Funds, and then monitor this data to verify whether it increases over time or remains the same. This would make it possible to assess the effects of cohesion policies, in some cases, and the effects merely of choices taken freely by entrepreneurs in response to opportunities, in others. Lastly, we need to consider, in addition to trade tariffs and external inflation factors, the effects of the taxation and related policies of each country. This is because – and we share the rapporteur’s view – we believe that there is no country in the Union whose wage negotiation mechanisms appear, at first glance, to generate a labour cost whose index causes the cost of living to rise. The truth is that wage negotiation mechanisms ceased some years ago to serve the purpose of furthering the distribution of wealth and, in some cases, do not even succeed in fully offsetting the effects of inflation retrospectively. To sum up, these are the analyses to be made if, as the Commission advocates, indeed, we want to provide social partners with more refined tools for negotiating wage agreements. However, it is some consolation to think that social partners already have the results of the aforementioned analyses available for their practical studies.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate Mrs Hermange on her excellent work but also express some dissatisfaction at the Commission’s communication. We do not, of course, want to ignore the various initiatives planned by the Commission regarding employment and certain social issues, nor do we want to disregard the negotiation initiatives undertaken by the social partners. The fact is that, although the agenda has a programme structure, endorsed since Nice by the Lisbon conclusions, in particular – and which, moreover I clearly support – this initial assessment of its implementation would seem somewhat inconclusive, removed from the original plan and goals set. Indeed, I wonder whether, in the meantime, a predefined model and predefined frameworks exist, within which the responsibilities laid down by the agenda for the many parties involved can be exercised; whether there is evidence of even embryonic good quality work and what its particular characteristics are; whether the job placement systems and systems providing information on opportunities are successfully fulfilling their role and whether school and training courses are starting to be rationalised. Moreover, it should be ascertained, at both Community and national level, whether industrial relations are moving steadily towards general development in terms of flexibility and security and whether local bodies and social forces are starting to cooperate responsibly in respect of national action plans and whether these plans are starting to be fully consistent with Union guidelines. It would also be appropriate to ascertain, in order to get an overall picture, whether the States have at least initiated an internal debate on their social rules, on cohesion within their national territories and on the integration of groups which are relatively or extremely marginalised because of age, disability, sex or profession. One last point concerns enlargement, on which the agenda focuses greatly, unlike this initial assessment, which merely refers to NGOs’ activities, although that is not to say they are not important. To sum up, the point we are trying to make is that, although much of the issue is left to the principle of subsidiarity and the active responsibility of a number of parties to manage, the social protocol, although behind schedule, is an integral part of the Treaties, and social policy at last goes hand in hand with economic policy in the open method of coordination. It is, therefore, vital that the Commission take a more incisive, specific role, which must be shared by the European Parliament in a more substantial, ongoing fashion.

 Mr President, the subject addressed so well by Mrs Ghilardotti’s report is, as we all know, not a new one, but on past occasions when it was discussed it has never been set out so clearly. I refer, in particular, to the legislation on European works councils, which has not been transposed by all the Member States and, where it has been transposed, has not been incorporated into their legislation but is regulated by means of agreements between the social partners which are often then disregarded by one of the partners, as has been shown by recent events which, moreover, have been debated in this very House. Yet Parliament, which has, in the past, been attentive to the issue of employment and openly involved in establishing and guaranteeing the dignity and even the quality of work, and which, moreover, has not hesitated to propose sanctions for the cases I have mentioned which even involved requirements governing the use of European funds for maintaining employment levels, has shown varying degrees of indecision in the debate on this report. The different attitudes are certainly understandable, given the sensitive nature of some issues such as the enforcement of sanctions, for sanctions do have to be enforced if one wants a requirement to be respected, or the confidentiality 
granting exemption from the consultation procedure to be removed, even though it is no longer observed, or a transitional period to be granted for the transposal of the directive which is, moreover, unnecessary, given the time frame for its implementation. The fact is that, both in terms of the continuous implementation of Community law, the continuing hope of ever-increasing cohesion and, lastly, the forthcoming practical introduction of a European Company which would provide greater protection of employees as regards participation than other forms of legal entity, the issue had to be closed, with the identification of major, related questions ranging from the contents of the information to the termination clause, from the time frame for initiating the procedure to the parties involved and to the sectors where it is to be applied, and all this in respect, on the one hand, for the fair trade requirement, which, also in this case, would be guaranteed by the different behaviour of the Member States, and, on the other hand, for the reasoning of the open coordination method, which has, at last, started to be applied practically in social policy. Clearly, the issue in question lends itself to being addressed within the context of the principle of subsidiarity, even though that concept still remains to be clearly defined today, despite the fact that it is one of the founding principles of the Union itself. However, it must be said that the definition and application of the principle does not and cannot serve the single purpose of calling for competence for certain subjects to be given to the Member States alone, for there is also a conflicting, appropriate need to provide the Union, in the face of great national differences and oversights, with a basic definition of these subjects wherever they have any significant implications for the Community as a whole.

 Mr President, overall, we feel that the rapporteur's good work deals exhaustively with the issue. However, we would like to comment on the proposal regarding the definite inclusion of the self-employed. We feel that it would be appropriate to include the self-employed in the new directive from the start. The Council's caution on the matter is quite understandable, but we nevertheless feel that instructing the Commission to assess, subsequently and with no time restriction, the consequences of excluding the self-employed today, would serve merely to postpone the realisation that it is necessary to include them. In fact, it is not just the issue of second drivers which needs to be addressed more exhaustively – it is, moreover, dealt with in Member States' national contract legislation – but above all that of self-employed drivers, including those who have only one vehicle or, in any case, consistently drive one of the vehicles they possess. There are various different causes which have a bearing on the matter. Often, when a self-employed driver purchases a vehicle, he is bound to pay for it in somewhat burdensome instalments. In order to meet the payments, he is forced to increase his workload. Another contributing cause is the just-in-time method which companies, having usually reduced their storage capacities, adopt in order to maintain continuous production, a method, that is, which requires them to produce a continual, regular supply of materials to be worked upon. Often, the combination of these two causes leads self-employed workers to neglect their health, not to take sufficient rest periods for their safety and, consequently, to create the conditions for potential harm to their or others' safety. Apart from anything else, definitively regulating the working hours of self-employed drivers as well is certainly a way of consolidating conditions of fair competition over the entire sector on Community territory and, at the same time, increasing the necessary safety measures.

 Mr President, first of all I should like to address my thanks to the Commissioner, Mrs Diamantopoulou, and my heartfelt congratulations to the rapporteur for the excellent job he has done. There is no doubt that a prospective cause for alarm in the field of pensions is the ageing of the population. But it should be noted above all that some Member States have already undertaken reforms of their systems without trauma, with significant contributions from social actors. These reforms have, over the course of time, also had positive effects on the health of public accounts. The problem should therefore, perhaps, be split in two: on the one hand, States that may still have some imbalance in public spending but in the context of a stable economy, and on the other, those that have deficient social security systems and an economy in transition. In the first case a gradual approach is essential. Almost all public pension schemes, in fact, are still run completely or partly on a pay-as-you-go basis, and without a gradual changeover to a fully funded system, accompanied by harmonious taxation systems and effective family policies, there would be serious social repercussions. For the second hypothetical scenario, and in the general case, we agree with the rapporteur in hoping that a convergent basis of parameters for maintaining the dignity of pensioners can be put in place at Community level. This will also prevent a widening of social gaps which supplementary schemes, although useful, cannot fully remedy. In the meantime, in fact, the only path open is to increase the contributor base, while noting that the current rise in the employment rate seems rather insecure. I fully agree with the rapporteur that what is avoided in all cases is anticipating even for the sake of intergenerational solidarity – paradoxical here – a reduction in the current levels of public protection.

 Mr President, I naturally want to thank Mrs Lindh, the President-in-Office of the Council, and President Prodi for their presentation of the agenda they intend to present to the Stockholm Summit. However, we may be forgiven for presuming to think that it is not so much a question of the excellence of that agenda as of its proper implementation nationally, in other words how the Member States carry through the processes of change, how they reconcile them with quality of life and work, and how they apply the strategy of greater social cohesion. Because the Commission admits, if only indirectly, that those are the real problems, when it talks about the 14 million who continue to be jobless and wonders whether enough has been done at national level. Equally, when it condemns the low skill levels of the labour force, one has to wonder whether the national training systems are put together properly, and whether educational reform, where implemented, is consistent with exploitation of the particular features of an area and whether it helps it to achieve greater cohesion, so that opportunity is open to all. The Commission likewise condemns the existence of poverty and marginalisation in the Union. It would therefore be appropriate to check, in the area of employment policies, whether local partnership initiatives capable of producing investment in initial stages in order to speed up bureaucratic processes, infrastructure allocations and negotiated labour flexibility are consistent with national employment plans and are actually being implemented. It would also be appropriate to check, with regard to the same policies, whether the State aid granted, even if increased in the future, is really consistent with the local employment system criterion adopted. Finally, with regard to the liberalised public services, pending verification of the final benefits to the user, it would be appropriate to consider whether the new jobs are numerically and qualitatively equal to those lost and whether the opening up of the markets involved is at least consistent with the integration of rural, remote, and mountainous areas with urban centres.

 Mr President, it is difficult to disagree overall with what Mr Bullmann and Mr Gasòliba i Böhm propose. Apart from anything else, their proposals would at least mean greater transparency. What is hard to understand is not their work, but why, supporting the outcome of the Lisbon Council, the Union is sometimes out of line with the principles it stands for. As we know, the 15 Member States do not have a common economic policy so much as a group of Community guidelines, laws and prohibitions. Faced with the challenge of globalisation, there must be more effort to give the Union common arrangements and policies based on a common history and culture, and every country must adopt a competitive flexibility. But it is not unusual for both to be harnessed only for purposes of economic growth and not for social progress. In some cases, public administration needs to be reformed, but in others there is also a need, for the purposes of wealth production, for the individual Member States to reform developing sectors and realise their potential in terms of basic criteria through their infrastructure policy, and move towards a policy of wealth redistribution. Yet faced with the growth of insecurity and poverty, there does not seem to be anything else to do at national and Community level except represent it statistically as accurately as possible. However, while virtue in public accounting is fundamental, compared with growing poverty and insecurity, it cannot find meaning only in the reduction of social costs without any non-statistical consideration of demographic growth and of the sometimes strident justifications for the continual requests to reduce labour costs without a concrete participatory system. Liberalisation enters into these considerations too, because, while we support it in terms of theoretical benefit to the final consumer, in practice it is not reflected in quality, safety or universal enjoyment. So roll on greater coordination of Community policies and better indicators to demonstrate their effectiveness. But it remains desirable that the Union should not only determine its future arrangements rapidly but should also make the principles it repeatedly proclaims increasingly applicable, binding and consistent.

 There is clearly no doubt that it would be highly appropriate to create a Rapid Reaction Facility and, moreover, the three Community institutions have already expressed positive views. However, over and above our common goal, we feel that certain elements of the Council's proposal deserve careful consideration. The first is essentially theoretical: the objectives of the mechanism in question do not appear to be very clear, apart from the tasks of supranational policing. The rapporteur goes so far as to propose explicitly the establishment of a European Police Force. And if this were the 
case we could consider the proposal, but it would have to have a different legal basis and, most importantly, a different Community institutional system from that defined by the recent Intergovernmental Summit at Nice. In actual fact, in our opinion, the ultimate purpose of the Rapid Reaction Mechanism is to make Community policies and programmes effective more quickly and to maintain that effectiveness more consistently. Moreover, the original impression came from the description of the conditions for triggering the Facility, which, being very general,
 still does not give a practical idea of them, when it would have been enough, without prejudice to the normal intervention conditions laid down by Community regulations, to highlight those conditions which, on the basis of their urgency, trigger the Reaction Mechanism. Then, it appears strange that the governments of the States within which the Mechanism may be triggered are not among the parties notified of the triggering of the Mechanism. Moreover, it seems odd that they are not notified, since they have been targeted by policies and programmes which, in the case in point, need to be safeguarded. Finally, objections could be raised to the increase in the volume of information sent to the European Parliament, even through the consultation procedure alone, but, since we hope that the list of topics subject to codecision will be extended, we feel that, in specific cases of geographical or political importance, the Commission must not hold back from informing Parliament. In the light of these considerations, we support the changes proposed by the rapporteur and we have therefore voted for the motion.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the willingness to listen and the commitment which the rapporteur has shown in drawing up this report are to be appreciated and sincerely applauded. He states in the explanatory statement that he was forced to seek a compromise between hundreds of largely homogeneous amendments. In effect, we do not feel that there is any other fair way to settle an issue which is so complex and, at the same time, so paradoxical. The complexity is caused by the implications for 15 different national situations, although all with exactly the same problems – maintaining a high-quality universal service and at least keeping levels of employment stable – and the paradoxical nature of the matter is mirrored in the contrasting elements of the reform proposed by the Commission. I would mention by way of example the time frames of the reform proposal and its entry into force, the fact that we have no knowledge of the effects of the first directive and the attractive, though groundless, observations on the future of the reform, starting with employment and its quality, maintaining an adequate universal service and the impossibility in material terms of accomplishing reform without recourse to a compensation fund. Spain might be able to enlighten us on this matter, for it established the fund and has used it, and I would mention the uncertain legal bases of the fund, the virtual criteria used in its composition and the discretionary authorisation of its application. Moreover, the report does not mention the geomorphologic characteristics of the different countries and the 
resulting differences in the costs of the universal service even though the categories of users are the same. The rapporteur is right, therefore, when he states that the compromise reached is the only compromise possible. Otherwise, irregular dealings would have gone on which would have been anything but transparent and above-board, with pandering possibly leading to conjuring tricks involving the special services during the transition to the private market. With regard to this, it would be as well for the Commission to conduct an inquiry to ascertain whether a private postal monopoly is not being created in Europe in the face of the process of liberalisation of the public postal monopolies, and to indicate what, in its opinion, the maximum permissible concentrations should be.

 Mr President, the proposal under consideration was certainly long-awaited. However, what we have to decide is whether it responds fully to the aims which, eight years ago, it was hoped to achieve through its promulgation or whether it may create further confusion. And this is certainly not the fault of the work carried out by Mrs González Álvarez, who has endeavoured very successfully to improve the legislation under consideration, but is inherent in both the guidelines and parts of the proposal itself. Firstly, in the case in point, the Commission, as the principal author of the legislative process, appears to have appointed itself an administrative authority, although there is no adequate legal and transparent legislative structure to define this new role, even from the point of view of defining its field of operation and monitoring its rapid action decisions. Furthermore, in view of its potential power to act autonomously as regards the introduction of emergency measures, not to mention the presumably lengthy period which will pass before it is possible to ascertain whether these measures are well-founded, even purely in terms of employment, it should be noted that there is no mention of the damage which would be caused to a company – to its employees in particular – by an erroneous decision. On the other hand, it does provide for a ban on exporting products classed as dangerous, which is certainly evidence of the Union's high level of civilisation, but there is no clear indication of whether this ban is consistent with the procedure known as Prior Informative Concert, laid down, in fact, by international conventions. The concept of liability, in terms of the definition of the word product, product traceability and the inclusion of products used to provide services in this definition, also appears to be open to interpretation and therefore to subjective action. At the same time, we should consider the possible interpretations as a product of the raw materials in the manufacturing processes and the positive implications of this in terms of guaranteeing health and safety at the workplace, although this endeavour is limited by the lack of an appropriate European statistics recording system and by the inconsistencies between legal systems for recognising an occupational illness. In conclusion, I call upon the Commission to set in motion a coordination project within the framework of existing Community legislation and to make our legislation both more transparent and also genuinely beneficial owing to its certainty.

 Mr President, we value the work carried out by Mr Bowis because, in addition to placing the subject in the right context, it raises important questions to which solutions must be found in the course of time. The usefulness of the authority to be established is undeniable, both in terms of monitoring and in terms of prevention, for which, in any case, the precautionary principle does not provide adequate practical guidance. A reliable legislative framework, the definition of acceptable risk and the practical safeguarding of local food and production diversities are aspects which still require attention, together with those of small and medium-sized businesses and the training of their employees. A further aspect is the organic revision of the labelling rules for both wholesale and retail selling, which will at last provide the consumer with correct information regarding products' traceability and make it possible to identify where responsibility lies in the event of risk or crises. Moreover, it has been said, and rightly so, that the authority will not be a political body and that, particularly in the event of a problem arising, it will report to the Commission and the Member States. How this works in practice will become clear when the authority has to act. Its legal status, authority and interaction at European level with other technical and scientific bodies whose responsibilities currently partly overlap with the authority being established also need to be defined. In short, it will be important to see how its independence and transparency are reconciled with the fact that no current resources have been allocated to it, with its subordination to the Commission, on the one hand, and with its authority to act autonomously and the membership of its board of directors on the other. Lastly, the intention to identify priority actions and class them in order of importance is certainly positive. However, while such actions are so long awaiting definition, they do not make up for the need to define a comprehensive European line on food policy and food safety, which will give the many European diversities another opportunity to display their unity.

 We are aware that the process of institutionalising the Union also requires definition of the concept of European citizenship and the institution of common values such as freedom, governability and stability. We would like to believe that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is genuinely intended to strengthen the competences of the Union and not those of the Member States, as the Convention stated when starting its work. Yet we are somewhat perplexed by the combined effect which would be produced by the Charter having binding authority over the Community countries, as the European Parliament requested on 26 March of this year, and the as yet incomplete and inorganic content of even the last draft presented, despite the commendable amount of work put in. A striking example is workers’ rights. A further area of confusion is the potential overlap of legal systems implemented by the supranational Courts: the European Communities’ legal system and the human rights system, although the latter derives from a Convention which does not make sufficient provision for social and economic rights. In other words, we would not like the pursuance of a noble, if unsolicited goal to serve, in the medium-to-long term, not to consolidate and expand those rights which the national constitutional charters and practices fully guarantee at present, but to undermine them. Pending further clarification, we therefore abstain from the vote.

. – I would like to start by assuring you that we support Mrs Glase’s work. It is, in effect, a clarion call for the Member States to combat a scourge which is, moreover, proliferating but increasingly being ignored, and which not only harms the economy and checks social policy but also hampers employment policy. However, three points are worth noting. Firstly, given precisely the different ways in which the Member States interpret the concept of undeclared work, the explanatory statement attached to the report would appear to shed more light on the subject than the text itself. The second point is the – by now constant – call for the two sides of industry to be flexible and responsible. ‘Emersion’ contracts aside, in addition to the initiatives adopted by the Member States to combat undeclared work which are to be included in the national employment plans, as the rapporteur requested, it would be interesting to find out how many allegedly joint flexibility initiatives have indeed induced both sides of industry to be responsible and how many have, in practice, been successfully implemented to date. The third point concerns a type of working relationship which the rapporteur does not mention even in the explanatory statement, but which nevertheless, in Italy at least, is likely to become as common, if not more common than undeclared work. I refer to that type of relationship which appears on the surface to be completely legal and have impeccable recruitment procedures, but which, in reality, 
is characterised by abusive terms and conditions and protection and penalty clauses which are the product of what are termed ‘pirate’ work contracts concluded by colluding trade union associations. In this regard, we feel that the study into the situation for the different categories of work, requested by the rapporteur, must take this last factor into account as well, and that quality parameters should then be defined so that work relationships can be genuinely above-board.

 Mr President, we support and value Mr Skinner’s work, although we do feel that, given the premises and, above all, the implications of the issue, he could have been a little more incisive, in view, moreover, of the fact that eleven years have passed since the first directive on the subject was produced and of the shortcomings of its amending directive which entered into force five years ago. Of course, we are aware of the greater or lesser sensitivity towards these issues shown in the positions adopted within this very Parliament and elsewhere, and of the concerns raised regarding legislation which is more stringent or would involve greater costs for businesses. However, as the rapporteur points out, we must consider just how much a worker’s life and health is worth. In effect, occupational accidents continue to be the scourge of the world of employment in all the countries of the European Union, although there is a higher incidence in certain sectors. This can certainly be explained by the many factors which contribute in various ways to increasing or reducing the size of the phenomenon, but we are now faced with an indisputable cause of injury, which is present in all the Member States, and which is sadly responsible for as much as ten percent of all occupational accidents, namely falls from heights. It must be said that the Economic and Social Committee’s opinion certainly laid out, clearly and precisely, not only the scale of the problem but also and above all the solutions to be adopted: Mr Skinner has not failed to build on this foundation, taking as a starting point the need to consolidate the relevant terminology used, to improve the way work is organised and to provide specific training and information for the workers involved. It must also be pointed out, however, that the solution should nevertheless be implemented via the preparation and issuing of more precise, and more stringent guidelines on prevention by the Commission, making it possible, among other things, to overcome the problem of the fragmentation of responsibilities in this area and, at the same time, to provide, along with more binding controls, for a system of incentives, particularly where small- and medium-sized businesses are concerned, to ensure that occupational safety rules are implemented efficiently and effectively.

 Mr President, if the Commission's intention was to improve the effective health and safety of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth, it may be said that it has not achieved its goal. The report has two clear shortcomings: firstly, the fact that it is overdue and secondly, its limitations. It could have been finished as far back as 1997, but even though it is late, it could at least have clarified the wording of certain articles of the directive and defined the many undefined concepts which have given rise to numerous interpretations. Among the various missing data which would have been useful, it could also have provided the results of the questionnaires sent to the Member States and the results of the coordination of relevant laws and activities by the European Standardisation Centre.  The European Parliament recognised the need to revise the directive as early as 1992, with the result that now, given the need for a social market economy, it agrees with the objectives of Mrs Damião's report: to link maternity policies to family policy and to remove ambiguity by practically and quantifiably enhancing the rights of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth.

 The Union for a Europe of Nations Group agrees with Mr Turco’s report. What is more, it is important to look more closely at certain aspects of the report which, although they are more concerned with the last period of aid programmes than with providing an analysis after the event, are just as important for the current period. I therefore call for greater and more meaningful coordination between the Structural Fund initiatives, with particular reference to the ESF, and more tangible compatibility not only with the longstanding annual horizontal themes 
– for example the SMEs – but also with new solutions. Furthermore, since employment is one of the three governing motifs of the new programming period, Parliament should be kept regularly informed of the quality and quantity of available jobs by means of the Commission reports on the use of the funds in question. The information should include a balance sheet as well as forecasts. One further aspect concerns another governing motif for the current period: regional and local development and related issues. New actions based on local initiatives carried out in a partnership framework have recently been introduced to boost the profile of this motif. It therefore becomes important not only to learn how to be efficient in implementing these guidelines but also to be aware of potential obstacles to their implementation, and always proceed in the knowledge that the Community also has an objective in terms of employment. It will be important from this as well as other points of view to verify that these objectives and guidelines are consistent with those of the Member States, starting with their national annual employment plans. The final point has to be the detection of fraud. The Commission mentions this in its report but provides an overview, confining itself to general aspects and not providing a detailed evaluation, so to speak, of the frauds, still less revealing the means used to combat fraud in the past or those to be used in the future. This last aspect is, in fact, an unambiguous indication of commitment and political determination. ***

 Mr President, we support the main objective of the motion for a resolution under debate, that is, the need for consistently transparent budget regulation on the part of the individual Member States in line with the objectives of the Stability Pact. However, we feel that, precisely in consideration of these undertakings and in the light of the current situation, the precise nature of any interventions cannot be identified in advance just for the sake of efficient budget control.  In fact, in a context where there are varying degrees of interdependence between States, there are too many variables at work to be combined to produce more general indicators. I refer to the constant pressure with regard to restricting welfare expenditure, structural reform of the labour market and privatisation of the telecommunications and energy sectors. On the other hand, we are aware of the need for a more effective convergence process, for economic cohesion and, therefore, also for the approximation of the single currency, whose oscillation is no longer virtual but is in line with prices and taxes; the need, of course, for more harmonious tax and fiscal policies, but also pricing policies; for more harmonious investment policies as regards both research and the closing of infrastructure gaps, including within the individual States, but also for greater homogeneity in the action of public administrations. The most representative variable is certainly the time frames and contents of the Treaty reforms and the process of constitutionalisation of the Union, i.e. of a greater or lesser European political presence.

 The report gives a clear impression that the concerted strategy for modernising social protection in Europe will be accompanied by an analogous process of cohesion. We therefore view it with interest and hope and commend its intentions. Numerous policies have already gone in this direction, albeit laboriously, and many more still need to do so before Europe, in terms of subsidiarity, is seen as one house, not only by its own people, but also by those in the candidate countries. Moreover, the European welfare systems have always played a constructive role in the social and democratic development of each nation. Consequently, if such systems are to continue to sustain development in the future, in light of the economic and employment changes taking place, as well as the requirements of society, modernisation is absolutely essential. There are three main aspects that need to be highlighted. The first is that economic policy, employment and social protection should be strictly interdependent in a way that is directly proportional. The second concerns the management of welfare systems and those who operate them. Nowadays, it is becoming more commonplace, as well as efficient, to operate complementary and integrated protection schemes. But, in our view, that does not mean that the role of the public authority should be reduced, either as regards the universality or, we hope, the quality of the basic social protection provided. It is, to a large extent, a principle of justice that imbues both health and pension schemes as well as social assistance, where, in particular, strategic coordination by the public authority is essential, even though it has been modernised. The third aspect concerns the principle of subsidiarity that underpins the European Union. Today, a common strategy for social protection is sadly lacking, and the current systems are, in the main, run according to the actions and unity of purpose of individual Member States. Therefore, any modernisation process has to take account of economic, employment and social protection differences between the various countries, whether Member States or candidate countries. What is required is that those responsible for the modernisation process, which continues to be closely linked to the promotion of social cohesion despite the underlying differences, should have the will and the know-how to ensure that changes are for the better and not for the worse. It is, after all, a matter of civilisation, progress and common dignity for the present European Union and a future enlarged community.

 Mr President, what should be welcomed in the Schwaiger report is the attempt to reconcile what up until now has been irreconcilable, and the obvious efforts of the rapporteur can be seen right from the first recital, where recognition of the significant increase in world trade thanks to multilateral relations can only stand in contrast to the lack of any substantial reduction in the world’s economic inequalities. Here, it is not a question of expressing our opposition to pursuing greater efficiency in the multilateral relations system, but rather a question of paying the greatest attention to some important aspects. If the first is the continuation of the inequalities between developing countries and industrialised countries, then there is also the social dumping that is being created within these very industrialised countries. It is undeniable that the process of European convergence for the launch of the single currency has led to occasions and opportunities for growth and development in all Member States. Nevertheless, today, we are confronted by a different process of convergence that is underway, in particular, between territorial macro-contexts where Europe seems to present itself in positions that certainly are not strong, with the risk, therefore, that its economic characteristics – founded on small and medium-sized businesses – will be compromised, as well as its cultural and social characteristics. In this respect, we do not think that public safeguards and duties such as schools, welfare systems – including health – and pension schemes can be part of the services to be regulated.  The second aspect relates to agriculture, for which, along with greater liberalisation of the market in favour of developing countries, there is the request not only for the Community principles to be upheld – support for environmental policy and the drawing up of a food policy for consumer protection – but also for typical national agricultural characteristics and products to be protected.  The third aspect relates to investments and related rules, but also to the local conditions for the implementation thereof. The condition of tariff and fiscal advantage is one of the first conditions, and the premise should at least be to harmonise the financial institutions, if not the tax rates. Moreover, the States’ recognised prerogative on this policy should also be translated into the possibility of a differentiated application throughout the States’ territories, otherwise – apart from the simplification of the processes – the only condition remaining would be the flexibility of labour. However, we hope that in this regard, the principles of the ILO and related conventions will be taken on board, starting with the convention on the protection of working minors. Finally, we hope that Parliament will be able to play an active part in the Millennium Round, starting with prior knowledge of the Commission’s study on the estimated impact of the effects of the new regulatory process.

 Despite its general title, once the gift wrapping has been removed, it readily becomes apparent that the draft resolution proposed by Mr Chichester is intended primarily to promote the nuclear industry on the pretext that it does not produce much CO2, at least as far as the power plants are concerned. Indeed, while it remains extremely vague on most environmental matters related to the energy sector, this resolution proposes that, in future, in the countries of the EU, nuclear-based electricity production should at least retain the share which it currently has. And this at a time when an increasing number of European countries are deciding to get out of nuclear power. However, rather more than electricity production, the reduction of CO2 emissions involves the problem of the organisation of transport – a point of which the resolution makes no mention. It is silent, too, on the considerable risks inherent in nuclear-based electricity production and the accumulation, over the very long term, of radioactive waste! We can do nothing other than vote against this draft resolution.

 Mr President, on behalf of the UEN Group, I would like to voice my appreciation of Mr Menrad’s report. I must also say that, although his work does not define a Community law, it is impossible to ignore the importance of Parliament’s voice on a topic which is defined as a Union priority, employment. Moreover, I think that Mr Menrad’s report, supplemented by contributions he has had the courtesy to take into consideration, is actually the best possible within the confines of the subject, Parliament’s competences and the constructive methods of Europe. Nevertheless, the employment issue is not only found in the laudable work that Parliament can and will be able to do, but in a much broader field, sometimes with additional competences, sometimes with transient contents.  Parliament’s recommendations and assessments of this subject are, of course, valuable, but there are aspects of this undertaking which seem to conflict. Yesterday, we heard the Council and the Commission talk about the impending start of the macroeconomic dialogue, but opinions and indications from this will not be published – this is what we were told. But it is not so much this as the rather uncertain spirit which has emerged, full of hope but lacking the desire to coordinate. The aim that was announced with the launch of the single currency seems to be to create confidence in the economic policies through the stability of monetary policies, prices and budgetary policies, as well as pay moderation and flexibility. And yet, today, the national macroeconomic dialogues have been shifted to a regional level. Conciliation has affected the regions and the Union in general and their programming ability, including their use of structural instruments and when devising models of local growth. However, I do not think that the Committee of the Regions is participating in the European macroeconomic dialogue, or that there are indicators in the assessment of the achievements of the States with regard to the creation of employment polices at local level, which are often entrusted only to the activism and will of the social partners.  Moreover, a fundamental role in employment strategies and social integration is reserved for these very social partners, and there is still no clear definition of the role of the social partners in their capacity as NGOs. But that is not all. We cannot only deal with pay moderation and flexibility for their own sake, because this would misrepresent the nature and spirit of the national dialogues, the maintenance of social protection systems and all the planning instruments negotiated on the subject, sensitive not only to small and medium-sized businesses but also to those sectors that are more compatible with tradition and the characteristics of the territory. Taxation and security are certainly not secondary considerations, on the contrary they are more important than moderation and flexibility. The hope is to establish an exclusively European model that is more coordinated and more transparent but also more determined where the States, because of their diversity, are not only divided into the strong and the weak.

 Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Diamantopoulou for her speech. For my Group, the Union for a Europe of Nations, the context of this matter is rather delicate because there is the danger, on the one hand, of setting the premises for restricted competition and, on the other hand, limiting the actions of the Member States in this field, and this conflicts with the principle of subsidiarity. So a real principle that would justify the Union’s intervention here is the possibility of social discomfort that the restructuring of firms could cause within the Community and within the Member States as a whole. It is, moreover, a principle which is already provided for by the Treaty of Rome of 1957. And this is to prevent future Union policies intended to increase cohesion and social integration being rendered, even only partly, useless. Given the hope that the Union will have a joint economic policy and, possibly, a joint industrial policy, in our opinion it seems appropriate in the meantime for the Union to give its opinion, especially on those restructurings which the Member States have been or are involved in, financially or otherwise. Moreover, we must stress the requirement for the Union to subject its interventions in this area to more stringent control and some checking mechanisms, both as regards the involvement with – and in any case, the information given to – trade union representatives, and also as regards the actual positive results – not just economic but also social results – of the interventions themselves. Union aid to firms has not always resulted in stable growth in the firms or protection of their employment levels. In these cases, we have to ask for a broad sanction to be implemented until the amounts committed by the Union itself have been completely reimbursed. This principle must also be applied in the event that aid is given to a non-Community firm, when it is considered that a cooperation agreement with the firm’s country – if one does not already exist – might not only better formulate and integrate the Union’s interventions regarding that country, but in this desirable event it could facilitate the implementation of the above-mentioned sanction.

 Mr President, first of all, I agree with the disapproval expressed by Mrs Pack in her proposal for a report on the Council’s attitude regarding the expected adoption of its position on the legislation in question. Indeed, its attitude does not seem to take into consideration the spirit and approach taken by Parliament both in the first amendment of the 1998 Directive and in its Resolution of July this year. I share the objections regarding the choice of where to base the Agency in question – Pristina in our opinion and not Thessaloniki – as well as the objections regarding the unilateral possibility, or so it seems – in the Council’s opinion – of extending the activities of the Agency itself to other regions of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia without even consulting Parliament beforehand. And this, at a time when the quarterly inspection and auditing of the Agency’s activities fall to Parliament, albeit after the event.
 Nevertheless, regarding the composition of the Agency’s board, I do not understand the reasons that should lead Parliament to envisage the nomination of the seven independent experts by the Commission only. This is in direct contrast to the proposals put forward by the Commission itself which, in conjunction with the committee responsible, has instead envisaged the presence of a representative of each Member State. It is not appropriate, in my view, for Parliament to exclude, paradoxically, the Member States that constitute the European Union from a context of decision-making. First and foremost, this context is political and its operational nature comes second. This means that it is not a question of pursuing preventative checks as regards the overall aid proposed, even if the amount, EUR 1,900 million over the next five years, would suggest that this is appropriate.

 Mr President, in the end, and almost too late, I agreed to add my name to this motion of censure on the Commission regarding the Eurostat 
affair. Quite frankly, I do not feel that I am either illiterate or, even less so, an anti-Europeanist, nor do I believe that I can be blamed for bringing the Commission into disrepute; if anything it did that on its own. At the end of the day, we were practically forced into this extreme measure by the Commission’s indifference and perfunctory attitude towards Parliament, because – and I want to mention this – this is not an impromptu move. For more than a year, there have been hundreds of questions and a large body of parliamentary work behind this extreme move. In any case, we expected the Commission to act less like Pontius Pilate; this is what we expected and, I believe, what we deserved since, after all, we are the only institution that has genuine popular legitimacy. I do not want to go back over the many questions to which adequate responses were not given, or the good proposals stated by the Commission for the future. Once again, however, I would like to comment on the organisation involved, that is to say Eurostat.
 It is worth remembering that Eurostat 
does not deal with generating interesting and harmless statistics. Eurostat 
is an institution which, through its surveying and statistical work, is in fact the guarantor of the Stability and Growth Pact: it monitors the application of the Maastricht criteria. It is, therefore, involved in setting out the economic and financial policies of the Member States and, indeed, in making Member States adopt strict policies that often entail budget and welfare cutbacks. It is, therefore, an institution that has a monitoring role, and its impartiality and authoritativeness must not be even slightly scarred by the doubts and suspicions that hang over Eurostat today. I am, therefore, sorry, Commissioner Reding, but the Eurostat affair cannot be crossed off as a deplorable exception. We realise that the affair is embarrassing, it is for me too, but I believe it is the citizens that are calling for this not to be tolerated, the same people whom we are asking to make sacrifices in the name of the Stability and Growth Pact. I do not want to give lessons in democracy to anyone – God forbid – but I would like to quietly mention that democracy is based on the rights of minorities to express their opinion.

 Mr President, despite appearances – that is, the almost 200 amendments I tabled in committee – I am actually not passionate about this debate at all; on the contrary, I find it somehow depressing, because right from the start the subject of the debate has not really been pluralism and freedom of information in Europe but simply an utterly ideological and specious attack. I find it depressing that a certain part of the Italian Left, blinded by their need to indict the Italian Prime Minister and thus the whole government – which, I am pleased to recall, was democratically elected by a majority – should concoct and consent to an inquisitorial report like this, devoted to the situation ‘especially in Italy’, as it says in the title, with the sole purpose of discrediting Italy itself. I will not accept the unscrupulousness or the pretence at morality of this kind of constant anti-Italian crusade, which is also supported by certain Members of the European Left who first attracted attention for having insulted Italy during the Italian Presidency and then attracted even more attention for falsifying signatures in the attendance register, as suspected by their own party colleagues. I will not accept moral lessons from those who have still not had the courage to condemn the Commission properly for the disgraceful Eurostat scandal. In conclusion, I should be pleased if this Italian and European Left could find the time and, especially, the courage to devote an equally detailed report to the conflict of interests of Mr Prodi, who is President of the European Commission in his spare moments and Ulivo leader in Italy full-time, and who, to further his political fight with Italy, has, despite our efforts, only succeeded in weakening and damaging the image of the European Commission itself.

 Mr President, I should like first of all to thank my fellow Members for their amendments, which have enriched this proposal for a Council regulation laying down the requirement for the competent authorities of the Member States to stamp systematically the travel documents of third-country nationals when they cross the external borders of the Member States. This provision amends the convention implementing the Schengen agreement and the so-called common manual to this end. It would apparently seem to be a merely bureaucratic provision; in reality, in view of the forthcoming, imminent enlargement and thus the enormous extension of the European Union’s external borders, it aims at ensuring that movement across these borders is managed more rationally, especially so as to safeguard legal immigration and to discourage and effectively combat illegal immigration and the criminal activities associated with it. In view of the complete abolition of controls at the internal borders between Member States, the objective is to transfer these controls to their external borders, while increasing judicial, customs and police cooperation with what might be termed compensatory measures to safeguard the security of European Union territory. It is important to make an effort to rationalise and harmonise border control systems: indeed, the gradual creation of the Schengen area has resulted in various procedures in each Member State for controlling its own borders. This has adversely affected efforts to check that third-country citizens in the territory of the Member States comply with the conditions for staying, especially for short stays. For this reason the Commission has produced this proposal for a Council regulation with the aim of making it obligatory to systematically stamp the travel documents of such citizens during immigration controls at the external borders, and establishing common rules for this. This is obviously just one of many operational instruments, but systematically stamping travel documents may contribute effectively to the fight against illegal immigration. Finally, I should like to point out that this regulation is certainly just a first step towards a more comprehensive reform of the system, which will also include systematically stamping documents – a proper form of control, then – for those leaving the Schengen area.

 Mr President, adoption of the report tomorrow can constitute a clear, positive signal with regard to the partial decoupling method, a solution which would avoid dismantling, in an extremely short space of time, the production of tobacco in Europe, thereby safeguarding 500 000 jobs of which 135 000 are in Italy alone. Adoption of this text would also enable a new stage of negotiations to get underway in the Council and with regard to the Commission, so that the demands of the producers in this sector can be met in full. First of all, it would be desirable to reconsider the conditions of eligibility for decoupled aid by calculating it, apart from on the basis of the three-yearly historical average, also on the basis of further quotas which the producer has obtained since 1 January 2001. Future negotiations would also enable the precise recipients of restructuring and conversion resources to be identified. Firstly, the aid should clearly target tobacco-producing holdings; secondly, aid should be distributed by producers’ associations and earmarked, only then for the regions. I would conclude by calling on President Prodi, having taken note of Parliament’s opinion, which we hope will be favourable tomorrow, to steer the forthcoming new mandate of the European Commission in this direction.

Mr President, as fellow Members have already said, the financial 
collapse of the multinational Parmalat has constituted a very serious episode for Italy and has involved thousands of small Italian savers; it is likely to damage financial credibility and, in future, to create widespread distrust of our country amongst international investors too. One of the causes of this financial collapse was, primarily the approval of the false financial statements of the Parmalat Group by one of the major auditing companies, which is alleged to have hidden the real asset situation of the company. What is more, it is obvious that the other bodies employed for financial auditing – Banca d'Italia
 and Consob
 – also failed to conduct the necessary inspections adequately and at the right time. Several of the most well-known credit institutes in global financial markets – both Italian and European – also appear to be involved in the affair; they issued an uncontrolled amount of 
bonds that are no longer redeemable. 	 For all these reasons, the Parmalat case has been described as the European Enron
, although, in fact, it is more serious than the US scandal, since US GDP is much higher than that of Italy. As we all know, the Parmalat collapse is, unfortunately, merely the latest in a long series of similar affairs that have occurred across Europe. So what can Italian citizens and European citizens, who are often the victims of this financial adventurism, expect? I think that they expect urgent and tangible measures, both to protect the workers in the Parmalat Group, which is the specific case in point, and – more generally – to safeguard and compensate the savers involved in this collapse. Furthermore, they expect instruments to be put in place to prevent operations of this sort occurring in the future and to restrict the maximum exposure of small savers. Finally, I would like to draw the attention of the Commissioner to two final points: I think that the time has come to create an establishment for monitoring and control at European level – a sort of European Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – with the right to inspect and impose sanctions, under the direct control of the ECB, and designed to verify the efficiency and transparency of the equity market in order to protect investors as far as possible. Lastly, a black list should be established to ensure that tax havens are outlawed.

Mr President, once again Italy risks being used as a dumping ground. Thyssen Krupp is the only case of a multinational that has grown thanks to the work of hundreds of Italian workers and huge funds placed at its disposal, either by the Italian State or the European Union, and then has decided to close, in this case in Terni, in Umbria, with the risk of leaving 900 workers and their families destitute and also wasting a huge resource of professional skills. As other Members have mentioned, the announcement of closure took everybody by surprise: no prior notice was given to the workers or the national and local authorities and, above all, no justification was given because today the closure appears to be dictated more by questionable strategic company choices than by specific technical reasons, given that in Italy production costs are lower, the quality is higher and the professionalism of the workforce beyond question: there have been steelworks at Terni for 120 years. Would it, I ask myself, be acceptable for Thyssen Krupp to go ahead with the decision to close after taking everything possible from that territory and those people: professionalism, resources and even their hopes for the future? Although I am convinced that large companies – the multinationals – are certainly a source of employment and development for the whole of Europe, a few remarks must be made: to say that we do not agree with some of the behaviour indulged in by European capitalism is neither a secret nor a shock: a capitalism which, in theory, is completely committed to the free market, to pure competition and to the flexibility of the global market but which, in reality, expects to be generously assisted time and again, requiring tax incentives from national governments and all kinds of structures, infrastructures and facilities from local administrations, not to mention the granting of Community funds. Meanwhile production has already been moved to India, with an eye on China, where the cost of labour is ridiculous and laws for the protection of workers and the environment non-existent. Further, as other Members have already stated, these multinationals often take advantage of the opportunity offered by privatisation – which unfortunately, most of the time, are no more than asset sales – to acquire our family jewels at knock down prices, as was exactly the case with Thyssen Krupp at Terni. So, moving beyond these contentious matters, what are we asking of the European Commission? Firstly, we are asking for immediate measures, within its powers, to safeguard the iron and steel centre in Terni and to avert the danger of Thyssen Krupp’s plant being closed; secondly: a commitment to check that European regulations are effectively applied in order to protect workers’ rights; thirdly: a further commitment to make the granting of Community funds conditional on agreements guaranteeing employment and subject to precise conditions and limits on the relocation of plant. We also expect a committed development strategy to be set in place for the iron and steel sector throughout Europe. Finally, should Thyssen Krupp go ahead with its decision to close the plant, we call on the Commission to check whether all the competition rules have been complied with, in particular as regards any possible abuse of a dominant position. In conclusion, Mr President, whilst we are satisfied with the initial positive steps today of the Italian Government, gained as a result of determined action across the board, we consider that that is all the more reason not to lower our guard. We believe unreservedly in the free market, but we also believe that there is no free market without democracy and, above all, without respect for workers and nations.

 Mr President, on behalf of my group, I express my satisfaction with the work carried out by the Committee on Budgetary Control and by the rapporteur, whom I congratulate. I must, however, emphasise that the picture that emerges from reading the report is altogether worrying. What emerges is the image of a European Commission shrouded in secrecy and a lack of transparency, which does not communicate with the other institutions; a stratified Commission with a bureaucratic complexity of functions, delegations and offices which is in fact manifested by a failure to shoulder administrative and political responsibility, both on the part of Director-Generals and the Commissioners. An example of this, as other Members have mentioned, would be the Eurostat affair for which no one has to date completely assumed responsibility. On the contrary, we have, on several occasions in recent months, seen attempts by the Commission to swiftly close the case, to settle it as if it were nothing, as if Parliament’s calls for clarity were in fact a real nuisance and as if the Commission were indeed a class of untouchables above everyone, MEPs and citizens included. It is also surprising that President Prodi, so diligent in ensuring that rules are strictly complied with – I am thinking, for example, about the recourse to the Court of Justice on the Ecofin decisions on the Stability and Growth Pact – dealt so lightly with such an abominable scandal such as the one involving Eurostat. I will conclude, Mr President, by saying that, over and above the naïve and vague declarations of principle by the Commission – declarations that we have again heard this evening– we are waiting for a strong signal, a rigorous reform that will really change the system.

 Mr President, the report by Mr Pirker – whom I congratulate – clearly sets out the need finally to create a common policy at European level against illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings. While the Member States must specifically retain their competences regarding the security of their external borders and the establishment of domestic immigration quotas, it is equally necessary and urgent to set up effective transnational cooperation to create a common modus operandi
 on visas, border control and repatriation, as the rapporteur has underlined. An effective coordination policy, the harmonisation of certain procedures and the prompt exchange of information would make it possible to combat illegal immigration more effectively, as well as many other criminal activities that are linked to it: drug trafficking and trafficking in human beings, to give just a couple of examples. It is worth recalling that an intransigent policy of combating illegal immigration would not only give Europe’s citizens greater confidence and security but would also allow all legal immigrants to enjoy their rights and opportunities to the full. In any case, it should be underlined that the European Union should strengthen its external relations with all those non-Community countries that want to collaborate effectively in combating illegal immigration and should also promote the so-called special quota policy for such countries. I do not believe it is mere rhetoric, then, to recall that we must direct our greatest efforts to a strong cooperation and development policy, which will in general help most to contain immigration and stop the outflow of people and hence of manpower, as well as the brain drain, from the countries of origin, not only to avoid draining the developing countries of human resources but also to avoid condemning them to certain, irreversible economic and social decline.

 Mr President, on behalf of my group, I would like once again to express our sympathy for the victims of the massacres of Nasiriya, for their families and for all the European armed forces engaged throughout the world in peace missions combating terrorism I will now focus my speech on the Eurostat case. There are too many unresolved questions in this affair and the measures that have been taken to remedy matters are few and, I would venture to say, belated and, therefore, probably ineffective. My opinion was confirmed after President Prodi’s hearing before the Committee on Budgetary Control this morning, in which he was, quite frankly, too general and, if I may say so, a little reticent. As regards the way the affair has been handled, given that we have a President who has made transparency one of his principal objectives, we do not understand why we have witnessed all kinds of endeavours to keep the documentation under wraps and avoid public debate in the Eurostat case, as if we were dealing with a state secret. There are too many questions, as I said. Has this drain on the EU’s funds come to an end? If it has come to an end, when, exactly, did that happen? Just this morning, the fact that the most serious incidents took place before 1999 was stressed once again. What about the less serious incidents? When did they occur? Are they still going on? Most importantly, what is the criterion for assessing the seriousness of an incident? The size of the sum taken, maybe? I would respectfully point out that fraud is serious by its very nature, and it is much more serious and unacceptable when public officials are involved. Moreover, how is it possible for a fraudulent organisation to have succeeded in operating without hindrance for years in the Commission? Are we really to believe that nobody noticed anything, despite the fact that rumours, faxes and emails on unlawful gains and fake contracts were flying around the Commission departments? What is more, we fail to understand how the Commission’s watchdog system works, for many other outrageous incidents have been discovered in addition to the Eurostat affair, such as the case of cereal prices. In this connection, the most ridiculous thing – it would be laughable if the matter were not so serious – is that the document presented this morning states – and I would draw your attention to this – that we need gradually to lay the foundations for a new culture of responsibility and transparency. What are we to infer from this? That, hitherto, irresponsibility and lack of transparency have been the norm in the Commission? There is something else that needs to be said on the subject of Eurostat and the serious nature of the scandal surrounding the organisation. This is not just another department, one of the many centres of European bureaucracy: it is an institution which, in carrying out its recording and statistical work, is, in actual fact, the guarantor of the Stability Pact, verifying the implementation of the Maastricht criteria. It therefore plays a part in defining Member States’ economic and financial policies and, in practice, in forcing the States to adopt stringent policies which often involve budgetary or welfare cuts. It is therefore an institution which has a watchdog role and which cannot afford to be associated with even the remotest doubt or suspicion regarding its impartiality or authority of the kind currently surrounding it. We realise that the affair is embarrassing because public funds have been used for unlawful purposes; we also understand the problem caused by the fact that the affair has exploded at a sensitive time, on the eve of the European elections, of enlargement and of the Constitution; we understand the problem but we cannot compromise on the matter. We can neither condone nor, as some would have us do, underestimate the severity of the incidents of corruption, fraud and malpractice. It is the citizens who demand that we stand firm, the same citizens of whom we ask sacrifices in the name of the Stability Pact. What is more, instead of pointing the finger and making a scapegoat out of some civil servant and bringing the affair to a hasty conclusion in this way, we would have greatly appreciated it if the Commission had fully shouldered its responsibilities, as Mr Santer did over much less. We cannot let all this pass without speaking out, especially at a time when the President of the Commission is disseminating a political manifesto – or maybe we should call it an electoral manifesto – describing the Europe of his dreams while neglecting the Europe that exists here and now. As if things were not bad enough already! President Prodi is entitled to put himself forward as a candidate for the next European elections, but, if this is his intention, we expect him to do things properly and resign. On the other hand, the damage this would cause at institutional level would be severe and, quite frankly, unacceptable. (Applause)

 Mr President, I would like to return, albeit briefly, to the massacres which have scourged Europe, and not just Europe, in the past week. I feel it is right that we should express our fierce condemnation of terrorism and specifically of these incidents. I would like to remember, in particular, the 19 Italian victims of the massacres in Nasiriya. It is important that the President of Parliament expresses our sympathy for the victims and our condolences to their families tomorrow, but I feel that it is also appropriate to thank all the armed forces of all the European countries who are currently on peace missions throughout the world. Lastly, I hope that Parliament will make a firm commitment to implementing increasingly effective measures to combat terrorism, for the message which must be sent out by the European Parliament is that none of the European peoples are going to let themselves be intimidated by these cowardly attacks.

 Mr President, Commissioner Vitorino, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of the report which I am about to present is the Commission proposal for a Council directive on compensation to crime victims. This initiative follows on from the Green Paper on compensation to crime victims with which, in September 2001, the Commission began to promote the debate on this issue and which, a year ago, was the subject of a report, which I had the honour of drafting, and also a Parliament resolution. On several occasions during debates in this House on the issue of justice and combating crime, a judicial system emerged at European level that centres almost exclusively – and I would say quite rightly – on penalties, punishment and control. Only to a lesser extent 
does this system deal with the rehabilitation and social reintegration of the defendants and, more generally, with a crime prevention policy. At the bottom of this list are, I am sorry to say, the victims of crime: innocent citizens who, despite having suffered an injury, at times serious, are, all too often, denied adequate protection and compensation. Thus, we need to put the protection of victims at the centre of the debate on justice. The most urgent problem to solve is the existence of major disparities between the national compensation schemes, enormous differences as regards the level of compensation and related procedures in each individual Member State. Such a situation cannot be considered compatible with the principles underlying the creation of a single area of freedom, security and justice. There has been a great deal of progress during the course of the year. The European Union has selected possible objectives to pursue, criticised the difficulties associated with the various legal systems of the Member States, identified the different kinds of needs of crime victims and established the minimum Community measures to be enforced. The most eagerly-awaited and most important step forward is, however, the desire now to adopt a binding legislative strategy, at Community level, to actively realise the Tampere policy objectives. Thanks to this directive, it will be possible to take an initial step towards harmonisation of the European criminal law systems as regards the treatment of crime victims, guaranteeing them, with all due respect for the principle of subsidiarity, sufficient attention, recognition of the necessary support and reparation for the harm inflicted, including when the person who committed the crime has not been identified, has disappeared or is unable to pay. Identifying common categories to define crime victims, compensation beneficiaries when the victim has died and the common procedures and formalities for payment therefore constitute the minimum legal base that the European Union is called upon to have to provide, so that it is no longer the case that the amount of compensation or the possibility of receiving it depends on the place of residence or on the place where the crime was committed. To this end, although I generally agree with everything that the Commission proposed, we added a more explicit description of the type of damage for which compensation is to be provided and the time frames laid down for compensation than is contained in the original text. We specified a minimum threshold for exclusion from compensation; we proposed, in order to avoid linguistic difficulties, to introduce harmonised forms and translations, where appropriate, into the language that the victim can understand. The priority objective is to guarantee the fundamental principle of non-discrimination for all citizens and legal residents in the Union and the desire to limit, as far as possible, the effects and suffering of victims of unjust damage, who are victims a second time when they are denied support by inadequate, or sometimes non-existent compensation systems I will conclude Mr President by thanking my fellow Members who contributed to the good outcome of the work.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can only thank the rapporteur for her excellent work, which is very precise and detailed. Firstly, I appreciated the principles, the values that are the basis for the report itself, in other words the need to recognise culture as having a principal role in the European Constitution. Indeed, the motto ‘united in diversity’ only makes sense when interpreted in light of the wealth and diversity of identities and of cultural and historical roots which are the heart of our European identity. All too often, however, European cultural heritage is neither appreciated nor exploited sufficiently, even though there is no doubt that it represents an area of great potential, not least from an economic point of view. I fully agree that it is necessary to begin by detailing a comprehensive study seeking to fix a European plan of industries and of cultural productions and activities and subsequently to implement a genuine inventory of European artistic and cultural heritage. It would be a step on from the past, even the recent past, when the Commission declared that it had neither instruments nor competence, thus relegating culture to an exclusively national responsibility. I will conclude by drawing attention to some important points in the report: firstly the reduction of VAT on music goods to boost sales and, in the meantime, to reduce trading of pirate products; secondly, greater focus on young artists, in terms of both training and promotion; thirdly and finally, greater investment at European level and more regulations, not least to facilitate European cultural enterprise financially, for example through the option of deducting the reinvested profits.

 Madam President, I feel it is genuinely important for Parliament to start carrying out an initial evaluation of the introduction of the euro today, a year and a half after its launch in the European market. The introduction of the euro has, without a doubt, been an extremely valuable development, and not just in economic and financial terms. It is worth pointing out once again that the euro area is the second largest economic area in the world. However, the single currency has also contributed to a small revolution in terms of culture and identity, so to speak. Indeed, the circulation and use of the single currency have given consumers something practical in common and have thus helped them to feel more like European citizens for the first time. Nevertheless, these same citizens, who exceeded all expectations and sailed through the transition from individual national currencies to the European single currency, are now demanding that the Community institutions carry out careful surveillance to prevent unjustified – and, in many cases, very substantial – increases in the price of both goods and services. Above all, as has been pointed out in the report too, these citizens are calling upon us to introduce minor measures in the future, effective, practical measures which will make their everyday lives easier. In particular, the citizens are calling upon us to introduce EUR 1 banknotes or even, in some cases, 50-cent banknotes, as well as for greater availability of low-value notes, especially in cash machines. I believe that these demands are absolutely legitimate and very reasonable too. I also believe that it is genuinely important that Parliament makes every effort to persuade the relevant Community institutions to comply with the demands of the European citizens, which, although small, are extremely important.

 The defence of fundamental rights cannot and must not become the ideological flag of any particular group, but must be the joint heritage of all citizens. Reading the pages of the Swiebel Report, however, it can be inferred that this important commitment to everybody’s rights is being transformed into an accusation against some quarters: in particular Italy and those who, in Italy, took the liberty of voting against the rapporteur’s wishes. Also with regard to defence of the family and related values, the report takes a one-sided, prejudiced view, which is certainly legitimate for a political group, but which cannot and must not become a common position of the European Union. Apart from religious aspects – which, nevertheless, cannot be completely overlooked, given the importance attached to Christian culture in Europe – the report completely ignores the great social and educational value undeniably inherent in the traditional couple, intended as a basic cell in the connective tissue of society. Defence of the right of individuals to conduct their relationships in their preferred manner is sacrosanct, but the European institutions cannot, in my view, equate these relationships with the social institution of the family in its traditional meaning.

 Madam President, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on his work. The seizure or confiscation of the proceeds of crime is indeed, as has been pointed out by the rapporteur too, a genuinely effective tool for combating organised crime. I would add that the confiscation of goods is also a valuable way of building up compensation funds for the victims of organised crime, victims of heinous crimes which can be linked to terrorism, child abuse, the trafficking of human beings or the trafficking of arms or drugs, victims who – it is worth pointing out – are often victims twice over, firstly because, through no fault of their own, they are the victims of a crime, and secondly because they do not subsequently receive sufficient, timely compensation for the damages suffered. Approximation of the rules and procedures governing the matter is therefore urgent and essential, especially where cross-border criminal activities are concerned. With regard to the Kingdom of Denmark’s proposal, I agree with the rapporteur that its scope should be restricted to organised crime offences, 
and I also support his proposal to place the onus to prove the unlawful origin of property upon the prosecution rather than the defendant. Last but not least, although I feel it is essential for it to be possible to confiscate crime-related proceeds, where these have been fictitiously transferred to the spouse or cohabitee or to another legal person, the prosecution must prove that the property of the spouse, cohabitee or other legal person does genuinely belong to the convicted person and that the other persons therefore only have fictitious title or access to it.
Angelilli (UEN

 Mr President, I would like to start by saying how necessary it is to lay the foundations for a policy shared by all the Member States on immigration strategies, on combating illegal immigration and therefore on a common definition of the right to asylum too. In particular, as regards the right to asylum, many Member States complain that the amount of applications they receive is excessive, condemning the attempts of some asylum applicants to abuse asylum procedures in order to get round Member States’ immigration laws. Indeed, it is essential to make a clear distinction between immigration, illegal immigration, the trafficking and exploitation of human beings and the right to asylum, the latter being a right which must retain its valuable, specific status as a human right which must be safeguarded. From this point of view, the report, pursuing what is supposed to be an open, progressive line of reasoning, widens the definition of the right to asylum – a fundamental right which, as such, cannot have too wide a definition – excessively and inappropriately, first and foremost because those requesting protection and those requesting the status of refugee are, in practice, placed on the same level, and secondly, because the report proposes too wide a definition of the right to asylum granted subsequently to family members too. Indeed, family members eligible for international protection include same-sex partners and partners’ children, and likewise, when it comes to minors, members of a minor’s family other than the minor’s actual parents can be considered to be their parents, and they therefore do not necessarily have to have lived together with the applicant in their country of origin. Therefore, unless amendments are adopted which make substantial changes to the text, particularly with a view to reducing the scope of the definition of ‘family member’ in the context of the right of family reunification, my group will vote against the motion.

 Mr President, the report of which I am about to give a brief overview deals with the Commission Green Paper on compensation to crime victims. This is certainly an extremely complex issue in legal terms, but I am glad to say that a major debate is developing on the matter with endeavours being made, first and foremost, to define the appropriate legislative instruments and identify the appropriate financial resources to secure what should be the basic right of a crime victim: to receive proper compensation for suffering and damages inflicted, especially where there is no perpetrator of the crime in that the author is unknown or is not in a position to provide the victim with compensation. Moreover, we know that the number of cross-border crime victims is increasing, firstly because of the increase in the movement of citizens within the Union but also, I regret to say, because of a general increase in crime, particularly in major, very serious criminal activities such as terrorism, child abuse and the trafficking of human beings. It should be emphasised, moreover, that many victims suffer injury twice, first as the victims of a crime and then as victims of an excessively bureaucratic system, and this system requires greater simplification in order to prevent situations where protection is unavailable or inadequate. In view of this, the need to set minimum standards on the protection of the victims of crimes, in particular on crime victims' access to justice and on their right to compensation, was explicitly established as early as Tampere when the principal guidelines to be followed with a view to creating a genuine area of freedom, security and justice were laid down. Regrettably, this strong political will has not yielded any significant legislative results at Community level in the time that has elapsed since 1999. The primary goal is, therefore, to create minimum common standards in as short a time as possible in order to make the right to compensation reality throughout European Union territory for both European citizens and those who are legally resident in Europe. These standards must contain a clear, precise definition which has been agreed upon by all the Member States of the types of crime and the damages that could be grounds for compensation. It will, moreover, be equally necessary to identify the parties who could legally be the recipients of compensation with similar precision and on the basis of similar assent, considering, inter alia
, that the families and dependents of people injured by crime can be considered to be the indirect victims of crimes. It will certainly be no easy matter to identify minimum standards, for two reasons. The first relates to the practical problem posed by legal codification, for a complex process will have to be launched to approximate the – at present, extremely diverse – laws of the Member States. The second concerns the vital need to identify adequate resources. A number of different funding possibilities exist. We could consider, as the Commission suggests, setting up a special European Solidarity Fund, which could, moreover, contain the proceeds of the seizure and subsequent sale of the assets of criminal networks. In any case, the priority must be to define rules and procedures governing the treatment of victims which are as harmonised as possible. All this would help to remedy the – at times, extraordinary –
 disparities which exist between the different legal systems of the Member States. Indeed, at present, there are differences linked to the place of residence of the victim or to the State in which the crime was committed, which means that discrimination is occurring which is unacceptable and prejudicial to the victims. In practice, a situation is created where there is real disparity between the treatment people receive, which varies according to the country in which the crime took place, and this is a blatant violation of the fundamental principle of non-discrimination.

 Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on her work, on the figures and statistics presented, which, although there is a lack of homogenous data, reveal that violence against women and children is an extremely disturbing phenomenon. The most recent data on domestic violence and violence within the home, which reveal how one in five women is the victim of violent acts committed by her husband or partner, are incredible. These acts of violence are often never exposed and sometimes even end in the murder of the victim. In the face of such tragic figures, we are astounded at the allocation of such an inadequate sum, even taking into account the increase of the 2002 budget by EUR 1 million. We are also astounded that public bodies have only accounted for 10% of the participants. The role of public bodies is, indeed, decisive, both in terms of training specialised staff and in terms of the provision of information on and prevention of acts of violence and abuse perpetrated against women and children. In particular, we need to create or improve counselling and legal advice centres which will be able to guarantee and provide maximum protection for the victims, as well as free psychological and legal assistance. It would be desirable to include teaching spaces dedicated to the prevention of child abuse and domestic violence in school curricula. Lastly, my group fully supports the idea of a European year of action to combat violence against women and children. However, I agree with my colleagues: if the legal basis is not changed, there is little of actual practical, effective use we can do to combat these terrible offences.

 Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for her work. I must start by saying that I fully share the regret expressed by other female colleagues at the sadly symbolic, worrying fact that, despite the many good intentions expressed, of the members of the European Convention planning the future of Europe and therefore the future of the rights of European citizens – both men and women – only 16% are women, which I feel is a genuinely disturbing figure. Nevertheless, it is worth calling strongly for the achievement of a number of fundamental objectives, strongly underscored in the report, which would help to secure more tangible and, above all, better opportunities for European women. I am referring, in the first place, to the need for an evaluation report to be drawn up assessing compliance by the Member States with all the legislative texts adopted – resolutions, recommendations and directives – in order to assess regularly the extent to which these texts are being implemented by the Member States and, if necessary, instigate any appropriate infringement proceedings in the event of failure to transpose or respect them. This would enable us to keep the situation more under control, making the Member States accountable and taking more effective measures to secure all the conditions necessary for a more balanced participation of women both in the work place and in government, while attempting, moreover, to promote a responsible social assistance policy for working women – in other words, facilities for the care of children and dependent persons – so as to make it genuinely possible for women to reconcile professional and family life. For the reasons I have attempted briefly to outline, our group will vote for the report.

 Mr President, although I pay tribute to the rapporteur for her work, at the risk of being unpopular I am completely unable to support this report. I cannot even endorse the language used, which I consider to be far removed from my own view of the matter and that of many European Catholic women and non-religious women too, who believe deeply in the values of life, the family and motherhood. Just by way of example, there are repeated references throughout the text to reproductive rights and fertility awareness: terms which, quite frankly, I feel would be more suited to cattle than women, who are human beings. It would be more respectful to talk about the right to maternity, to informed maternity, about emotional education, but, above all, apart from a number of general and therefore largely acceptable statements, I feel that the entire report is based on the imperative of upholding the right to contraception, particularly emergency contraception – the morning-after pill – and to abortion, for both the Member States and the candidate countries. All that is unacceptable in that it rides roughshod over the principle of subsidiarity and therefore the right of each Member State to decide on its own health policy, and especially because it trivialises recourse to abortion and shows no genuine respect for life and the rights of the unborn child. Moreover, this is a proposal which does very little of substance to develop a responsible policy promoting solidarity and the family, adoption and the protection of child mothers, which totally disregards all the legislative measures and good practices which exist to help pregnant women and mothers, offering practical help for women expecting a child, dissuading them from resorting to abortion by providing a programme of economic aid and proper social and psychological help. Therefore, Mr President, my group will vote against this report.

 Madam President, I should like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on his work. In particular, I welcome the Community’s undertaking to fully cancel the debts of the highly indebted and least developed countries linked to special loans. Of course, these are only the first steps in what will, of necessity, be a long, major process. Indeed, genuine debt cancellation is now truly the only possible way to give many of the developing countries the chance to find a way out of the spiral of debt, out of what is known as the debt trap, to give these countries the hope of being able to compete on a global market and the practical opportunity to do so, and to give their people a future in which they can genuinely combat poverty, hunger and illness on a practical level. Of course, we must demand a commitment from these countries that they will respect human rights, abandon war as a means of resolving disputes and use the funds released by debt cancellation for responsible, monitored poverty reduction programmes, while guaranteeing wider democratic involvement of civil society. It is therefore worth specifying that the debt cancellation or alleviation measures must not be seen as an excuse to reduce development aid: quite the opposite, development aid does need to be monitored but it must certainly be increased and encouraged. We must not forget that Europe has a responsibility to provide essential support to the poorest countries of the developing world through a long-term undertaking to help these countries and support them during a process of far-reaching change and economic and social development, in addition to cancelling the debt. The success of the fight against terrorism, illegal immigration and the trafficking and exploitation of human beings is also dependent on the poorest and most heavily indebted countries and communities achieving a future of peace, progress and economic and social justice.

 Mr President, I sympathise both with the previous speaker and with all those who, as frequently happens, mention – albeit, in my opinion, inappropriately in some cases – the Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi. To get back to the debate, the European Parliament is, at last, going to vote on two fundamental issues: combating terrorism and the European arrest warrant. Of course, this vote is only a sort of belated attempt to comply with bureaucratic procedures in respect of decisions which have actually already been taken. As has already been stressed, this way of going about things is not particularly acceptable, for it represents a genuine political humiliation for the European Parliament, which – and we must not forget it – is the only democratically-elected European institution, the only institution which fully represents the European citizens. We can be satisfied with the endorsement of the European arrest warrant, a tool which will certainly be effective in legal terms in combating terrorism and international organised crime, replacing the complex, excessively bureaucratic extradition procedures. However, we must not forget that the fight against terrorism, particularly the sort of terrorism which we have encountered in recent months, cannot be conducted solely by means of arrest warrants, for this would be a hypocritical and wholly inadequate approach. As Mr Solana stressed yesterday, Europe will only be able to attempt to win genuine international credibility if it is capable of restoring peace and social and political justice to the Mediterranean Basin and the Middle East. Europe’s undertaking in these critical areas must not be dictated solely by emergencies and emotion or, even worse, by the selfish desires of those who see their own peace threatened: it must be part of a European project, a practical, ongoing undertaking seeking to secure a fitting economic, political and social future for these areas. In conclusion, we are confident that the new constituent phase which will be inaugurated with the installation and work of the Convention will genuinely succeed in making Europe a strong, responsible political actor, capable of achieving a single common foreign and security policy and a common European area of freedom and justice.

Mr President, the past week has been pivotal for the future of the Union. Firstly, agreement was reached on the European arrest warrant, a major, sensitive agreement which must be seen as an initial step, to be consolidated by a broader, further-reaching political and institutional project bringing further integration. In particular, at Laeken, we started to define that political and constitutional Europe in which we firmly believe. The idea that Europe might be condemned to being just a union of agriculture and trade or just a financial and monetary union is waning. We are, at last, entering a new phase: an exciting phase, a phase of laying foundations and further integration, in which we must establish European political unity while safeguarding national identities and diversities. The diversities unite us; they must not be seen as dividing the European peoples, for they have come to represent precious social and cultural assets. Europe’s strength stems, in actual fact, precisely from its ancient culture, from its diversities as well as its common roots. In this sense, as a European and an Italian, I can only appreciate the work of the Italian Government at Laeken in enthusiastically upholding Parma’s application to be the site of the Food Authority. If we want the Europe we are building to be a Europe of excellence, quality and competitiveness in the area of quality, when it comes to the Food Authority, Parma is the natural, most suitable and most prestigious choice, precisely because of Italy’s longstanding gastronomic traditions: it has a tradition of culture and quality, professionalism and rigour, and a history of consolidated scientific excellence which is recognised the world over. In promoting Parma’s application – energetically, moreover, as Italy did at Laeken – we are not trying to impose unnecessary vetoes or advancing nationalistic claims; rather, this is an attempt to allow the quality, capacity, skills and natural, genuine vocation of a territory to prevail over bureaucracy, sterile bureaucratic agreements and pre-established lists, rather than allowing the latter to prevail as has happened on countless occasions. The citizens do not want the site of the Food Authority to be purely administrative but to have proven experience and capacity in the field of food safety. I feel that Parma has that proven experience and capacity. Finally, my heartfelt thanks go to the President, Mrs Fontaine, who, with great authority and courtesy, has steered the work of this House during this first part of our parliamentary term.

 Mr President, the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms has done some notable work in opening up a debate within the European Union Member States and thus assuring the highest security at European Council meetings and other similar events. Indeed, since the events of 11 September, the significance of these topics has increased enormously. Nevertheless, both the rationale underlying the organisation of these summits and the views of many of the peaceful demonstrators remain current. First of all, it is important that international Summits should continue to be held regularly and, where possible, they should be expanded to include representatives of the Third World, as happened at the G8 summit in Genoa. Indeed, it is only through discussion, dialogue and, especially, the preparation of a genuine cooperation and development policy that the poverty and marginalisation of vast regions of the globe can be overcome. This is precisely why we do not share the extreme, though peaceful positions of those demonstrators who, in Genoa, called the validity of the Summits themselves into question. Then there are the views of the so-called anti-globalisation movements, which are also topical and important; they are the views of those who imagine a development model with greater respect for people and the environment, those who imagine a more just society in which wealth is redistributed more fairly. That is why we should appreciate the innovative method introduced at the Genoa Summit by the Italian Government, which lined up a series of preliminary talks with the demonstration leaders in order to make participation in the Summit itself more democratic. It must be made quite clear, however, that there can be no tolerance for violent demonstrators. At Nice, Gothenburg and Genoa, some people, even politicians, succumbed to the temptation of seeking to justify violent behaviour. We should, rather, have the courage to condemn it unconditionally in every case, because, in addition to the views of the authorities and the views of the demonstrators, there are the views of the silent majority of European citizens, who want practical answers to the issues discussed at these Summits, and that is also thanks to the stimulus provided by the demonstrators, but without the unfortunate excesses and violence that completely devastated the city of Genoa. Lastly, I should like to mention the views of many men and women in the forces of law and order who, every day throughout Europe, strive to deal with major and minor emergencies of public order and crime, often with inadequate resources. If, as happened in Genoa, some of them went too far, they should be identified and punished individually, but without a whole class of people who often risk their lives for the good of society being unjustly and undeservedly criminalised. Finally, I congratulate the Italian Government and its Prime Minister, Mr Berlusconi, and the Belgian Prime Minister for having reached that important agreement yesterday on the European arrest warrant. I hope this will be the first step towards European harmonisation on matters of justice, and especially an important precondition for a European political Constitution guaranteeing all European citizens the right to security, freedom and justice.

 Mr President, I wish to denounce the unacceptable behaviour of Mr Schmid, who was acting President this morning, who during the debate allowed some left-wing Members to make really personal attacks on Members of the Italian centre-right and in particular the Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, as well as involving President Fontaine by accusing her somehow of blocking in an evidently improper manner the request to waive Mr Berlusconi’s parliamentary immunity. I believe and we believe it is unacceptable that Members from other countries should attack the sovereignty of the Italian Government and the democratic choices of its people. If this unfortunate habit and this constant lowering of tone are not stopped, next session we shall make sure we bring to this House’s attention all the examples, public and private, of European party leaders who, in our view, damage Europe’s image.

 Madam President, I, too, would like to express my grief at the deaths which occurred in the incident in Rome yesterday, and to express my heartfelt thanks and full support for the work of the police force and the municipal police, in particular, who are always ready and willing to act in the front line, not just to combat crime but also to come to the aid of European citizens at difficult times such as these, and who are always prepared to lose their lives doing deeds of great bravery, as, sadly, happened in Rome as well as New York.

Madam President, after the events of 11 September, Europe and the European institutions must also assume their responsibility and find the courage to achieve a joint agreement between the Member States on combating terrorism and, in general, combating organised crime, without delay. The legal instruments which will make this fight genuinely effective include the European arrest warrant, which will, at last, replace the complex and excessively bureaucratic extradition procedures which have now become insufficient and inadequate for fighting crime, particularly international crime. That said, we need to move one step at a time. The emotion of the tragic terrorist attacks of recent months must certainly prompt us to strengthen judicial cooperation between the Member States without delay, but in speeding up this process we must take things one step at a time and act responsibly. Indeed, good laws are not compatible with haste or with lack of precision or emotional reactions, particularly when it comes to identifying the offences in respect of which the European arrest warrant is to be applied. We would therefore express our concern at the Belgian Presidency’s proposal to apply the European arrest warrant to a list of around 30 categories of offences immediately. In our opinion, terrorism or the trafficking of human beings, to give just two examples, cannot be placed on the same level as counterfeiting or forgery. It would therefore be more in the general interest to propose and adopt, first of all, with the unanimous consent of all the Member States, an initial, limited list and then, subsequently, to extend this list gradually, thus focusing initially on terrorist crimes, organised crime, the trafficking of drugs, arms and human beings and the exploitation of minors.
Angelilli (UEN

Mr President, it has never been so appropriate as now, in the wake of the events of 11 September, to establish joint investigation teams to improve cooperation between all the national investigation teams, particularly with a view to enhancing and speeding up that necessary exchange of fresh information between all the information services of the Member States of the European Union. Clearly, this is a police cooperation tool that will be of truly strategic importance in preventing crime. It is a vital, useful tool which will help to tackle the critical terrorist situation in Europe in the wake of the severe international crisis caused by the attack on the twin towers. We have all had the opportunity, although, sadly, only since the New York and Washington carnage, to reconstruct the series of preparations for terrorist attacks made on our own European territory over the years by people and organisations linked to Osama Bin Laden: the many, apparently unimportant signs actually linked by a single thread and whose connection, sadly, we did not realise until it was too late, until after 11 September, when thousands of innocent people had already died. Clearly, closer judicial and police cooperation involving more joint investigations might well have made us more effective in preventing terrorist crimes. However, it is worth noting that, in addition to helping us respond to the critical terrorist situation, joint investigation teams would also play a useful general role in helping to fight the many phenomena linked to large-scale organised crime at international level 
such as the illegal trafficking of arms and drugs and the trafficking and exploitation of human beings. Mr President, I would like to end by thanking Mr Kirkhope and pointing out that the fight against crime, both terrorism-related and general, has, for years now, been the subject of the most insistent requests from European citizens, who are demanding increasing efforts from the national and European institutions fully guaranteeing the fundamental, inalienable right to safety, that precious thing which is under increasing threat. Therefore, I look forward to the greatest possible endeavours from the European Union too, making use, not least, of the tool of the joint investigation teams, precisely to restore the necessary confidence of the European citizens.

 Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur for her work. Parliament has stressed on many occasions that equal opportunities for men and women must be more than just a principle. Equal opportunities is a concept, a definition which must be translated into a genuine effort by the institutions to ensure, first and foremost, genuine equal treatment of men and women as regards access to work and professional training. What is more, working women must also be able to choose whether to take the opportunity to have a family and bring up children without this jeopardising their professional careers through no fault of their own. Indeed, society must be re-educated to see motherhood not just as a woman’s right but also as an opportunity for society as a whole, considering, not least, that one of the causes of the falling birth rate is precisely the fact that many women are discouraged from having children by the rigid mechanisms of the employment world. For precisely this reason, we need not just to ensure that a woman has the right to resume her job when maternity leave comes to an end but, in order to genuinely protect working mothers, we need to be able to provide them with more flexible legislation on parental leave, allowing fathers to benefit from paternity leave too so that they can attend to the child during its first few months of life. In conclusion, Mr President, the European Union should increasingly promote all such instruments – social, legal and economic – which can provide strong, practical – as opposed to theoretical – support for women, especially working women, and thus provide strong support for families.

 Mr President, I should particularly like to thank Mr Pirker for the work he has done. Now more than ever, as the rapporteur has stressed, it is essential to reformulate Community immigration policy: not just aseptic rules allowing or forbidding entry, but a broader and more responsible approach based above all on economic and demographic assessments and evaluations of social and cultural integration. We therefore need to lay down a strategy for a sustainable immigration policy in which national and local institutions can play a major part in using objective criteria to identify occupational needs and the availability of jobs, accommodation, social services and training for all those who ask to come and live and work in our Member States. Setting limits and strict rules means ensuring they get the best possible welcome and are fully integrated, with mutual respect and benefits for both European citizens and the immigrants. It means avoiding painful social conflict, and it also means being tough on illegal immigration, which all too often is associated with crime and exploitation. Above all, Europe cannot confine itself to taking a passive role and attitude towards immigration as if it were just a traffic policeman directing traffic. Europe must act with greater political awareness so that it can also interpret fully the strong motivations underlying these phenomena. Very often, or almost always, people from third countries come to Europe out of desperation, poverty, hunger or marginalisation. Their desperation is such that there are mothers who leave their own children and come to our countries in order to earn something for them. For this very reason, and also because of its geographical situation, Europe cannot play a merely bureaucratic role, encouraging or limiting immigration. Europe must choose to play a strong, responsible, political role, aware that behind the policy choices to be made regarding immigration there lies the possibility of also being a player in the serious international crisis we are going through. We must be aware that it is only by making greater efforts through Third World development programmes and by preventing the so-called brain drain that we can implement the best peace policy of all, which is the fight against poverty and injustice. In conclusion, Mr President, we must be aware that well regulated immigration can bring great benefits to the European Union, to the immigrants themselves and to their countries of origin. But we must be wary of the demagogy of those who propose too permissive an immigration policy, a policy that would encourage Europe to open its borders indiscriminately, reduce controls and extend the right to asylum to an absurd degree, but then to selfishly close our eyes – as we have been doing for years – towards what is happening in the Middle East and the southern countries, as if it had nothing at all to do with us. September 11 showed that what happens in those parts of the world affects us closely, and so we should really be convinced, with a little consistency… (The President cut the speaker off)

 Madam President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur for his work on the extremely serious, topical issue of terrorism, which has recently been spreading with appalling, renewed vigour. We may have been deluding ourselves in thinking we had banished this scourge which had stained Europe with blood for so long. It may be that contemporary terrorism is more difficult to fight because it is less ideological and more sensationalist, because it is not based on political ideals but purely on violence, with precisely the aim of destabilising the institutions and terrorising the public. What, then, should be Parliament’s role? On the one hand, Parliament must certainly address the causes of that social and cultural malaise and distress which clearly lead to terrorism, but, most importantly, it must endeavour in some way to prevent the emergence of terrorist groups, to anticipate it and to identify the first signs as soon as they appear. There are so many resources available to us: so many data banks, so many police resources and so much legislation, and yet, all too often, when faced with the emergence or transformation of large-scale criminal phenomena such as those related to drugs, crimes against children, the trafficking and exploitation of human beings and, of course, terrorism, Parliament continues to be taken by surprise and ends up arriving too late, incapable of defining effective preventive actions. This was the case of those violent groups, many of them in contact with terrorist organisations, who infiltrated the peaceful, legitimate anti-globalisation movements. I therefore look forward to the measures envisaged in the report to contain the spread of terrorism, particularly the European search and arrest warrant and the abolition of the formal extradition procedure. I would like to end, Madam President, by saying that – to give just one example – there are still Italian citizens who used to be part of the Red Brigades and have been condemned as guilty of terrorist homicide for almost 20 years now, who have been in hiding for that entire period as the guests of other European States, despite repeated applications for their extradition.

 Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mr Cornillet for his work on the fundamental rights situation in the Union. This is a detailed, balanced report which could genuinely provide constructive impetus for each Member State to give increasingly tangible, concrete substance to the principle of justice and the protection of the principal, inalienable rights of the European citizens. This report could provide the opportunity for a moment’s reflection, for an initial stock take of the effect of the new Charter of Fundamental Rights, which represents a stage which is only just the beginning and yet so important if we are to achieve a European unification which consists of more than finance and economics, which is also the home of rights and opportunities for all the European citizens, and where special attention is given to those whose rights are most often violated such as children, the marginalised and the poorest people. Although I support the line taken by the report, I do have a few criticisms. With regard to the chapter on non-marital relations, I feel that it is unacceptable to envisage equal legal status for marriages between people of the opposite sex and unions between people of the same sex. Without prejudice to the right for all people not to be subjected to discrimination on the basis of their sexual orientation, there is still a legal and social need to protect the traditional marriage union as a fundamental unit of society, particularly where recourse to fertility treatment or the adoption of minors is concerned, which must remain the exclusive privilege of natural families. This is precisely because of the need to protect minors for, all too often, we forget that fundamental rights are the prerogative not just of adults but also and above all of minors. I would, however, like to draw Parliament’s attention once again to the case of the male descendents of the House of Savoy who, in a Europe which is an area of justice, freedom and free movement, have been unable to return to Italy for over 50 years. It would be appropriate if Parliament could help to resolve this matter.

 The Alleanza Nazionale
 group has voted for the Karamanou report because the European institutions are at last decisively committed to combating phenomena like child pornography and the sexual exploitation of children, which is worsening and spreading all the time, striking down the weakest and most defenceless citizens of the European Union: our children. This is the first perceptible step to remind the Member States of their responsibility to introduce more appropriate legislation to deal with the specific nature of this odious crime. The Alleanza Nazionale
 group has frequently denounced the urgent need to intervene and impose strict controls and prohibitions on the Internet, which represents one of the main channels of communication and distribution of both audio and video child pornography, making the service provider criminally responsible for the content of the services provided. Finally, we particularly appreciated the proposal to confiscate the proceeds of this sexual exploitation and devote them to victims and children’s rights NGOs. The European Union will then be playing a decisive role in resisting a phenomenon which knows no frontiers because it is often run by large criminal associations at international level.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, all the studies and statistics on major social emergencies stress that the right to security is one of the greatest demands of the European citizens. Crime, in its most varied forms, is rightly perceived by our citizens to be not just a threat to physical safety 
but a genuine, ever-increasing, intolerable threat to the freedom of movement, the freedom to work and the freedom to live a normal everyday life. This psychological concern has led to an increasing lack of confidence in the institutions and increasing mistrust of other people. This sense of insecurity affects absolutely everybody: companies, families and individual people, particularly women, the elderly and children. In this context, it is often very difficult to separate large-scale organised crime, large-scale criminal phenomena, and what is known as small-scale crime; this is particularly true of urban areas, one example being drug distribution and drug pushing. Mr President, there was a time when the first thing people asked for was timely crime prevention and sure penalties for criminals. Now the situation has changed: people demand safety above all else and, therefore, crime prevention in particular, maybe because the number of particularly abhorrent crimes, such as all crimes related to paedophilia and the sexual exploitation of women and children, is increasing at a worrying rate. Crime prevention must therefore be interpreted – and is being interpreted – as a certainty enabling people to exercise their freedoms, and the citizens are demanding precisely an undertaking that we will implement all possible measures to contain the spread of crime. I believe that the importance of crime prevention has been stressed by Parliament on repeated occasions, and Parliament has produced a large number of instruments in this field. It was also appropriately and explicitly recognised by the Treaty of Amsterdam and then acknowledged on a number of other occasions up to and including the Tampere Council, which explicitly proposed to reinforce international cooperation on crime prevention by establishing a crime prevention network between national authorities. This proposal was then accepted by the French Presidency and the Swedish Presidency, which intend to establish this network of information and exchange of experiences and best practices to prevent crime through a proposal for a legislative initiative. The undertaking would include the exchange of information and news in as short a time as possible precisely in order to be able to study the origins of criminal phenomena. It would operate in a similar way to the way in which the Lisbon Drug Monitoring Centre operates, albeit in a different sector, which monitors changes in drug distribution from their origin. The objective is therefore to be able to study criminal phenomena right from their origins, monitoring the enormous capacity for evolution and veritable metamorphosis of crime to adapt to new forms of prevention, apart from anything else, and thus find new channels for expression. To sum up, the network is a network for the exchange of information and best practices. It is certainly not an attempt to take away from Member States the power to make fundamental decisions on security policies, which are obviously the prerogative of the individual States and therefore the individual national parliaments and governments. In my opinion, we are simply showing the citizens that Europe is in the process of creating a genuine area of freedom and justice. I would like to thank all the Members for their cooperation and Mrs Terrón, in particular, for the amendment she tabled, which has enhanced and complemented our work.

 Mr President, I support the extremely urgent Portuguese initiative promoting the legal protection of victims during criminal proceedings. The rapporteur – whom I congratulate – did well to highlight the unacceptable paradox of, on the one hand, a Europe without borders where goods and people move freely, a Europe which is on the point of monetary union, a financial and economic union, and, on the other hand, a Europe of 15 criminal law systems, all completely different. On the one hand, there are a potential 350 million people who are encouraged to travel and work in the name of the united Europe, but if they fall victim to a crime, a wrong-doing, Europe vanishes, the much-lauded European citizenship vanishes, the citizen becomes a person without rights who has to reckon with a foreign, often hostile State which gives out no information, creates a multitude of problems and does not pay damages where they are due. How many of us Members of Parliament are requested to ask questions on cases of this kind? However, the Commission duly replies to us that it cannot go into the matter of national legal systems, even when obvious injustices occur. Just in recent months two cases have been referred to me. The first is the case of two Italian Alitalia pilots, Alberto Nassetti and Pierpaolo Racchetti, who died in France following an accident, in unexplained circumstances, during a test flight of an aeroplane. Six years have gone by and, beset by hundreds of problems and prohibitive legal costs, their families are still waiting for justice, they are waiting to know the cause of these deaths and who, if any, the responsible parties are. The second case involves a Greek student, Mikis Mantakas, killed around 25 years ago in Rome, following a terrorist attack carried out by the Red Brigades. The guilty party, Arturo Lojacono, was identified and sentenced, but sought refuge abroad. Italy has repeatedly requested the extradition of this multiple murderer from France, where Mr Lojacono lives freely, so that he can finally serve his time. Well, we are still waiting for a reply. So, together with the euro, I also welcome the advent of the statute for the victims of crime, so that a genuine European area of justice can be built.

 Mr President, I am just taking the floor to inform you that a delegation of workers from Telecom Italia is present in Parliament today. Telecom Italia is a leading company in the telecommunications sector. These workers have come to Parliament to present a petition bearing over 10 000 signatures, calling precisely for the support of the European institutions. This is because they have been made redundant by their company despite the fact that it is economically sound and that it has been expanding for some years. Telecom Italia is therefore a company which raises its prices and cuts jobs. In recent weeks, in recent days, we have been discussing the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the rights of workers. It would therefore be appropriate for Parliament to endeavour to avoid there being such a huge discrepancy between its fine declarations of principles and harsh reality. Therefore, what we want from Parliament and the Commission are greater endeavours to protect workers and fight unemployment.
Angelilli (UEN

 Mr President, in the same way as the Treaty of Amsterdam and the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, Parliament has repeatedly declared itself to be opposed to the death penalty which sadly, as has been pointed out, still exists in many countries of the world: countries with antidemocratic traditions such as Communist China and extremely liberal countries such as the United States. We are also aware of how difficult it is to succeed in eliminating this penalty which is so very unnatural and inhumane. It is even difficult in America where, as Mrs Frassoni pointed out, those who represent the institutions, the policy-makers, do not dare to propose abolishing capital punishment for fear of losing support. The reason is clear: with the rise in organised crime the death penalty is considered to be a deterrent, containing and checking the increase in crime and illegal activity. However, we know that this is not at all the case; we know that the death penalty is an abhorrent practice, a form of State-legalised crime. We know that, even though it is strict and uncompromising, the fight against crime must be pursued under the banner of the law and social rehabilitation, certainly not in the name of repression alone or, what is even worse, with the mentality of an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. This is precisely why we must promote a Europe-wide campaign for a moratorium on the death penalty, a large-scale human rights campaign which involves everybody, from those with political or institutional roles to the citizens themselves, especially the younger citizens, precisely in order to create genuine civil awareness of the matter and to put political pressure on the countries in which the death penalty is still part of the law. I would also like to propose that the European States refuse to trade with those countries in which the death penalty is still practised, but I know that this is nothing but a utopian dream. I refer, in particular, to China, which, as the Commissioner too mentioned, issues a death sentence every day of the week and in general shows very little respect for human rights but which, regrettably, is also a highly attractive trading partner for all the European countries and one they cannot do without. I would like to end by saying that these campaigns against the death penalty would be much more efficient and much more widespread if we were to succeed, as an institution, in conveying to our citizens the idea that we are simultaneously working, with equal determination and efficiency to build a safe Europe where it will be possible to eradicate terrible criminal scourges, such as drug trafficking, the exploitation of human beings and child abuse, in the very near future.

 Mr President, Commissioner Reding, ladies and gentlemen, this report on the possibility of establishing parental control of television broadcasting in order to protect minors tackles an issue which is extremely important and topical, all the more so when we consider the growing number of television programmes on offer and the increasingly wide and increasingly uncontrolled distribution of the Internet. To this I would add two further observations: on the one hand, the number of minors with direct access to televisions and computers is constantly increasing and, on the other, there is a worrying increase in the broadcasting of violent images – portraying all possible types of violence – both in television programmes and over the Internet. For example, last week in Italy, a racket trafficking paedophile pornography via the Internet was uncovered. This discovery was then broadcast on the television network. However, some of the images taken from the sites investigated were also shown, causing great consternation amongst the citizens over the unscrupulous use of such pictures, which are or were certainly inappropriate and harmful for the minors who were watching television at the time. To return to the report, as you are aware, the European Commission is preparing a report on the implementation of the 'Television without frontiers' directive, to be published in the next few months. Guidelines and considerations on the protection of minors must be included in this report in an appropriate manner. I would also like to point out that Article 22, Paragraph 2 of the directive explicitly specifies that all the Member States must take appropriate measures to ensure that broadcasts by television broadcasters do not include any programmes which might impair the physical, mental or moral development of minors, in particular programmes that contain pornography or gratuitous violence. Therefore, we are all aware that, in practice, this is certainly not a simple undertaking. However, in the light of these considerations, our task is to define the objectives which we can reasonably expect to achieve in order to be able to establish genuine, reliable protection for minors. Firstly, we must identify all the technological systems in order to be able to manage in an informed manner the increase in the broadcasting via television or Internet of material which could be considered harmful to the psychological development of minors: I refer, in particular, to filtering systems and programme classification systems. However, we must also take into account the introduction of the digital system, which will facilitate the use and broadcasting of such programmes. Secondly, we must specify that, in addition to the technological control systems which I have mentioned, a further two elements are essential to prepare the ground, so to speak. Firstly, we must promote the development at national level of information and awareness-raising policies targeting families and the world of education in general. Secondly, we must encourage producers to take responsibility for the quality of television programmes and broadcasters to take responsibility for broadcasting procedures for these programmes. Clearly, we cannot attempt to harmonise legislation on the protection of minors in that, under the principle of subsidiarity, each Member State is sovereign in this matter, but also because cultural and moral concepts and therefore views on these issues differ widely from country to country: for example, there are differences in the definition of who exactly is a minor and the definition of violence, etc. However, having said this, if we are to produce more than empty words to protect children we do need to provide clear recommendations on the protection of minors in the media context. I would like to summarise the proposals made in this report which I feel are most important and most viable in practical terms: firstly, the setting up of an group of experts consisting of high-level individuals appointed by the Member States to contribute to the definition of common criteria for the protection of minors in the media context; secondly, the establishment by all the operators in the sector of a code of self-regulation in respect of the protection of minors; thirdly, the possibility of promoting filtering systems and making them available for use on both television programmes and the Internet. I would like to end by saying that, in accordance with the vote which took place in committee, I cannot accept Amendments Nos 1 and 4 tabled by the liberal group or Amendments Nos 5 and 6 tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, whereas I welcome Amendments Nos 2 and 3 tabled by the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party.

 Mr President, it is a matter of deep concern that, yet again, the European Parliament has not been consulted on the Council’s intended action plans for the prevention of and fight against organised crime. The European citizens, who, every day, live through the drama of all forms of petty and serious crime – from international drug trafficking to the sexual exploitation of children, from the trafficking and exploitation of human beings to illegal immigration – who live in towns which are unsafe or even dangerous, would like to be able to express their opinions and to lay claim, democratically, through their representatives at the European Parliament, to their rights and priorities of security and the fight against crime. Most importantly, Parliament should be able to give a voice to the defenceless, and I am referring to the many children who are victims of violence or sexual abuse and the many adolescents who are ensnared by drugs. Clearly, the fight against the sexual exploitation of children and that against drugs – to quote but two examples – are genuinely extremely difficult tasks, but they are priority issues, and it is certainly not acceptable, as the Council advocates, for priority to be dictated by feasibility rather than urgency,

I think we all agree on the role and importance of sport which, at both competitive and amateur level, is an excellent tool for the education and social integration of both players and spectators. Of course, sport is also an extremely important economic phenomenon and, as such, it must follow and comply with certain market rules, as indicated in the famous Bosman judgment. However, as has already been pointed out this morning, sport must preserve its unique features, which are primarily of a social and cultural nature. Precisely to avoid sport being reduced to nothing more than a business, we must call, loud and clear, upon the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference at Nice to expressly insert a significant reference to the institutional recognition of sport into Article 151 of the Treaty.

 Mr President, as the rapporteurs who have just spoken said, although the right to free movement is deemed to be one of the most important aspects of the fundamental right of European citizenship, it is a right which is all too often subject to restrictions, and the large number of petitions to the European Parliament on precisely this subject are testimony to this. I would first of all like to focus on a point strongly emphasised in the report: the need to fight against all abusive and excessively restrictive interpretations of the concept of public policy by some Member States. For example, someone who has lived in a country since childhood or, at any rate, for a large number of years, and therefore has cultural, social and family ties in that country, should not be deported unless he or she is convicted of a crime which is deemed to be, in effect, a serious offence, under the criminal law of the country of residence. Sadly, this is very often not the case. Another point which I would like to focus on concerns the members of certain royal families, such as the Italian royal family, for example, which, despite the fact that it does not pose a threat to national security, cannot fully exercise its legitimate right of free movement. I feel that the time has truly come to make a genuine attempt to tackle these issues and remove the barriers to free movement once and for all, for the very reason that – as has already been said – potatoes and goods appear to have greater freedom of movement in Europe than the citizens.

 Mr President, I would like to start by complimenting the rapporteur on managing to combine so many proposals in one report. However, I would like to touch on a few points. In the first place, I agree that there is a need for policy-makers and the law to be able, or rather to be as good as under obligation, to adapt to the speed of technological progress. In the case of the audiovisual sector, clear and, most importantly, timely legal instruments will mean that the institutions are able to regulate these changes: to provide better protection for the public and for users, establish the necessary restrictions to protect minors, lay down new rules to protect copyright and set regulations in place before certain developments occur, such as the fact that electronic commerce will soon be taking place via the medium of television. Moreover, we must not be intimidated but take pride in the entire audiovisual sector in the digital age as a great vehicle of freedom, information and movement of ideas. We have a vast European heritage of culture and communications which must be fully exploited, and for this more funding will certainly be necessary, but this purpose could also be served by opportunities for discussion, such as the Forum proposed by the rapporteur: this would be an opportunity for discussion aimed at the creation of a future audiovisual policy which would take advantage of the infinite number of openings provided by the newest technology and use them to further progress towards the goal of producing increasingly high quality products. Therefore, our objective is to achieve an interactive audiovisual policy where there is more participation in order to give expression to the countless individual characteristics and differences in which our great European identity is rich.

 I have had occasion to witness the situation in Tibet personally. It is far more serious, humiliating and painful than it is possible to describe in this Chamber or at any other meeting. For the last forty years, the Chinese have forcibly denied the Tibetans their freedom, they have deprived them of their identity and, what is more, trampled on the human rights and dignity of the people. That is why it is necessary for a Parliament which is so concerned with human rights and combating xenophobia and racism to call upon China to negotiate another statute recognising the rights of the Tibetans in full and genuinely guaranteeing the full autonomy of the Tibetan people. I would like to be totally clear, even at the risk of appearing antagonistic. We must guard against hypocrisy. It is, in fact, pointless to adopt a joint resolution full of good principles, fine words and indignation if, for economic and commercial reasons, maybe, we then allow the supreme Chinese authorities to be welcomed with the highest honours by our ministers or the mayors of the various European capitals, as is actually going to happen tomorrow in Rome, when Mr Rutelli, who is Mayor of Rome as well as a Member of the European Parliament, will officially receive the Chinese Prime Minister or, at any rate, a delegation.  If we continue to sacrifice principles and rights in the name of the economy, apart from making pious declarations of intent in Parliamentary debates it will be extremely difficult to find a genuine solution for the Tibetan people.

 Mr President, after years of confusion, it is time to clarify the system for recognising professional qualifications and diplomas, precisely in order to provide the European citizens with clear, transparent, and, most importantly, universally accessible laws. This is clearly a somewhat difficult undertaking for, apart from anything else, there are 14 directives in existence on the subject and each one has been amended several times. Moreover, the failures and delays of the Member States in complying with European legislation have all too often been justified by its complexity or by the difficulty of gaining access to information at European level. As the rapporteur points out, even lawyers have trouble. However, at the end of the day, the only people to pay the price for this situation are the citizens, especially young people who may well have invested time and energy in the certainty of obtaining results and official recognition and feel betrayed by the institutions. And the situation is all the more serious if we consider the unemployment levels in Europe.

 Mr President, the Schmitt report draws Parliament’s attention to the extremely topical issue of defining clear, common standards governing the right to asylum. This is necessary not only for legal and administrative reasons but also and especially in order to uphold the dignity of asylum seekers. Clear, well-defined rules governing the matter are also necessary in order to avoid the right to asylum being confused with the problem of immigration. I used the word ‘problem’ intentionally, for the very reason that the absence of an adequate immigration policy has meant that our citizens often perceive all forms of immigration as a problem, a burden and even a hazard, instead of as a social and economic resource and a source of cultural enrichment. In Italy, for example, unregulated or, even worse, illegal immigration is related to organised crime. In this confusion where illegal activity is ever increasing there are no rules and no certainties. In particular, the human rights of neither European citizens nor immigrants are genuinely being upheld. It is therefore urgent for us to define an immigration policy, and therefore also a reception policy and a migration flow control policy, a policy which takes into practical account the genuine existence of social phenomena and which refuses to be conditioned by ideologies. This is the framework within which the right to asylum must take its place: it is a sacrosanct right which every self-respecting civil society must uphold.

 Mr President, confronted with the burgeoning phenomenon of organised crime at international level, the Member States must surely cooperate with one another as much as possible. Indeed, they must set in place the institutional conditions needed to launch a tangible and efficient cooperation process in the field of law – a process that must nevertheless cover all the stages needed to prevent the untimely impositions that are detrimental to legitimate national prescriptions in the field of justice, over which Member States have sovereign powers, and above all to prevent impositions that result in riding roughshod over basic civil rights. We must therefore proceed with caution with regard to a document like the one from the Council which, as the rapporteur himself has underlined, now claims, after years of discussion, to have found a universal solution in the space of a few months. Furthermore – and I agree with the assessment made by Mr Di Pietro – the Council’s text would appear to be overladen with contradictions, inconsistent propositions and omissions. It is clear that the justice sector, more than any other, cannot be handled in an inconsistent or contradictory manner. It is the opinion of our Group that even the report, considered as a whole, would be the subject of much debate, notwithstanding the incorporation of certain corrective amendments that take into account the safeguarding of personal liberty and respect for national sovereignties. The report contains arguments that are too disparate, which do not link together smoothly, and everything thus hinges on approximations. We will, in conclusion, vote against this report, while stressing that the Europe to which we aspire is a Europe of rights and guarantees: rights and guarantees that call for gradual and responsible discussion, as well as very serious examination. We must first establish general rules and institutional certainties. Only then will we be able to institute actual conventions.

 Mr President, sadly, once again, Parliament is having to discuss the restructuring of companies in Europe. Yet again, workers are likely to lose their jobs. This time, I am referring to the workers of the company Goodyear in Cisterna di Latina. As has already been pointed out, in one month’s time, 600 people and as many families could be deprived of their sole source of income. Despite the commitment they have shown to the company and despite their high level of professionalism – which has made the Cisterna plant one of the most productive in Europe – these workers are likely to be removed from the production cycle, while Goodyear, after years of benefiting from state and European subsidies, is totally free to walk out. I do not think this is at all fair, either to the workers at the Cisterna plant or to all those Italian and European citizens whose taxes have, albeit indirectly, enabled Goodyear to benefit from the state aids I have just mentioned.  The European Commission and the Council must, at last, assume all the necessary responsibilities, both with regard to the adoption of a common position on the information and consultation of workers and with regard to Community and national aid, which must only be granted to companies who undertake to establish long-term agreements to protect jobs.  Today, we ask the Commission to start by protecting the workers at Goodyear in Cisterna, and therefore to put as much pressure as possible on the company for it to come to an agreement as soon as possible, thereby ensuring the continued existence and operation of the Cisterna plant. Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to remind the House that there is very little time available, and therefore that any measure – including those already cited by the Commission in its introductory report – which we adopt must have an immediate, timely effect.

 Madam President, allow me to remind you that tomorrow will be the second anniversary of the Cermis tragedy. Two years ago, in Cavalese in Italy, an American aeroplane from the Aviano NATO base cut through the cables of a cable car during a low-flying exercise which exceeded safe limits, causing the deaths of more than 20 Europeans. Since then, the victims’ families, who have not had the consolation of justice, since the pilot responsible has not faced criminal charges, have been awaiting solicitous financial compensation from the United States at the very least.  I therefore appeal to the President of this House and the President of the Commission for them to stand surety for immediate compensation from the U.S. authorities, and this is in order to uphold the rights of the victims’ families.

 Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work. Over the coming years, faced with the challenges of globalisation and eastward enlargement, Europe will, more than ever before, require appropriate detailed guidance on how to plan and revitalise its economy. To this end, Europe as a whole, and each Member State individually, will have to make optimum use of all available resources and capacities, including the Structural Funds. For this to be possible, what we need from the European Commission are not just good intentions, but clearer guidelines and a firm commitment to monitoring the way these resources are used by the Member States.  For example, in recent years Italy has had problems in utilising the Structural Funds, mainly because of excessive bureaucracy, insufficient information and a lack of involvement of economic and social operators at local level.  There are, therefore, two points to which I would like to draw the Commission’s attention. Firstly, we need to make the best possible use of consultation as a means of ensuring proper coordination and participation by all local and regional operators in decision-making, precisely so that imbalances and inequalities can be avoided. Secondly, a genuine effort is required to make administrative procedures simpler and more transparent, since, they are all too often unnecessarily lengthy and complicated, to the point of hindering access to the Funds. This is something about which European small and medium-sized businesses, in particular, tend to complain.  I will conclude, Mr President, by saying that the failure of the Commission’s communication to focus on territorial pacts and, especially, methods of combating unemployment among women and young people, is cause for serious concern.

 Mr President, as has already been said, unfortunately, overall, Seattle was not a great success: the only real participants were the protestors, who, while their demands were supported by many extremely valid grounds, wrongly thought that the failure of the Summit itself would constitute a victory, a solution to the serious problems in question. In reality, the problems and contradictions of the global economy are still there, unresolved and still relevant: doubts about genetically modified organisms, child labour, the negative social effects of unbridled, unregulated globalisation. But that is not all: perhaps these protests served as a pretext for the official participants at Seattle – those with the right to sit round the conference table – not to have to fully assume the political responsibility to negotiate, which, although certainly very difficult is absolutely necessary, precisely as regards social rights and safeguarding our citizens’ health. These are negotiations that cannot wait any longer.  Of course, we are dealing with a complicated process, but Europe has to be equal to the challenges facing it. Talks within the World Trade Organisation have to start up again, and Europe has to be very aware of its role, a role of balance and responsibility, with a view to globalisation with a human aspect that is open and welcomes changes and acceleration in the economy but is also able to safeguard equal employment opportunities, the environment and health.  Finally, Europe must not forget to defend our own specific differences, not just economic but also cultural and social, because globalisation that leads to uniformity, levelling out and exploitation must have no place at all in the European growth model.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I think that we need to congratulate Mrs Pack, the rapporteur, for her work on the second stage of the Socrates programme. I would also like to thank the whole of the European Parliament delegation which, with a lot of patience and determination, secured an increase in the financial provision of at least EUR 300 million. This is a valuable resource for our young people, who have great confidence in the educational and training potential of this programme.  I will take this opportunity though, to remind the House that whether or not Socrates will be completely successful depends largely on the publicity this programme will be given within the individual Member States and the speed of the selection process. Indeed, many European young people often complain of the difficulty of finding timely information on the programmes that concern them. More widespread information and less red tape will certainly ensure real equal opportunities and more democratic access to the programme. In this way, young people, above all, those least well-off and most disadvantaged will be able to consider Socrates as a chance for integration, for cultural enrichment and professional training, but above all, as a chance to have personal experiences and life experiences, in order to gain the flexibility and open-mindedness necessary to address, in the best way, employment challenges in the world of work: this is why SOCRATES is an important investment for the young people of Europe.

 Mr President, it is very important that we have finally succeeded in including explicit references to culture in the Treaty. Indeed, at this delicate stage for the European Union, while we begin to enlarge eastwards, while all the economic and financial changes linked to the creation of the single currency are already underway, we must not forget the value of culture, the specificity and diversity of European culture, its enhancement and its diffusion. Culture, which also means history, languages and traditions, must remain a fundamental and indispensable bond for European citizens. We must therefore welcome the new Culture 2000 programme, but reiterate some considerations which, moreover, most of my fellow Members have already done. Firstly, we need to encourage and stimulate the European citizens and European associations and small businesses in this sector to make as much use as possible of this programme, but avoid concentrating the meagre funds on only a few large events, to the advantage of a few privileged networks which, in the long run, as past experience has taught us, end up monopolising these funds. Secondly, in any case, we would need to make an effort to increase the funds laid down for this programme.  To conclude, Europe must not forget that investing in culture does not mean simply preserving a great legacy and our identity as Europeans, but also the creation of many new jobs. Mr President, I think that the European citizens are currently in great need of this.

 Mr President, the strengthening of the European Union cannot be achieved solely through the euro. Our young people must feel integrated, not separated by borders, and have a more open, free mentality. In short, they must gain that ability to adapt and that speed in cultural exchange, training and professional experience which are increasingly necessary elements in the society of the next millennium.  “Youth” is a programme which will be able to achieve these aims. Above all, it allows the least well-off and most disadvantaged young people to have experiences of other countries which could prove decisive when they enter the job market. It is therefore a priority to ensure, as highlighted by the rapporteur, a greater diffusion of the programme and to make sure that, in future, Community actions like this one will not remain a privilege for a minority because of a lack of information.  I fully agree with criticisms that the Council has not been willing to increase the budget, which is necessary for equal opportunities of access to the programme. Moreover, it is incredible that full protection of the participants cannot be ensured as far as social protection and medical assistance is concerned. To conclude, I would like to emphasise that in a society which is leaning towards telematics networks and the Internet, and which increasingly invests in their use, for communication, information and services, it is almost ridiculous that the Council has not accepted the amendments on the creation of an Internet site dedicated entirely to young people.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it really is very important that a debate is taking place on the Ustica massacre here today. It will take on particular importance if Parliament manages to exercise an appropriate political and practical role which will help shed light on this sombre event and bring justice for the 81 victims and their families who, for more than 19 years, have been waiting to find out what happened, why it happened, and who was responsible. I said that more than 19 years have passed and there have been several inquiries by the Italian magistracy, but not even the last inquiry overseen by Judge Priore, while very noteworthy, has provided truly satisfactory answers. Was it a missile launched during air combat which destroyed the aircraft or was it a bomb planted inside? Unfortunately, a great deal, indeed too much evidence has been concealed or destroyed and it would be an oversimplification to place the blame for this tragedy only on the top ranks of the army, who generally speaking, only follow orders. Obviously, the real blame lies elsewhere, in particular at the door of the high level Italian representatives of government and politicians of the time. What inconvenient facts, what political manoeuvrings were covered up in the interests of National Security? In fact there have been numerous unanswered questions regarding the complex international events of those years. On the one hand, the great world powers – USA and USSR – were at diplomatic breaking point, and on the other hand, there was a progressive deterioration in relations between the Atlantic Alliance and some Islamic countries, Libya in particular, while in Italy, the far left in particular, was continually calling into question Italy’s participation in NATO. Finally, what is the link between the Ustica massacre and the one that happened around a month later at Bologna train station?  We have tabled a motion for a resolution to underline the importance of these factors, factors which, however, were not mentioned once in the joint motion for a resolution. Nevertheless, while we consider that the joint motion for a resolution leans too far towards the air missile hypothesis rather than towards an internal bomb, and above all, while we believe this motion to be far too kind and diplomatic towards the Italian political authorities, we agree on the need to request the cooperation of all the Member States of the European Union in finally providing everything necessary for an appropriate and adequate detailed examination of the inquiries, so that those who did this, the instigators and the motives behind this absurd massacre can be identified.

Madam President, 
after employment, the most pressing issue that European citizens bring to the Community’s institutions is the security emergency which, because of its nature, cannot be solved by the Member States on an individual basis. We must commit ourselves fully to this issue, with the aim of strengthening the faith that the European citizens have in Parliament. However, I think that the idea of creating a Charter of Fundamental Citizens’ Rights does not go far enough. We already have a lot of written declarations which often are not implemented. What we really need is the will to use all the practical means necessary to ensure genuine co-operation on legal and police matters. I think that nowadays, the lack of a European strategy on immigration is unacceptable, with regard to dealing with both legal migration and illegal immigration  In conclusion, the concept of Europe as not only a single market and currency is very appealing, especially as an area of freedom, security and justice, but it is important for this challenge to become reality through progressively strengthening the Community institutions and developing the collaboration and co-operation between the Member States, rather than resorting to decisions taken by qualified majority, which in itself does not constitute the solution to the problems.

 Mr President, as an MEP for Sicily, I would like to express my satisfaction and appreciation, and thank my fellow Members who, like me, voted for the amendment this morning, which has shown how, in the end, common sense prevailed when faced with the willingness shown by the European Council. There is no doubt that the overwhelming majority of Parliament has today concluded the procedure at second reading by accepting the common position. Of course, we were once again saddened at the attempt by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, accompanied in this action by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left and by some Italian left-wing democrats – with an amendment which, fortunately, only received about 50 votes – to abort the continuation of the plan for the Messina bridge on the trans-European route from Berlin to Palermo. If the amendment had been passed, over and above the very serious detrimental effect, which was mentioned at the end of the procedure, the Italian Government – which has already launched the process to begin construction of the bridge – would not have received the 10% contribution from the Union’s funds, as provided for in the Treaty. Even more than the sum involved, there is obviously the political significance that such a vote would have had. The opposing view, taken by those against the bridge over the Straits, did however – if I may say so – seem to be misleading right from the start and counter, in particular, to the legitimate interests of Sicily and Southern Italy. We cannot hope for the development of these regions of Southern Europe and then deny them the right to have essential infrastructure. Building the bridge will of course not resolve all of the problems associated with the socio-economic deterioration of Sicily, but it will finally allow the trans-European road and rail networks to be completed and it will enable the island to play a more competitive role in the area of free trade planned for 2010.

 Mr President, I have always held that the degree of civilisation of a people can also be measured by how much they respect animals. In this regard, I should like to thank Mr Maat for his excellent report, which is a move in this direction, and for the improvements made in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which, in relation to the Commission proposal, help to give a more civilised image of our continent in the field of protecting animal rights. Of course, it is not just a matter of image – of projecting a more humane image outside the confines of the European Union – but it is also, and I might say above all, a matter of substance. Some aspects of the problem involve animal health, as has already been mentioned. Let me underline a few of them. First of all, the maximum length of time spent on the road: given that livestock should be moved as little as possible, it would be appropriate to limit transport to eight hours or 500 km per day at most. That would apply both to slaughter animals and to those intended for fattening. As regards the transport of animals for breeding, shows and competitions, however, transport for more than eight hours should require the use of special vehicles. What does ‘special’ mean? It means that these vehicles should be fitted with equipment to measure the temperature and humidity in the livestock compartment, and there should be a forced ventilation system that operates when the vehicle is stationary. Finally, in addition to the quite reasonable requirement of special training for drivers of vehicles intended for the transport of livestock, because we know that inappropriate driving inevitably causes the animals serious and unnecessary damage and suffering, I should also like to underline the need for an official veterinarian to be present while the animals are being loaded. This is to ensure that the rules for transport – the fitness of the animals to travel, and the minimum space allowances – are observed. For this reason we particularly support Amendments Nos 121, 122, 123 and 124.

Madam President, Commissioner Fischler, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I would first like to congratulate Mr Varela on his excellent work. My group does, of course, fully support his report. I would like to highlight two points that we consider to be particularly sensitive: consumer health and employment in the fisheries sector and in the tuna processing sector. After years of tests, scientific analyses and expert opinions, we all know that fish consumption is on the increase: fish is healthy, the consumption of fish products – either fresh, smoked, frozen or canned fish – by European citizens increases year after year, and is also due to several effective advertising and information campaigns. We also know only too well that in the Member States various requirements, especially those relating to health and hygiene, must, rightly, be met in order to market canned fish products produced in Europe. In order to adequately protect consumer health, the same requisites should also be extended to products from third countries where, unfortunately, health regulations in this area are often too lenient or even, in some cases, completely lacking. We therefore support and strongly insist on the requests made in points 8 and 10 of the motion for a resolution, which point out, respectively, the need to intensify inspections on third-country products – which are, moreover, already provided for by Directive 91/493/EEC – and the need to create Community laboratories to uphold quality, food safety and consumer safety against what is known as food piracy. The – equally important – issue of competitiveness and, therefore of employment, in the tuna fishing sector and the canned tuna industry, is linked to the sensitive issue of protecting consumer health. 
If, in order to adequately protect the consumer, certain requirements are imposed, including those that I just mentioned relating to health, which involves a considerable amount of money being invested, and if the same requirements are not applied to products from third countries then, with the inevitable entry into the Community market of products at very low prices compared to European products, then competitiveness in the fishing industry and the European canned tuna industry will be unfairly harmed. There is a grave risk of job losses in a sector that has already been hit hard in recent years by a worrying socio-economic crisis. As a result, we would point out the need to support, with every possible regulatory and economic means, the sector in question, which is an important source of employment also in other Mediterranean regions, including Sicily, where fishing and bluefin tuna processing has for centuries provided economic support to a considerable percentage of the active population. With this message of hope we also want to see an assurance of something tangible.

 Mr President, our vote in favour of the solidarity fund to cover the requirements of countries and regions struck by natural disasters comes with two hopes or two recommendations. First, we hope that with the forthcoming 2004 financial year the fund may be suitably expanded, or at least index-linked, as Mr Turchi assured me he would propose; since the fund is so meagre, it is completely inadequate to meet the needs of the recipient Member States, as has already been seen this year. With regard to our second hope, setting up the fund is a first, concrete step forward, but it is not enough in itself. It is not enough to think about funding countries struck by natural disasters if we do not also think about a serious forecasting and prevention policy. We believe the time has come for the Union to think of setting up a European Civil Protection Agency with the remit of coordinating and managing risk prevention and emergencies among Member States. Recent painful examples in Europe remind us that catastrophes and disasters can be supranational, and yet one cannot rely on the generosity of volunteers or the competence and resources of just the country immediately affected. Europe should be able to have adequate human, financial and technical resources available, ready to take prompt action. This may be an ambitious objective, but it is not unachievable. After all, every citizen, and not just every European citizen, has a right to safety that I believe is physiological rather than constitutional. We therefore bring the problem to the attention of the Commission and Parliament in the hope that we shall not remain its only proponents.

Mr President, I believe that economic and social cohesion will make or break the future of the European Union, the Union of 25. Enlargement will reveal dramatically once again the complete lack of practical responses to an objective on which the European Union and the Treaties preceding it were founded. We need only to think of a survey conducted a few years ago, which showed that Lombardy was one of the top 20 wealthiest regions while Sicily, my homeland, was in seventy-seventh place. This shows just how far we are in practice from the objectives of achieving a proper, sound, tangible economic and social cohesion policy. There has been no strategy, no will to take practical measures, no polycentric Europe. Southern Italy and the Mediterranean have been left on the fringe of a genuine growth and stability strategy. The problems are not only due to geographical remoteness, which would, alone, be grounds for huge-scale, effective measures, but there is also an incredible lack of infrastructure, a lack of planning in the areas of training, technological innovation research and improving the universities in marginal regions. Therefore, we need to preserve the European Union’s minimum intervention threshold, we need to stem the flow of people leaving mountain areas, we need to intervene in disadvantaged islands, which are disadvantaged not only because of their distance from mainland Europe but also because of inherent problems to which Europe must find an immediate solution.

 It must be clarified once and for all what is meant by disadvantaged when the term is applied to an island as such and not just to the outermost regions. This is a concept which has already been enshrined in Declaration No 30, annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam, although I regret to say that the different translations of the document are extremely misleading. One way of boosting the development of structurally disadvantaged regions could be to make greater and more effective use of the Structural Funds. This depends, not least, on the provision of much more information, a more streamlined, flexible procedure and a more rigorous assessment of the quality of projects and interventions. I would therefore like to express my appreciation of the Pomés Ruiz report, which has the merit of portraying the light and the shade – more shade than light – of a situation which, with the basic premises having been identified, now calls for financial commitment, more courage and political will following specific recognition of ongoing structural disadvantages, the nature of which has thus far been wholly unclear. Hence the importance of a substantial change, of acting upon this recognition through the convergence of other policies. I would cite, in particular, the need to activate the appropriate derogations provided for in Article 87 of the EC Treaty on state aid, which are essential if we are to close an economic divide which has grown up 
and is the result, as well as of geographical handicaps, of the short-sightedness of the ruling classes, including the Community, over a number of decades.

 Mr President, Commissioner, in the European Year of People with Disabilities, the European Union has the chance to provide a great opportunity for making up for a huge amount of lost time. Politics certainly cannot give back sight to the blind or speech to the dumb or mobility to the sick, but it can and, at all events, must enable people with disabilities to bear the difficulties of everyday life with less physical and mental effort and thus to give them the chance to lead an even more dignified life. Sometimes – as we know from personal experience – it does not take much to give them this chance: removing structural barriers, building according to certain criteria which take into account the needs of a section of our people who have difficulties. Thus, politics has the task of giving the issue due consideration: this is not charity or a work of mercy but recognition of the right to the best life possible. Where, then, a physical disability goes hand in hand with a state of financial need or even extreme poverty – and that is the most common thing in the world – the situation becomes even more tragic. The figures recorded in the report are alarming: there are 600 million people with disabilities, many of which come from the developing world. We can therefore imagine their quality of life. The Union for Europe of the Nations Group, on behalf of which I am speaking, is aware that there is still much which can and must be done to address a major issue which affects millions of families in the world, who are waiting for politics and politicians to respond with practical measures to a topical problem which continues to be urgent. However, the group acknowledges the Commission’s sound proposals and endorses the conclusions drawn by the rapporteur, Mrs Lynn, in her report. We will therefore vote for the resolution, which has the merit of giving many unfortunate people to whom fate has dealt a bitter blow the right to hope once again.

 Mr President, the Community Action Plan for fisheries in the Mediterranean Sea presented by the Commission is an initial major step towards sustainable management of the sector. However, what we have here are a series of good intentions which, although we do not fully support them, need to be implemented with some urgency. A number of points, rightly emphasised in Mr Lisi’s report – and I would like to congratulate Mr Lisi – are particularly important. The Commission rightly considers that one of the key elements to bear in mind, with a view to a sustainable approach to fisheries in the Mediterranean Basin, is the specific nature of the Mediterranean itself. Quite right. I would point out that the principal areas of reproduction and repopulation of many – not all – species of fish in the Mediterranean are concentrated in the coastal areas. On behalf of the UEN Group, I can therefore only welcome the European Commission’s proposal providing for delegation to the Member States of responsibility for managing coastal fishing. I would also point out that another specific characteristic of the Mediterranean Sea – a relatively small, warm sea compared to the northern seas – is the fact that few single-species schools of fish are formed. Precisely for this reason – and here I am disassociating myself from the Commission’s proposal – I feel that the Mediterranean fisheries system does not lend itself to the effective implementation of TACs and quotas. We support the Commission’s line on enhancing and improving scientific research in the Mediterranean and involving fishermen’s associations in key decisions in the fisheries sector: these are points of primary importance which I am afraid it is not possible to go into in more depth here. I would, however, like to highlight the excellent proposal to allow professional organisations to participate in the future Advisory Council for the Mediterranean which we hope to see established. In conclusion, still on the subject of the specific nature of the Mediterranean, I would like to emphasise a point which is genuinely important and crucial for the sector’s economy, a point which certainly applies to Italy in any case. We must make every endeavour to support the small-scale fishing, the traditional fishing which, in addition to providing a vital source of employment for countless families, is the guardian of an age-old tradition which Europe must protect and safeguard.

 Madam President, I will start by saying that I do not belong to the cross-party group of animal rights extremists either by nature or by inclination, I have never been a vegetarian and I am not one of those people who likes to sleep with their dog on their bed. I firmly believe that we are not bound to love animals but that we do have a duty to respect them. This, too, is a way of measuring the degree of civilisation of a people. The almost complete lack of attention on the part of many of the Member States to the need for proper implementation of Directive 86/609 on animals used for experimental purposes, the appalling shortcomings of the directive itself and the delay in realising the need for it to be updated are confirmation of at least two things: firstly, that animal welfare is a taboo subject in this wealthy, opulent Europe, and secondly, that international economic lobbies are still succeeding in preventing free, political debate on certain subjects. Admitting, as I do, that scientific progress includes animal experimentation does not mean allowing the Member States to flout and repeatedly violate standards and to subject laboratory animals to unnecessary suffering. Therefore, the European Commission must speed up its reform process in this area and step up its control and monitoring of non-compliant States, and Parliament, without allowing there to be tension between its head and its heart, must summon up the courage, with the resolution before us today, to take up arms and wage ideological war against the egoism and evil ways of mankind and, without jeopardising scientific research, confirm our unquestionable duty to respect defenceless animals.

 Mr President, since the last debate on the situation in the Middle East, which took place in this House in May, the political horizon has become more than disheartening. Less than an hour’s flight away from my native Sicily, the tragedy of two peoples with which we share friendship, history, culture and trade is continuing along its inexorable course. President Arafat is still enclosed in his headquarters, which have been reduced to a miserable cement hut, deprived of freedom of movement. Islamic terrorists continue to stain the cities of Israel with blood, striking at the civilian people without discrimination. We all agree in Europe on the need to create two free, sovereign states, and we all agree that this is the only way to restore peace in the Holy Land. How much credibility can Europe claim, though? My countrymen ask me: ‘How much credibility can you expect to have, as Members of the European Parliament, how can you expect us to become genuine supporters of Europe if Europe continues to sit still, defenceless, in the face of genocide which is taking place only a few miles away from us? How can you fail to convene a major international conference involving the European Union, the United States, Russia and the United Nations, as called for by the High Representative for CFSP, to discuss the Palestinian question and the creation of two States?’ If economic measures are not matched by political, diplomatic action, the European Union will not succeed in freeing the two peoples from the tyranny of hatred. We must ensure that the European Union both embodies and is seen to embody genuine practical action, unity and accord.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent work. This document gives a clear picture of the difficulties European cinema has been striving painfully to overcome for many years now. I would like to focus briefly on two of the many points contained in the motion for a resolution which caught my attention. Firstly, I fully support the call for the funds made available to the film-making industry to be increased. In effect, considering that the cinema has become an important part of our cultural heritage – cinemas have been more popular than bookshops for many years now in Europe – and given the high potential for employment in this sector, there is no doubt that greater Community financial aid would facilitate its development. And this is precisely one of the problematic areas. Without incentives and investment, there is no growth or impetus, and there is no quality either. Europe has been overrun with film productions which are foreign to our cultural identity and often of dubious quality for too long now. That is not to question the existence of the opportunity or rather the need for cinema to encourage awareness of diversities, of course, but I do feel that Europe needs to protect and encourage its own film heritage. If, in addition, we consider the competition which came from television during the 1970s, it is not hard to see why hundreds, thousands of cinemas have been closed for so long. Secondly, I fully support item 18, which refers explicitly to the restoration and protection of the European film heritage. We do indeed need to encourage public institutions, local authorities and cultural associations to search for old and short films and to restore film material, thus ensuring that they are preserved and are available to the public. There are very few film libraries in Europe which are worthy of that name and genuinely properly equipped and efficient. They often suffer from miserly public contributions from the governments of the Member States. Well then, the European Union cannot remain insensitive to this additional urgent need if we genuinely want to preserve the past heritage and guarantee the future of cinema.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although I fully support the conclusions of the extraordinary European Summit in Brussels, I can only condemn the amount of time it is taking Europe to make a practical response to terrorism top priority. It took thousands of deaths for us to be able to come to an agreement on establishing the European search and arrest warrant; it took thousands of innocent victims for us to be able to agree on defining a common strategy to combat terrorism. Only now is the Union being called upon to participate more actively in the prevention and stabilisation of regional conflicts. Where was Europe – we wonder – when the Mediterranean sea was seen as the border between two opposing worlds, between Islamic fundamentalism and religious tolerance? Will the Union please realise, at last, that we can only define a European security and defence policy if we take the Mediterranean as our starting point. I live on the farthest edge of European territory in the Mediterranean, just a few metres away from the most advanced NATO base – the Sigonella base – and a few minutes away from the Middle East by ‘plane. I know how willing the moderate Arab and Muslim world is to cooperate; I met the mayor of Jerusalem and the mayor of Gaza last year. Well then, I am convinced that it is now up to Europe genuinely to start to turn what have hitherto just been good intentions into practical action.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome the Council's decision to include in the common position the essential points of the amendments adopted by this House. We of the UEN Group consider particularly important the fact that the Council, like the European Parliament, has endorsed the principle that the system for inspecting certain potentially dangerous ships, an extended inspection to take place annually, should be mandatory rather than discretionary. Who knows how many environmental disasters we could have averted for our marine life, our coasts, our fishing fleets and our tourist operators? Who knows how many oil tanker wrecks, how many deaths, how much serious pollution we would have avoided in our continent if proper inspections had been carried out? Let it be quite clear that these inspections should not just assess the technical aspects of vessels but also respect for social standards on crew living and working conditions and crew training as well. I would point out that 70-75% of accidents are caused by the human factor. I would like to end by saying we welcome the fact that the Council has recognised the importance of installing voyage data recorders, better known as black boxes, on board vessels. In our view, this should not just be an essential condition for entry into European Union ports but also an effective way of applying one of the underlying principles of Community environmental policy: ‘Polluter pays’.

 Mr President, the excessive optimism in the wake of Stockholm and the numerous objectives on the agenda do not reflect the bitter, discouraging reality. It is not clear, now the Stockholm Summit is over, how Europe intends to deal rationally and practically with the extremely serious issue of our ageing population and the resulting decline in the work force, while, at the same time, ensuring that it maintains a sufficient standard of living. The outrageous on-going lack of social service provision, the discriminatory treatment of pensioners, the poverty zones which are becoming increasingly common throughout Europe, require clear, courageous choices to be made. In other words, the single currency will not suffice without reform of the financial market. It is pointless to attempt to achieve a stable European Union without a genuine, effective foreign policy. As President Prodi rightly said, Europe's credibility is at stake: too many promises have been made and not kept after recent European summits; there have been too many dashed hopes. Either we do act resolutely right now, or Stockholm will go down in history as yet another pointless stage in the long, exhausting attempt to produce the promised Europe for the Europeans.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the point raised by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and Mr Segni on the status of the islands which are part of the European Union is an old, controversial issue which clearly cannot be limited to purely linguistic points. The issue is a political one and must be tackled and resolved once and for all as such. I find it difficult to understand how it is that the Treaty can call for social and economic cohesion to be achieved if, years on, we have still not succeeded in eliminating the ambiguity of the treatment reserved for the islands, which is due to the contradiction between Article 158 of the Treaty and Declaration 30 on the island regions, annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam. Can we not, at last, put an end to this ridiculous line of reasoning which decrees that some islands shall be disadvantaged and others privileged solely on the basis of how far they are from land? I represent the constituency which contains the two largest islands in the Mediterranean – Sicily and Sardinia – and I can say in all honesty that both islands are severely disadvantaged in structural terms precisely because they are islands. I will end by calling upon Parliament to make every effort to ensure that the Intergovernmental Conference restores to the islands their right to grow and develop.

 Mr President, the Katiforis report has been amended according to the proposals, notably, of the Europe for a Union of Nations Group, which were adopted in the Committee on Fisheries and, in my opinion, this version is an improvement on the original. I would like to touch briefly on these amendments. With regard to the installation of satellite fishing vessel monitoring systems, we feel that it is important for them to be installed on as many vessels as possible, although small vessels should not be compelled to carry them, of course, as investment and running costs would be disproportionately high compared to the value of the catches they make, and also in view of the fact that, in any case, satellite fishing vessel monitoring systems are not suitable or efficient for coastal fishing vessels. We welcome the report’s rejection of the idea originally put forward by the rapporteur of creating a taxation system, as this would be impossible to implement and enforce for all the Member States. Moreover, with regard to the protection of coastal areas, which are the main breeding and spawning grounds for many species of fish, we hope for tighter controls, which, in our opinion, should be accompanied by penal sanctions for throwing unwanted catches back into the sea. In effect, this practice is responsible for a high death rate and is therefore incompatible with good fisheries management. More specifically, with regard to fisheries management in the Mediterranean, we are all aware that 
fishing in the Mediterranean is not governed by provisions on TACs. And just as well, in my view. As you may be aware, in contrast with the cold Northern seas, the Mediterranean is a small, warm sea where there are very few, if any, schools of only one species of fish. In our opinion, the possibility put forward in the explanatory statement of this report of setting TACs in the Mediterranean is therefore inappropriate.  Lastly, we would vote for the amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left. We do believe that it is extremely important to give financial support to conventional fishing and craft trades and to boost the income of fishermen during periods when moratoria on fishing are in force: in short, we must make it possible to carry on a major, responsible economic activity while still ensuring proper respect for the environment.

 Commissioner, I believe that this issue holds particular importance within the Member State because the Italian Government’s attitude is not fair but clearly discriminatory. Recently, the Italian Government denied the request made by a clearly tourist-oriented local authority, Taormina, to establish a gaming house and, at the same time, it authorised Venice casino to open a branch in Mestre. According to the Commission, does all of this not constitute clear discrimination within a Member State, and moreover, does it not force the inhabitants who would like to play in central and southern regions to go to other Member States – there are hundreds of gaming houses in Europe – rather than staying and playing in Northern Italy, which does not hold great appeal?

Madam President, the new proposal for a regulation on the common organisation of the markets in the fisheries and aquaculture sector puts forward new and interesting aspects that need to be thoroughly considered, which I cannot, unfortunately, discuss in this forum. Being the representative of the largest island in the Mediterranean – Sicily – and head of the province of Catania, where large numbers of people work in the fishing industry, I would have been in a good position to talk about day-to-day experiences.  Today though, I would like to make some constructive criticisms, which I hope can contribute to improving the proposal for a regulation in question. As far as consumer information is concerned, I fully agree with the Commission when it proposes compulsory labelling indicating the designation of the species, the production method as well as the catch area. Nevertheless, with the aim of making consumers more responsible and making the market more transparent, other details should be included, for example, the minimum legal size, which would allow fishery resources to be respected. As far as producers’ organisations are concerned, it is true that we need to make them more responsible, as regards both the organisation of the market and the efficient management of resources; however, it would be appropriate – and in this respect I stress the relevance of Amendment No 67, tabled by my political group – for the Member States to be able to grant additional aid to producers’ organisations that develop measures which valorise the species caught and measures to adapt supply to demand through structural actions of the FIFG. In view of the fact that – and it has been reaffirmed here this morning – according to data provided by the Commission, 60% of fishery products consumed in the European Union are imported, we should support aquaculture, which constitutes a major economic opportunity for maritime communities, in a substantial and comprehensive manner. Often, people do not enter this sector due to a lack of knowledge.  Finally, I would like to conclude by thanking Mrs Fraga Estévez for upholding the amendments tabled by the UEN Group in the Committee on Fisheries.

 Mr President, once again, a few weeks after the debate on extending the SOCRATES programme to young people in Turkey, Parliament is going back to addressing the controversial issue of relations between the European Union and Turkey. This time, instead of culture, the nature of the European intervention is intended to support the social and economic development of the Mediterranean country and, for the umpteenth time, the question that we are all silently asking ourselves remains: can, and indeed should, the European Union in any way support a State that is geographically close, if not contiguous, surrounded by the same sea that washes upon the coasts of Southern Europe, even if that State appears extremely distant as regards respect for human rights? We are disappointed to note that since 1996, the year when the Aegean Sea crisis led the European Community to block the agreement on the Customs Union with Turkey, no headway has been made towards obtaining total respect for civil rights and the protection of minorities. While the Turkish Government has made some half-hearted attempts in recent years, the recent death sentence placed on the Kurdish leader, Mr Öçalan, has made any possible political rapprochement
 between Turkey and the European Union more remote. And yet, as we have maintained several times in this Chamber, the process of a community’s democratic growth also occurs through its economic and social development. To deny the financial aid proposed by the Commission for the next three years for the development of the Customs Union would, especially at this tragic time when this Mediterranean country is on its knees following a terrible catastrophe, contribute to exacerbating a downward spiral with unimaginable consequences to Turkey.  To conclude, the Italian delegation from Alleanza Nazionale
 thinks it more sensible to have a carefully considered acceptance of cooperation with Turkey, subordinating it to specific, tangible actions to bring its government into line with western European democracies. Democracy has a price, Mr President: asking Turkey to pay it is an act not of weakness, but of great responsibility.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the Italian delegation from Alleanza Nazionale
 is fully in favour of Turkey being included among the beneficiary countries of the Youth and SOCRATES programmes. This is not just a deserved tribute to culture, but it is also an objective political assessment which springs, in particular, from the knowledge that we have a State – Turkey – as an interlocutor, which is still a long way from fully upholding human rights and the principles of freedom and democracy which the European Unions is based on. And it is for this precise reason that we must stimulate and encourage full involvement of the young people of that country in a sound policy of exchanges, mobility and meeting the other young people of Europe.  Youth has always been the first to long for novelty, change and growth – even cultural growth – of a country. The young are an extremely efficient means of transmitting sound values, characterised by democracy. The European Parliament has already done well at first reading – and here I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Gargani – in saying that it will allow Turkey to take part in the exchanges envisaged by the two programmes. Besides, to deny this chance would mean increasing the isolation of that Mediterranean State from a Europe which has to seek dialogue, especially with those, as in this case, young people, who cannot be expected to take the blame for something that is not their fault, but which is the fault of a government which we still have our reservations about. Therefore, allowing Turkey access to the SOCRATES and Youth programmes does not confer legitimacy on a State that has not yet shown concrete evidence of maturity with regard to the rights of minorities, but it does contribute to helping young people to accelerate the slow and difficult process of achieving this.

 Mr President, the agreement reached with South Africa undoubtedly constitutes an overall step forward on a political level for the European Union. In this sense, we should feel particularly satisfied. But we do not think the same can be said on a trade level. This agreement is somewhat bewildering, leaves questions unanswered, and still has grey areas. Many organisations have been unhappy during these five long, tiring years, organisations which are usually involved in the processes of development in Third World countries. Moreover, different interpretations and opinions have been expressed by Parliament which wanted an agreement with conditions closer to those of the Lomé Convention, and the Commission itself wanted, how shall we say, an agreement with more conditions attached. In our opinion, this is an inconsistent agreement. What we really needed were separate agreements where we could work with equal dignity and equal responsibilities. However, where this balance could not be achieved, we should have had calmer and certainly more analytical talks. The European Union, for example, has recognised safeguard clauses for agriculture in South Africa, and also for sectors competing with the European economy. 75% of South African agricultural products will benefit from facilitated access on to our markets and, in return, South Africa has taken – we think we can say this in good faith – rigid positions of outright refusal and which are, in certain aspects, incomprehensible. I am referring in particular to fish and wine. European countries have asked for access to South African waters to be regulated, despite the price concessions on South African exports of fish products, against the wishes of that country. South Africa uses European designations for its own products in our markets and in third countries’ markets in return for financial help for our sector. All this seems excessive and irrational. So we, the delegation of Alleanza Nazionale
, believe we must vote against. We repeat, though, that in the future we are very willing to support the long and difficult process of growth and development in South Africa in a way that does not create injustice or unfairness.

Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I was the co-rapporteur for the tobacco part of this important report on the reform of the common organisation of the markets in certain Mediterranean goods. As you know, the aim of the European Commission, which it stated explicitly, is to end the production of tobacco in Europe. This is the first case of forced elimination of a product with historic roots in our continent and which, moreover, is not experiencing a market failure. I would like to point out here the main and most obvious consequences in the event that the Commission’s proposal is approved. The consumption of tobacco products would not fall and there would be no beneficial effect on the fight against smoking which we all support. There would be no beneficial effect on Member States’ tax takings, which in the European Union total between EUR 15 and 65 million a year just in terms of final consumption taxes on tobacco products. There would be a significant worsening of the European Union’s trade balance following increased imports and reduced exports, with a deficit of more than EUR 800 million a year, equivalent to current Community spending on aid for tobacco producers. Four hundred and ninety thousand people would lose their jobs, in terms of workers in the industry and 10 000 holding owners who, leaving aside the temporary receipt of a payment decoupled from production, would in any case lose their jobs as the lack of economically viable agricultural alternatives in tobacco-producing areas has been amply demonstrated; there would therefore be multitudes of newly unemployed people in the European regions which already have the highest unemployment rates of the current 15 Member States of the Union, and the same would happen in the tobacco-producing regions of the ten new acceding countries, also in view of the fact that over 50% of workers in the European processing industry are women. Other consequences would be: the closure of hundreds of European companies involved in the primary processing industry and ancillary activities 

whose existence depends on local availability of the agricultural raw material, with a consequent massive decrease in the taxes paid by the companies and their employees and an even more severe deficit in terms of social security contributions; vast rural areas of the poorest regions of Europe would turn to desert, considering that 80% of European tobacco is grown in Objective 1 areas; there would be a general impoverishment of local systems where the production and processing of tobacco is highly concentrated, which in many cases forms the backbone on which a complex economic and social system is grounded and which currently provides the populations with dignified living conditions. For the reasons and arguments briefly set out so far, clearly approval of the Commission proposal would, apart from anything else, run counter to the aims of the CAP laid down by Article 33 of the Treaty, which deliberately is not cited as the legal basis of the proposed reform. I would conclude with an appeal to all my fellow MEPs, in particular those Members from the central and northern European regions since, as we know, tobacco is only produced in certain very specific areas of southern Europe.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the Commission’s legislative proposal contains elements of reform of the common agricultural policy which we feel give some cause for concern. Total decoupling, proposed by the Commission, will lead to widespread abandonment of production, particularly in disadvantaged areas or areas classed as marginal, and cannot on its own, in any case, provide an exhaustive response to the need for substantial CAP reform. Indeed, although it gives us more room for manoeuvre in WTO negotiations, total decoupling of production aid could, in the long term, lead to the dismantling of all market management mechanisms. We consider reform to be necessary, but it must be carried out with due regard for the goals laid down in the Treaties and for the principles of quality, environmental protection and, above all, employment. With a view to increasing employment, Member States must be given the tangible possibility of making employment a criterion in allocating a quota of the direct aid provided under the first pillar. In any case, we feel that preserving our farming system and fostering a future of security and dignity for our farmers must continue to be priorities, and we hope that it will be precisely these priorities which will influence any WTO negotiations, not vice versa
. For all these reasons, we believe that gradual, vertical decoupling of aid is possible, with a view to gradually limiting the application of the measure to a few sectors. It is far too early to extend decoupling to the animal-rearing sector, rice and durum wheat, considering, not least, the definitive nature of the measure. Then we cannot endorse the proposed differences in aid and we believe that money saved through modulation must be channelled principally into preserving rural development measures which include, not least, support for quality, with no distinction made between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged areas. These are the main reasons why we have tabled a number of amendments on behalf of our group, amendments which I hope will be accepted by the House. We have also, on behalf of the UEN Group, tabled a number of amendments seeking to introduce a more balanced system of aid to the nut sector, a system which, taking into account the different production situations in the Union, establishes a fairer distribution of support between the different Member States and more aid per hectare than was originally proposed by the Commission. We welcome the introduction of a distinct animal-rearing sector, with the goal of preserving traditional rearing methods and the use thereof in the territory. We will firmly support all the genuinely important amendments which, like those tabled by our group, seek to establish a system of special benefits for young farmers with a view to facilitating access for new generations to production activities. Lastly, as regards the dairy sector, we believe that it is desirable to move on from the quota system and that, 20 years on from the adoption of the temporary quota regime, it is now time to bring about an appropriate transition to normal market dynamics through a conclusive process with a reasonably short timeframe. In any case, we believe that the agreement in principle achieved on the key principles of the reform could serve as a sound basis for the future Council agreement.

 Mr President, the accession of the new Member States will expand Europe’s borders further, in that the Union will exert even greater influence over the continent, with the development of proximity policies which will create new potential partners which might become new Member countries in the future, as has happened in the case of the current accession countries. We find it hard, however, to imagine enlarging Europe even further without launching a debate which is now urgent: ultimately, how wide can Europe’s borders stretch? If we look southwards, towards the African shores of the Mediterranean, we see situations which have always been such as to make it clear that those countries cannot share development criteria, ideologies or political or religious beliefs with Europe, except, perhaps, Libya and Israel. If we look eastwards, we might consider granting membership to the Republics of Ukraine and Georgia. The same may be said of Norway, to the North, while, to the West, the Atlantic is in itself already a border. What are the widest borders that we can consider if we are not to drown the Union in an area of free trade, given the need to have a Union which does not go under whenever it has to address major international issues, as, I am sad to say, has been the case in recent days? The debate on which countries will be destined to become part of the Union and with which countries we should just form preferential cooperation relations will have to be addressed very carefully, given that cooperation cannot concern trade measures alone but must cover relations on sensitive issues such as respect for human rights and the control of migration flows too.

 I want to congratulate the rapporteur and the members of the Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth Disease on the excellent work they have done together. This is an important report because it endorses some firm points of reference in the problematic area of the prevention of this terrible disease. First and foremost in that it calls for emergency vaccinations to be made a priority to control any future spread of the disease, in addition, of course, to calling for a ban on imports from third countries in which foot and mouth disease is endemic and for much more decisive measures to combat illegal meat imports, which we believe are the most likely cause of the entry of the disease into the European Union. Secondly in that the report urges the European Union to change its current policy of vaccination being a last resort. In the event of any future outbreak of the disease, vaccination with a view to keeping the animals alive must be considered right from the outset, along with the immediate need to slaughter the animals in the infected farms and avoid contacts which are widely known to be dangerous. The Community should be able to play a fundamental role in defining the strategy for controlling foot and mouth disease. Indeed, we support the call for a shift of emphasis in European Union policy away from purely commercial considerations. (Text abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s proposal on the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy is worrying in a number of respects in terms of the preservation and future development of European farming. We are concerned, in particular, at the proposal to make heavy cuts in direct payments, in that decoupling direct payments from production will not guarantee farmers protection from price fluctuations and will not boost their competitiveness on the international market. Not to mention the fact that the Commission is proposing to turn intervention systems into mere safety nets, without providing for sufficiently comprehensive external protection. Quite apart from the fact that this is extremely dangerous, it means that the stability of a multifunctional European model of agriculture cannot be guaranteed. Moreover, the compulsory modulation of direct payments, as proposed by the Commission, could, in the attempt to release funds for rural development, cause further damage to the COMs in the most vulnerable and weakest sectors. We certainly support multifunctional agriculture and the development of the second pillar of the CAP, but we believe that this goal can be achieved more gradually. Given that compulsory modulation cannot be the only means of funding of rural development in the long term, it will be necessary to release resources from other budget headings, but we feel that this must not be to the detriment of the COMs. If enlargement and the new economic situation make cuts necessary, these cuts must not be to the detriment of the very sectors and small farmers at risk, who are already in great difficulties now, for otherwise, paradoxically, we may well find our countryside full of people fleeing the towns, certainly not young farmers. This is not the kind of rural development we want. We consider excessive the Commission’s proposal to cut payments to producers in many sectors – particularly the rice, nuts and durum wheat sectors – and animal husbandry. We are therefore opposed to the Commission proposal overall and we can only welcome the decision taken by the Heads of State and Government at the Brussels Summit of 24 and 25 October last to leave the Berlin Summit agreement and the budget headings unchanged until 2006. We welcome the fact that the summit conclusions have temporarily reassured the producers and the markets of the Member States, making the possibility of a complete review and therefore distortion of the fundamental principles of the CAP less likely. We also welcome the schedule decided upon by the summit to be followed until 2013, although it is quite clear that CAP-related budget and resource management decisions will be taken by the 25 countries together after 2006, that is with the participation of the new Member States. In this respect, we hope for a positive outcome to a necessary consultation process, and we hope equally that the new Member States will exercise the same pragmatism as that displayed by the Heads of State and Government at Brussels and accept the recent proposal of the European Council. More specifically, however, as regards the text of the resolution to be put to the vote tomorrow, I must stress that, although it does moderate or enhance some of the Commission’s proposals in a number of respects, there are certain elements that we cannot endorse, particularly since it supports the principle of introducing a new model of support based on a system in which income support is decoupled from production, it is in favour of phasing-out direct payments, it supports the principle of compulsory modulation and since entire sectors – such as the rice, nuts, milk and animal husbandry sectors – are disregarded. These are the main reasons for our opposition to the text.

 Madam President, although there is eight times as much wealth in the world as there was in 1960, I am sad to say that, even today, one in two human beings still lives on less than a dollar a day, one in five does not have access to drinking water, one in six is illiterate and one in every three children suffers from malnutrition. The UN development programme and Unicef are responding to these disturbing statistics and they have calculated, for example, that an annual expenditure of USD 80 billion over a period of 10 years could guarantee every human being access to basic education, to basic medical care and to adequate nutrition, to drinking water and to health infrastructures, and, for women, access to gynaecological and maternity treatment: this sum is four times less than the amount the developing world repays in interest on its debt, a quarter of the US military budget, 18% of the amount spent on advertising in the world, 9% of the military expenditure in the world or half the assets of the four wealthiest people in the world. These are statistics that must make us pause for thought. In 1999, according to the figures of the World Bank for 2000, the developing countries repaid their creditor northern countries USD 300 billion, the equivalent of at least four Marshall plans. The European Union must undertake to bring about the alleviation or cancellation of the debts of the poor countries. The beneficiary countries, for their part, must undertake to establish forms of good government and to channel the money saved through debt alleviation into achieving sufficient standards of fair, sustainable development for their people.

 Mr President, we have, on several occasions, stated that the best way of improving the situation of the zootechnical sector in Europe is to restore consumer confidence in the operators of the sector. In order to achieve this goal, I feel that, first and foremost, it is vital for the institutions to ensure that the information they issue is correct and that appropriate terms are used to inform the public about BSE. Talking about contamination, mad cow disease or infected meat does nothing to encourage the consumer to buy beef or veal. BSE was not caused by a virus or a bacterium, and so we must prevent the use of inappropriate terminology generating phobias or psychosis among consumers. What I am saying is part of the debate seeking to ensure that consumers are provided with correct, comprehensive information without creating futile panic. Ensuring that information issued is correct is the most effective way of encouraging consumers to start buying beef and veal again, and this is much more important than any economic support the European Union may provide or any subsidising of farmers.

 Mr President, we have heard what the Commissioner has to say regarding the situation which has come to pass in the United Kingdom: 900 cases and the situation still does not appear to be under control. This is the situation that has been described to us. I therefore feel that the initiatives implemented to date are not sufficient. Moreover, we have heard, in the Committee on Agriculture and elsewhere, that, also in the United Kingdom – as some farmers have said – interventions are not always timely enough considering the fact that as long as three weeks have been known to pass between the occurrence of a case of foot-and-mouth disease on a farm and slaughter of the animal. We must therefore create the right conditions for the Commission to intervene through all the channels open to it and ensure that timely measures are taken, apart from anything else in order to make the need for vaccination clear at last. Although vaccination will not provide a definitive solution to the problem, it will certainly be an indication of the will to stop regarding slaughter as the only possible reaction. There is therefore a clear need to create the right conditions for tighter controls and thus to prevent foot-and-mouth disease from spreading to other countries as well.

Mr President, I would certainly like to emphasise the fact that there is a need – and this has been repeated on several occasions – to restore consumer confidence with regard to operators in the sector. In order to do this, I call upon the Commission, as I have done on countless occasions, to provide clarification, that is to make all data available to allow correct information to contribute to reducing this collective psychosis of which, it appears, even we have been victims in part. I would like to stir things up by saying that if we limit ourselves to the facts, to the current state of affairs, one is much more likely to be struck by lightning than infected by BSE. By this I do not mean that we should not adopt all necessary precautions to prevent even a single human life being put at risk, but we should take care, because the media are causing such damage and are paralysing the sector, often without any objective information to provide accurate news. The provision of accurate information is thus an indispensable requirement if the problem is to be addressed in the proper manner and if we are to prevent psychosis being encouraged in an unjustified – I repeat – often unjustified manner. It is important to let consumers know what they are eating: in this respect the move towards compulsory labelling to provide consumers with accurate information on the animal's characteristics, from birth to slaughter, should be speeded up. With regard to interventions, the need to allow operators in the sector to overcome this moment of crisis should be not be forgotten. Thus, direct economic intervention should be used: it should be remembered that many breeders have thousands of head of cattle and they don't know what to do faced with the reduction in demand for their product. We need to create stockpiles through public intervention. This direct intervention must ensure that companies in financial crisis receive the direct State support.

 Madam President, one of the primary objectives of the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council must continue to be guaranteeing food safety by enforcing effective laws and performing stringent controls which will restore consumer confidence. All this must be carried out in a climate of transparency and regularity so that the citizens do not feel that they are being swindled or sacrificed on the altar of major economic interests. We must prevent animals suffering from BSE entering the food chain. We therefore need to develop an effective control system in all the Member States of the European Union. It is becoming vital to stop using meat-and-bone meal until it is proven unequivocally that using these feedingstuffs will not spread the disease. The panic spreading throughout the public is destroying an entire sector, and those who are least to blame – the breeders – are worst affected, for it is precisely the breeders, and not those responsible, who are the victims of the situation. Breeders feed their livestock on products supplied by the industries, and a similar situation occurred in Belgium a few months ago with the matter of dioxins in chickens. We call for financial subsidies to assist breeders so that they do not have to bear all the costs of the crisis. We also feel that it would be appropriate to ensure that every outbreak of the disease is contained and to place a ban on the export of meat until such time as it is proven to be safe to eat.

 Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, ladies and gentlemen, in addition to the many negative effects of mad cow disease, one positive effect is the fact that it has induced the European Union and the Member States to adopt more vigilant, detailed legislation to ensure food safety and protect honest producers in the strategically important beef sector.  It is a pity that it takes scandals such as this or the dioxins in chickens issue to speed up safeguard and prevention initiatives, but better late than never! It has become apparent that the serious difficulties experienced by the entire sector during the periods of greatest crisis caused by mad cow disease were, apart from the direct effects of the disease, primarily due to the lack of confidence between consumers and beef producers and sellers which ensued. The situation was not improved by the dissemination of false information. We have learned from this experience that it is essential to promote all initiatives which consolidate a stable relationship of confidence between consumers and producers and those who sell food products in general. Although the protection of consumer health is by far the most important criterion, it cannot be our sole objective in establishing an efficient system for the identification and registration of bovine animals during the production and fattening stage and a labelling system based on objective criteria during the marketing stage. It is important to understand that all initiatives which protect honest European Community producers – and they are without a doubt the great majority of producers – need to be promoted. All the Community producers are calling for well-defined but not oppressive regulations. In other words, we must guard against suffocating the healthy part of our agricultural sector with bureaucracy, which is frequently much more damaging than any disease. I will conclude by pointing out that there is no point in adopting stringent legislation if it does not provide an efficient supervision system which rewards honest producers and penalises those whose improper conduct jeopardises the future of an entire sector which is of primary importance for the European economy.

 Mr President, I would like to outline the position reached by Mr Nobilia and myself, both of us members of a special group within the UEN Group.  We believe that the issue raised by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi is, perhaps, one of the main problems that the internal market must face. Regulations in this area are flawed and inappropriate, and instead of providing overall operational certainty and uniform legal protection of the consumer, they leave much room for groundless discretion and uncertainty. 
This is certainly the case as regards the subject the questioner gave as an example – e-commerce – and along with this, sales procedures, purchasers’ rights, their option to withdraw and, at the same time, varying levels of tax levied on the sale itself. However, this issue also affects numerous other areas: the electronic components sector – as a further example – where production might take place in several countries, including ones not in the Union, with storage and/or the affixing of the trademark in one Member State and final assembly in yet another Member State. Moreover, the problem is not so much the reliability of the individual components or their compliance with the legislation of the importing or producing state as their overall conformity with the notion of greater flexibility.  The European Union firmly supports this view, especially if the countries of residence of the end consumers have, with the aim of increasing the competitiveness of the economic operators operating in Europe, 
attributed specific characteristics to 
the product on the basis of clear and pre-determined characteristics and ones which, in any case, supplement those established by the Union.  The concept I have just explained is clearly illustrated by the agri-food sector where, with particular regard to place of origin and following derogations granted on this matter to the Member States, there is greater focus on the information which features on the label of the product intended for final sale.  It is clear that such a situation not only leads to uncertainty, but at the same time distorts competition to the detriment of small and medium-sized businesses, not through proper compliance with the relevant national law but because of the fewer opportunities accorded to them precisely because of the shortcomings of Community legislation.  It is also clear that the persistence of such a disadvantage for small and medium-sized businesses gives rise to fears of repercussions on employment which, in this specific case, cannot be allayed by simplifying administrative procedures, reducing set-up costs 
or involving the social partners and their resources. All of this means that, as well as drafting various regulations on the issues raised and on specific matters relating to this area, we must also consolidate the requisite overall view and the legislative philosophy that serves as a real means of regulating the internal market and which provides an effective point of reference for the Member States and for every economic operator. In conclusion, we believe that, in addition to the monitoring of fragmentation performed by the Commission – truly praiseworthy work as far as the process of the approximation of national laws is concerned – we must make every effort to ensure a more correct assimilation and a more accurate translation of the mandate conferred by the Council of Vienna, which was subsequently confirmed with specific regard to the internal market, with the aim of improving the European legal reference framework and that for competition, alongside 
the elimination of barriers to trade and the improvement of services.
