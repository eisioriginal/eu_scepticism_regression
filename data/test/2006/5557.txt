 Madam President, with your permission I would like to ask the Council, with support from the other groups, to annex the following formal declaration to the directive and therefore to postpone the vote on the legislative resolution. I shall read the declaration that I hope will be annexed:  ‘The European Parliament and the Council state that the rules on subcontracting agreed upon in Article 9 of this Directive shall be without prejudice to other provisions on this issue to be adopted in future legislative instruments.’
 Claudio Fava,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, I understand that the Council must meet formally with the Permanent Representatives Committee. I ask the Presidency to propose officially that this declaration be added and for this reason I am requesting that the vote on the resolution be postponed until the next plenary session, in order to give the Council time to carry out its formal consultation.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, four minutes will be enough to give you a summary of two years’ work – work that has been hard but, I hope, useful – which has involved Parliament alongside both the Commission, with its proposal, and the Council. The essence of this work has been to prepare a directive which, for the first time, lays down sanctions for employers who benefit from the work of illegal immigrants. I believe we have succeeded in changing the philosophy behind this directive, which had been confined solely to fighting illegal immigration. The compromise text agreed with the Council also provides some protection for those immigrants forced to work illegally, who are often held hostage by criminal organisations. Otherwise, Madam President, there would have been a risk of punishing them twice over, both as exploited workers, often forced to accept indecent working conditions, and as illegal immigrants who have to be repatriated, with the repatriation ban which, in many countries, means years and years. In this context, in Articles 7 and 14, we have provided that, in cases involving minors, serious exploitation or people trafficking, the Member States will be obliged to draw up rules for issuing temporary residence permits, the term of which may be extended until any remuneration due has been paid. We should have liked this possibility to be extended to all illegal immigrants, but that is prevented by the Return Directive adopted last year. I was not one of those who supported it. We have, however, succeeded in introducing a rule allowing Member States to apply more favourable measures to immigrants regarding the issuing of residence permits. Article 10 is, in my view, the key article. For the first time, it provides for criminal sanctions to be imposed in the worst cases, including those where the regular workers are minors. I think the additional sanctions laid down in Article 8 are important. They include withdrawal of licences, closure of establishments in particularly serious cases, and exclusion from state aid derived from European funding. Otherwise, we would be guilty of extraordinary hypocrisy: we would be punishing employers with one hand yet still giving them generous subsidies with the other. I believe it is fundamental that we have succeeded in including a definition of remuneration that equates the pay due to an illegal immigrant with the pay of a regular worker, without any discrimination. We have included temporary work agencies in the scope of the directive. In certain countries – such as my own – in particular, these are the organisations that most readily recruit illegal workers under the very worst kinds of exploitative conditions. Just think of the cases where illegal agricultural workers have been hired, which have long filled the crime columns. We have successfully asked for the trade unions to be able to represent immigrants in administrative and civil cases. The text previously mentioned third parties in general, but now it mentions trade unions. We need a running-in period to see how it works, and we have therefore asked the Commission to report to Parliament and the Council after the directive has been in force for three years, specifically about the rules on inspections, residence permits, sanctions and subcontracting. On the subject of subcontracting – Article 9, which was the subject of discussion between Parliament and the Council and within the Council itself – your rapporteur would have like to extend liability to the whole contracting chain, as the Commission had originally proposed. The Council and Parliament, or rather part of Parliament, were for excluding subcontracting entirely, but we have reached a compromise solution that I believe is workable: dual liability, which should not prevent us from legislating again on this issue in future. That is why tomorrow, for my part and on behalf of the other shadow rapporteurs, whom I thank for the collaboration they have given me during these two years, I shall ask the Council to add a statement to the compromise text on which we are going to vote, to the effect that the provisions of this Article 9 shall not prejudice any future legislative action on subcontracting. In conclusion, Madam President, I believe this directive lets us envisage a Europe in which immigration has finally become a matter of collective responsibility and recognised rights, and not just of rules against immigrants.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the Commissioner’s remarks and hopes. Parliament has, I think, said quite clearly – and not just today – that measures on legal immigration are needed and immigration needs to be dealt with in an overall context, which does not just seek to produce punitive measures against illegal immigration. We are overdue in that respect, and of course we are not happy that the Treaties do not authorise this Parliament to enter into a codecision procedure with the Council on legal immigration. The legal basis that now constrains us to talking only about legislation to combat immigration is something that I too find frustrating, but it is the legal basis that we have to abide by. Having said that, I believe that our report today has introduced articles that genuinely protect the rights of foreign workers, even if they are illegal immigrants. I am thinking of the temporary residence permit for minors who have been exploited. I am thinking about pay: it is, at last, expressly stated that remuneration cannot be lower than that which the law recognises for all other European citizens. I am thinking of the role of the trade unions which, for the first time, can defend and represent foreign workers, even illegal ones, in administrative and civil cases. These, I believe, are all reasons why we can talk of recovered rights, a step forward and not back, and a directive that tackles a difficult and sensitive subject, but with a sense of balance to which this Parliament is particularly alert.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the closing of Guantánamo allows us to rectify a violation that has shamed international law and, above all, has done no service to the war on terrorism. Today, however, it is not enough to welcome President Obama’s decision. Now is the time to take responsibility, and responsibility also involves Europe and the Member States. Guantánamo is, in part, the consequence of Europe’s silence and the collaboration of many of our governments in the system of rendition. In recent years, what has happened is that our governments were, on the one hand, saying that Guantánamo must be closed and, on the other, sending their police officers there to interrogate the detainees. We are talking about responsibilities which were denied when this Parliament investigated the matter, but which have been acknowledged and verified in the past two years. February 2008: London apologises for the CIA flights; some aeroplanes have used British bases, said Foreign Secretary Miliband, contradicting what Tony Blair had said three years earlier, maintaining that nothing illegal had taken place on British soil. December 2008: the Spanish Government under Mr Aznar knew that many CIA flights had overflown Spanish air space and used Spanish airports. This emerged from a secret document published by El País 
that turned out to be true. The then Minister of Foreign Affairs, Josep Piqué, who acknowledged the use of Spanish airports, said that he did not know what happened afterwards in Guantánamo. Perhaps he thought that it was an amusement park. In October 2008, we learnt that in Portugal, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Amado, admitted that the former centre­right government of Mr Barroso knowingly made Portuguese airports and air space available for illegal CIA flights. Mr Amado said: ‘I did not talk about it so as not to disrupt the serenity of the European institutions’. We ask: and what about the citizens’ right to know? Or are we to imagine that not even Mr Barroso knew what sort of civil and juridical obscenity Guantánamo was then and still is now? This is the point, Mr President, and I am about to conclude: in recent years we have shown much good will and much hypocrisy, not least in what the Council has left unsaid during these years. Two years ago, Parliament addressed 46 recommendations to the Council. We would have expected that at least some of these recommendations would have been given due examination and due attention, that there would eventually have been replies to at least some of the recommendations. For this reason, we believe that providing some help in closing Guantánamo and assuming our collective responsibility, as Europe and the 27 Member States that it comprises, would be a contribution, however small, to atone for our collective silence.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ‘To thwart illegal immigration, one has to be unkind. Immigrants come because it is easy to get here and no one sends them away, but precisely for this reason we have decided on a change of tune’: these are the words of the Italian Minister for the Interior, Mr Maroni. It seems a parody of a policy and yet it is the policy of the Italian Government. It seems clear to me that inherent in this policy is a profound contempt for what we are discussing here and for the rules that the European Union gives us. Today, we have spoken about the closure of Guantánamo. I think that we need to speak urgently about the closure of Lampedusa: about the Centre for Temporary Stay and Assistance in Lampedusa, as it has been pictured in recent months, namely as an open­air prison. The Presidency has rightly recalled the legal framework, referred to also by Mr Barrot – the use of coercion only in exceptional cases, detention only on absolutely clear grounds and for as short a period as possible – a legal framework that is substantively and formally violated every day in Lampedusa. Most of those who are in Lampedusa are asylum seekers. The Council recalled the minimum standards envisaged by a Directive on asylum seekers adopted in 2003; these rules are being substantively and formally violated. We often have 180 days of detention, including for those who are fleeing from political persecution or war. All this, of course, constitutes acts of legal barbarism which, however, are measured by the numbers offered to us by newspapers. 1 200 people died in 2008 when trying to cross the Mediterranean. Of those who managed to survive, many went through the torments of Lampedusa. Therefore, Mr Vice-President, I invite you to visit Lampedusa, as you yourself have promised, to go there soon, and (if I may make a suggestion) to announce at the last moment that you are going to Lampedusa. Otherwise they will smarten up the Centre like a ballroom for you and make you imagine that this is the detention centre that we are talking about this evening.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our group is fairly satisfied with these two proposals. The fact that we are fairly, not completely, satisfied is demonstrated by the number of amendments by means of which we have tried to help to improve these texts. We are also only fairly satisfied because there has been a lack of ambition; we believe that more could have been done, and that it could have been done better. There are signs of opening up and of a civilised attitude, which are quickly followed, even at times in the debate within this Parliament, by signs of rigidity, particularly from the Council, and of considerable protectionism. This also applies to the Blue Card: there is resistance on some central principles, such as ‘equal pay for equal work’, which is a sacrosanct, natural principle. Even on this, however, we have encountered certain areas of difficulty. We believe that it is vital to overcome the principle of Community preference, to overcome the idea that there is a two-speed Europe, which is the reason why it is necessary to make use of the principle of Community preference. We believe that reference to the labour market is important, but the labour market cannot be the only governing principle. There are other inclusive principles relating to political and social welfare attitudes that ought to form part of immigration policies. Legal immigration means equal dignity and equal opportunities, or else we are going back to selective, partial and discriminatory immigration. We would like to avoid that. For this reason too, on behalf of my group, I support the proposal that Mr Moreno has put to the Commission: let us try to design a Blue Card that is not linked solely to the 3% of highly qualified immigrants, but one that seeks to find specific legal instruments with which to open up the market to immigration. Immigration ought to be inclusion. If it becomes selection, then it is no longer a positive policy.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank the Vice-President, Mr Tajani, for some of the clarifications he has given, and I would like to respond immediately to his request. He is asking this Parliament if we want to examine this proposal together: the answer is yes. The oral question stems from this demand of ours. We would like to examine it while having at our disposal all the information needed in order to understand, as you rightly wonder, whether this tool is a necessity and above all whether it is safe and respects citizens’ privacy, which is our priority. We welcome the letter that you sent to Mr Deprez, chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, in which you make a commitment that we would like to take as an official commitment. That is the commitment to consult the European Data Protection Supervisor. Our group does not yet have an official view regarding body scanners: we need more information and to examine the issue more thoroughly. Meanwhile, with regard to health, we would like to understand what actually constitutes an exposure overdose, particularly for frequent flyers, and on this point we need to be certain that the information is reliable, because for many years we have been forced to leave liquids behind, and now we discover that it was probably an excessive precaution and that the information and the assessments were probably unfounded. We need an assessment of the principle of proportionality and the full involvement of the European Parliament. We do not believe that these measures can be seen merely as technical ones: they are measures that have a direct impact on human rights and on privacy. It is complicated to combine security, privacy and the protection of passenger health, but that is the responsibility that this Parliament endorses and which it entrusts to you. We hope that we can have this information and that you and the European Data Protection Supervisor will give it to us. We need some more data in order to be able to make a confident decision on how useful these body scanners are.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 2009 is a year in which we will not only be going to the polls but will also have to provide some answers to specific questions asked of us by our electorates. One such question will concern the area of freedom, security and justice: why do we mean to create it, how do we mean to create it and when do we mean to create it. We need to provide an answer in the form of an ambitious programme of legislative policies which, Commissioner, the Commission has not yet put on the table. We expect strong legislative proposals with respect to immigration policy, especially on entry policies and asylum policies, in order to safeguard this fundamental right throughout the European Union and to avoid drawing a distinction between policies on legal and illegal immigration, which seems to us altogether inappropriate. We believe that a common policy framework and regulatory environment is necessary: alongside containment measures we need integration measures and legal immigration channels. We expect strong proposals on judicial cooperation in criminal and police matters, founded on mutual recognition of procedural guarantees. Mutual recognition is still lacking, and without such proposals the fight against organised crime and terrorism is likely to remain nothing but rhetoric. Lastly, we expect a bolder approach to the protection and safeguarding of fundamental rights, which remain the primary objective of judicial measures. The new Fundamental Rights Agency should become the main instrument of this activity once the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force. We expect, Commissioner, to find evidence of this intention in the programme to be unveiled to us by the Commission within the next few days.

 Mr President, Mr Jouyet, Mr Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, after seven years of combating terrorism I believe that we are now skilled in cataloguing the risks of terrorism, its effects and its devastating consequences. I also believe that one of the most dramatic of these consequences is a loss of balance – a loss of a sense of balance in reacting to the threat of terrorism. This balance is necessary for investigating not the superficial but the deep causes underlying this violence, and is vital for putting in place preventive and punitive policies, without abandoning the fundamental principles of our legal culture. This is a valuable but difficult balance, because it has to be translated into rules that do not leave any margin for discretion. I therefore welcome the Commission’s initiative to revise the 2002 framework decision, provided that attention is paid to the very timely recommendations that have been made in the two reports we are debating today. The first recommendation, Mr Jouyet and Mr Barrot, is that we must avoid the culture of suspicion, because basing our society on suspicion, and dreaming up integration and immigration policies drawn up on the principle of mutual mistrust would be a gift to terrorism, since terrorism’s aim is above all to create divisions. This is why, when discussing terrorist offences, and the concept of provocation – which is a concept that seems to us both general and subjective – we prefer the legally more consistent and more specific concept of public incitement. I believe that it is a less confusing and less subjective principle, and this is not a terminological issue, Mr Barrot, but a substantive issue: provocation lends itself to abuses, to excesses, it also lends itself to excessive attention to the socially emotive, which would often dictate excessive and confused reactions. All this leads us to the second risk that we must avoid: interpreting the fight against terrorism as grounds providing justification for revising, reducing and altering the scope of fundamental rights. From these two reports we expect a clear and unequivocal signal on this point: this is the challenge which we are called upon to tackle as legislators: combining the fight against terrorism and acts that prepare the way for terrorism with respect for the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and especially freedom of expression and freedom of association, without which our cultures would return to the age of barbarism. Mr Barrot, we must tell the truth: the risk is that we will turn the fight against terrorism into a conflict between cultures or religions, that we will speak racist language; this is quite a real risk, as demonstrated by the meeting in the last few days in Cologne, with the irresponsible participation of a Member of this Parliament, Mr Borghezio. It should thus be said strongly, and said here, and said by this Parliament: fascist intolerance has nothing to do with the war on terrorism! The valuable work done by the two reports that we are debating here also takes this approach: combating terrorism, preventing terrorism’s desperate violence, but at the same time ensuring that there is the right balance between the need for safety for our citizens and their freedoms and fundamental rights. On this point, Mr President, Mr Jouyet and Mr Barrot, we call for vigilance from the Council and the Commission and we promise that this Parliament will do its utmost to work together with you.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to address the Council, because it is not our directive or the Commission proposal that we are debating, but the way in which the Council has emptied it of all meaning. This directive reflects the common direction that the debate on immigration is taking in Europe. The fact that it has been unanimously approved by the Council does not diminish but heightens the message it represents. It is a message that speaks to us of a Europe built on the principle of mistrust. The issue is not the advisability of a directive that creates a joint, shared system. The issue is what this directive lays down. The day after the death of 150 illegal immigrants who drowned in the Mediterranean, you are asking us to tell the survivors that from tomorrow those who, like them, are already in our countries will be faced with a provision stipulating up to 18 months of detention. We are approving a devastating legal principle that provides for the possibility of depriving an individual of liberty for up to 18 months through an administrative measure and without any crime having been committed. What we would never tolerate in our countries if it were applied to a European citizen, we permit and support for illegal immigrants. The 18 amendments that restore signs of political civilisation to this measure, tabled by our group, are an attempt to restore dignity in legislative terms to a provision that we believe to be humiliating not only for the European Union but also for our Member States. If they are not adopted, there will be many votes against this, including mine, Mr President. I do not believe that there is a broad consensus, Mr Weber. There is no consensus on the discretion and judgment that we are giving our countries regarding the way in which the most significant points of this directive will be dealt with. This Parliament is not the guardian of abstract rules. It is a Parliament to which the treaties attribute the duty to protect specific principles, specific principles relating to the law and political civilisation. The Council is asking us to renounce these principles in order to move swiftly. We believe that on this point there is a fundamental mistake. Here you are not asking us to move swiftly, you are asking us to make the wrong move: wrong for immigrants, wrong for Europe, wrong for our Member States, and it is a responsibility that we do not wish to share with you.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if you do not mind I am going to stick to the facts. The facts tell us that Silvio Berlusconi’s government is reintroducing the concept of race into the Italian legal system and is rapidly marginalising Italy within the EU, systematically violating the founding principles on which Directive 2001/38/EC is built, first and foremost the fundamental principle of the right of free movement of persons. I would like to mention just two implications of this: the first we witnessed in Naples a few days ago, when the Camorra were appointed as stand-in law enforcement officers and dislodged anyone who remained in the city’s Romany camps with Molotov cocktails. The second one we heard from Mr Romagnoli, who has come out with a proposal whose origin can certainly not be embellished. This is a completely unoriginal proposal: to rebuild, build or conceive a State to which all Roma citizens are confined. I seem to recall that the same proposal was made about gypsies and Jews by Goebbels in 1930s Nazi Germany before war broke out, and the State of gypsies and Jews was replaced by crematoria. This is the message behind the proposal we have heard today.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to welcome the President of the Council and the Commissioner. As a Group we welcome the Council's approval of a negotiating mandate which will at last enable the Commission to negotiate the inclusion of all Member States - I repeat all Member States - in the new Visa Waiver Program as amended by the US Congress last year. We wish at the same time to express our regret that the Washington Administration decided to launch bilateral negotiations with the countries having recently acceded to the European Union: that decision cannot be endorsed on grounds of either merit or method. Our Group believes the United States to be an essential partner in the fight against terrorism, but at the same time we think that the US Administration must respect the political subjectivity and powers of the European Union, as enshrined in our Treaties. I would venture to suggest, Commissioner, that the same reminder be made to the EU Member States: they are the interpreters and custodians of this European subjectivity. It is worth recalling, as you have done, that visa policy, like our policy on asylum and combating illegal immigration, is the responsibility of the European Community. Importantly, the Council has drawn red lines around the negotiating mandate, to the effect that no bilateral agreement may be negotiated between a Member State and the United States on matters falling under EU competence, especially where such agreements allow the US authorities access to European Union databases. We now call on the Commission to work towards an agreement, an overall solution, granting a visa exemption for citizens of all European countries on the basis of equal dignity and above all reciprocity.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks go to you, Madam President, Mr President of the Council and Commissioner. We welcome the Council President's proposal of an integrated approach to immigration. This attempt to combine the various aspects of the problem and handle them together has to begin with the acknowledgement of a fact known to us all: 60% of migrants arriving in Europe come by sea, and ‘Fortress Europe’ has issued an approximate estimate, by default, that 12 000 human beings have drowned or otherwise gone missing over the past ten years. The Mediterranean has become the largest open-air common grave anywhere. In my opinion, even though Frontex was not established for humanitarian reasons, it cannot be dissociated from this context; it cannot be dissociated from the fact that we are facing a major humanitarian problem. Where do the difficulties and ambiguities of this project lie? The Member States have until now interpreted Frontex as serving to lessen their own responsibilities, and yet it is a coordinating agency based on a spirit of solidarity and reciprocity which cannot operate in isolation from the Member States. Indeed, the Member States are primarily responsible for managing both land and sea borders. Another significant point is that Frontex has not so far been adequately resourced; now that we hear it is to have funds, structures, men and practical resources at its disposal, we shall need to verify their operational reliability. It is not enough simply to list vessels and helicopters: we need to see how this stock of resources and tools can in actual fact be put at the service of the Agency. My third point is that Frontex has still not solved one problem which you, Commissioner, raised when you said that we should contribute to bringing down the number of dead and missing persons. How can Frontex undertake to do this? We believe that there is only one way: by ensuring that its remit includes sea rescue operations. In other words, besides the rules governing immigration into the European Union, maritime law, humanitarian law, should also be included, setting out the need to save every human life whenever there is an imminent risk of lives being lost. That is the message we leave you with, Commissioner, and those are a few points on which we should like some clarification from you and from the Council.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank my colleagues and say immediately that we were, quite frankly, obliged to work on a report that got off to a bad start, sent out mixed messages and contained shaky proposals. I believe that the Committee on Civil Liberties did a remarkable job of restoring a meaningful, tangible political profile to this report. The basic premise was of course shared by us all. The violent radicalisation of individuals and groups in recent years has shown up one of the greatest weaknesses in our legal system and represented one of the greatest onslaughts on our democratic institutions. It is essential to combat this phenomenon. In this sense, European Union action offers added value since it provides harmonisation, because if we pool our instruments we shall have a sum of instruments, each of which will have its own intrinsic weakness. However, this is a new challenge which calls for well-balanced efforts without giving way to the natural human temptation – inevitable, given the attacks we have suffered in the years since 11 September – to generalise or to build a Fortress Europe, or to sideline a priority that is central to the process of EU integration, namely the safeguarding of fundamental rights. That is why we believe it is essential to move in the three directions set out by this report. The first step is to uphold fundamental rights and the rule of law, particularly – as Mr Frattini said – religious freedom and freedom of expression. Unless these rights are guaranteed, the very idea of Europe will be a failure, as will an integration process predicated above all else on the fundamental rights of European citizens. We need to strengthen judicial cooperation so as to strike at radical, violent, organised fringe groups. We need full harmonisation of terrorist crimes at European Union level, and that of condoning criminal activity should be added to the proposal of the Committee on Civil Liberties. Of course we also need careful prevention work: we must attack the causes and factors – which are numerous, and it is pointless to pretend otherwise – leading to the radicalisation of various population groups within our societies. This entails expanding the rights of citizenship, active citizenship, in other words a form of citizenship comprising responsibilities and participation in political life, as well as dialogue with religious movements. As the Vice-President has said, we must also fight in favour of, and protect, the millions – tens of millions – of European citizens who profess a religion different from our own, as well as the Muslim non-Community citizens who have always lived by the rules of our democracy and complied with our laws, which makes them worthy of our full respect. Lastly, we need to build a dialogue which genuinely represents an alliance of civilisations and not a clash of civilisations. ‘Alliance of civilisations’ – I am concluding now, Mr President – Is not a term we have borrowed from a political polemic; it is the term coined by the United Nations Security Council. It expresses a major responsibility and a strong commitment for this House and our communities. I believe it is vital to keep this term in tomorrow's resolution.

 Mr President, President of the Council, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I believe I can share Commissioner Frattini’s approach to the debate. We need to look to the future, we need to understand how we can manage the time left to us with a sense of responsibility and commitment shared by all the European institutions. We believe that after years of debate on the area of freedom, security and justice, in which this Parliament has been critical of the clear democratic deficit – such a tricky area for the fundamental rights of citizens – we can welcome the signature of the new treaty, which finally creates a European dimension in this area, and which gives Parliament full legislative powers, including on judicial, criminal and police cooperation and on entry and residence policies. For this reason, my group also believes that, even during the delicate phase of ratification, no institution can escape the fact that the framework has completely changed. We know it is not possible simply to bring forward the entry into force of the Treaty, but we believe it would be a mistake politically to carry on working on highly sensitive dossiers in a way that sidesteps the democratic scope of the Treaty of Lisbon. For this reason, our group also believes that a joint commitment from Parliament, the Council and the Commission is necessary to identify any dossiers of particular importance, not to block their passage but to guarantee that Parliament can be consulted with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and to integrate them into the new institutional framework. I am thinking in particular of the important dossiers on which until now we have merely been consulted, such as the proposal for a European PNR system, the proposal to revise the framework decision on terrorism, the directive on the admission of highly qualified workers and the directive on a uniform procedure for the admission of labour migrants. May I take a few seconds, Mr President, to express concern over what the Council was saying about the Returns Directive. We appreciate the Council’s availability and cooperation, but we believe that there are a few extremely delicate points. One in particular is that 18 months’ detention is not considered an improvement in the effectiveness of this directive, but an oppressive measure on which a good many in this Parliament will continue to express their displeasure.

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, as an Italian I would like to welcome particularly warmly the fact that Slovenia holds the Presidency of the Council; that, of the countries who have recently joined the European Union, it falls to Slovenia to be the first to hold the Presidency; and that Slovenia is now in the Schengen area together with other European countries. As holder of the Presidency, your fundamental task is to give a strong impetus to the process of ratifying the Lisbon Treaty. This is a treaty that will enable this Parliament to have greater co-decision powers, that will make it possible to take decisions by qualified majority on some absolutely strategic issues and all within sectors where the fundamental rights of citizens will be given more attention and more protection: I am thinking of judicial cooperation and legal immigration. Our suggestion is directed to this end, and we will have to attempt over the coming months to find room for an interinstitutional agreement to regulate the transitional stage on various issues: I am thinking, for instance, of the Europol package to be voted on tomorrow, and tomorrow this Parliament will ask you to make an undertaking for the Council to consult the European Parliament once again within six months of the entry into force of the treaties in the light of the new legal provisions that these treaties will offer us. Again, on the common immigration policy I would ask for your commitment to a secure framework, as illegal immigration can only be combated while respecting fundamental rights with tenacity, conviction and accuracy, partly in order to avoid a recurrence of what happened a few months ago when hundreds of human beings clung to tuna nets in a vain attempt to cross the Mediterranean to reach Europe.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Socialist group welcomes the adoption of the Europol report and the proposal to convert Europol into an EU agency. After an extremely long period of waiting we are finally in a position to make Europol into a concrete and effective tool in combating organised crime, as well as many other dangerous types of crime which are now manifesting themselves at European level – I am thinking, for instance, of the action that Europol will be able to take on money-laundering. Our group wanted to strengthen the supervisory powers specified in the proposal into genuine parliamentary supervision, not just restricted to budgetary powers, of course, and we wanted to strengthen the provisions on personal data protection and data security, particularly in the absence of a good framework decision on data protection in the third pillar, which is still taking its time in coming. We cannot, however, ignore the fact, as pointed out by Mr Díaz de Mera García, that meanwhile the context has changed: the signing of the Lisbon Treaty creates the prospect that in the near future police cooperation will be subject to co-decision by the European Parliament and thus to our full responsibility, to qualified majority voting in Council and to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice. This is why we are asking the Slovenian Presidency for a formal undertaking to put a review of the dossier before the European Parliament within six months of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. Finally, the Socialist group still believes that it would have been more appropriate, on a matter as sensitive as this, for the rapporteur to have withdrawn to a certain degree, in view of the events that saw him involved in politics in his country. Our group has, however, decided not to leave out his contribution to a dossier that we believe to be of strategic importance for the process of European integration.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the oral amendment that our Group is proposing involves replacing the words ‘all forms of glorifying’ by the word ‘apology’. We consider that the word apology better reflects the type of behaviour to be curbed. If Mr Díaz de Mera is in agreement, our Group will vote in favour.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I ask whether the proposer of the amendment would agree to remove the two phrases which currently read: ‘in some rare instances’ and ‘which may not be lawful’ from the sentence. If these two phrases are removed from the amendment, we would be willing to support it.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot go along with a lot of what President Barroso has said, especially when he says that the Commission is being tough on illegal immigration but very generous and supportive on integration. We can certainly agree to the directive on penalising employers who illegally employ non-Community migrant workers, but we find no trace in the programme of those legislative measures on legal migration previously announced by Vice-President Frattini. No mention is made of the Directives on seasonal workers and highly skilled workers, nor of opening up legal migration channels for unskilled non-Community workers, who constitute the majority of immigrants now present on EU soil. We believe these measures to be necessary, not least so as to combat exploitation and bring undeclared work out into the open. The reference to a shared overall approach is fine, and one cannot fail to agree on the need to avoid having 27 different immigration policies, but we look forward to receiving some more tangible information about the European surveillance system announced in the programme. Finally, Mr President, I would recall that under the new Lisbon Treaty many of these subjects will be handled through codecision as of 1 January 2009, with this House assuming full legislative responsibility alongside the Council and the Commission. It might perhaps be useful to prepare the ground for better cooperation among the EU institutions.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to thank both of the rapporteurs for their work, which has been valuable and absolutely to the point. I should like to begin with a picture that has been in all of our minds for some months: the photograph of 40 shipwreck survivors clinging to a tuna net in the middle of the Mediterranean for two days and two nights. In that instance, saving the fish seems to have been more important than saving the lives of those desperate people: they were not taken on board the fishing vessel that came across them. I am saying this because, as the Commissioner reminded us, we need a global but differentiated approach to the subject of immigration. It must be an approach combining balance, solidarity and – as recalled by Mrs Gruber – an absence of taboos. Immigration cannot be regarded merely as a security issue. It is a necessary challenge for Europe; it is an aspect of integration and social development that we have to confront. Commissioner Frattini said that Europe has a part to play; we agree. Europe has a part to play, provided that it can deal with all the complexities of the issue. In the few seconds remaining to me I should like to highlight the three fundamental principles contained in these two reports. The most effective way of stemming illegal immigration is to open up legal migration channels, as long as the migrants and the countries receiving them have reciprocal rights and obligations. On illegal immigration, I would like to say that a principle of solidarity must be established among Member States, provided that it applies to all Member States and not just those bordering the Mediterranean. At the same time, as many of my fellow Members have already said, we must combat illegal immigration by creating conditions in the countries of origin that alleviate the causes of the deep despair from which these people are fleeing: the underlying causes mentioned by Mr Frattini. Finally, Madam President, respect for human rights remains a necessary point of reference for our policies. The process of European integration will be strong and meaningful only if we can prevent Europe from closing its doors to immigrants.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my report was adopted seven months ago, and since then the only signs of anything new happening have come from the United States. One such sign was recalled by Mr Gawronski: President Bush decreed on 20 July that his administration would continue to have recourse to unlawful CIA activity in the form of extrajudicial seizure and detention of suspected terrorists in willing third countries. The other important sign is that the US Congress has opened its own independent inquiry into extraordinary rendition. This tells us that we are dealing not with a chapter of history but with current affairs. Judicial inquiries are underway in four European countries: Spain, Portugal, Germany and Italy. Thirty-nine provisional detention orders have so far been issued against as many US secret service officials and agents. The inquiry by this House documented facts, not opinions. It is a fact, for instance, that some of our governments and security services cooperated with the CIA in carrying out extraordinary rendition. I would remind Commissioner Frattini that our sources in this case were not anonymous. Our sources, as the report says, were statements by the UK and German Governments. We put forward 48 recommendations, above all to the Council, and we should like to know from the Council whether even one of those recommendations has been followed up over these seven months. We made two requests in particular: we invited the European institutions - including the Council - to shoulder their respective responsibilities under Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty, and we expected the Council to exert pressure on all the governments concerned to provide full and exhaustive information, with the possibility of arranging hearings where necessary. This has not happened. It is not true that the Council has no powers, Mr Lobo Antunes; the Council has the powers conferred on it by Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty. Our request certainly could have been acted on by the German Presidency and now the Portuguese Presidency. We appreciate Mr Frattini’s initiatives, but we are not satisfied by these two six-month presidencies which have in effect consigned to oblivion a year of work by our committee of inquiry. Given that public opinion in our countries is calling for truth, the silence of the Council - and, I must say, of many of our governments - constitutes a missed opportunity for Europe. Nevertheless, this House does not intend to give in. I am sorry for Mr Gawronski, but we shall come back to this topic. An own-initiative report in the Committee on Civil Liberties will be our contribution to combating terrorism in a way that is respectful of human rights always, everywhere and for everyone; the number-one human right, as Cesare Beccaria taught us centuries ago, being the presumption of innocence.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to know whether it is possible to have Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty annexed to the minutes of our debate. We have just heard from the Council that Articles 6 and 7 are confined to a statement of principles. As you know, Article 6 sets out principles, while Article 7 sets out actions to safeguard those principles. I believe it would be worth reminding the Council and also my fellow Members of this fact.
 Claudio Fava  (PSE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that this debate is enabling us, in the meantime, to overcome, to take stock, but also to overcome some dangerous mistakes – a first mistake. We are debating a strategy against terrorism, not against Islam, and reducing the causes of terrorism in a simplistic way to Islamic fundamentalism would be a rather superficial solution, a rather simplistic reading. Similarly, some turns of phrase that I have just heard worry me: the mosques bring war into our societies! These are rather general, rather violent, and rather boorish opinions. Imagine if in Turkey tomorrow an MP stood up in the Turkish Parliament and said ‘the Christian churches bring war into our society’ – what would be the indignant reaction of this Parliament? I would also like to make a suggestion to Mr Frattini: we know that enforcement work is absolutely fundamental, just as much as preventive work. I believe, however, that calculations ought to be made on the basis not of alleged terrorists arrested but on actual terrorists found guilty. It would be useful to monitor or do some reconnaissance work on how many terrorist suspects have been arrested over recent years in our countries and have subsequently been released. We have received some replies from the Council, but some of these have been partial answers. I would like to focus on three points here that we need to explore more deeply: it is not very clear to us what the role of this Parliament ought to be, and how it is to be truly associated with this European Union strategy. We do not believe – and this has been pointed out by other Members – that a meeting once every six months between the Vice-President and the Chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Council is sufficient. We believe that a quality and level of consensus is required that cannot be limited to these formal, ritualistic meetings. It is not clear to us what will happen regarding the functions of the EU counter-terrorism coordinator. It has been explained to us that this function is primarily linked to providing strategic assessments and disseminating information. When our committee had the opportunity of talking with Mr de Vries, it was admitted to us that the function was completely devoid of content or tools. In that case, I believe that nothing can be more damaging than an institutional function that does not have the tools with which to exist or give an account of itself. Finally, Mr President, it is not clear what position the Portuguese Presidency will adopt on Euro-Atlantic cooperation. I would like to go back to the very simple and very sincere request contained in our question. The question was whether this cooperation will be pursued with methods complying with Article 6 of the Treaty as recommended by this Parliament at the completion of the CIA enquiry. We need a clear answer. A joint strategy makes sense if it includes full respect for the fundamental rights of citizens, but this has not always been the case. We welcome the initiative by Vice-President Frattini on a questionnaire to be distributed to the EU Member States to find out what instruments they have put in place and what responses have been produced by these instruments, including in the sphere of respect for the fundamental rights of citizens, but on this point we would like to let you know that this Parliament intends nonetheless to instigate a follow-up to the conclusions of the committee of enquiry on the CIA and to put the formal question: what action have the Council and the Commission taken with regard to the many requests made in those reports? Mr President, in conclusion, I think I can say that combating terrorism requires a high level of social consensus and we need to be vigilant regarding the principles set out in Article 6 of the Treaty. Avoiding abuses and avoiding simplification is the only way of ensuring we achieve this consensus.

 Mr President, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, I endorse what Mr Frattini has said here today and in the interviews he has given in recent days, but someone who does not endorse them at all is the Maltese Minister for Foreign Affairs. In a statement this afternoon he explained that Malta cannot take charge of illegal immigrants who legally do not come under its jurisdiction. Twenty-one people who drowned are not a legal matter, and somebody at the forthcoming meeting of the Council of Ministers, either the Presidency or the Commission, needs to explain to the Maltese Government the difference between illegal immigrants and shipwreck victims. Somebody needs to remind the Maltese Foreign Minister that a fishing boat flying the Maltese flag decided to leave 27 people clinging to a tuna fishing line because they thought it was more important to save the tuna they had caught than human lives. Somebody needs to explain to the Maltese Minister and all the rest of our ministers that humanitarian law has nothing to do with legal obligations or the conventions signed by our countries. Since I believe that it is important to put words into deeds, I agree with you, Mr Frattini, that the Frontex funds need to be released and that all countries need to take this requirement on board but, at the same time, allowing Frontex or the European repatriation fund to receive these funds must be made conditional on fulfilling their duty to assist anyone in distress at sea, in whatever circumstances and no matter what the legal status of the shipwreck. That is one of the working hypotheses that can be used to tackle this problem over the next few days with the other ministers.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I confess, in a minute and a half, that, every time this House is asked to debate human rights, one has the worrying feeling that the debate will end up being nothing more than a rhetorical exercise. I say this while also having in mind the fact that, although one month ago this House debated the outcome of a year’s work by the Temporary Committee on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners, this month neither the Commission nor the Council have in any way acknowledged the work done by the European Parliament and submitted for their opinion. We do want to see the same thing happen with the precious communication before us which, as Mr Voggenhuber points out, is intended to clarify and enhance what has been standard practice in this House since 2001, namely guaranteeing the compatibility of all the legislative processes developed by the institutions with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Recognition for this practice was a long time coming, and we hope that its implementation will not be shelved. One point must be made clear: we are asking the Commission for an annual report, to be submitted to Parliament, which summarises the implementation of fundamental rights in European policies. It seems rather strange to us that annual reports on the application of Community law and on competition policy should be planned, but not a report on fundamental rights for the Commission to submit to the European Parliament. We also take this view because of the impact that such policies have on 500 million European citizens and because we believe that this is a sensitive issue for which the European institutions must take responsibility if they are to restore dignity and substance to the human rights on which we are often asked to focus.

 Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, after a year’s work, more than 200 hearings, seven missions abroad and thousands of pages and documents examined, what I am presenting to Parliament this morning is not just the final report on the work of our committee, but a rigorous analysis of five years of excesses and abuses, often tolerated for the sake of the fight against international terrorism. The fight against terrorism is an enterprise to which we are all committed without exception, but we never agreed that the founding principles of our Treaties should be trampled underfoot for the sake of this enterprise. Thus we come to the subject of our mandate: extraordinary renditions. Did our governments know about them? Some of them certainly did. Those governments that decided to send their agents to interrogate the victims of the renditions in Guantánamo, Syria and Afghanistan – they knew. The European embassies in Sarajevo knew what would happen to the Algerians who were captured and handed over to the Americans against the orders of the local courts to set them free. The top people in SISMI, Italy’s military intelligence service, knew that the CIA was preparing a kidnapping on Italian soil. There is widespread responsibility and contributory negligence surrounding these events, and very few European countries are entirely blameless. This is demonstrated by the facts we have gathered, Mr President: not opinions or prejudices, but circumstantiated, concrete, serious, proven, verified facts. The facts also include the unanswered questions, contradictions and omissions that we have gathered. In the face of all this evidence, if people decide to look the other way, it will be because they lack the courage to stand up for what is right or they have no intellectual honesty. Almost every day, Mr Gawronski asks me whether we have found out anything new in the last few months. Yes, Mr Gawronski, a lot. We have found out that there are many more than the 21 rendition cases that we have reconstructed: they are faceless, nameless prisoners, without anybody who will complain about their fate, because they do not have a western passport in their pocket. We have found out that one man is innocent: he may have to stay in Guantánamo for almost five years, stripped of the most basic rights, just because no government is interested in getting him out. We have found out that torture is pointless in the fight against terrorism: that was explained to us by Maher Arar, the innocent victim of a rendition, who was held and tortured in Syria for 12 months. We discovered that and other things because Mura Kurnaz and Maher Arar were our witnesses: we had asked for them to be brought before our committee under escort, and we questioned them at length, as we did many others, including victims, relatives, lawyers and magistrates. We conducted 200 hearings, Mr President, a showcase of hurt and humiliated human beings. Should we now pretend nothing has happened and look the other way, as many European governments have done? Some people, of course, would have preferred us to use more accommodating, more cautious language, perhaps in the belief that the abuses, infringements and excesses are the normal price to pay in the fight against terrorism. That is a fallacy. The strength of our principles lies in the rigour with which we can apply them, starting with the report that we are debating this morning. It is Parliament’s duty, Mr President, to show that it is not caught up in the game of expediency and political affiliations. When faced with the truth, we each represent not a government or a party, but rather our own selves, our individual moral honesty, and our integrity as human beings and as MEPs. Mr President, above all I should like to thank the committee chairman, Mr Coelho, for the balanced way in which he directed our work throughout the year. I should also like to thank all the staff and assistants and the Members who have lavished particular care and passion on this work. This page in Parliament’s history that is being written today is first and foremost the outcome of this shared passion for the public good. We expect the same rigour and, if I may say so, the same consistency from the Council and the Commission. We have opened a door, and we shall not allow anyone to close it again. Above and beyond this report, we have a duty to do everything in our power to ensure that the events of the last five years can never happen again.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament constantly has to tackle a high-minded and difficult task: making its personal contribution to combating terror. As you know, on Saturday, alongside our British friends, we will be commemorating the fifty people who died in last year’s bomb attacks in London. We have another equally difficult task: investigating the truth, including the truth about the abuses committed over the past few years in the name of the fight against terrorism. This is the raison d’être of our committee: the truth about the rights denied those accused of being our enemies, but who, as human beings who stand accused, are entitled to representation by a lawyer, to a trial, a judge and dignified and humane treatment. Mr President, where there are no rights there are no laws – merely the exercise of force and arbitrary acts. When we talk of extraordinary rendition, which is the theme on which our committee has focused, we are talking about an arbitrary act that certain countries want and others accept in the name of the fight against terrorism. Extraordinary rendition refers to the extraordinary transport of terrorist suspects captured by the CIA and sent to complaisant countries that are willing to interrogate them using any methods at their disposal and to hold them without trial. In recent years, Mr President, rendition has been a fact and not an opinion or a conjecture. It is a fact that has even been admitted by the US State Department, a practice that has been used and abused, even to the detriment of European citizens. We are reserving the work conclusions reached in the past few months, and those that we hope to reach over the next few months, for the concluding report; but it is now our duty to inform you of a vast and general range of offences, involving various European countries and different levels of responsibility: some have been complicit, some have covered up the illegal operations and some have simply looked the other way. A few hours ago, news arrived from Italy that the Milan investigating judge has signed a protective custody warrant against the deputy director of the Sismi, the Italian military security service, for acting as an accomplice in the abduction of Abu Omar, the Milan imam who was kidnapped, in whose case another twenty-two preventative custody warrants have been issued against CIA agents. And here I must impress upon you the seriousness of the fact that the director of the Sismi, General Pollari, appeared before our committee to assert that his agency had never received any information regarding this abduction. Let us note the fact that the deputy director was arrested because he was considered to be responsible for this abduction. Mr President, we are not a court of justice; because of this event, however, we have an additional responsibility at the political and institutional levels, as do governments and Member States, to which we appeal because the burden of proof – precisely because we are not a court of justice – is a burden that must be shared with the governments, whose full collaboration and commitment to absolute truth we will need in the months to come. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we would like to make every effort to discover the plain truth on the facts and responsibilities, to ensure above all that these events and abuses are never repeated on European territory or to the detriment of European citizens, and I believe that this is the ultimate aim of our committee. Thanks to the work of our assistants – the committee staff, whom I would like to thank – we have reconstructed in detail a complex system of aircraft and fictitious companies used by the CIA for its assignments in recent years; we have minutely reconstructed the routes of over one thousand flights, which we have made available to our fellow Members of Parliament. We know that many of these flights were routine flights used to transport equipment or officials, but not all of them were: Abu Omar, Maher Arar, Khaled el-Masri, Mohamed Algiza and many others were roughly loaded onto and transported in these aircraft to their prisons. These flights have landed in our airports, used our skies and taken advantage of our silence with impunity and in only one case out of 1 084 flights has a police officer claimed to be able to identify crews and passengers. Mr President, we have provided the victims of scandalous errors of justice with a voice and the right to speak, as we have those who have enabled this committee to do its work. We now have a difficult task before us, for which we ask Parliament to authorise us to continue our work until the end of our mandate, in the knowledge that the truth that we will have obtained and consolidated by the end of it will constitute a body of work to be placed at the disposal of all European countries and, of course, of this Parliament.

 Mr President, Mr Frattini, Minister Lehtomäki, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we should be very worried about the red tape that binds together many of the arguments and debates that we have in this Chamber. We could make the same comment on the subject that we are analysing now, as we did a short time ago in the debate on the CIA flights, that is that the Union is an area that is bound by the rules and principles of the rule of law and that, therefore, personal data, all personal data, including our current account data, must not be given to third countries, except in the cases provided for under national laws and now under European directives; there are no exceptions, not even in the name of the fight against terrorism. Anything that goes beyond this constitutes an arbitrary act and an abuse of the system. I and other Members would like to know what role the Council and the European Central Bank played and how aware they were of the secret agreements made by SWIFT and the United States administration, since the duty of transparency should not apply solely to our dialogue and debates in Parliament, it also has to exist outside this House. Mr President, I concur with my colleagues in asking the Council to examine and adopt a framework decision on data protection as quickly as possible, because when there is a legal vacuum abuses and arbitrary acts can gain a foothold.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have come to the end of a journey that began in July 2004 with the presentation of the Commission proposals on the new Structural Funds, which, I should like to point out, Parliament has always supported, has sought to improve and has, at any rate, defended by emphasising certain aspects that we regard as important, relating to quality, spending, sustainable development, environmental protection, equal opportunities, access for the disabled, public security and cross-border cooperation. We have worked alongside the Commission and the Council to ensure that this journey is swiftly concluded, but also, I repeat, to improve some sensitive points that we regard as important in the way in which our regions and our local authorities will use the Structural Funds. I should like to quickly point out our contribution on some specific points. Firstly, the consultation procedure: we fought to have the procedure extended and supported and to have it include, alongside institutional and administrative topics, new topics that are of importance on the ground: I am referring to non-governmental organisations and to civil society. We believe that the consultation procedure is a great school for democracy and, above all, a great resource in terms of responsibility: extending the scope of responsibility in the management of the Structural Funds is one of the major political challenges facing the European Union. We have focused on equity, that is to say, on the need to prevent a two-speed Europe, which would pave the way for geographically discriminatory measures. We know that the European cohesion challenge is a difficult one. Enlargement has widened the gap that exists between various geographical areas of Europe, and we felt it important to bridge that gap and to strike an economic and social balance among all of the countries of the European Union, preventing the risk of a two-speed Europe. We have concentrated on a number of priorities, adopting the Commission’s proposal to avoid turning the Structural Funds and the Regional Development Fund, for which I am responsible, into a kind of 'shopping list' that anyone can access on the basis of the most varied of needs. Instead, we have concentrated on the quality of a few objectives and made sure that quality comes before quantity, and we have done so, too, on the basis of the experience that each of us has committed to memory. We have held on to the principle of additionality: the Structural Funds are a form of added value, they must not substitute for the current, normal expenditure of the Member States, of the State. In that sense, we must focus more on quality issues regarding this expenditure, as a form of added value. Finally, Lisbon: Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Lisbon does not only represent a competitive Europe, which is capable of getting its own economy off the ground and of pursuing the objective of full and good-quality employment, but it also represents a Europe that is capable at last of investing in knowledge, in intangible infrastructure, in know-how, in processes and technological innovation, and in everything that is today at the heart of the Structural Funds. The European Parliament’s contribution has been a practical one, including on a number of specific points, insofar as it has paid particular attention to environmental issues, to sustainable development, to urban policy, to small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the backbone of the European economy, and to security, too. We are pleased that a statement has been proposed that includes our request for special attention to be paid to security, aimed at making our European expenditure impenetrable to organised crime. We are only partly satisfied, Mr President, because, as you and all of my fellow Members will know, we do not believe that the budgetary resources are sufficient for the challenge we are facing, in spite of the enlargement and in spite of the proposal by the previous Commission, a proposal that is perhaps more generous and more in keeping with the needs of this enlarged Europe of 25. I feel it is worth stressing the European Parliament's sense of responsibility yet again, as other Members have done. It has always tried to cooperate fully and effectively with the other European institutions, has avoided the conciliation procedure and has avoided jeopardising the next programming period. I should like to thank the European Commission, Commissioner Hübner and the Austrian Presidency. They have acted in the same spirit of cooperation as we have. It is now down to our countries to act; we have the appropriate instruments, we ought to be able to make good use of them.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Mrs Ferrero-Waldner and to Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, whom our group supported and whose work today at the centre of our debate it welcomes. We welcome his report because it is timely, because it is practical and because it has a precious quality: political realism. Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra reminds us that we must eventually adopt a strategic approach to Latin America, a broad outlook that aims to place side by side all the points that matter to us: the social aspect, the economic aspect and the cultural aspect. We must bear in mind that many things have changed in that continent. Major new players have emerged strongly in the social and political spheres; we must take account of these new players, including, of course, the indigenous and mestizo part of society, which until recently was sidelined from the political process. We must realistically consider the fact, too, that regional integration processes often mark time and, from that point of view, our experience can support and help the work being done by Latin American countries. Finally, we must bear in mind, as Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra points out, that poverty remains endemic in that continent: 45% of the population live below the poverty line. However, notwithstanding a few inconsistencies, the income produced by the Latin American continent, in terms of GDP, is equivalent to USD 2 800, or three times as much as that produced in China. That tells us that Latin America remains a continent with significant economic and income-related disparities, in other words a continent of inequality. From that point of view, the Vienna Summit represents a great opportunity; firstly, in terms of making up for the scant attention that our institution, the European Parliament, has historically paid to Latin America and, secondly, in terms of investing in a cooperation measure that can genuinely overcome poverty and of preventing the political measures from being reduced to a sum of separate measures. We need the strategic outlook that the Commission is proposing to us and that the rapporteur has been able to take up.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unlike Minister Alexander, who is very young and very enthusiastic, this Parliament is not at all happy with the statements made by Condoleezza Rice – neither with what she said nor, above all, with what she chose not to say. There is no anti-American feeling in this; let us just say that the balance between security and liberty, between human rights and the fight against terrorism, has been tipped away from the side of human rights. This Parliament is no longer content with the solemn assurances made by the governments involved. History is full of lies told equally solemnly by those very same governments, and the Iraqi chemical weapons affair is a reminder of that. At the moment, says the Commission, there is no proof. We have to reach an agreement on what we mean by proof. Do we mean a public admission by a prime minister appearing on television and saying, ‘Yes, it is true: I have allowed secret prisons run by US secret service agents to operate in my country, and torture has been used in them’? I think it would be difficult to expect that kind of proof. Mr President, we believe that the statements by Condoleezza Rice – who claims that many human lives in Europe have been saved because of preventive actions by the CIA – are more than an admission of guilt. I should also like to mention that we consider the need for proof sacrosanct only for governments, but sometimes forget about it in the case of citizens, who are quickly transformed from suspects into terrorists without the necessary legal guarantees. We have many good reasons to call for a committee of inquiry to be set up, not in order to make accusations but to seek the truth. We appreciate the firmness shown by Commissioner Frattini and endorse his support for the work done by the Council of Europe, but we cannot delegate our responsibility for political vigilance and our duty to ascertain the truth to any other institutional body: it is our job and our responsibility.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am afraid that the denials referred to by Vice-President Frattini in relation to the countries involved are extremely formal and unconvincing. In the top-secret CIA documents, which virtually the entire European press is currently discussing, the clandestine jails in Poland and Romania, referred to in the Washington Post
 and Human Rights Voices
, even have a name – ‘black sites’. They are a sort of no-man’s land, beyond the law and beyond the right of habeas corpus. If proven, these allegations are serious and present us with a difficult problem – the need to find the delicate balance between protecting citizens’ rights and combating terrorism. I should like to underline a contradiction – the fact that shortly, in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Parliament will tackle the issue of data retention and will again attempt, with a great sense of responsibility, to find common legal and political ground to reconcile rights and emergency situations. We need to protect the rights of citizens and to use all available means to combat terrorism, at the very time when we discover that European countries have become the CIA’s own back yard. Mr Frattini, what is really serious is that we do not even have the right to be surprised. Two years ago, as the current legal investigations – of which you are well aware – have shown, Community and non-Community citizens were kidnapped in European countries by the US secret services. Once again, however, we appear to be turning a blind eye. We have noted your final comment, namely that if the episodes we are discussing today were proven, they would constitute serious violations of Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union. That, I believe, is an important statement and one we would ask you to develop further, by launching an exhaustive and in-depth investigation into the events we have been discussing this evening.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in all honesty we expected more from the Council’s statement. We expected greater clarity, in particular, since immigration requires joint, coordinated measures for European policy, focused not on the need and the means to protect ourselves from immigrants, but above all on the capability to ensure respect for the human rights of immigrants, their human dignity and agreement among the Member States. Such a policy demands, above all, courage and truth, which is why I will just dwell on an omission in the speech by Mr Alexander which I believe to be particularly serious: he did not make a single reference, not a single word, to what has happened in recent days on Lampedusa. I would therefore like to put four quick questions to him and to the Council. Is the Council aware of the fact that the temporary holding camp on Lampedusa has been transformed in fact – but not by law – into a detention centre, a place where rights do not exist and where ill-treatment and violence are the order of the day? Is the Council aware of the fact that an official delegation from this Parliament was taken for a ride by the Italian Government, which, on the day prior to our visit, had the centre evacuated? Is the UK Minister aware that his Italian counterpart, Mr Castelli, the Minister for Justice, this morning hastily dismissed events on Lampedusa as a load of rubbish made up by the journalists? Finally, is the Council aware that the current cooperation agreements with Libya provide not only for the monitoring of the borders but also for non-EU citizens who have been turned away and deported to be interned in refugee camps in the Libyan desert that are not further identified? We await some answers.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteur for the excellent work he has done and the Commission for this proposal, which we consider an honest attempt to harmonise the treatment of asylum seekers across the European Union. This proposal is benefiting today from the European Parliament’s contribution and efforts, so that we can realign ourselves with the spirit of the Tampere Council, which has been mentioned several times today, and also so as to overthrow the primacy of fear as the only political element, the only criterion for action in our policies on immigration and the right to asylum. Now, however, it is important to oversee the implementation of the directive as amended and to ensure that it really does become the new Europe-wide legislation that is implemented in all our countries. Above all, with regard to the new definition of a safe third country, we must avoid – if I may say so, Mr President – certain fanciful interpretations that we have heard today from the benches on the right: a safe third country for us means adopting a European list of safe countries, and adopting it under the responsibility of Parliament as a party in the codecision procedure. Objective, precise conditions are needed: precisely the opposite of what is happening today. Thousands of migrants leave Lampedusa to be expelled and sent to Libya, which is anything but a safe country, Mrs Klamt; and when people are sent from the United Kingdom to Iraq, they are going to a country that is anything but a safe third country. It is also a case of changing the function of Parliament. Today we are not offering the Council a polite suggestion; instead, we are calling for clear, strict and responsible rules. To conclude, I believe that the basic problem is to make the Council and all the European institutions understand that Europe today cannot simply look after itself, but that it must instead look after the rights of those who are now suffering the violence of war and the humiliation of persecution. In view of all that, we must ask ourselves whether the problem is that we receive the asylum applications or rather whether the problem is the war and persecution from which those refugees are fleeing. Even before we put it to the European institutions, that is a question that we should put to our own consciences.

 Mr President, Mr Clarke, ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament cannot fail to agree that we urgently need to respond to terrorism, and it also considers that this response must go hand in hand with strict protection for human rights. When we speak of human rights, we mean a strict, pragmatic view of human rights, not merely an abstract, virtual debate. If we agree to abandon that long-established level of protection for human rights and regard for these fundamental rights, we shall have given the terrorists their first resounding victory, that is to say that we shall have shown that our values – values on which we claim our Western civilisation is founded – are actually fragile, shaky and utterly partial. Mr Clarke, allow me to put to you some questions that have arisen in part from certain omissions that we noticed in your speech. Commissioner Frattini has appropriately spoken about prevention, and hence about seeking causes. This Parliament would like to know whether it can have an answer to a plain and simple question: was the war one of the causes that led to the spread of terrorism on this planet, or not? ‘Reaction’ is the word Mr Frattini used. Our question, however, is whether there is a limit to the use of forms of summary justice, as Mr Watson mentioned. That is not an abstract or philosophical question. A judicial inquiry is under way in several countries – we were talking about it just yesterday, Minister – in Sweden, Germany and Italy, regarding the responsibility of the US secret service and the compliance of European secret services in the kidnapping of a number of European and non-European citizens, who were taken to Egypt, Syria and other Middle Eastern countries to be interrogated and tortured, and in some cases killed. What is the Council’s position with regard to the inquiries that are under way? We are aware of the Commission’s position, which is very clear: it will not tolerate any further human rights violations of such seriousness. Lastly, Minister, is the principle of proportionality still valid in the European institutions? Many of my fellow Members have asked questions about data retention, and at the moment we have two radically different ideas, two different approaches. On the one hand the Commission talks to us of specific purposes under the control of an independent authority; on the other the Council intends to collect all data without any kind of selection. Where will the balance lie; what will the role of this Parliament be in establishing this balance; and more generally what will the political role of this Parliament be? Will we only be called on to agree and ratify decisions, or will we also be able to fulfil our safeguarding role? We would appreciate an answer to these questions, Minister.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too thank the Commissioner and the other rapporteurs. I believe that we have devised a path of work that benefits everyone, including in view of the quality of the reports that we are submitting to the vote in Parliament. I am dealing with the European Regional Development Fund, which is without doubt the most important of the Structural Funds in terms of quantity of resources. It was set up 30 years ago and has the crucial task of correcting the regional imbalances present throughout Europe. It is a task laid down by an article of the Treaty, pointing out to us the requirement for, and the necessity of, a Europe founded on solidarity and on the ability to create equal opportunities and fair conditions, particularly now that we find ourselves faced with the challenge of enlargement. The ten new Member States represent a large resource in terms of the quality of policies, a significant step forward in the history of Europe. We must also remember, however, that regional imbalances are becoming worse. Right now, a third of all of Europe’s resources belong to a geographical area covering only a tenth of the European Union, and we have recorded a doubling in the number of regions eligible to come under Objective 1, that is, regions with a high level of structural imbalances and economic difficulties. That is therefore the fundamental task of a policy of engagement and solidarity. If the Union were just a free trade area, we could confine ourselves to redistributing the income among the wealthiest regions and the poorest regions. In contrast – and for this I am grateful to the Commissioner – we have the choice of a political, social and economic project entrusted to the Structural Funds, or rather the choice of a development model that, in its entirety, benefits the process of European integration. It is a development model that makes a number of significant choices. It favours the choice of subject matter made in Gothenburg and Lisbon and therefore chooses the path of the knowledge-based economy, knowledge, innovation, scientific research and training, intended as a permanent opportunity throughout people’s entire lives, as well as risk prevention and sustainable development. It is an extremely ambitious project that naturally has one objective that cuts across the others, that is, the quality of spending. Mr President, Commissioner, we have not always spent everything, and, even when we have done, we have not always spent it well. There are regions – including in my country – that have received considerable resources but where there remain the unwavering signs of hardship that they experienced 10, 15 or 20 years ago with regard to employment levels, the quality and interlinking of infrastructures, scientific research and the processes of innovation. It is therefore clear that we have to achieve a great improvement in quality in terms of the adequacy of spending, and, in order for this to occur, we have to select objectives by setting a small number of priorities. It is for that reason that our group is against the wish – which is understandable but unnecessary – of indiscriminately enlarging the fields in which this structural fund may be used. We propose a vote against a number of the amendments that would seek to introduce too many objectives and too many priorities. We propose voting against the understandable desire of a number of Members to include VAT among reimbursable expenses. We do not wish to reopen a debate that has been thoroughly aired in committee, but we believe that value-added tax, as was pointed out by the Council, the Commission and the Court of Accounts, gave rise in the past to significant misuse when a proportion of VAT was reimbursed. We believe in particular that including this would create intolerable inequality among countries with VAT rates varying between 1% and 25%. This also relates to the construction of new housing. We approved an amendment, which we hope will be adopted by the Commission, relating to the construction of social housing. However, to consider that Structural Funds could be generally invested in the construction of housing would mean fundamentally withdrawing resources from such funds. We are satisfied with the results achieved. We have strengthened the role of the partnership, which we consider a great school for teaching civilisation and democratic practice. We have succeeded in ensuring that special attention is also paid to the fight against organised crime and mafia-related crime, laying down the possibility of also using the Structural Funds to create the necessary know-how for tackling the pervasiveness of mafia-related crime. We have also succeeded in ensuring that the principal of non-discrimination applies across the board. On this subject, the rapporteur has tabled only two amendments, the purpose of which is to enhance the unity and consistency of the entire text. I will conclude by pointing out, like Mr Hatzidakis, that the quality of our spending is, however, dependent on the existence of sufficient resources. That is why I believe that this Parliament has to ensure that resources are not withdrawn from solidarity, or rather from the ability to create a Europe that all moves at the same speed. It is not solely a question of a principle laid down in the Treaties, but it is the principle to which we have to entrust the future of the political and economic integration process in Europe.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we must first of all thank Mrs Fraga Estévez for the excellent work she has carried out, and also the Commission for the sensitivity shown in taking account of what happened in the last parliamentary term, when Parliament had maintained that the Commission’s proposal could not be amended. Respect and a degree of humility on both sides have enabled a compromise to be reached. It has been possible to reopen a debate with the fishing organisations. We have succeeded in preventing the Mediterranean from becoming marginalised in comparison with other seas, subject to a host of obligations and bans, amounting merely to a policy designed to penalise. Whilst appreciating the fact that the regulation represents a step forward and useful mediation, however, we believe that, even now, it retains an approach that is still linked – albeit to a lesser degree - to a model of fishing suited to the northern seas. The northern seas are characterised by highly industrialised and single-species fishing, and they have a completely different marine biology to that of the Mediterranean. That is the reason for the long-standing debate – in committee and with you, Commissioner – on various minimum sizes, which we would have liked to fix more decisively: sardines and cod caught in the northern seas do not have the same rate of biological growth as the fish fauna of the Mediterranean. Equally, it is difficult to dictate overly specific limits on fishing gear, since an artisanal activity, carried out by small fleets, varies from country to country partly according to the kinds and variety of traditions. With the implementation of this regulation, we would like to aim at an objective that is rarely achieved: a basin-wide policy, that is, a global approach. That of course involves paying attention to the management and conservation of fishery resources, to anti-pollution efforts and also to the safeguarding of jobs. I would like to point out, Commissioner, that 80% of the fishing carried out in the Mediterranean is small scale and takes place in regions that are mainly located within the area of the former Objective 1: areas experiencing extreme social hardship, high rates of unemployment, and, in many cases, deprived of social support. I believe that particular sensitivity towards maintaining employment levels is a joint mission for the Commission and Parliament. We call on the Council to accept this proposal and to take into due consideration the quantity and quality of the work that it has made possible.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our group has welcomed the Commission’s proposal and believes that the amendments tabled by the rapporteur have been scrupulously drafted. They are in fact based on a fundamental principle concerning the procedural safeguards that are to be harmonised and offered to all those charged in criminal proceedings throughout the European Union: if criminal proceedings are organised at a European scale, then citizens’ rights should also be guaranteed at that level. It is an important principle because it increases mutual trust among the various legal systems, without which there can be no cooperation. As Commissioner Frattini has pointed out, they are minimum but absolutely essential procedural rights: the presence of a legal advisor at all stages of the proceedings, translation of all documents, assistance from an interpreter, and so forth. If these rights were not guaranteed, we would run the risk of seeing unfair or arbitrary trials. Then comes the rub: the issue of exceptions, or the possibility – called for by some of my fellow Members – for the Member States not to apply these guarantees to particularly serious forms of crime such as terrorism. Our group rejects such a solution. The compromise reached in Amendment 4 to recital 8 recognises it, that is, the need for a legal and ethical threshold that the Member States must never cross, not even to combat terrorism: it is a question of human rights, the International Convention on Human Rights and the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights. I therefore consider the argument put forward by a fellow Member regarding the high costs that this reform would generate to be rather ignoble. It is a concern too far, in part because it is very difficult to put a financial value on protecting human rights. We have to do more in the fight against terrorism, but without suppressing the rights of those under investigation and those who have been charged. We cannot accept a two-track system as unfortunately prevails in the United States with, for instance, the Guantánamo affair and the changes to the US judicial system, because Europe’s legal culture and the memory of all that Cesare Beccaria represented for that legal culture mean that one cannot, I believe, announce the end of habeas corpus
. Mr President, terrorism is above all a patent violation of human rights; it would therefore be a paradox for us to want to combat it ourselves by violating the civil rights of those charged or under investigation in such proceedings.

Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, this evening we can celebrate a minor miracle, because in Lebanon, in times past, after the murder of an ex-Prime Minister we would have seen a fresh outbreak of civil war, whereas, on this occasion, Lebanese society has responded with peaceful indignation. For the first time we have seen Druse, Sunni, Shia and Christians demonstrating together. Now, what has been termed ‘the spring of Lebanon’ needs political support, pressure and assistance. It is not sufficient to refer back to dignified or dutiful United Nations resolutions, but instead we need a commitment from these institutions, first and foremost to make President Assad of Syria aware that he has to find the courage to go beyond half-measures. Repositioning a few thousand soldiers in the Bekaa valley, 30 kilometres from Beirut, is not a withdrawal and merely looks like a charade. Commissioner, we know that there will be no peace between Palestine and Israel, or in the Middle East, as long as the Syrian occupation of Lebanon – an offence to the principle of legitimate sovereignty – persists. Since we are convinced that peace, if it is to be genuine, must be based on pluralism, we believe that there must be greater passion and political engagement in support of the peace process and of the restoration of full sovereignty in Lebanon.

 Mr President, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, I do not wish to add anything to the reports by Mr Di Pietro and Mr Costa, with which I am in absolute agreement. I should like, instead, to reflect on a contradiction that we are being called upon to face this evening. Everyone knows that only a strengthening of judicial cooperation can make a significant contribution to the fight against terrorism and organised crime, and that implies mutual recognition of judicial decisions, exchange of information and harmonisation of guarantees relating to legal procedure. We also know, however, that many Member States do all they can to hinder such judicial cooperation in every way. Your mandate, therefore, in our opinion, also consists in standing up to the Council and making sure that all the European institutions firmly adhere to that objective. Greater political will is needed to enable us to carry out what the European Constitution provides for and prescribes, which we do not want to remain unfulfilled. Precisely for the sake of consultation and judicial cooperation, Mr Frattini, we urge you to intervene respectfully but firmly with the Italian Parliament and the Italian Government, partly because you used to be a minister in that government yourself. Italy is the only country not to have implemented the European arrest warrant. Something that might have been just serious until yesterday is, you will agree, an absolute paradox today.

 Madam President, Commissioner, I shall first address the Council, because we have in fact just heard that the Paris Club decided a couple of hours ago to freeze the debt of certain countries affected by the tsunami. We believe this is a short-sighted decision, because we think those countries need not a moratorium but the cancellation of their debt, as had been proposed by almost all the humanitarian aid organisations – Oxfam, ActionAid, etc. You will know more about it than I do, Minister. In that respect I agree with the Commissioner: a different kind of trade policy is needed. Thailand was asking us to lower the cost of accessing international markets, but the West is unbending on that point: protectionist barriers cannot be touched. The last item on the agenda: it is not just Iraq’s debt and that of the countries affected by the tsunami that need to be cancelled urgently. Indeed, it would be a serious matter if the message being sent out to the international community were that it needs to be struck by a war or a natural disaster causing 200 000 deaths in order to be entitled to solidarity from the West.

 Mr President, Commissioner, we feel that it is certainly commendable that immigrants are at last no longer considered a problem, but a resource – as the Green Paper expressly states – and that we are aiming for a permanent multicultural and multireligious dialogue. We are concerned, however, by the productivity approach, as, moreover, you yourself called it in an interview for an Italian newspaper: that is, the decision to make migratory flows conditional on the requirements of the European labour market. The Green Paper inclines towards the possibility – just a possibility, but one which we intend to comment on – of making the admission of an immigrant conditional on a job vacancy which it has not otherwise been possible to fill with European Union workers, or on a Member State’s specific needs in particular employment sectors. Commissioner, do you not agree that application of this principle could mark the end of a common European immigration policy, as well as a step backwards from what many Member States have already achieved?

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to welcome the Commissioner on behalf of our group. Let me come straight to the point. This evening Parliament is being asked to approve the extension of the specific human rights and democracy programme for two years. Our group has no objection in principle. During the recent months of dialogue with the Commission, however, we have placed some political conditions on our assent: that is to say, we want a clear signal from the Commission that you represent to commit to a structured dialogue with Parliament. It is not a question of our claiming management responsibilities that do not fall within this Parliament’s remit, but rather of claiming the power to carry out a political evaluation of this measure and, more generally, of all initiatives relating to the development of democracy and action on human rights. We ask to be able to carry out an ex ante
 evaluation of the priorities of the initiatives and an ex post
 evaluation of their quality and the degree to which they have succeeded in advancing democracy in real terms. In other words, Commissioner, this Parliament is asking to be involved in defining the guidelines for our actions and in judging the effectiveness of the results we obtain. In recent years, many questions have remained unanswered and a great deal of information either has not arrived or has been supplied in a highly summarised form. We do not know the extent of the funds actually spent through this programme, which projects have been concluded, where they were carried out or with what concrete results – because in some countries the funds have been frozen – or indeed what is being done to unfreeze the funds. We do not want to break the sacred rules of comitology, but it is a question of finding a modus operandi
 for a relationship that is not just based on a verbal expression of good will. Commissioner, we appreciate your offer of collaboration, and our willingness to extend the life of this programme should be interpreted as an act of trust. It is important to make it clear that Parliament must not be regarded, as it often is, as a notary who is called in to formally approve the accounts but who has to confine himself to that alone. That is not in the interests either of Parliament or of the Community institutions. In this regard, we believe that this programme should be streamlined and speeded up as much as possible. Greater responsibilities should be given to local non-governmental organisations on the ground, and more emphasis should be placed on microprojects and on certain campaigns that in the past have made some headway in the difficult area of democracy in some countries. We have to work a little harder on democracy, as we have neglected it up to now while focusing our operations on the area of human rights. Naturally, it is also necessary to develop a capacity for dialogue, for which, Commissioner, Parliament will place our trust in you and give you our vote. We hope, however, that from tomorrow this will become a daily dialogue – not just a formality but a dialogue of substance – to assess the decisions that have been made and to define the objectives that we set ourselves.

 Mr President, I am grateful to the Commissioner for her report even though I believe we need to find the courage to establish some figures that tell us what is really happening in Colombia. I direct this particularly to Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, who accuses anyone who does not acknowledge that Colombia has made progress in respect for and quality of human rights in recent years of bad faith. I should like to recall something that Amnesty International wrote only a few months ago, when it pointed out that Colombia is the country where trade unionists run a greater risk than anywhere else in the world: 500 have been killed in the last four years. The High Commissioner for Refugees reminds us that there are three million displaced persons inside the country and that 300 000 people have been forced to flee abroad. In this war of everybody against everybody else – I repeat: everybody against everybody else – everybody is to blame, including the guerrilla groups, of course, but also the armed forces, who in collaboration with the paramilitary groups – I am just saying what the international human rights agencies have told us – are directly involved in the killings, the torture and the intimidation carried out against human rights workers, trade unionists and local community leaders, who are summarily labelled as guerrillas or sympathisers. The government’s strategy in this situation seems dangerously short-sighted. An agreement has been reached only with the paramilitaries: the perdón y olvido
 agreement – forgive and forget. New paramilitary groups have been formed: 150 000 peasant soldiers under direct army and police control. We believe a less short-sighted approach is needed in addressing the problem of Colombia and that we should also consider what has happened in recent years to the Plan Colombia
: USD 500 000 has gone straight into the pockets of a raft of US contractors. The Plan Colombia
, Mr President, has been excellent business for a large number of US companies but much less so for Colombia, which continues to be torn apart by repression and war. I shall conclude by asking the Commissioner, Parliament and our institutions to take a very careful and objective approach when giving support to the peace process in Colombia: in this process and in these negotiations the country cannot do without the involvement of all sides in the conflict – all sides, not just the paramilitaries.

 Mr President, I am grateful to the Council for reminding us that the European Union does not have a candidate in the Ukrainian elections, that our responsibility is undoubtedly to contribute to the holding of democratic elections, and that we must press for a peaceful, political solution to the institutional conflict in Ukraine. We call for the ballot to be repeated and express our solidarity with all Ukrainians, with the whole Ukrainian people. We are not here to support either Mr Yushchenko or Mr Yanukovich, who have both, moreover, been heads of the Ukrainian Government; nor are we here to push for the partitioning of Ukraine between the East and the West, but to guarantee the territorial integrity of the country. I find this contrast between the good guys and the bad guys rather nauseating. Who are we to say that the democratic good guys are the Kiev students and the bad guys are the miners coming to protest in Kiev? We need to make a non-simplistic interpretation of what is happening in Ukraine. Unfortunately, Ukraine is already a geographically divided country, in which the Russian population makes up 33% of the total population. In view of these figures – which are similar to those we find in Iraq, where the Sunni population makes up 33% of the total Iraqi population – we need to find a political solution that seeks to hold the two parts together and allows the president who is to be elected – and we want to see him elected in a democratic election – to be president of the whole country. The danger now is not just that the country may split, Mr President, but that there may be civil war. I have the feeling that the spirit of Yalta is perilously alive in this Parliament and that the only objective is to drag all or part of Ukraine into the western sphere of influence. I do not agree with that. The strength and the responsibility of the European Union is not to fight for the causes of the West but to fight for the cause of democracy and to play a part in helping the President of Ukraine to be truly the president of the whole Ukrainian people.

Mr President-elect of the Commission, the replacement of Commissioner Buttiglione is certainly a step forward but it is a goodwill gesture which, in our judgement, is still not enough. We are still somewhat baffled by the decision to appoint Mrs Kroes to the Competition portfolio, even though you know that that office will clearly result in a situation where a conflict of interest may arise. In an executive, and I can tell you this from the painful experience of the Italian Government, conflicts of interest give rise to the worst sort of politics. Finally, there is still some opposition to some of the fundamental political choices that you presented to us in July: I refer to the ambiguity on the subjects of war and peace, to the excessive emphasis that you place on the market and on competitiveness, and to the acceleration that you wish to impose on the processes of liberalisation. I allude to some of the political choices that we would equate, if I may say so, Mr President, clearly with the right. For these reasons, Mr Barroso, you will not have our vote of confidence tomorrow.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think the figures and numbers that Mrs Hybašková and Mrs Morgantini have given us need no comment but just deserve our absolute respect. I shall be more cautious in seeing the shadow of al-Qaeda behind every conflict that breaks out on this earth. I am not particularly interested in President Bush’s definition of genocide or in deciding on a point of law as to whether we are dealing with genocide in this case. I am much more interested, as other Members have said, in what we can do and what we must not do. What we certainly can do is envisage direct, rigorous sanctions, such as an arms embargo or an appeal to the International Criminal Court, as Mrs Bonino has suggested, in order to seek a political solution. Of course, we must at all costs avoid creating the preconditions for a military intervention, even though it would be justified on humanitarian grounds. Mr President, we are all aware that the history of recent years, from Bosnia to Iraq, has been that of the arbitrary and often counterproductive use of force to resolve crises. That is an option to be avoided, most of all because we would risk turning this region into a never-ending war zone.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our debate today is particularly important, as we know, for two reasons: firstly, because we are talking about one of the substances that has caused most harm and deaths among citizens and workers at the plants where it is used and produced, namely asbestos. Secondly, because we are debating one of the first measures to implement the extremely significant regulation that has, in a way, marked this parliamentary term, that is to say REACH. With the question we have asked and the draft resolution we will vote on today – let me say straight away to reassure the Commission and Vice-President Tajani who is here on its behalf – we are not opposing the draft implementing regulation that the Commission has adopted on this issue. I refer to Point 2.6 of this draft measure, which provides the missing Annex 17 that should have reproduced the provisions of Annex 1 of Directive 76 – the directive on dangerous substances, which will be replaced by REACH, and therefore repealed – this Point 2.6 extends the ban on the placing on the market of asbestos fibres and products containing asbestos. The truth is that in this same decision, however, there are exemptions, to be granted by certain Member States – for the record, there are four of them – who may keep articles marketed before 2005 on the market, as well as diaphragms containing chrysotile asbestos used in production at existing electrolysis plants. The possibility of using these exemptions is of course subject to the Member States’ compliance with all the Community rules on worker protection, effectively meaning that these plants, coming to the end of their lifecycle, do not generate problems for workers’ health. There is a reason why we are not opposed to this: these exemptions do exist, but we must acknowledge that the Commission has provided a mechanism, so to speak, by which these exemptions will in time – in 2012, to be exact – be reviewed through reports to be made by the Member States concerned, on the basis of which the European Chemicals Agency will prepare a dossier providing for the gradual withdrawal of the exemptions. Thus we are not opposed, but certainly with our resolution we want to give you in the Commission a strong impetus to be a bit bolder, to go a bit further and a bit faster, shall we say, above all bearing in mind that there are already alternatives to chrysotile asbestos, at least for high-voltage plants, and in fact the companies concerned have launched promising research programmes to find alternatives for low-voltage plants also. There are two aims to our stimulus and our input. The first is to set ourselves a date, a deadline – we are proposing 2015 – by which to lift these exemptions, launching a real withdrawal strategy, including measures that will then be required to demolish these plants in safety and also ensure safety as regards export. Lastly, the second thing we are asking the Commission – and we would appreciate a reply on this, too – concerns a point that is critical for us, namely the fact that a Community list of articles containing asbestos for which an exemption applies has not yet been adopted, and so we are of course asking for this as soon as possible, by 2012, to enable better control and a better understanding.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my sentiments exactly. I, too, would like to make a personal comment. First of all, however, I must acknowledge that the Commission’s answer to the specific questions we are asking in our resolution has been positive, for the most part. It will, of course, be down to the new Parliament to check and ensure that the commitments outlined are met, and within the time periods provided. On a personal note, I would like to say two things. Firstly, my best wishes go to Mr Bowis, with whom we have worked a great deal. Perhaps the two of us could form a club of European Parliament observers, especially to follow those matters on which we have done so much work together, and seen great fruit, I believe. Secondly, I have to say, somewhat symbolically, the fact that my last speech in this House should be on REACH and its application, which has occupied my time since the beginning of this parliamentary term, when it seemed we would never come to the end of that legislative journey, well, it shows that I am a lucky man, fortunate also to have known people like yourselves and like you, Mr President; working together we have come to a real understanding and have produced what I believe are truly significant results for European citizens.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Roth-Behrendt did an excellent job of explaining our group’s position and, in particular, outlined perfectly why we very much appreciate how much ground has been covered in improving this text. She also made it clear, however, how important it is to go the last mile, namely a dual legal basis and a clearer and stronger rightful possibility for Member States to have prior authorisation with regard to hospital treatment. So, in short, let us not keep having this discussion, since we are very familiar with this directive, having discussed it for months. I would like to ask two particularly political questions, since it is decision-making time. The first question is to Commissioner Vassiliou: exactly what does the Commission think about the dual legal basis? Secondly, I am addressing in particular the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats – I am sorry that my friend John Bowis is not here, as we solved a great many issues during this parliamentary term with him as coordinator of the main groups of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and I too, of course, wish him a speedy recovery – I would ask the PPE-DE Group and also, I think, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe: do you consider it better to proceed to the second reading without the vote of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament? Without a large majority? I therefore call on you to give serious thought to Amendments 116 and 125 on the dual legal basis and Amendments 156 and 118 on prior authorisation. If these documents are approved we will vote in favour; it will not be possible any other way. It is up to you to consider and choose the outcome you want to see.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one minute is only enough for a telegram. The title of mine, which I shall send to the European Council, has already been conveyed by Mr Schulz and Mr Rasmussen, who said that more must be done, above all with regard to the social emergency, through new tough financial and fiscal policies. Let me add an additional message: it is, of course, vitally important as we go through this crisis to minimise the social impact, but it is also important to hold a firm course so that we will know whether we are to emerge from it as winners or losers in terms of global competition, which will become increasingly fierce in the search for a new green, smart, low-carbon economy. Therefore, all measures at all levels, from local to European, must be consistent with this objective. The Council needs to give a strong mandate for the negotiations in the run-up to Copenhagen so that we do not miss this opportunity, which is also an economic one. The mandate must be supported with the necessary funding of developing countries that will enable them to join with us.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all,7 I would like to clarify that I am speaking in place of our shadow rapporteur, who is unfortunately unable to be with us today, but I am able to give the united position of our group. We fully support the compromise, which is the product of more than a year’s work. Our thanks for this go to Mr Krahmer, who has played a very important role, listening carefully and even revising his initial positions. This compromise will lead to a greater degree of protection and lend support to European industry, partly by introducing flexibility. As has already been said, the focal point of this consensus, this agreement, consolidates and extends the application of the BAT or best available techniques, reinforcing the rules and making them more transparent. The minimum requirements proposed for large combustion plants must be met in order to apply the BATs and air quality criteria to this sector. This is why, for our part, we are saying that the amendments tabled in plenary must not be carried. They weaken the compromise, particularly those aimed at narrowing the scope of the IPPC, the application of the BAT and the requirements for large combustion plants. I must emphasise that our group, albeit after an animated internal discussion, has decided not to table any amendments. Therefore, we invite others to do the same and not to support the amendments that have been tabled in order to send out a strong, clear message at first reading.

 Mr President, as I said earlier, I am in favour of this proposal, although I would like to point out that if amendments had not been tabled that go somewhat beyond what was adopted on the basis of a general compromise within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, this problem would not have arisen, since the compromise amendments were completely in keeping with the nature of this revision, namely a recast. If this had been the case, then we could have voted today, but we accept the deferral as it makes sense.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, those Members who have spoken before me have demonstrated well how we have managed to bring together very diverse opinions, which have been merged into a common draft. The Florenz report, which deserves recognition for its success in achieving this consensus by listening carefully to all points of view, is ultimately about energy reconversion and general change in production systems, lifestyles and consumption. It is more than just a philosophical statement and we know that it will not be an easy ride, but it envisages rapprochement in stages. For example, there are indications in the legacy that we are leaving to the next Parliament of what we believe should be the priorities for action in the next parliamentary term, in the run-up to Copenhagen and beyond. I would, however, like to focus on the content. I feel it is my duty first and foremost to thank the key player in this work, the secretariat. I have here some statistics on our work. To give you an idea of how important their job was, I need only say that they organised eight thematic sessions with sixty of the world’s leading experts. Now, most importantly, I should like to make an appeal, that is express my hopes, for the new Parliament. President Pöttering, you yourself demonstrated your belief that the gamble of this committee would pay off – even though, if the truth be told, it did not find favour with everyone in this Parliament when it was created 18 months ago. You appealed to the House on two separate occasions, illustrating your personal support for this subject and for our task, and so I will address you directly, if you will allow me. It would be a shame if the next Parliament did not create a similar instrument in the next parliamentary term, not least because in the meantime many national parliaments and governments have restructured their work, with climate change as a specific field. Therefore, I hope that the next Parliament will not go back to strict compartmentalisation, where connected areas are separated into different committees, but that, as we have recommended, it will prepare itself for the long ride to a lower carbon economy.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Vondra and Mr Verheugen for their promptness in making these statements. I have to say that for the most part I share their concern and agree with the realistic approach they propose. After all, we are all aware of the situation. I have seen one estimate saying that 2 million jobs could potentially be lost in the course of the year in the car industry as a whole, the majority of which would be in the parts sector. We are witnessing an extraordinary contradiction. On the one hand, we have a fleet of public and private vehicles – as you have rightly said – that is very obsolete and has high emission levels, while, on the other hand, demand has slowed down dramatically, if not collapsed entirely. I therefore very much welcome the recovery plan decided on by the Commission, which has sought to use all the tools at its disposal, although we know that they are limited, and we understand the reasons why. There is a real need for a genuinely counter-cyclical move to stimulate demand and provide it with strong support, in line with the environmental targets that we have worked so hard on over the last few months. And what happens? What happens is that each country acts independently. Some intervene while others do nothing; for example, my country has done nothing so far. Some do one thing, others do another. I agree with you, however, that we should make an effort ahead of the Competition Council next spring to maximise coordination, at least on principles, for example linking scrapping schemes to specific emissions targets. I think that France has come up with a good solution of varying the bonus awarded to purchasers according to the emissions level of the car purchased. This would, I believe, make for a ‘win-win’ situation in terms of employment, innovation, competitiveness and the environment.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have ‘saved the best for last’, as they say. This report was the first to be finished, exactly two weeks ago, and strangely enough it is the last to be debated. First of all and quite sincerely I must thank everyone who has worked on this report, particularly the delegation, among many, from the French Presidency. I too would like to mention Mr Léglise-Costa, who led this initiative with great professionalism. Together we have found an intelligent solution to the issue, at perhaps the most difficult time imaginable, that is to say when the motor industry is in the throes of an appalling crisis. On close examination, this result was by no means a foregone conclusion, not least considering how this report’s journey began, with all the controversy when the Commission adopted the corresponding proposal last December. Yet we have succeeded not only in seeing it through, but also in achieving three things at once: we have stepped up our efforts, enhanced our strategy and introduced greater flexibility. I say we have stepped up our efforts because, as you know, the priority proposed by Parliament has been agreed; that is to say, a long-term reduction target has been included, of 95 grams of CO2
 per kilometre by 2020. This is obviously important because it brings this sector into line with others covered by other legislative instruments such as the emissions trading scheme, but also, and above all, because it allows companies to plan their investment, innovation and research accordingly, which I believe is crucial at this difficult time. Secondly, I say we have enhanced our strategy for the reasons that Mrs Corbey explained a short while ago: we have in fact helped to shape the future by encouraging eco-innovations and subjecting them to rigorous controls; we have encouraged research into new engines, or new fuels, shall we say; and we have introduced a system of super credits for vehicles with exceptionally low emissions. This opens up a strategic outlook that will, of course, hinge on the review in 2015 of the testing systems used to produce accurate and credible measurements of how much the various technologies help to reduce emissions. Finally, we have introduced greater flexibility, as I said, because, as we have managed to strengthen the regulation, it has been possible, reasonable and fair to allow businesses to take a gradual approach, phasing in the new measures between 2012 and 2015. At the same time, as you will be aware, we have reformulated the procedures in such a way that they still enable us to persuade companies to make investments that will put them in a position to meet their own specific reduction targets, while at the same time facilitating their transition to the new system. I would like to say again how pleased I am with this proposal; it is, I believe, a great work of industrial policy. It is shame that we do not have the power or all the tools we need to be able to intervene with other instruments or other levers, and I hope that under the Commission’s coordination all the Member States will adopt intelligent policies to encourage demand, using forms of eco-taxation, for instance, as the French Government has done for its part, in order to prevent any distortion of competition. This would be an extremely useful additional measure in terms of replacing existing, obsolete vehicles, while permitting more efficient cars to be placed on the market on a large scale. I hope that today we will also have the pleasure of finding out the Commission’s opinion on this compromise, since up to now it has not been stated officially.
 Guido Sacconi,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, here is a simple calculation that anyone can do on their own, with paper and pen. Given that the average CO2
 emissions from cars sold in 2005 were 159 grams per kilometre, on the basis of this regulation introducing a binding target for 2020 of 95 grams per kilometre, we will have cut the average emissions from cars sold by 38% in 2020. It is quite easy to work out, and you do not need an impact assessment to get the answer. I think it is extraordinary. My apologies to those of you who have praised me and thanked me for my work and who approve of this compromise, which seems to me to be a large majority of you, but allow me to address mainly the dissenters and our friends from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, namely Mr Davies, who are once again demonstrating their inability to take responsibility. They just call for wonderful targets, but when it comes to decision time, they leave it to us to decide. Well, I only hope that the same farce does not begin that I had over REACH (the Regulation on chemicals and their safe use), because these same groups said that REACH too was giving in, that it was a betrayal. A month later it was heralded on their websites as a great environmental success for the Union, making the EU the world leader, we might say, in the control of chemical substances. I hope that this time I will be spared such a farce. Thank you, Mr Borloo, and Mr Dimas, too; your opinion as you expressed it is clear and will help us bring this difficult work to its conclusion with tomorrow’s vote.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank my fellow Members, starting with my group chairman, Mr Schulz, who rightly highlighted the result attained last Monday with the agreement on the regulation laying down the requirement to reduce CO2
 emissions from motor vehicles. I would like to explain why, intentionally and in agreement with the French Presidency, which has done a wonderful job – I wanted to say so informally – why, to stay on a car theme, I speeded up the securing of this agreement, putting my foot on the throttle, so to speak. This was for two reasons: the first is because I felt it important for the package to move forward, at least on one issue, to show that it really is possible – difficult, but possible – to reconcile different requirements: protection of the environment and combating climate change, on the one hand, and the economic dimension of competitiveness and social issues, as well as employment, on the other. We are aware of the extent of the current crisis in the motor industry, and doing this at this point in time sends an extremely important signal. However, I put my foot on the throttle for another reason too. I thought that it would be much better to conclude this dossier ahead of the European Council next week so that, if I may put it bluntly, no one can put their oar in. No head of state or government will be able to get their hands on the regulation. I am addressing my fellow Members who, like Mr Davies, have criticised this agreement, but have not realised that it would also have been better if the other dossiers – such as Mr Davies’s dossier, where everything is already in place to reach an agreement – had already been concluded. I would like to tell you something, Mr Borloo, if you will allow me one moment longer: we do not always manage to reach unanimity here, so take heart, and do not allow a similar situation to what happened yesterday on renewables, where one country, unfortunately my own, vetoed the proposal, thereby making an agreement impossible.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will not take up a great deal of your time because this is a well-known topic. We are talking about the pre-registration of chemical substances, a preliminary stage, in fact the first stage in implementing REACH, which is very important. This is because it offers companies the opportunity to establish the right to apply a transitional regime, in other words, stagger the times specified for registering substances. This is a more demanding procedure which above all, even more importantly, can lead to the formation of groups of companies for sharing data. This means that data can be presented jointly by producers of the same substance. As we are all well aware, we have received information to the effect that, compared to the initial forecasts which the REACH system was based on, the number of pre-registrations has not only been high, but actually far higher than predicted. We were talking in terms of a few hundred thousand, but the number of substances which have been pre-registered, and the Commissioner will certainly give us the exact figures for this, has probably passed the million mark. This presents a problem for us as it also raises a lot of questions about the causes of this explosion, or phenomenon you might say, which could even be positive. The main thing we know is that this avalanche of data, though still preliminary basic information, has severely tested the ability of the newly formed European Chemicals Agency in Helsinki to handle it. Our question then is exactly this: we want to know how these problems were tackled, what kind of structure has been set up if problems have been caused for the companies who have been very anxious, for want of a better term, about being able to meet the deadline. The deadline for submitting these pre-registrations expired at 12 midnight on 1 December. We also want to know what are the Commission's analysis and initial assessment of this phenomenon and what problems it may well cause during the next phase of implementing this regulation.
 Guido Sacconi,

 Madam President, I would first of all like to thank the Commissioner because I found that the answers he gave were very persuasive. I understand in particular that this explosion of pre-registrations obviously reflects an important aspect of this matter, as he himself said. We have had problems because REACH has even been operating too efficiently and has uncovered substances that are actually unknown, which are starting to pop up. I would like to ask a question, if I may, which is perhaps premature as it is not possible yet to probably have the relevant data and an assessment of this matter. After all, we always thought that the system would more or less include somewhere around 30 000 substances. In light of the number of pre-registrations, are you able right now or in the near future to quantify the number of substances which will be entered in the system via pre-registration? The reason for this question is because faced with a significant increase in this number at the moment, this should obviously make us think about how subsequent phases are going to operate.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in a situation such as this one, where we are all in agreement, our debate risks becoming repetitive. For my part, I would just like to make three very brief political points, since I fully agree with what my fellow Members have said. The first point naturally is recognition for the perseverance that our rapporteur has shown since the start. From the very first meetings, she has demonstrated a political determination to close the dossier at first reading, and in fact she has almost forced us to do so, by twisting our arms. However, we were all convinced that this was necessary if we were to introduce legislation swiftly to obtain an immediate classification of all substances and make a real step towards tougher standards to protect consumer health and – I agree on this point – the health of workers who use these substances in many different sectors, particularly in the more difficult context of a small business. Secondly, we have avoided the increasing danger of reopening old discussions that had been shelved with the adoption of REACH, something that I was particularly keen to see. At an international level, I believe that even the fact that REACH is increasingly being used as a benchmark at international level by other countries, which are using it as a model to adapt their own legislation, is extremely satisfying. In any case, the provisions relating to the classification of substances that we are about to vote on must be adapted and integrated so that they correspond to the principal regulation on the classification, labelling, and packaging of substances and mixtures without adding any new elements. Ultimately this means, as all my fellow Members will know, that the GHS is not the last word on the subject of the classification and labelling of substances. There has been much discussion of PDT. We must not forget that this is an ongoing process. For now we are implementing what we already have, and classifying substances on which the UN has already carried out a risk analysis. As soon as we have new risk categories and the results of new studies, the GHS will be updated accordingly, so this is an ongoing process.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I just wanted to say that the chance you have given us to vote again on Amendment 27 has made it possible to put right an injustice, because in this way we were able to vote for Amendment 92 which, if Amendment 27 had really been adopted, would have lapsed. It therefore seems to me that this decision was extremely wise and democratic.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am helped by the fact that Mrs Jackson and Commissioner Dimas have given a full explanation of the main elements of this compromise, which I also support. Let me therefore put forward some eminently political thoughts. I am a negotiator and I always ponder whether or not the compromise that has been reached is valid. I therefore read the texts again with a fresh mind, following the night of the negotiations. Goodness only knows why negotiations always have to end at night. Is an agreement reached in the morning of less value? There is food for thought there as well. In all sincerity – and I say this to our Green and GUE colleagues, and to Karl-Heinz Florenz who I see has re-tabled an amendment from the Environment Committee which bore my signature and which I cannot therefore but support – in all sincerity, looking at both the compromise and the Environment Committee texts, we have achieved – and the main credit goes to you, Mrs Jackson – a really amazing result. Are we aware that there was nothing about recycling in the Commission proposal and then in the common position? Nothing apart from a recital which mentioned the recycling society without going into further detail. There was nothing! Now we have precise targets; we have a review in 2014 when other materials, not covered at present, could be included; we know for sure, as Commissioner Dimas has just confirmed it, that legal action can be taken against States failing to implement the measures planned to achieve those targets. That seems a very important fact to me. It is also very important that a political and legal process has finally been set in motion to compel States to draw up genuine waste prevention plans, and that a hierarchy of waste disposal which respects the environment has finally been included in European law, and is legally binding, making waste no longer just a problem but a resource. In all honesty, therefore, and shouldering our full responsibility, I believe that rejecting this compromise and heading for a risky conciliation would not be in the interest of European citizens, but would turn the achievement and establishment of these targets, set out here in a clear and absolutely incontrovertible way, into a kind of Russian roulette.
 Guido Sacconi  (PSE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too of course add my voice to those of my fellow Members who have expressed thanks and appreciation for the work done by our rapporteur, Karl-Heinz Florenz. I would also like to thank, informally, all Members and political groups who are working and have worked very intensively this year for the Temporary Committee on Climate Change which has genuinely forged a very strong, staunch climate of unity beyond the fringe areas of discord which do nevertheless exist. This gives me reason for hope because a summary of all the material we have gathered already and the material we are gathering for the final report will be forthcoming, and this will, in short, allow us to pass on a healthy legacy to the future Parliament which it can use to carry out the work it must do in line with the truly overarching vision which is so necessary on this matter. What we have today is the first chapter, the placing on record of the state of scientific knowledge on this issue. We should be clear that this does not mean that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a scientific movement, but a forum where, following years of work, all scientific literature on the subject has been considered and a summary, an audit, has been made, reaching levels of probability in various areas, various assessments, which have very rapidly attained almost 100%, an unprecedented state of affairs, I believe, in the history of science. I believe that this is also of concern from a wider point of view; it could be regarded to some degree as a model for establishing an intelligent relationship, if I may be so bold, between scientific knowledge and political decision-making in respect of the extraordinary complexity of the issues facing the world today. Climate change is happening, it is happening fast, and therefore we must act promptly and, as Karl-Heinz rightly said, it is not only a problem but an opportunity. This knowledge is precisely the basis upon which, in the space of one year, Commissioner Dimas, the world political climate has also changed, and global warming is not the only thing to have happened. The world political climate has changed, culminating in Bali with an acknowledgement by everyone of the validity of the IPCC research and, in recent months, of truly important changes in the positions taken by leaders. Some of our work also involved carrying out several visits to China, India and recently to Washington in the United States, and we were able to seize upon what, as you noted, the Presidential candidates have stated very clearly, namely that there will be a very different commitment even in the United States over the coming months which really gives rise to hope for the international negotiations which are due to conclude in Copenhagen in 2009. I agree with you on that point and we are producing results which were unimaginable only one year ago.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, you are well aware that, within a few days, ten to be precise, the first implementation phase of REACH will begin. This is the phase for the pre-registration of substances. In view of, shall we say, this solemn moment, we, as you know, were annoyed about the definition of testing in the REACH implementing regulation. This was because one of the objectives of REACH which we secured with no small difficulty in the course of the legislative process and inter-institutional negotiations was precisely the promotion of alternative methods to animal tests. When we saw that the draft implementing regulation did not include a series of tests scientifically validated by the ECVAM (European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods) because, firstly, they have not yet been approved for regulatory purposes, and secondly, some of them, three of the five, were referred back for validation to the OECD, we were, I repeat, very cross. It is only right that REACH should proceed as scheduled, but it is also right for it to set off on the right foot in terms of compliance with the spirit and purpose of this most important regulation. In the meantime, as you know, there have been talks between us and on 5 May Parliament received a letter, signed by Commissioner Dimas on your behalf and on behalf of the Commissioner for Research as well, which gave interesting and binding responses to our questions and to our notional opposition to this regulation. We must acknowledge that a solid way of accelerating, rationalising and where necessary, making these processes for validating alternative methods more transparent is envisaged Our debate this evening will now become a touch more formal. I am sure that you will confirm these undertakings and thus make it possible for us to adopt our resolution tomorrow, as amended in the meantime. Upon so doing, in light of the commitment which I am asking you to confirm, there will cease to be any opposition to the regulation. Instead, note will be taken of those undertakings, but we will continue the call both for confirmation of those commitments as a matter of urgency and for the regulation to be amended as soon as possible so that it can, at the earliest opportunity, include the alternative tests, which will have been fully validated in the meantime. Thank you, I think I have even finished before time, allowing us to proceed more quickly with our work.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have no doubt whatsoever that it is vital for the European Parliament finally to take a thorough look at the issue of adapting to climate change, the scale of which we have in truth underestimated until now. The Commission's Green Paper has therefore given us a valuable opportunity to examine this subject. As everyone now knows, we are engaged in a very tough battle to do our best to mitigate global warming, and we are discussing a legislative package which should enable us to take a major step towards this goal. We are nevertheless aware that the effects of climate change are already being felt in many parts of the world, especially in the poorest areas as well as in large parts of our own continent and the European Union. It is therefore necessary to react by developing an appropriate policy which goes in the right direction without conflicting with the primary goal of, I repeat, reducing emissions and mitigating global warming. I believe some very significant progress was made in Bali from this point of view, given that it was decided to provide finance for the Global Environment Fund, specifically earmarking a share of the CDM to financing adaptation projects in developing countries. I have also read, if I am not mistaken, that the programme of work drawn up last week in Bangkok to follow on from Bali – Bangkok being the first major meeting since Bali – has scheduled another meeting in Bonn this June to focus specifically on the subject of adaptation. The reason why I have singled out this aspect, the international dimension, is that it seemed to me, when drafting the resolution adopted in the CLIM Committee and now being put before this House for its appraisal, that international cooperation was the top priority. The European Union must set about developing cooperation and financial, technical and scientific collaboration with the countries most in need of help, countries less well-equipped to confront the sometimes devastating effects of global warming. We need only think of the Pacific islands: we held a hearing which was attended by representatives from some of those countries, and they explained to us how precarious their situation already is now. Another priority is of course to strike a careful balance so as to preserve a dynamic link between mitigation and adaptation. The third priority is to stimulate research and experimentation. There is still insufficient know-how, given the extreme diversity of territorial situations, to properly gauge the likely effects of global warming; hence it is difficult to devise long-term policies to adapt to and prevent the most worrying developments. The key point over the next few years will of course be dovetailing these policies with others, which calls for political resolve on the part of all players at all levels. We have emphasised in particular the rethink that is needed in order to factor climate change into our cohesion policies, a rethink that must begin with the adaptation of agricultural policies and, more generally, land management policies. On this point I think we should back the amendment that has been tabled, calling on the Council to adopt a common position on the soil protection directive at long last. Finally - I think I am still within the five minutes, Mr President - I also believe it is very important to find the right balance, as it were, between European policies and action at local level. The principle of subsidiarity must be interpreted dynamically and not in a bureaucratic fashion. The extreme diversity of situations in Europe means that no single policy can be drawn up. We have the southern areas of Europe, of course, and also the Alpine belt, where the effects are very different and very significant. The various committees must therefore establish a very close one-to-one relationship with regional authorities. I am thinking of large-scale regional bodies such as the Alpine Convention and the Carpathian Convention, which are developing some very worthwhile initiatives and can be used as a model for international cooperation. Thank you, Commissioner. I hope you will tell us how work is progressing on the preparation of the White Paper, after the consultation held on the Green Paper.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say at once that I completely agree with the statements that Minister Podobnik and Commissioner Dimas gave a short while ago. We see them more and more frequently and shortly we shall be able to communicate in nods and winks, without speaking and without interpreters, because, it seems to me, we understand each other very well. I also agree with what they said concerning the fact that the additional responsibilities taken on by the European Union during the Bali Conference puts us under an obligation to play our part with even more coherence than before. However, today we are discussing Bali and on this issue we should pause for a moment, as, perhaps even tomorrow, we will approve a resolution that seems to me to be well put together. The most accurate opinion that I have come across concerning Bali was one that had been written by Mr de Boer, who, as you know, is the executive director of the Framework Convention. He wrote about the fall of the ‘Berlin Wall of climate change’. This seems to me to be highly appropriate since, at Bali, as we have been reminded, a road map to Copenhagen was decided, with sufficiently precise stages and outlines. Specifically, and this is something I would like to emphasise, the issue of adaptation was discussed, even before 2012, as also increased financing. There was specific discussion of technology transfer, the issue of deforestation was included, but above all, and for me this is the most important and most promising issue, the barrier – hence the ‘Berlin Wall’ – of Annex 1 was overcome between industrialised countries and developing countries in a world that has changed, in which a good number of those that were developing countries are now experiencing massive growth. In summary, the game of pass the parcel played by the USA, India and China so as not to do anything has, we could say, been exposed, and for this reason a situation has come about in which difficult negotiations – they will certainly be difficult – have a good possibility of reaching a successful conclusion.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would emphasise the significance of the fact that you, Mr President, decided to come and inform us in real time about the adoption of the package that has been so painstakingly put together; one might even say made to measure. Let us not forget that this package goes hand-in-hand with another decision that you adopted in December: I mean the proposal for a regulation on vehicles, which in a sense forms part of this package. I shall not comment on the content of the package itself, since I have the bad habit of judging texts once I am familiar with them and have examined and assessed all their details. We shall attempt to find out whether you have struck the right balance, or whether there is a need for any further fine-tuning or improvement. On the whole, it seems to me that the set of proposals corresponds to the principles and objectives suggested by both Parliament and the Council in recent months. I would however raise one political point - already alluded to by Mr Musacchio - which affects all of us. I agree with his verdict on Bali. The glass is neither half full nor half empty, but it was a major political success. Just three months earlier, no one would have bet even a cent on it. The EU confirmed its world leadership role on that occasion, yet its responsibilities have thereby been heightened. Our responsibilities have increased: we cannot go to Poznan and then Copenhagen with empty hands. We must go with facts. You have played your part by drawing up this package, but now it is up to the legislators - Parliament and the Council - to adopt it and translate it into binding standards. That will be no easy matter in the short time available to us. This legislative period has entered its final phase, rather as CO2 emissions should do in 2015, when they ought to peak before starting to fall, that is. We have already reached that ceiling. As a result, there needs to be some kind of informal agreement, a special working procedure, to ensure that most of this package is wrapped up before the end of the parliamentary term; otherwise we will be empty-handed when it comes to negotiating the Bali follow-up phases. This therefore affects Parliament, which must play its part by avoiding wherever possible conflicts of competence which waste months. It also affects the Council, which - as has happened in other cases - could embark on informal cooperation with us at a very early stage. However, it also affects you: you came along a little late today because you evidently had matters to discuss. If other dossiers that I have been involved in are anything to go by, it would be a good thing if the Commission could present a united front towards the outside world.

 Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure that I do not need to remind you of the importance of the Conference of the Parties in Bali which is now imminent and in view of which we have asked for further information on your strategy, on the line that you intend to take. As the European Union, we are independently committed to an extraordinary effort, if I may put it that way, even though we know that it does not represent the ultimate solution. Our shared goal is to keep global warming within two degrees of levels in pre-industrial times, fully aware that this is a high-risk threshold, and that it will be necessary for some areas of the world, for some parts of Europe, to make provision, as planned, for a policy of adaptation. If we really want to pursue this difficult goal, however, we know that a new international treaty is absolutely crucial. As we know, the European Union’s burden of responsibility is limited (14% of global greenhouse gas emissions). A new international treaty taking account of the changes that have taken place since Kyoto, in particular the extraordinary and explosive growth of the Asian giants: indeed, Bali is a crucial step in that direction, and while it will not be the place at which agreement is reached, it will be the place at which negotiations will start and it will therefore be very important for Bali to come up with a clear negotiating mandate, with precise deadlines, with a view to conclusion by 2009. In recent months, the world context has changed from the political, economic and cultural point of view, from the IPCC reports whose final synthesis will be released at the end of this week, and is to be presented in Valencia, to the award of the Nobel Prize to Al Gore and the IPCC’s scientists. A great deal has changed in recent months and we can therefore be optimistic, albeit in a critical and vigilant way. I would therefore like to sum up the purport of the resolution which we have drawn up and which we are sure will be adopted in this House tomorrow by a large majority; it is an offering, an offering to the negotiators to help them to take a tougher line as these negotiations are being launched. I would like to thank Mrs Hassi who, with the other rapporteurs, has managed to provide a synthesis, to prevent the whole thing from becoming an overdressed Christmas tree. The focus is very much on those negotiations and that is how we put it before you.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to give Mrs Jackson and Mr Blokland my most sincere thanks for the work they have done. They led us by the hand, so to speak, to reach a consensus supported by a huge majority in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and to achieve a result that was by no means a foregone conclusion at the outset: improving the consistency of two documents, one on the recycling strategy and the other on the proposed review of the waste framework directive, which are now more consistent than the Commission's original documents. In particular, I very much appreciated the way in which Mrs Jackson conducted the discussions with us shadow rapporteurs, which allowed us to resolve almost all the problems consensually. That is why I felt rather surprised and also a little hurt, Mrs Jackson, when I saw you had tabled some amendments on behalf of your group that called these agreements into question on one particular point. That places us in a difficult or, I might say, embarrassing position. Let us look at the priorities. First of all, a highly positive point is that we prioritised the prevention of waste generation much more than the Commission had done: we defined it better and laid down a target for stabilising it by 2012, together with a whole raft of practical monitoring measures. Secondly, there is a point that I am going to fight for to the bitter end, Mrs Jackson. We defined and specifically laid down a five-step hierarchy. Just as in a hierarchy, first you do one thing and only then the second, third and so on, namely prevention, re-use, recycling, recovery and lastly disposal. We did not rule out the possibility of departing from this hierarchy, but we tied the possibility to strict evaluation criteria, starting with cost/benefit analysis throughout the life cycle of consumer goods. I am therefore somewhat astounded that you are now calling this solution bureaucratic. Thirdly, there is a problem that we did not resolve through our compromises and that we must now resolve by putting it to the vote in this Chamber, even though the Committee on the Environment did find what I believe is a good solution: we cannot undermine the hierarchy by regarding energy recovery as recovery, since it is actually disposal. By doing so we would straight away undermine the hierarchy and risk creating undue competition with renewable energies. Let me be quite clear: this is not an ideological rejection of incineration and energy recovery, but I too very much agree with Mrs Brepoels that reaching a definition on this subject should be left to a more appropriate forum. Is a review of the incineration directive planned? Well, I think that would be the best place to define the issue of energy recovery, and in that respect I have therefore tabled Amendment 136, which I regard as highly reasonable. We should not fill this directive with too many problems, so let us examine the issue more calmly and with some in-depth technical input. Lastly, I too should like to make a stand on the subject of bio-waste. The subject of composting has been put off for too long, but it is a strategic element in a recycling society and I do not see why we should not at last provide an opportunity for this option, on which there has been agreement for some time.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Liese has just said that, yesterday, we, in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, adopted a very important and extremely detailed resolution. Since Mr Gabriel has gone into these details, I will not mention them. We will try to further improve this resolution in Strasbourg, with a view to the Spring European Council. I should just like to devote the few seconds available to me to supporting what I consider to be a very good starting point from Mr Gabriel’s speech, which is that we are faced with a turning point in history. I believe that, during this year and next, 2007 and 2008, it will be possible to actually say whether, politically speaking, we are going to succeed in speeding up and making a qualitative leap on this major theme that is commanding international attention. The situation is changing, not only in terms of the new data being supplied to us by the scientists in Paris, the panel, etc., but also in terms of the political and international debate: for example, a different sort of awareness is developing or may develop on the other side of the Atlantic. I therefore believe that, while playing our part and introducing appropriate legislation – emissions trading, the inclusion of aviation, the reduction in CO2 emissions for cars, and all the other things in the pipeline – we need to make a big qualitative leap in political terms and create a powerful alliance among the European institutions so that they can present themselves as strongly as possible in international negotiations. We too, as Parliament, ought perhaps to do our jobs better – clearly, first and foremost, that of legislator – but we can support the Commission and Council negotiations by perhaps proposing a major international alliance of parliaments, with a view to making the fight against global warming a real priority, as the citizens are demanding.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to make it clear first of all that I am sitting in this seat not because there has been a ‘palace coup’ within the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, but for logistical reasons, to make it easier to give voting instructions. Mr Florenz, the committee chairman, has already mentioned the essential points about the content and the difficulty in reaching the outcome that we achieved in the agreement with the Finnish Presidency. It is now my job to say that this outcome is like a fresco painted by a team of artists: many people have been involved – I recall that ten parliamentary committees have worked on it. In particular, two committees have cooperated very closely with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. I therefore thank Mrs Ek and Mr Nassauer, the draftsmen for those two committees. Then I thank all the shadow rapporteurs in the Committee on the Environment: Ria Oomen-Ruijten, Chris Davies, Carl Schlyter and Caroline Lucas, Jens Holm, Johannes Blokland and Alessandro Foglietta, as well as the secretaries of the committees and political groups. We have encountered five presidencies; the British Presidency at first reading and now the Finnish Presidency have played particularly decisive roles. We have also got to know a number of Commissioners, because REACH was launched during the previous parliamentary term. The Commissioners responsible then were Mr Likanen and Mrs Wallström, and now they are Mr Verheugen and Mr Dimas. We have therefore seen many things, had a great many opportunities for discussion, and distilled all that work into today’s conclusion. I have not the slightest doubt that this Parliament’s sense of responsibility will confirm our decisions and at last make it possible to send out a strong message to Europe’s citizens: REACH will be up and running on 1 June 2007. Some may say that the result of all this is not a brilliant product, but in the meantime it will start operating, and I am sure that it will produce highly significant results for people’s safety, for health, for the environment and, not least, for the competitiveness of European industry. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this excellent result, for which I thank this House, will now be followed by a series of amendments not covered by the compromise. I will agree with many of the amendments, but it is quite clear that voting for and adopting them would mean forcing us to go through conciliation for the sake of some marginal points, and that would really be the wrong thing to do, as it would put back the application of the regulation. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the days since we reached our understanding with the Council – which was made possible in part by the Commission’s support – I have been wondering what might be an appropriate comparison for this long journey, which, for me, has lasted three and a half years, and which has brought us to this point. To answer that question, I have had to resort to my passion for mountain climbing: perhaps the most fitting comparison is to say that we have climbed a high mountain – probably, and without any exaggeration, an 8 000-metre peak in the Himalayas. I have never been that high and I doubt if I ever will, because I am only a moderate climber, but I do know what happens when you reach the top: at that point the exhaustion and the dangers you have experienced no longer count, nor, perhaps, does the disappointment you often feel when you get to the top and the view is restricted because of mist. It has happened to me so many times: I get up there and I cannot see a thing! Nevertheless, the sense of achievement is enormous just the same. It is important to be quite clear about two things: the first is to realise whether you have actually got to the top, and the second is to prepare properly for the descent, which is often no easier than the climb up. As the lead climber, I should like to give my opinion on these two points. Have we actually got to the top? I really think we have. We have done so with the package of chapters that we agreed upon in the final stage of the negotiations: duty of care; animal welfare and, above all, the compulsory promotion of alternatives to animal testing; the agency; communication of information; and adjustment to the new interinstitutional agreement on comitology, thus safeguarding Parliament’s role. We have had to give up one thing, which is extending the chemical safety report to small tonnages; that, however, was not a victim of this ascent, but rather an early retreat to base camp, since we have established a review clause that may possibly allow us to reintroduce this obligation in seven years’ time, once appropriate checks have been performed along the whole supply chain. The reason why I can say that we have reached the top is that, with this agreement, we have above all arrived at a successful solution to that most controversial topic, the purpose of REACH, which is to regulate the substances of highest concern by means of the authorisation procedure. To check whether we really have got to the top, we have to remember where we started from: a deep and very distant valley. The Commission’s original proposal in fact stated that all substances subject to authorisation could be authorised on the basis of the principle of adequate control. We have come a long way since then. The Council’s common position, which was positively influenced by Parliament, had already cut back the range of these substances, and then, with the 30 November agreement, we took a further step forwards and reduced the number of substances that could be approved under this quicker and easier procedure and, on top of that, we included all substances – even those that will be authorised on the basis of adequate control – in a substitution process. Where an alternative exists, a substitution plan must necessarily be submitted; if no alternatives exist at the time of authorisation, the company must in all cases declare the lines of research and development that it intends to pursue. On this basis, therefore, the duration of the authorisation will be established case by case, and it must be duly justified by the Commission where an alternative exists. If an alternative should appear during the term of the authorisation, the obligation to submit a substitution plan will come into effect. What I should like to emphasise is that the Commission will make its decisions case by case on the basis of the agency’s report, which must take account of the opinions of the Committee for Socio-Economic Analysis and the Committee for Risk Assessment, which must also take account of third-party contributions. It is therefore a highly transparent process that does not depend solely on the applicant’s own declarations. As for the descent from the summit, I think it is important to choose the best route, since the same grade of climbing difficulty may be a much greater challenge on the way down than on the ascent. What I mean by this metaphor is that we should adopt the compromise that we have reached, because in that way we can have the regulation published by the end of the year and thus meet the deadline for starting the process to implement REACH by 1 June 2007. This is a complex issue, which cannot be resolved by rushing it through: REACH is so complicated that it would be wrong to expect to solve all the problems at the approval stage. The important thing now is to start implementing it: we have provided for a number of what we might call self-regulating mechanisms and deadlines, which will allow for adjustments to be made as work progresses, on the basis of the practical experience that we have gained. We have been improving the balance at all stages in this procedure: I could mention the solutions we have found for the problems of small enterprises, or the strengthened health and environmental protection measures, particularly as regards the risks to which workers are exposed. Overall, I think we can be very pleased with this end product. I have noticed that my fellow Members in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left have tabled a package of amendments, which are on the whole admirable and are very similar to those that I tabled during the negotiations with the Council and the Commission in order to arrive at the point where we are now. How useful are these amendments? Where will they take us? Which peak will we be able to reach in an unlikely conciliation procedure? We all know what the real alternatives are: either to adopt the compromise package that we have set out, improving on the common position, or in fact to accept the common position. Let us be quite open about this: maybe that would be better. These are the real alternatives that we have, and I am sure that Parliament will make the right choice in Wednesday’s vote. Mr President, my speech today means that my work is done. Even the voting list will be short – there is not a lot to do, just two pages, which is a record for REACH, considering that some 5 000 amendments were examined at first reading. My work therefore finishes here, and it just remains for me to thank all those who, in their many different ways, have taken part in this Himalayan expedition. A great many have taken part: I have known six presidencies and countless committee chairmen and commissioners, and I was always there as the lead climber, even though there were times when someone tried to pull me down instead of acting as my safety person. Even so, we have got this far. Joking apart, I am grateful to everyone, from the chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, Mr Florenz, to all the shadow rapporteurs, including those who have voiced their disagreement with this result, to the presidencies, especially the Finnish Presidency, which has really been a crucial interlocutor, to the Commission, which may not have imparted any great bursts of speed but which played a decisive role in the final stages to achieve this result. Above all, however, I thank the staff who have worked with me: two Italian ladies – one of whom is my assistant, Sabina Magnano – who have played a very important role in this project. If I could change the name of the report, I would name it after them and all those who have worked with me. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, regarding all the positions that have been voiced, even the most critical ones, and those who are preparing to vote for the common position, without supporting a package that improves it, I should just like to say that there is freedom in this Parliament and that we shall remain on good terms as before. There is, however, an argument that I have to demolish. Somebody spoke of hundreds of dangerous substances that would be freely released on the market, and someone even said that 90% of dangerous substances would be authorised: in other words, the compromise puts in place a kind of licence to kill. All this distortion is supposed to have happened during the last night of negotiations. That is not true. I can only give you an estimate, because only REACH will tell us the actual numbers, but the most reliable estimates say that roughly 2 500 substances will be subject to the authorisation procedure. With the compromise, there should be less than 200 substances that can be authorised on the basis of adequate control – which is not a licence to kill, but involves a risk assessment. In any case, because of the way in which we have restructured the compromise, even for these substances a substitution plan must necessarily be submitted where an alternative exists, or a research and development plan where there is no alternative. Nobody, therefore, can deny the fact that all substances that are authorised will be included in a process that sooner or later will lead to their substitution. If anyone was thinking that substitution would be made compulsory by decree, they would be voting on something that I have never put forward, either at first reading or in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. What I really cannot accept is what has been said about the negotiating process having been non-transparent and undemocratic. I met the shadow rapporteurs before and after all the negotiating rounds; I kept them informed; and, right up to the last round, there was very broad agreement on the negotiating mandate that I took to the negotiating table. Lastly, I should like to thank my friend Carl Schlyter for having returned the apple from a year ago. I shall eat it tomorrow. He, however, kept it, and he showed me something in a glass jar that is a real ecological disaster in the making. Still in the fruit and vegetable department, I should like to tell you something that I was taught by my old trade union negotiating master. He was an old worker who had been through a lot and had made plenty of sacrifices. He told me, ‘You must not be like a walnut, which is hard on the outside and soft inside; you have to be like a peach, soft on the outside and hard inside.’ That is the negotiating line that I follow.

Mr President, Mr Vanhanen, ladies and gentlemen, you, Mr Vanhanen, like the President of the Barroso Commission, often referred in your speech to the need to give a boost to the Europe of results in order to regain the citizens' trust, naturally without pitting this Europe against the Europe of values and of the Constitution. When it comes to dividing up the work that exists in this Parliament, I, as rapporteur for REACH, belong to the category of sherpas, of those who work to deliver results, like my colleague, Mrs Gebhardt. For this reason, I very much welcomed the fact that you have included among the priorities of your Presidency the conclusion of the legislative process on REACH and that you have done so by including it in the ‘competitiveness’ chapter. The main purpose of REACH is, of course, to protect human health and the environment, but it is also a powerful incentive for innovation. From this perspective, both the Council and Parliament have done an excellent job over the years of work that we have behind us, because they have reconciled their positions to a great extent and have made this instrument much more usable, and have done so, too, in an effort to boost innovation. I am sure that, under your Presidency, an agreement at second reading will be possible. Both legislators will nevertheless have to make progress. A small amount of progress, since there has already been a great deal of convergence, but progress will still always have to be made. I am saying this to you because there will be those who advise you to stand firm and make no concessions. I, on the other hand, am willing to make progress and I am sure that you will be too.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too am grateful to the Austrian Presidency for having made this strategy one of its key priorities. I hope that, although our document comes slightly late in the day, the Summit will decide on something practical in this regard over the next few days and not confine itself to making token or rhetorical statements. I should like to extract and highlight three key words that I consider essential from the contribution made by Parliament in the shape of the unanimous resolution on which we shall vote tomorrow.  The first word is integration. The Lisbon and Gothenburg European Councils were held one year apart. Five years later, the time has perhaps come to integrate them more, maybe even with a buzz word, with a new word such as Lisbothenburg
, in such a way as to overcome this contradiction and this distinction between competitiveness and environment.  The second word is governance. We genuinely need to give a strong boost to the Member States and, I stress, to what is actually taking place at a local and regional level, so that everyone, across the board, might play a leading role in implementing this strategy in practice. Actions cannot only come from above, but this leading role also needs to be promoted.  Finally, the third word is monitoring. I very much agree with the need to define a concise set of, let us say, multicriterial indicators, which measure the progress made towards sustainability on a regular and ongoing basis. This is vital if we are to win over the citizens, who must have the opportunity to ascertain in practice the progress made or the difficulties encountered in pursuing our objectives. I believe that this bottom-up form of monitoring is very important.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in actual fact, I had requested to speak fearing that the vote on the amendments would have had a different outcome. Instead, it seems to me that the vote has been very positive and has made the regulation more balanced. Furthermore, I believe that, also as regards the parts on which we voted in favour of a decidedly very strong position, such as the part relating to authorisation, the conditions have been created to achieve convergence with the Council as soon as possible. In the debate the day before yesterday on all of the key chapters, the Council demonstrated that there is a strong possibility of convergence between what we are preparing to vote on – and I am hoping for a positive final outcome – and what has taken shape in the Council’s work.
 Guido Sacconi (PSE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, while listening to the speeches of the two Commissioners and Lord Bach, who represented the UK Presidency, I was reflecting on the distance we have had to travel in order to arrive at this point. You yourself have heard how close together the respective positions of the three institutions now are. I believe I can say that concerning the themes of registration, authorisation and other aspects that have been mentioned, there are no significant differences of opinion on points of principle. It is difficult to summarise this lengthy process in a few minutes, even though this is the longest time limit that I have been given since I became a Member of this Parliament. I shall therefore devote only a few words to two key concepts: balance and responsibility. These are words that came to my mind this weekend, which I spent almost entirely doing some soul-searching. Particularly in the light of the attacks last week on the compromise that I initialled, I wondered in truth whether I had taken the right decision and whether a balance really had been achieved; in all conscience I had to reply in the affirmative. We have not only safeguarded but also reinforced the balance between those two essential factors that are close to all our hearts: namely protection of human health and the environment on the one hand and the maintenance of industrial competitiveness in Europe on the other. It is easier to arrive at such a balance when one is approving a political resolution, since in that instance one is working solely with words. To reach a balance in a regulation of such importance, when so many often-conflicting interests are affected, is, in contrast, rather more difficult. In such circumstances, it is in fact also necessary to take account of technical data of considerable weight and importance. From this perspective I feel that my conscience is clear. As far as human health and the environment are concerned – and I will confine myself to quoting only a few improvements to the Commission’s proposal to which I attach particular importance – we can bring forward the registration of persistent bioaccumulative substances. Subject to Parliament’s approval, of course, we shall also introduce the chemical safety report for the lower tonnage band, if only for the most hazardous substances. If Parliament endorses on Thursday the positions adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we shall define an authorisation mechanism for the substitution of the most hazardous substances, very similar to the mechanism that the UK Presidency referred to a short while ago. I am particularly proud of this. As for enterprises, I shall mention only the most important things that have been done. While maintaining the burden of proof, we have made the registration mechanisms more flexible for the low tonnage bands and have introduced a very important feature for small enterprises: namely data sharing, which has become obligatory apart from certain mechanisms for opting out. I should also like to recall that, together with Mr Nassauer, we have at the eleventh hour extended the period envisaged for data protection and for research and development. I believe that these are all concrete actions that are moving in the right direction. In this connection, Mr Nassauer, may I say that during my weekend of reflection and soul-searching I was somewhat struck by the fact that, after the compromise we initialled together, you saw fit to table your earlier block of amendments as well. In this connection I must declare that should our compromise unhappily not be approved, I will naturally support the other block (number 2). I am optimistic about this. I now turn to my second key concept: responsibility, to which I would add the word autonomy. We have been subjected to much pressure, albeit legitimate pressure, concerning the interests that we all have to represent in some way while seeking the best possible compromise that is acceptable to a majority in Parliament. We have come close to this objective; and meanwhile the positions of various institutions, in particular the two legislative ones, namely the Council and Parliament, have moved very close together. I believe that the ball is now in Parliament’s court, so to speak. We are aware that many aspects of European integration are in difficulty at present. Nevertheless Parliament could today send out a strong, clear message on such an important subject to its citizens, enterprises and trade unions concerning its ability to decide and to reach a compromise that would by definition be as representative as possible of the wishes of all interested parties. Mr President, my work comes to an end at this point. I will naturally pay attention to the voting list in the next few hours, but let us say that the greater part of my job is done. As Lord Bach and Commissioner Verheugen said earlier, we now have to seize the opportunity to speed up the decision-making and legislative process on this matter that has engaged so much of our attention. I said recently that an agreement is like a fruit: if it is not picked at the right time, when it is ripe, it rots and goes bad. Since this morning I have been carrying an apple in my pocket. It is not beautiful; it is small and covered with blemishes, because it was organically grown and contains no fungicides; but I think that it will taste very good and for this reason I shall eat it later. I accordingly call upon Parliament to pick this fruit; in so doing we shall also help the other institutions, especially the Council, finally to close this file and to send out the message that I spoke of earlier.
 Guido Sacconi (PSE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to make just three very quick points. First of all I should like to respond to the criticisms made by various fellow Members including Mrs Breyer and Mrs Foglietta, who allege that I have expressed my personal viewpoint and not that of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. It is possible that I have made a mistake and in that case I offer my sincere apologies. However, as the principal rapporteur of Parliament I feel that I have a responsibility to the House to work towards the broadest and most solid majority that can be achieved. It is above all for this reason that I considered the compromise that we have discussed at such length to be useful, feasible and necessary. To achieve REACH we have had to arrive at a compromise. Before assessing whether REACH is or is not a strong regulation – we shall have time after the vote to carry out a careful analysis – we urgently need to have a REACH regulation at our disposal; and we know how much deep-seated hostility it has attracted even in recent weeks. On the other hand it seems to me that the points of principle that I have publicly declared to be insuperable have not been resolved, given that the burden of proof for lower tonnage bands has been maintained: this means that 30% of those substances must be covered by complete documentation. I challenge anyone to contradict my assessment on this point. In this connection I should like to cite the example of the principle of ‘one substance, one registration’, which for the first time, thanks to the compromise, is largely supported in Parliament, whereas hitherto it had been adopted only by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. The criteria for opting out have certainly been retouched, but the final ruling on applications for authorisation not to participate in data sharing rests with the Chemicals Agency. Finally I should like to thank all Members, especially the rapporteurs, but above all the extremely important staff that we should perhaps value more highly: namely Parliament’s officials and Secretariat. If we have got this far the credit must also, and perhaps principally, go to so many officials who have carried out this exceptional work.

Mr President, as I have to make an objection to the order of the vote regarding Article 3a and Article 4, I ask whether I should do so now or wait for the vote on Amendment 29.
 Guido Sacconi (PSE

 –
 (IT) 
Mr President, I will not comment on the merits of this amendment, but I would just like to point out that to vote first on this new Article 3, dealing with Amendments 99 and 32, is perhaps acceptable from a formal point of view, but not from a substantive point of view, insofar as the new Article 3 is nothing but a new version, a ruse to reintroduce the contents of Article 4. That is a fact, and so much so that if, for instance, you had the courage – or the misfortune – to read Amendment 99 and compare it with Amendment 88, you would see that they are identical, save for a small detail regarding the dates. I therefore think it more appropriate to vote on the amendments to Article 4 as such, and only afterwards, and if required, to address those relating to the new Article 3, which seeks to replace Article 4 through the back door.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our debates are often repetitive, and so I should like to start with a news item that I read yesterday which I found quite striking. A few days ago, in Huang-Kan-Tun in southern China, there was a popular uprising, which unfortunately also led to two deaths because of brutal repression by the police. It was an uprising by the whole population of that village against a recently established chemical plant, which in a short time had caused very severe air, water and soil pollution. What do I mean by this news item? I mean that new environmental, ecological, health and social demands are now emerging in these new economic powers too, as a result of industrial growth. That clearly shows us our role in the future international division of labour: designing and selling technologies to enable those countries to grow without repeating our past mistakes, such as pollution and social oppression. In view of all that, I think the summit has had a positive outcome, because it has genuinely reinvigorated the Lisbon Strategy on the basis of the interdependence of the three pillars; it has revitalised the European Union’s global role as a leader in the field of sustainable development; and it has put forward a protocol for Kyoto 2 that is highly ambitious and important precisely in this context. What I think is good above all is the political reform of the management of the Lisbon Strategy according to the principle that everyone must play their own part to the full – the Member States, the Community, local communities, the European Union, and so on. Parliament too must play its own part, as has been clearly stated. We shall do so better, Mr President, if, as you hoped, the collaboration that has been occurring recently among the institutions on the task that concerns us – drawing up advanced legislation – continues. I think that one of the main areas where this challenge will lie will be the REACH directive. I am sure that the desired collaboration will take place in the coming months in order to achieve this result.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if I were asked for the two main reasons why I consider the convergence in the positions of the Council Presidency, the Commission and Parliament that we see today to be important, I would reply that my first reason is that the social and environmental aspects of development are being sincerely acknowledged not as constraints and obstacles but as factors in our competitiveness. My second reason is that we all agree that in order to properly relaunch the Lisbon Strategy it is essential to create a sense of ownership of the strategy that filters down to local levels, so that responsibility lies first and foremost with national governments and parliaments as well as with the public. I agree wholeheartedly on this point, which I hope will be transformed into tangible measures in the European Council. This time, however, I must disagree with what Mrs Frassoni said in her speech. Among her reasons for rejecting the proposal for a resolution – which I, on the other hand, support – she mentioned the fact that one of the paragraphs in the resolution called the REACH regulation into question. Madam President, you know very well how much I value that regulation and I would never risk jeopardising it by supporting the proposal for a resolution. I should, however, like to call on my fellow Members not to regard the regulation as a symbol of good or evil any longer, as polarisation of that kind implies that in the end there will be winners and losers. I believe, instead, that reaching agreement on that regulation would be a victory for us all.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, previous speakers have explained the situation clearly and set out what needs to be done to resolve this most critical situation. I have to bite my tongue and avoid referring back to some of the demands made concerning the REACH regulations, which will come into force in eleven years' time, undermining the competitiveness of Italian and European industry, which now seems to be facing very different and more immediate competitive challenges. Like you, I have long union experience behind me, on which I should like to draw to make two observations. Firstly, exactly one year ago, on 10 February 2004, we were discussing here in Parliament the case of Terni, the steel industry and the wider crisis in European steel-making. On that very day we were informed that the dispute was being resolved at ministerial level and that negotiations were being started which were ultimately to lead to the June agreement which, today, ThyssenKrupp has once again torn up. Why was such an agreement possible at that time? In my view, for one fundamental reason only: because ThyssenKrupp had been isolated, both nationally and on a European level. The exceptional mobilisation of the workers and citizens of Terni and Umbria, as previously referred to, played a leading part in that political process. The Terni plant is not a mere factory; it is an integral part of the town. Today, the same situation is being played out once again. Today, as before, we are seeing an attack not only on a professional body, a production capability, a tradition, but on the dignity of the entire population of a town. This must be the starting point for the renewal of a powerful unity which will again leave ThyssenKrupp in an isolated position. A second comment also drawn from my union background: why has ThyssenKrupp chosen today to take two apparently contradictory initiatives? It has sent us the letter describing the problems in detail, while simultaneously laying off, or threatening to lay off, a further 600 workers, for more or less plausible reasons. In my view, the company is afraid of being isolated again by this Parliament. That explains the importance of the agenda on which we shall be voting tomorrow. Commissioner, I appreciated your speech and the pointers you gave, notwithstanding the Commission’s limited powers, of which we are perfectly well aware. However, the Commission can perhaps do something politically, possibly at the most senior level, as it did last year, thereby making a significant contribution to the isolation of ThyssenKrupp.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must admit that I had prepared a different speech. However, what Mr Ferber said a moment ago somehow forces me to speak about the REACH dossier – as I am the rapporteur on it – which Mr Ferber held up as the greatest threat to the competitiveness of European industry. I hold exactly the opposite view. I think it is always wrong to turn a specific piece of legislation into a symbol of either good or evil. In any case, I think that if REACH is a symbol, it is precisely pointing the way towards a new competitive future for Europe’s industry. What is happening in the world to leave our competitiveness in crisis and in question? We are witnessing a great international redistribution of work, as has happened before at other times in world economic and industrial history. Europe has not yet succeeded in finding its own space, its own trump cards, in this great transformation. It identified them in the Lisbon strategy, but it has only been able to develop and expand them in a very small way. Mr Barroso, I recognise that the list of priorities that you have indicated, for which an interinstitutional partnership ought to be established, is a fair one and I believe that it is precisely on that basis that we need to address this major turning point in Europe’s competitiveness. Our trump cards are knowledge and the environment. Europe is going to become a world leader in those areas, and it is now in a position to achieve that.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the devastating effects of global warming, noise and chemical pollution, overfishing and shipping accidents are dramatically degrading our oceans and, inevitably, the populations of cetaceans living there. We now have valid and sufficient scientific evidence demonstrating that high-intensity active naval sonars can be lethal for whales, dolphins and fish. All cetaceans are extremely dependent on hearing for their survival, and many species have an acute sense of hearing and use sound not only to locate their prey but also for navigation and communication, often over long distances. Noise pollution caused by sonar equipment thus not only causes physiological damage but also interferes with the natural behaviour of the animals and with normal communication. It drowns out calls and disorientates the animals, scaring them away from their usual habitats, where they feed and reproduce. Last year we adopted a resolution on the protection and conservation of the marine environment. This Parliament voted unanimously for the application of consistent, coordinated measures to halt the decline of biodiversity by 2010 and to promote the sustainable use of the seas, protecting and conserving marine ecosystems. I would not wish to remind you, Mr President, that these were political objectives to which we gave a binding commitment at the last world summit on sustainable development. I believe, therefore, that it is our duty to adopt provisions designed to preserve the marine world which surrounds us, and so I call on the Commission to abide by the deadlines which it announced in this Chamber for making the move from studies to concrete proposals.

 Mr President, I have been forced to note with some amazement that in both introductory speeches – in their discussions of the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy – the words ‘environment’ and ‘sustainable development’ were never used. I am not interested in formal acknowledgements or ritual tributes, but I do wonder, Mr Verheugen, if this is the type of continuity to which you alluded. Apart from that, however, there are three good reasons to consider this third pillar of the Lisbon strategy to be still relevant. The first is that a few days ago an international event of the greatest importance occurred, something highly positive for once: the ratification by the Duma of the Kyoto Protocol, a field in which the European Union has been a world leader. The second is that, as chance would have it, the environment is precisely the field in which the Member States are furthest behind schedule in their implementation of Community policies. There is yet another even more important reason, which has to do with the subject that government offices throughout Europe are quite rightly – and rather obsessively – concerned about at the moment: competitiveness. How can the European Union regain its competitiveness in world markets if it does not commit itself to the new technologies, or if it does not take on leadership – including technological leadership – in the field of environmental technologies? This is the issue that I am raising, and I hope it will be a key point in the strategy review process.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to express my thanks to the Chairman of Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr Parish, for having sponsored this question after the valuable expert hearing held by the Committee. It is undeniable that Mediterranean food is part of the historical and cultural heritage of our continent. The healthy basis of the diet is also undeniable. The Commission’s White Paper on obesity identified the Mediterranean diet as an excellent natural medicine. The health benefits have been scientifically demonstrated and have an excellent reputation abroad, in particular, in the United States. This has meant that the concept has been broadened to the point of distorting its original nature. Recognition by UNESCO would encourage a definition to protect this particular diet. I would say to Mr Parish that, in relation to specific diets in European gastronomic culture, we are currently talking about Mediterranean food, but this is certainly not the only specific diet in the very rich European gastronomy. Commissioner, you have maintained your predecessor’s commitment to recognising the importance of this initiative, and I thank you for that. You have stressed that you do not have decision-making powers with respect to the UNESCO procedure. However, I think that you could issue a statement and undertake diplomatic efforts … (The President cut off the speaker)

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very happy to see the evidence of a very positive codecision process in agriculture, which been possible through the enhanced cooperation between the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament. This is a good omen and I am sure that you will permit me to congratulate Mr Capoulas Santos on his balanced report on modulation, on young farmers and on security in the workplace, as well as in relation to the new challenges. We are going through a difficult transition: we know about the soft landing and decoupling, and other innovative measures. As we go through this transition we must protect farmers who will be faced with the removal of milk quotas, as well as disadvantaged areas such as those in the tobacco sector, and we should take the opportunity of this shift to embark upon a serious rethink post-2013 to update the aims and new missions of the common agricultural policy (CAP) and to launch a debate on a way to overcome the dichotomy between the first and second pillars.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this reform undoubtedly rewrites the fundamentals of the wine sector to make it competitive on world markets. Through the Castiglione report we have emphasised the fact that the competitive strength of European wine, and what has enabled it to overcome competition from the New World, is its quality. Furthermore, it is for the sake of quality that we have improved the Commission's proposal on certain points, such as on grubbing-up with reference to the time frame and the ecological constraints, and on the liberalisation of planting rights with the provisos recalled during this debate. We have supported the idea that there should be more careful checks to ensure that the approval of oenological practices is not made too easy, and we have come out in favour of increasing Community cofinancing for promotion campaigns. Nevertheless, our support for quality cannot be reconciled with the practice of sugaring. We do understand, ladies and gentlemen, that this practice is favoured in some countries on economic grounds, but in that case we call for the same standard, the same scheme on aid for must as under the previous legislation. Above all, we believe that it is essential, for the sake of transparent and accurate information to consumers, that where sucrose is used this must be indicated on the label. Ladies and gentlemen, and here I am addressing some of you in particular, it is a matter of respecting the principle of traceability, which we in this House have fought to uphold in a bid to protect consumers.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the Batzeli report on the CMO in wine is a preparatory stage in a dialogue that will lead us to the legislative report, and therefore to final decisions within the course of this year. I do, however, think that it would be a good idea for Parliament to take decisions on some of the proposal’s main conclusions, and this should certainly include grubbing-up. Like others of my fellow Members, I disagree with this proposal if seen as the only and exclusive option for rebalancing the market. We must compete with each other on the world market, and the strength of European wine lies in emphasising quality and traditional practices, and also in its connection to the land and age-old practices that are used in this sphere. To this end, I am also opposed to the importation of musts: as the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, we have tabled an amendment on this point. I think that dialogue, including today’s exchanges, will lead to positive results – 
including during transitional periods – 
against measures that, like distillation, if abolished immediately would pull away the safety net for many winemakers. I think that if we listen to each other we will be able to retain European wine production on the world stage.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the blackout of electricity networks on 4 November is a sign that should highlight the urgency with which we must provide common responses to the energy problem. The episode has shown clearly how closely networks are interconnected, and the lack of appropriate management to support this. Commissioner, the guidelines presented by the Commission on 9 November to rationalise the cross-border transport of electricity in Europe, which are aimed at improving the management system, are welcome. However, it is important to enforce greater cooperation among regulators: we must speed up the implementation of a single European regulatory authority, a European centre for energy networks, as proposed by the Commission’s Green Paper. It is also necessary, in my opinion, to have network administrators that are independent of commercial operators, as well as greater computerisation, enabling transmission networks and distribution networks to communicate. The internal market is a key aspect of common energy policy. Today, more than ever, this policy is essential and must be regarded as a priority. We must continue down this road with greater courage. Together with the Member States, we must speed up this process, overcoming national protectionist self-interest that slows down liberalisation and competition on the market, so that episodes like that of 4 November will no longer happen, and, above all, so that Europe, as a single actor, can negotiate the delicate international geopolitical balances, securing for itself a protected, sustainable and unified energy supply.

 Mr President, representatives of the Commission and Council, ladies and gentlemen, the Council decision on the EU-Albania agreement is a highly positive step. I congratulate Mr Ilves and believe that the agreement will allow us to develop more direct political relations with Albania, with a view to achieving a free trade zone; the movement of workers, capital and services; freedom of establishment; and, in future, the lasting stabilisation of south eastern Europe as an area of peace, democracy and security. With this agreement we are calling on Albania to bring its legislation more into line with that of the European Union, not only in sectors such as the internal market, but also as regards justice, security and respect for rights. It is precisely because of this agreement that Albania has made significant progress and is now, in my opinion, more likely to overcome the numerous problems that still remain in that country regarding electoral law and media freedom, as well as on the corruption and organised crime front. For our part, this agreement falls within a broader perspective, relating above all to the launch of a Euro-Adriatic strategy that should include the resumption of infrastructure projects such as corridor 8 and, more generally, the pursuit of the goal and historic mission of EU enlargement. In strategic terms, the project to unify the continent according to the principles of democracy, peace and development must include Albania and the Balkans as leading players in the new Europe.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s proposal on the directive concerning the control of shipments of radioactive waste is balanced and takes account of many of the suggestions made by Parliament during the debate on the previous proposal. I commend this attempt to update the previous directive and to clarify it from the procedural and terminological point of view. The inclusion of nuclear spent fuel in the remit of the directive is equally commendable. The Socialist Group in the European Parliament is therefore substantially in agreement with this text and would like to compliment Mr Seppänen on his report and his contribution. We have requested a separate vote on Amendment 6 because we do not think it possible to exclude the restrictions and controls that are to be found throughout the directive from the legislative provisions of the transit countries’ regulations. The amendments proposed by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance express a concern that we can share. Nevertheless, I think that the Commission’s text – Article 13, to be precise – already sets limits to exports, in particular to those countries that do not have sufficient technical, legal and administrative resources at their disposal to guarantee safe disposal of radioactive waste. We shall therefore vote against the Greens’ amendments. I also agree with the structure of the proposal and should like to thank the Commission and Mr Seppänen for their work.

Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, an agreement has been reached in a meeting of the Wine Management Committee to amend Regulations (EC) No 1622/2000, No 884/2001 and No 753/2002, with the aim of authorising the use of wood shavings to age wine. I wanted to table an oral question, with the support of more than 40 fellow Members, whom I should to thank, on the admissibility of this oenological practice, because I believe that Parliament must be able to express its opinion on an issue that is only outwardly technical but which actually raises some important issues relating to the quality and future of European wine. There was an attempt to justify this proposal by the need for us to fall in line with those non-European countries that already authorise this practice. I wonder, instead, whether the specific nature of European wine and its strength on the world market do not indeed lie in high quality and respect for traditional practices. Has the Commission assessed the impacts of this proposal on high-quality wines? What measures does it plan to adopt in order to ban this practice, at least for high-quality wines? As regards labelling, does the Commission regard the failure to mention this practice on labels as being compatible with our guidelines on transparency? Finally, what would happen during WTO negotiations if, instead of trying to raise standards relating to oenological practices, we lowered them? I should be grateful to the Commission if it would kindly shed some light on these points, not least in view of the next WTO reform of the wine sector.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I too should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report. I think the text is appreciably better than the Council’s compromise text, because it points out a way to achieve much-needed reform without drastically penalising the agricultural sector and its production, particularly in the less favoured regions. The Council compromise gives cause for concern above all because of the repercussions it would have on less suitable areas, even though the cuts in aid have been substantially reduced, while the four-year extension certainly remains an unsustainable cut-off point. Commissioner and representatives of the Council, what I am asking – so as not to dwell on matters already dealt with by other Members – is for you to appreciate the considerable understanding shown by the committee and its Chairman, Mr Daul – the whole committee in fact – regarding the change in procedure that led to the informal compromise, in order to provide a more suitable negotiating position at the WTO. I also ask you to return the favour of Parliament’s understanding by accepting the proposed improvements to the text, which are sure to be adopted by this House, particularly so as to allow for transitional state aid in the least favoured regions and to readjust the compensation paid to farmers, especially from the restructuring fund.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union-United States wine agreement provides a stable legal framework for our trading relations and is therefore a worthwhile step forwards. I am pleased to tell Commissioner Fischer Boel that I acknowledge its merits. Like many other Members of this House, I consider it essential that in phase two the Commission does not lose sight of the priorities for the Community market, which are to ensure definitive results regarding the protection of denominations of origin and regarding the restrictions to be placed on the recognition of wine-making practices. I believe my fellow Members’ concerns on this matter are justified and I trust that, through close dialogue with Parliament, the Commission will press for these objectives.
