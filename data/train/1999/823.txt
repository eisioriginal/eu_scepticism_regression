 Mr President, I welcomed the urgency today with which, as this parliamentary term draws to a close, the Commissioner returned to the need, which the last speaker mentioned, for defence of the European way of life to be among our prime objectives. A liberalist wind, a single school of thought appeared to be attempting to destroy the idea of justice which brings dignity to politics in Europe and in our countries. I am pleased that the Commissioner reaffirmed this point. In Italy there is a booklet, ‘The Dream and the Choices’, a fine discussion by President Prodi available in bookshops. It points out, with regard to this way of life, what the major social democracies, the Christian school of thought in the social doctrine of the Church, have built in our countries, with different political experiences, since the early twentieth century; and indeed today we are different. In my opinion, this has to be a prime objective, and in 20 years’ time we will be remembered not just for our history, our Christian roots and the beauty of our cities but also for having created a model of relations between people which is among the most advanced in our history. I will end, today in particular, at the end of this parliamentary term, by expressing a concern: the diffusion, precisely with regard to this issue, of a lack of rules, of the insecurity of young peoples’ jobs. Of course, we must defend change, but we must be careful not to destroy young peoples’ security. I would like to extend my best wishes to the incoming MEPs for their work.

 Mr President, after today’s debate, I understand why Turkey is calling upon the forthcoming December Council to set a date for the start of the negotiations. I support Turkey’s request, for what is happening here is a farce, started by Mr Giscard d’Estaing and continuing today in this Chamber. Here, we are not discussing whether Turkey is fulfilling the conditions it needs to fulfil in order to become a member of the Union in the near future – and we can be rigorous in demanding that it does fulfil them – we are opening a debate on whether or not Turkey is to be allowed to join the Union in the future and wondering whether a different sort of association might be appropriate. We are going back on decisions already made and reopening the debate on the opening of a line of credit for a major country – a country which is essential to Europe and the West – which has applied to become a full member of the Union. Personally, I support the line taken by Mr Brok in his report and his resolution, where he calls for greater pre-accession cooperation from the Commission and for the Council to adopt a position which is more in line with that expressed on occasions by Parliament, but I do not support the Ferber amendment – which I will vote against tomorrow – in that if it were to be adopted, the whole approach of the Brok report and resolution would be turned upside down and they would make no sense. There are good reasons for what I am saying: we have a duty to be unambiguous towards a major country which practises moderate Islam, is pro the West, which could have great cultural significance on our borders and could give substance to a Union foreign and security policy. I hope that, tomorrow, we will reject the Ferber amendment – as a member of the European People’s Party I will do so – and we will thus be able to take a step in that direction.

 Mr President, among the topics on the agenda for the forthcoming Council is the Lisbon Strategy, the Union’s Financial Perspective and the resumption of the constitutional process. I will restrict my remarks to the latter issue, as I consider it to be crucial. Parliament has been the mainstay of federalist policy, as acknowledged by the President-in-Office, whose prudence and perseverance we welcomed also today. We also agree with his concerns: time is against the Constitutional Treaty. In fact, we are at an historic turning point and not just because the reunification of Europe makes a constitutional charter both more difficult and more necessary, but also because the next Parliament will see a significant generational replacement of the parliamentary groups which created the European Community. Europe’s future would be threatened by deadlock in the Intergovernmental Conference, and another failure, instead of ending the democratic deficit, would increase the danger of there being a democracy with no voters, threatened by populism. A failure would also be a negative signal for the objective of making Europe’s economy more competitive, since this objective calls for greater economic integration, greater social cohesion and greater democratic transparency. Nevertheless, we agree with Mr Kinnock: better no Constitution than a Treaty which does not live up to the Convention proposal. We would therefore call on the Council, through its decisions, to rekindle enthusiasm for a more democratic Europe, united in its diversity and capable of having a common foreign and defence policy.

 Mr President, the reports that we are discussing express concern at the gulf between the Lisbon objectives and the results achieved. The Council and the Commission share these concerns and rightly insist on the importance of confirming a strategy for a knowledge-based economy. I do, however, believe that, in view of the Spring Summit, the Union’s Financial Perspective needs to be considered and questions must be answered. The first question concerns the means of achieving a balance between the stability policy which manifests itself in the form of the single currency, and a policy of promoting research, innovation for small businesses and investments in TENs, which will enable the European regions to integrate. The second question concerns how to address the globalisation of the markets that is challenging even the most modern businesses that have to compete with the US and Japan – that is to say the countries at the forefront of research – and traditional businesses that have to compete with China and economies that have low labour, social policy and environmental policy costs. The third question concerns developing factors for competitiveness, which help to strengthen the Community’s presence in fundamental research, and also in industrial policy. This community commitment is possible if the Financial Perspective is consistent with the objectives of EU enlargement, and also with growth that is increasingly linked to human capital, product quality and the competitiveness of businesses operating in an ever more open market. I believe that the political problem turns, in fact, on the ability to bring about the structural reforms and also to take the budgetary decisions that we believe are necessary to give Europe a future.

 Mr President, I welcomed the timeliness and the quality of the action plan presented to us for implementing the European space policy. This policy was re-launched when the United States reworked its strategy and when the ESA and NASA reported exceptional successes that excited the world. Space policy is crucial for international cooperation in research, for the Lisbon strategy and for guaranteeing Europe’s independent access to space. The plan that we are discussing is of a horizontal nature in that it concerns many Community policies, from agriculture to communications. After the Galileo project we are awaiting the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security project. I share the desire to pool investment resources to achieve objectives that no country can achieve on its own, and I agree with the intention to take a more determined approach towards coordinating research, technological innovation and industrial policy. There are two issues, however, that I urge the Commissioner to take note of. The first concerns the repercussions, for the European programme, of the new strategy established by the most important space power in the world, with which we have strong ties in terms of collaboration. The second concerns the discrepancies between Europe’s ambitions and the resources needed to implement the most important part of the space programme, and this seems to be the issue that the White Paper has left open. The complex issues influencing this programme do indeed concern the constituent process as regards the competences for space and common defence, but also the political decisions, both national and Community, that are called for to make the European economy more competitive.

 Mr President, I too am delighted that the Irish Presidency is prioritising the objective of reuniting the peoples of Europe, after divergences on key points of the Convention’s proposal led to its collapse in Brussels. The June elections must not be allowed to widen the split in the Union, but must instead give a new democratic boost to pro-European feeling. Parliament wants to get back on course towards a constitution straight away, and appreciates the commitment to reconvene the Intergovernmental Conference and to act transparently, for the sake of closer and closer relations between the Union’s institutions and its citizens. We also share the multilateral position for a common foreign and defence policy, for a solid partnership with the United States, for the reaffirmation of the United Nations and for the resumption of international trade talks. Public opinion is, however, concerned about the future. The spring Council will report the successes that have been achieved, but there is also the risk that the social model will be weakened without Europe’s economy becoming any more competitive in the world. We have to think carefully about the choices we need to make to relaunch the Lisbon strategy and also about the Union’s financial perspective: that is, the resources that Europe can call on to face the challenges that were clearly spelt out by Mr Prodi. These challenges concern, first of all, the enlargement of the Union and also, especially in the long-term, the future of our continent’s younger generations.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my speech concerns the MacCormick report, which deals with European governance and – as the rapporteur rightly mentioned – Europe united in diversity. The Commission communication on which this debate is based, and to which Commissioner Fischler made a timely reference earlier, proposes tripartite contracts and agreements committing the Community, the States and regional and local authorities. It proposes this in order to make Community rules adaptable to situations that are characterised by significant environmental and demographic diversities as well as to the political diversities of the Union, from transport policy to regional, territorial policies and so on. This is an important decision, although it must be noted that it will start an experimental phase in which we must take stock in order to learn the necessary lessons, which will partially be procedural ones but which – as has already been said – will also concern the best management of Community regional policies. We know that, in any case, these are agreements bound by an obligation of compatibility with the Treaties regulating the life of the European Union and adjustments that must not hinder the functioning of the internal market. Basically, the principle to which the Commission refers in this communication, which is accurately interpreted in the MacCormick report, is that of flexibility. This principle entails respecting the various constitutional systems of the States of the Union, but it recognises that in some States there are constitutional systems that assign huge responsibilities to regional and local authorities, which must not be reduced despite the fact that, in such cases, the need for greater democratic participation must not cause imbalances that would run counter to the guidelines produced by the constituent Convention. Tripartite contracts cannot, however, derogate from the provisions of secondary law applicable throughout the territory of the European Union because – as I mentioned earlier – it is only in this way that they remain coherent with the guidelines of the constituent Convention. We need to improve the implementation of Community policy. It is, therefore, important that the tripartite agreements and contracts define clear objectives based on the need to give due consideration to diversity throughout the territory of the European Union, although, on the basis of these experiences, it will then be possible to look again at a policy for the management of Community policies that goes beyond the issue of diversity and tackles the more general issue of democracy in greater depth without, however, compromising – and I believe that this must be emphasised – the uniform enforcement of Community law across the entire European area.

 Mr President, the Green Paper presented by Commissoner Busquin, which Parliament particularly welcomed, once again put forward the strategic importance of space policy for the independence, safety and economic growth of a Europe that wants to remain at the forefront of scientific research and technological innovation. In recent months, a turning point was reached with the constitutional Convention, which gave space policy a specific role, thus representing a legal base for Community programmes and consolidating the strategy begun with the extraordinary success of the Galileo programme. Nevertheless, we must not disregard the fact that the Commission has also given a specific response to the unprecedented crisis that has struck the space sector, specifically launchers, undermining the activity of many industries and accentuating distortions of the world market. The space asset 
is crucial to the concentration of professional expertise, research and technology, which characterise the development of the knowledge-based economy. It is a resource that cannot be wasted and the Commission and the European Space Agency Council have shown that they are fully aware of this. Parliament’s report stresses the role of the ESA and national agencies, and expresses its satisfaction with the framework agreement, which the European Community and the ESA supported and Parliament strongly pressed for. This framework agreement confirms the unique role of the ESA in organising research and technological and industrial development. This role must be specified in a European space programme that redefines the responsibilities of the Commission in the face of public demand and new initiatives that call for political representativeness and a specific institutional competence. Giving Europe a role as leader on the international stage, involving all the EU countries is not incompatible with the firm belief that international cooperation is necessary: cooperation, in the first instance, with the United States – thinking here of the International Space station – but also with other countries, including Russia, Japan and China itself. We must, however, be aware that the quality of international agreements – in particular those relating to space – depends on the quality of scientific, industrial and also financial support. Europe’s goals have to be supported by public resources, as is the case across the world, and by more active organisation of common policies in fields such as agriculture, telecommunications, the environment and transport. We need to give stimulus to private initiatives, as is the case with Galileo, but we need to take note that the objective of doubling the space budget in ten years will only go part way towards bridging the gap with the United States. Space science has played a pioneering role. The quality of human resources and basic research, however, warrants greater attention. The future of the European Space policy depends on this being given. This is why we believe that the next framework programme for research should dedicate more funding to the space sector, guaranteeing a quota in this field for small and medium-sized enterprises, which are becoming an indispensable support for new innovative enterprises. My final point concerns the Convention’s guideline for an arms agency that is open to all the Member States, according to the structured cooperation method. This guideline can help to implement the industrial and technological asset. This is not – and we need to make this clear – about militarising space, but rather about recognising that this is about twofold activities, both military and civil, as well as a strategy for European security that cannot be abandoned because of the temptations of US unilateralism. To avoid misinterpretations, the report refers to the United Nations resolution on prevention of an arms race in outer space and to the Convention itself, which proposes to promote peace and to contribute to security and sustainable development on earth. We are now looking forward to the White Paper, after discussing the Green Paper. Our expectations are based on the positive opinions that we have expressed thus far and they are, we believe, the expectations of the scientific world and the European industrial world too.

 Mr President, I will make two remarks on the report by Mr Gil-Robles Gil Delgado and Mr Tsatsos, which reflects the hopes but also the fears of this House. The first remark relates to the identity of Europe. I would mention the words of a great historical liberal: ‘Why we cannot help calling ourselves Christians’. The reference to Christian roots could help to strengthen the secular nature of a policy which continues to be undermined by indifference and love of power. Nevertheless, what we are calling on to unite Europe must not divide it. I am, in fact, convinced that the references to the human person and to peace, freedom and democracy, to human rights and to pluralism represent the synthesis in constitutional form of Christian and democratic values that inspired the actions of the founders of the European Community. The second remark concerns future revision of a compromise that the Intergovernmental Conference may be able to improve on, without reopening the debate on the institutional balance proposed by the Convention. The report condemns the fact that the unanimity of the States continues to apply to the Constitutions’ revision procedure, and continues to do so even in the future. I believe that the Commission’s opinion – mentioned here by Mr Barnier – must be supported, in other words that the IGC should pave the way for more flexible revision procedures that do not allow the right to veto, at least where the non-essential provisions of the Treaty are concerned.

 Mr President-in-Office, among the points on the agenda for the Italian Presidency, this Parliament has naturally paid particular attention to the Intergovernmental Conference, which should approve the Convention’s draft. The Constitution will be an historic development recalling the 1957 Treaty of Rome. Parliament, however, expects a step forward on the majority vote and a common foreign policy, which it believes is the only alternative to American unilateralism and the most worthwhile basis for Euro-Atlantic understanding. I also hope there will be some thought about the fact that human values, which are clearly expressed in the clauses of the Constitution and are there to protect the European citizenry, have Christian roots. Christianity is no restriction to the secularity of politics. The Italian Presidency has the opportunity to incorporate the trans-European networks – which the Commission’s priority projects have marked out as an objective for strengthening European territorial cohesion – into a broader programme. We must, however, allocate more resources to the research and innovation policy, as you, Mr Berlusconi, have said and Mr Prodi has confirmed, since the competitiveness of the European economy depends especially on this investment. This Presidency should, finally, put into practice the initiative outlined at Thessaloniki for an immigration policy that finds a steady balance between legality and reception; that is, one that upholds the values we read of in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Lastly, to reinvigorate Europe’s Mediterranean policy, we must be aware that no initiative involving the southern Mediterranean countries can be successful unless it is based on a strong peace policy that guarantees the security of Israel but also a homeland for the Palestinians. I wish you success in your work!

 Madam President, I too appreciated Commissioner Lamy’s statement, although I am quite aware that the future of textiles and clothing companies, which are already in difficulties because of the appreciation of the dollar, will depend on the decisions made within the WTO. Removing quantitative barriers should provide a chance of growth even for the small and medium-sized enterprises which operate in the textiles regions of Europe. These enterprises must be able to extend their interests to new markets and invent new forms of cooperation with the countries entering the international market. The abolition 
of the MultiFibre Agreement will, however, lead to a situation which is characterised by more intense, concentrated competition in the mature markets. We are not, of course, asking for protectionist measures; on the contrary, we are calling for more open, transparent markets, as Mrs Ferrer has said. It is inevitable that globalisation of the markets should facilitate the decentralisation of many traditional activities towards developing countries, where production costs are lower. The fight to eradicate poverty and disseminate prosperity must be furthered by the elimination of customs barriers, but the fact cannot be disregarded that the activities of many European industries are under greater threat from social and environmental dumping than from economic competition. We would therefore like to focus on a number of points mentioned by the Commissioner. Access must be improved for Community products, which are usually of higher quality, to third markets, many of which are protected by high 
duties and non-tariff barriers. The liberalisation process must go hand in hand with a guarantee of reciprocity, as the Commissioner has rightly said. The textiles and clothing industry must be shielded from unfair competition, which means that minimum standards of protection of the working environment must be guaranteed. Lastly, given our experiences in other fields, not least, we should explore the possibility of launching a process which makes a quality label mandatory for textiles and clothing products, to provide a guarantee to the consumer but also to curb the flows of illegal imports which jeopardise economic growth and the proper functioning of international trade.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner both for the time she has devoted to this initiative and for her comments on the matter, which confirm the Commission’s intention to develop a strategy consistent with that already presented in the Green Paper on Space Policy and with the initiatives on the Galileo joint undertaking. The motion for a resolution is a response to a growing concern: when we discuss the Green Paper with a view to the drawing up of a White Paper – in other words, of a more organic Commission proposal – we would not want to find ourselves in a situation where our goals are jeopardised by the severe crisis affecting the entire European space industry and, in particular, the new version of Ariane; nor would we want – and I believe this is one of the Commission’s concerns – the 
impasse
 
in connection with 
the Galileo project ultimately to jeopardise a highly ambitious project which has required extraordinary cooperation from the whole of European industry. We are convinced that space is a key sector for Europe and that this decision, formalised by the establishment of the European Space Agency, must be confirmed and consolidated. The Space Agency is an asset which we must not waste, and it is no coincidence that it is cited, not least in the recent action plan to increase research, as one of the major technological platforms to be considered if we are to respond to the need to make the European economy competitive. The space industry is currently experiencing a period of crisis. However, we must remember that, although the resources which have been available to it are infinitely inferior to those at the disposal of the parallel United States industry, it has succeeded in winning a sizeable share of the market and has managed to compete in those fields in which it was operating in parallel with the US initiative too, reducing Europe’s dependency on US technology in industry sectors where both were active and, not least, finding the means to cooperate positively with North American industry. We feel that this presence, this initiative must be confirmed, and it would appear from the Commission’s response – although expressed in what, as I have said, is an unplanned debate arising from the concern not to find ourselves in a situation where our plans are jeopardised and pending a more organic, comprehensive assessment – that it agrees with us. We must acknowledge that the development of the space sector is extremely important in terms of making the knowledge-based economy a practical reality, that public funding and coordination of defence policies is essential and that it can be supplemented by private investment but only in some links in the space industry value chain. We hope that these observations, which express our agreement with the Commission, will be heeded by the Council when it meets on 27 May to take decisions.

 Mr President, we all agree in acknowledging that, if Europe does not speak with one voice, it is a powerless Europe, but also in this debate, it seems that it is hard for the European Parliament to have one single voice. If we do not want the war to halt the path towards the Constitutional Treaty and towards joint foreign and defence policies, we have to prevent the rift which has divided Europe in recent weeks deepening. We were in agreement in condemning Saddam’s regime; however, we had different opinions on pre-emptive, unilateral war, since mainly innocent victims pay the price for war and since the post-war situation is still completely unclear. But what is the realistic thing to do now? We have to avoid making it more difficult for dialogue between old allies who feel the weight of their responsibility for the world’s future. We must participate in providing humanitarian aid, granting the United Nations the central role of the mandate also in the subsequent stage, in reconstructing Iraq. We must heal the rift between Europeans starting with what unites us. This is the challenge which the Spring European Council tried to keep sight of and this is why President Prodi also reminded us of the burden of war on Europe’s economic revival. This is the challenge that Parliament too must address. We must take steps towards peace – starting with peace in the Middle East – and towards the political unity of Europe.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Napolitano report addresses one of the most controversial issues facing the Convention. It is an issue which puts to the test the principle of subsidiarity and the very ideal of Europe as a community of diversities, and it involves different national historical traditions and systems whose attitudes towards regional power vary. I believe it is right for the proposal on the Union’s powers not to interfere with the systems of the individual States. We cannot, however, disregard the fact that some national Constitutions confer major legislative powers on the regions, and the Convention will have to recognise this, although without creating privileges, without upsetting the internal market and without removing the need for a political Europe. For all these reasons, I feel it is right to give the regions with legislative powers the right to approach the Court of Justice directly when their prerogatives are affected by European measures. I believe that it would be a mistake to overlook the fact that some Länder 
or 
regions – in Germany, Italy or Spain – are territorial authorities which are much larger than some of the entities established in the national States. Widespread consensus on this report, which Mr Napolitano has rightly called for – is necessary to the constitutional process, which must facilitate the participation of regional and local authorities in Europe’s future as a community.

 Mr President, the media system has developed alongside democracy, but our impression is that there has for some time been growing conflict between the two and that there is a tendency towards concentration, the result of which is, in practice, less democracy. The media has an extraordinary influence over society, but I believe we have to realise that there is only one way to resist the domination of North American investments in the media and advertising industry and that does not involve media concentration in European Union countries. In Italy, the President was moved to send a message to parliament on the matter, but I would also like to point out that the highest moral authority, Pope John Paul II, has called for clear, fair rules guaranteeing pluralism, freedom and participation, to avoid the abuse of what are extremely powerful tools having a devastating impact on people’s consciences and society. I would, however, like to point out that this issue affects other sectors as well as politics. During the recent hearing organised by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats on television without frontiers, a reporter noted that television is exacerbating the commercialisation of sport and the concentration of advertising resources. Thus, there is a growing divide between the few wealthy sports and the poor sports, and the link between television, advertising, sports rights and the owners of the major football teams is becoming increasingly close. Public television networks can provide alternatives to these tendencies, but we all know that, in the world in which we live, in a liberal society, private, commercial television companies play a major role. However, this role must not be allowed to develop in such a way that the extraordinary power to influence public opinion is concentrated in the hands of a few.

 Mr President, the resolution on the legal personality of the European Union is one of Parliament’s contributions to the Convention charged with drawing up the European Constitution. The Carnero González report stresses that the attribution of its legal personality is an essential step towards the constitutionalisation of the Treaties and improves the coherence of the various European policies. Opponents of the Union speak of a superstate, a Europe that has fallen into the hands of a stateless bureaucracy. In reality, Europe is not a threat to national identities, and national identities are not a threat to Europe. Political unity is the only way to prevent the individual countries from being overwhelmed by untamed globalisation or to prevent difficulties from making the ghosts of nationalism re-emerge. Anyway, we are not starting from scratch. In the past the Treaty has attributed legal personality to the European Communities, but with the birth of the Union there is a legal void to fill. The Council has addressed this several times, without, however, reaching clear conclusions. Public opinion and all countries that have relations with Europe are convinced that their relations are with an autonomous and unitary system. Moreover, in the sphere of foreign policy, defence and security, the European Council can deliberate on procedures that represent the beginnings of a legal personality. One has to recognise the benefits for European citizens and for the Union’s international image. It is not true that we are trying to build our common house from the roof down. Construction by pillars reveals a problem, which Mr Carnero’s proposal remedies by taking up a 1997 Parliamentary resolution on international law, Community law and the constitutions of the individual Member States. This resolution made express reference back then to the need to give the Union a legal personality. We cannot, of course, pre-empt the Convention, but this resolution gives a great boost to a constitutional process to which, in our opinion, the future of a democratic Europe is bound.

 Mr President, Mr Aznar has laid down the clear objective of ‘More Europe’ for the Spanish Presidency and has explained how he intends to carry out the programme. Time constraints dictate that we will have to focus on a small number of issues and not waste words. The first issue is the Convention, which will have to supplement the Charter of Fundamental Rights, promoting the Community method and the federalist approach as a guarantee of political democracy, economic integration and social cohesion. The second issue is the Lisbon reforms, which have now become intertwined with the launch of the euro. The single currency consolidates the single market and represents a decisive step towards political Europe and a common economic policy. The single currency strengthens Europe’s position in the face of globalisation but means that it is no longer possible for national systems to restore competitiveness by devaluing. The Stability Pact must be respected. In the interests of economic recovery and employment, therefore, the structural reforms, mentioned specifically by President Prodi, need to be pursued with the necessary determination. This strategy must be consistent with the overall goals of integration, cohesion and harmonisation of the series of policies upholding the European social model. It is not easy to pursue apparently conflicting goals in a balanced way, but this is the challenge of the present times. The third issue is the ‘political’ contribution that Europe can make to the fight against terrorism which has been occupying all the major democracies since 11 September. I call, in particular, for the reinvigoration of the Mediterranean policy and for peace initiatives in the Middle East. Spain has, on many occasions, been at the forefront of action addressing these issues. Lastly, I support the pledge made by Mr Aznar regarding Argentina, a country afflicted by a crisis which is threatening democracy itself and which could exacerbate the difficult situations of other Latin American countries.

 Mr President, if our goal is to establish a federation of States and the constituent process is to involve the Treaties, the Laeken Declaration establishing a Convention that is to propose institutional reform to the Intergovernmental Conference before the European elections and before enlargement, is a success for Parliament and the Belgian Presidency. However, the European Parliament must ensure this success does not become an illusion. This democratic challenge must be supported by a great debate open to all the citizens of the Union. As I see it, the future of Europe is in the hands, in particular, of the great political families which created the European Community and believe in integration, in the European social model, in European democracy and in European reunification. However, on certain points of the Laeken agenda, the Community process was slowed down by a cross-fire of vetoes. This is the weapon of the sceptics and populists. I refer to the deferral of the financing of Galileo, which President Prodi also mentioned, and to the failure to reach agreement on the locations of the European agencies or on the Community patent. In any case, as has just been said, these shadows reinforce the need for the Community method and majority decisions; I refer also to the security and defence policy, in which progress has been made, and to foreign policy, which is still poorly defined. Europe is standing shoulder to shoulder with the United States in the fight against terrorism, but it is also concentrating on combating the poverty which divides the world, while the situation in the Middle East has reached tragic dimensions. What should we do? Is there no way forward? I support Mr Verhofstadt’s call for a Europe whose actions are consistent with the values of freedom and solidarity, which it enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights in order to make globalisation more humane.

 Mr President, the European Council confirmed and reinforced Europe’s decision to stand shoulder to shoulder with the United States to combat terrorism and ensure internal security, and also its commitment to avoiding a humanitarian disaster in Afghanistan. After 11 September, the political geography of the world has changed radically. However, the Shanghai Summit will be more important than the restricted summit at Ghent. 
What is the European Union’s role? Is a single foreign and security policy possible? Will we be able to reinvigorate the Mediterranean initiative and work for peace in the Middle East? In reality, good intentions are often contradicted by the behaviour of certain governments, who delay integration and endeavour to take away the political influence of a Convention which should be developing the method and objectives. This is what we expect from Laeken and from an Intergovernmental Conference which needs to reform the Union before the European elections.

 Madam President, the European Parliament should take a very balanced view when its debate covers the responsibilities of national parliaments, so as not to give the impression of interfering in the various countries’ affairs in one way or another. On the G8 I share the opinion of the Council and Commission on the good and bad sides of it, but I also wonder why, every time an international summit is organised, from Seattle to Gothenburg to Genoa, conflicts break out that threaten public order, as if people were trying to fight an invisible tyrant. We should reflect on this paradox and initiate a dialogue with the young people, giving politics back its role. Violence is rejected without equivocation. Violence is incompatible with democracy, and extremism is often the cradle of violence. The violence in Genoa is being investigated by the Italian magistracy, in whom we should have every faith. There is, however, a political issue: there are various ways of defending institutions. We should not confuse the Black Block that was looking for violence with those who were exercising their right to demonstrate in the streets. That confusion leads to a spiral that produces more violence and sows the seeds of terrorism. In these situations it is very difficult to enforce the law without using force, but that is the responsibility of governments. To isolate the extremist movements we must start with the moral authority of national and European institutions and the ability to show every respect for the rights of the citizenry.

 Mr President, the Belgian presidency’s ambitions coincide with the ambitions of Parliament. There is continuity in foreign and defence policy, in the implementation of the single currency and in sustainable development, but there is also insistence on the relationship between European integration, economic competitiveness and the social agenda. We need to modernise the European social model, which is characterised by solidarity. Nevertheless, the key issue concerns the relationship between enlargement and reform of the European institutions. Enlargement must be a success for Europe. The Laeken Summit must remove the intergovernmental uncertainties of Nice. It is now a question of method and of political substance as well. The response can only be provided by a Convention which in which, first and foremost, the national parliaments and the European Parliament participate as democratic representatives of the citizens. In order to restore the citizens’ confidence in Europe, we must make the institutions of this Convention more transparent, more efficient and more democratic. This is the point – it has even been said today – on which Council, Commission and Parliament all agree. This is a challenge which is highlighted by globalisation, a challenge that we must tackle together as we work towards a European Constitution.

 Mr President, I approve of the Méndez de Vigo-Seguro report, which represents an excellent summary of the work of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. The reunification of Europe is indeed a historic turning point, but a turning point which calls for a far-reaching reform of the institutions of the Union. The Nice Summit exhausted the intergovernmental method which necessarily involves difficult mediation between national interests. What is needed now is a constituent convention to define, before the European elections, a model capable of guaranteeing democracy and efficiency in Union action. The report avoids exacerbating the argument about the Treaty of Nice, but clearly condemns its limitations. However, we cannot remain silent, waiting for Laeken, at a time when influential spokesmen of national governments are addressing issues fundamental to the future of the Union. Chancellor Schröder has spoken of a European federation, Prime Minister Jospin of a Europe of nations. I do not know what Aznar and Berlusconi will say, but I do know that the specific problems of the Community and the reform of the institutions are two sides of the same coin, and I do know that Europe must become a political area with a democratic soul. Parliament cannot stand on the sidelines of this debate. The future of Europe cannot be left entirely to market forces and confrontation between national governments. Parliament must promote a debate going beyond the pragmatism that ties the hands of the national governments. Because of the things we have heard, that debate also tells us we must be braver and more forward-looking if we claim to be realists.

 Mr President, this joint debate is tackling issues which will shortly be at the centre of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Forum. We are all convinced that the future of the Union's Mediterranean strategy depends largely on the success of the Middle East peace policy, which we must be more zealous in supporting even though it is the United States which is at the forefront of this political initiative. The success of the Euro-Mediterranean project and the concrete results of economic cooperation between the European Union and the countries of the area should benefit the peace policy. Moreover, eastwards enlargement, which received fresh impetus from the Nice Summit, must go hand in hand with an equally strong boost for the Mediterranean strategy, which has to evolve. Another boost, including financial support, is therefore needed for the Barcelona Process and the MEDA programmes, particularly the programmes targeting professional training, university exchanges, projects promoting cooperation with the Union's research centres and technology parks, and especially with the cities and regions of Mediterranean Europe. Economic and social progress must also lead to the consolidation of the areas of democracy, but, as has already been stressed, we must not lose sight of the fact that full respect for human rights is essential if the partnership is genuinely to succeed.

 Mr President, the Nice Summit has shown that Intergovernmental Conferences have reached the end of their useful life. We are on the eve of eastward enlargement, a turning point which is throwing the strategy of doing things step by step into crisis. If a response is not found to the democratic deficit of the European institutions, the Union will not be able to count on the support of the peoples. The list of problems tackled in Nice is long but, as President Prodi made quite clear, there was insufficient focus on the institutional reforms and the role of Parliament. It may be that we went to Nice with too many ambitions. Parliament's ambition does not, however, mean that it lacks a sense of responsibility. If we gave in to the realists, we would sweep the Charter of Fundamental Rights under the carpet and be content with a free trade area governed by the large corporations and national interests. Something is wrong. The young federalists who called upon the heads of government to be more courageous, to have the courage of the fathers of the European Community, have understood this. We need to set in motion a large-scale debate on the future of Europe: this must be the post-Nice process if we want to revitalise Europeanism in a profoundly different environment.
Bodrato (PPE-DE

 Mr President, with the vote on the Charter we are setting off once again along the road towards a European Constitution. The Union is a giant of the world's economy but it still lacks a soul. Although the Free Trade Area is growing and the democratic deficit is being reduced, the risk that competitiveness will start to conflict with mutual support and that a free market will encourage nostalgia for the past in social and territorial contexts which feel that their traditions and security are under threat is also on the increase. The Charter has many supporters but also many enemies, and we have heard the opinions of those who do not want a political Europe. This difference of opinions is one of the rights to freedoms recognised by the Charter itself. However, the Charter's enemies highlight the political significance but also the legal status, which does not conflict with the Treaties but reinforces the democratic perspectives. For some the Charter does not go far enough and for others it goes too far. The Members of the European People's Party, which has Christian Democrat origins, are convinced that the reference to Europe's spiritual and moral heritage will strengthen the cohesion of a Union which values cultural and political differences. The method followed by a transparent, open convention and the work carried out by Mr Méndez de Vigo and other Members deserve our full support. Now we expect Nice to produce a strategy which will make Europe a union of economic, social and political rights.

 Mr President, developing an independent European Food Safety Agency is a major objective which must be achieved in conjunction with the national structures responsible for monitoring. We must, however, ensure that in the wake of the debate on the White Paper, the fear of a bureaucratic Europe which concerns itself with the quality of products without doing anything effective to combat fraud that threatens the health of the consumer is not reinforced in the mind of the public. I, too, congratulate Mr Bowis on his report and I would just like to highlight one point. A strategy which covers the entire food chain, from farming to production and distribution, could facilitate further economic concentration to the detriment of smaller companies and companies producing typical products, without creating any real advantage for the consumers. Small companies producing typical products are the jewel of many European regions. The objective of food safety can and must fit in with this grass-roots situation which, as a large number of Members have stressed, is of cultural as well as economic value.

 Madam President, the Commission has undertaken a courageous initiative and I would like to express my support for the excellent Vidal-Quadras report on the need to deal transparently with the problems raised by the historical liabilities resulting from nuclear research carried out at the Joint Research Centre – the need to decommission obsolete installations and manage radioactive waste. I would stress certain points which have been already been touched upon several times, starting with the premise that essential health and environmental obligations must always take precedence over economic objectives, although these cannot be disregarded. It must be recognised that, for some time, the comparison between the cost of the different sources of energy has been distorted by underestimation of the cost of decommissioning the installations and waste management. Therefore, the cost of decommissioning nuclear installations must not be taken solely from European Union resources but must also be the responsibility of the Member States which are involved in the construction of installations. In terms of the budget, the cost must not be taken from the research heading but a separate line should be created, as has been suggested. Europe must use this undertaking to gain fresh experience which will allow it to tackle the extremely serious issues regarding the ex-Soviet Union and the countries of the East which are candidates for enlargement. These territories contain many nuclear power stations which will have to be closed or decommissioned in forthcoming years. We must avoid the repetition of tragedies such as Chernobyl, the consequences of which have still not all become manifest, particularly with a view to the future lives of the communities affected by that disaster.

 Mr President, I will confine myself to stressing three points tackled by Commissioner Busquin which are also referred to in the report under debate. The first concerns the close relationship between research, economic growth and employment. In order to respond to the challenge represented by the United States, the Union as a whole and certain countries in particular must allocate a higher proportion of their resources to research and facilitate investment by private companies. I subscribe to the view that we need to propose tax relief, harmonised at European level, as a guideline for the Member States.  Point two: research and development have generated an extremely well integrated system. In some areas, it is not easy to distinguish between basic and applied research. However, public financing and the European programmes need to target chiefly medium- and long-term economic and non-economic objectives, whereas competence for market-related research should lie chiefly with the firms. Thirdly, the tertiarisation of research policies and the consolidation of the role of the regions: The territorial aspect of research policies is important chiefly in terms of the transfer of scientific and technological knowledge towards the small- and medium-sized enterprises which characterise many industrial districts. Small- and medium-sized enterprises are one of European industry’s strong points, in certain countries in particular, but they are still poorly integrated into the research system.

 Mr President, I would like to emphasise some issues which, in my opinion, should be addressed much more positively in the programme of the Portuguese Presidency. We need to reconcile the Union’s enlargement with the institutional reforms that will guarantee Europe’s political role, as requested by Parliament at the IGC.  Europe has the single market and the single currency at its disposal. Nevertheless, it is right to address unemployment more vigorously and again put forward the objective of harmonising tax and social policies, which are fundamental elements of social cohesion. We must strengthen competitiveness in an increasingly globalised economy that must rise to the growing challenge of the IT revolution. We need new strategies for research, innovation and training. The document adopted by the Commission yesterday has opened a crucial debate on these matters.  The enlargement of the Union, which is mainly towards the east, is a real prospect for every European country. Nevertheless, I agree with the Portuguese Presidency that this political priority must not diminish our interest in the Mediterranean, since peace and development there will have a direct influence on Europe’s future.

 Mr President, this recommendation invites Parliament to express an opinion in keeping with the Council proposal on technical harmonisation in the automobile sector, by considering it to be an important factor in the development of the global market. The process of harmonisation aims to attain the highest levels of safety and environmental protection and is an important stimulus for quality, with advantages both for industry and for consumers.  This recommendation originates from the agreement, concluded in 1958 within the framework of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. This agreement was then broadly amended, and it was extended to States outside the Union. The European Community has thus become part of an amended agreement which now includes Japan. Nevertheless, because of a different certification system, but also for procedural reasons, the United States could not adopt a similar decision.  A Parallel Agreement was negotiated to overcome this difficulty, which allows harmonised technical regulations to be adopted, but only unanimously and without the contracting parties being obliged to mutually recognise certificates and permits. In this way, the European Community has taken on an important intermediate function, insofar as it is a contracting party of both of these agreements.  The rules laid down by the Parallel Agreement coincide with those in the UNECE agreement, but a specific decision-making procedure is anticipated when a draft regulation is not considered within the framework of the 1958 agreement. In any case, in order to include technical regulations in Community legislation it is still necessary to have a corresponding Commission directive that is adopted by Parliament under the codecision procedure. Parliament’s role is thereby guaranteed and it is anticipated that the Commission will provide Parliament with the draft regulations it wants to implement on a global scale.  I will conclude by pointing out that an opinion in keeping with this recommendation would put the European Community in a position to fully support the Parallel Agreement, and confirm its position as a leader in the harmonisation and policies of expanding the markets.

 Mr President, Mr Menrad’s report appears quite correct in giving the modernisation of labour a fundamental role in increasing productivity, competitiveness and therefore also employment. Nevertheless, the conclusions have some limits. There is competition between the Member States on labour policy and the standards of the European Social Model which does not contribute to the achievement of the objectives which we say we wish to pursue and the conditions which, in theory, are guaranteed.  When we state that the reduction of the tax burden on the cost of labour must not involve the reorganisation of public finances nor the balance of security systems, we are proposing a squaring of the circle that only strong economic growth can resolve. In reality, there is a trend to regain competitiveness by putting some social costs onto family budgets. In this way, though, the social divide will grow and, in some cases, marginalisation and fresh poverty will also increase. In any case, Europe risks in particular, in the globalisation of the markets, having to endure competition from those large economies which have invested, and continue to invest, more in technology and research, as well as in professional youth training, that is, in the future of hi-tech industries. So I think that Mr Menrad is right when, in his general conclusions, he emphasises the need for the Commission to harmonise the documents on the main lines of the economic policy and guidelines on employment. I think that, in this area, the Committee could be a very important step.  (Applause)

 Mr President, after almost twenty years and despite the commitment of the Italian magistracy and the association of the victims’ families, we still do not know the truth about the Ustica tragedy, a tragedy which affected Italian public opinion and also the wider European public opinion. The inquiries were made more difficult by the reticence and lack of cooperation shown by some countries, including countries which are Members of the European Union as well as the very Alliance which guaranteed security in Europe during those years. The mystery which continues to surround the catastrophe has ended up casting serious doubts on Italy’s democratic life and its very independence. Now, a judgement made by the Italian magistracy has outlined various scenarios which provide for military operations along the very route taken by the DC9 that disappeared into the Mediterranean that evening. Transparency is therefore an issue. Transparency is a value which this Parliament referred to decisively during the first weeks of its activities and the public has the right to trust both political and military institutions. However, we believe that it is right for the European Parliament to ask the Member States – which can participate in ascertaining the truth – to provide the magistracy with all the documentation necessary to definitively identify who was to blame. This is the moral and political significance of this joint resolution and is the reason for the urgency.

 Madam President, Mr President, from Kosovo to East Timor, the world needs Europe, the Europe of the institutions of the Union. And the European Union needs a good relationship between the Council, the Commission and Parliament in order to win the full confidence of its citizens. Mr Prodi has proved to be fully aware of these considerations. An institutional crisis would weaken the Commission but also this new Parliament at a time which is crucial for European federalism. In our political opinion, the Commission’s programme is very important in that it intends to build on past triumphs and strengthen the commitment to peace, security, stability, employment and the well-being of all Europeans, but also people from other nearby countries, to the East and South. But regarding the appointment of the Commission, the method of government is important too, in terms of its collegiate nature but also in terms of the behaviour of individual Commissioners. We think that Mr Prodi will perform the duties of President with authority regarding this matter. Taken together, the issues we have discussed allow us to express a vote of confidence in what Mr Prodi called ‘a new start’: a term commonly used to refer to the Commission, but also in my opinion, that applies to this new Parliament too.

 President Prodi, this is your third meeting with this Parliament, a Parliament which is greatly changed but which has an institutional continuity which we must all respect. We know the areas in which you intend the Commission to work, and today you have completed and spoken in greater detail of your intentions for the reform of the Institution, and you are aware of the orientation and also of the political concerns of the European Parliament. I will make three very brief points. The first is that we agree with your objective of accelerating economic union by means of a political Europe. This objective requires close collaboration between the Commission and Parliament, whose composition democratically represents the citizens of Europe and must therefore contribute fundamentally to the reform of European Institutions. This is where we must search for that European soul which is essential for the future of the continent. But although we need first of all to reestablish trust between the Institutions and the people of Europe, we consider that it will be necessary to establish a relationship of close, loyal collaboration between the European Institutions, and therefore between Parliament and the Commission. The second point concerns the objections and the debate which we will resume in September. I think that the primary reason for the objections is to verify the compatibility between the selections that you have made in putting together the team which you introduced to us today, and the general themes which you have presented to this Parliament. We fully support a strategy which is motivated by the conviction that it is essential to respect the Stability Pact, and we are in agreement with the idea that today the fundamental issue is to make Europe into a more competitive unit, in order that it can resume the path of development, and also in order to combat unemployment. However, we also consider it necessary to emphasise the opportunity to highlight the reasons why there has been recent talk of an Employment Pact as well, and the need to devote great attention to the regional imbalances which still exist in Europe. Without a European strategy from this point of view, we will run the risk that an economy such as ours will tend to concentrate its resources on the strongest areas and leave the weakest by the wayside, even though some of these have recently shown signs of great progress. The third and last thought refers to President Martens" address on behalf of the Group of the European People"s Party in this Parliament during the debate on political agendas. He expressed strong support for your candidacy, and I invite him to deal with a few issues which are holding back the activity of the Commission. I believe, however, that notwithstanding the peculiarity of the constitutional nature of relations between the Commission and the Parliament, the concerns voiced regarding the political balance which exists in this Parliament but which is not reflected in the Commission are well founded. We hope that the hearings will help us to resolve this point as well. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner de Palacio, ladies and gentlemen, as the Commissioner has mentioned, it is important not just, and not so much, to highlight the significance of this proposal for a directive, within the framework of developing a European strategy for transport systems, but also to mention that it is not the first time that the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council itself have dealt with matters relating to the transport system and transport networks and expressed their views with specific pronouncements on them and with reference to the external costs involved in their use and the associated, problematic issue of transport infrastructure charges. As regards the reference to Parliament’s contribution, certain points were highlighted on all of these occasions in the conclusions linked to individual reports and speeches: the need first of all to harmonise transport charges in all Member States to consolidate the single European market; the opportunity for a transformation – if not a radical one in some cases, then one that is objective and realistic at all times and, in any case, challenging – of the charging structure with a view to internalising the external costs of transport, which are often overlooked when decisions are made concerning the transport mode and, therefore, omitted from infrastructure completion strategies. Also highlighted was the need, in any case, to create a system of tariffs tallying with transport infrastructure use; the need to establish homogenous mechanisms for calculating the costs of each mode of transport and clearly comparing the Member States; and, finally, the need, to equip governments with transport policy instruments based on infrastructure costs so as to encourage the use of transport modes with less environmental impact and, above all, to allow for new investments in infrastructure and, in future, to complete the plan for fully implementing the major infrastructure projects for the trans-European transport networks that are also suffering from problems of financial cover. This was mentioned a short while ago and we are, moreover, all aware of it. At this stage, therefore, the governments of the Member States must address two separate issues. On the one hand, there is an increasingly urgent need to invest huge resources to satisfy the demand for transport infrastructures. On the other hand, the Member States must tackle the costs – including social costs – involved in the growth of mobility, from increased air and noise pollution to environmental problems, and above all increased congestion and rising accident rates. I cannot call to mind the figures relating to this outlook, which must also be seen in the context of enlargement and of the expected increase in demand that, as always, must be met. This is not just an issue of external costs. We know that often the construction of infrastructures and the operation of the transport system have been funded primarily from general taxation. Today, however, the new approach to the sphere of public sector activity, the ceilings on the Member States’ budgets and policies for the privatisation of services, make it essential also to have recourse to private-sector capital to finance the construction of infrastructures, even if it means sacrificing a plan for completion. I would just like to mention that if this all has to take place outside of a plan – which is acceptable to no one – of detrimentally penalising road transport, it will be necessary to guarantee alternatives because the single incentive of toll charging or the measure relating to costs would not constitute an answer to the problem, in the absence of real and competitive alternatives to redirect a proportion of the volume of traffic. Instead, in terms of costs, it would exacerbate the forced use of this infrastructure and would have general economic consequences. This is why we have tried to give guidelines and find solutions to the most sensitive and difficult aspects of the problem through the cost financing instrument, and to divert an additional set of resources to accelerate the implementation of such projects. I will conclude by lamenting the fact that a delay on this due to internal positions in the Council will today prevent a complete result. In order to achieve one, I believe that strengthening Parliament’s position could play a major role in the future development of negotiations and, to this end, I must thank all the groups and all the Members for their valuable cooperation in the work at this stage, at least in view of the objective of bringing the first reading of the report to a positive conclusion.

 Mr President, Commissioner de Palacio, I feel that I should not say too many words in order to stress, as the various rapporteurs have already done, and therefore those who spoke before me, the significance of the issues that we are dealing with, safety at sea in particular, to which the various provisions that we are considering in this joint debate are related. Not adding anything to what has already been stated, I would just say that I too support approval of a very strong initiative, which the Commission has made very effective in this direction, which we hope will find a convergence and a common direction within the Council too, as well as the completion, therefore, of legislation that we need and which, by accepting the proposals in question today, we will make our partial contribution, which will however be specific and important. As far as I am concerned, I followed one of the reports as shadow rapporteur which make up a package – the report by Mr Poignant as regards the transfer of ships, not just cargo ships but also passenger ships between the various national naval registers – and I must stress the quality 
and the usefulness of both this Commission proposal and Parliament’s reaction as set out in the Poigant report, which we fully support and we agree with the suggestions and guidelines that have, moreover, been confirmed this evening, on the possible acceptance of suggestions from both the Council and, on a point that I consider to be very important, the Commission. Finally, the text allowed us to put an end to the various Conventions being interpreted differently and will, therefore, contribute to legal certainty by also simplifying the procedure for re-flagging passenger ships between registers and will, therefore, also lessen the regulatory burden within the EU and make it less bureaucratic. What is even more important, in my view, is that it ensures the control of safety aspects – which we see as indispensable – since the proposed procedure provides for, not only better cooperation and the exchange of information between national maritime authorities but, if necessary, additional inspections on ships: it was stressed how important this is in view of an enlargement that also includes countries, such as Malta and Cyprus, that are an important point of reference on this matter because of their traditions, commitment to production, and links between vessels and the fleet. Once again I would like to praise the rapporteur and the Commission proposal and, on behalf of my group, I give my full support to the positions that have been set out.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Sommer, whom I would like to thank for your work, I feel that our debates would sometimes be simpler if we were a little more au fait 
with the order of business. I agree that this proposal for a directive will serve to simplify and, therefore, to some extent to promote the widespread use of systems of charging by means of tolls, rights of use and other means, but the subject of the directive is not so much charging as the interoperability of the different systems. For us, this was a goal which really was indispensable, in that only by guaranteeing interoperability can barriers to trade and potential distortions of the internal market be eliminated. In this sense, what we are doing is not supporting exploitative or technological monopolies but establishing the indispensable need for interoperability. I have no objection to resolute investment in pioneering technologies or the satellite sector as set out by the rapporteur. I have listened on a number of occasions to objections relating to the ‘Big Brother’ risk. I am no advocate of ‘Big Brother’, but, quite frankly, I would not like it whatever country it came from. It would not be right for any of us to be totally indifferent to Mr Bush’s ‘Big Brother’ and to be concerned solely about the European ‘Big Brother’, although, clearly, if I have to choose between them, I would choose the European branch of the family. One last point: the interoperability obligation must apply to contractual regulations too. We have to make things simpler for users and taxpayers too, with clear rules which make contractual relationships and regulations applying to individual operators flexible and open to common use by all operators. Legal, fiscal and other barriers make the obligatory reference to a single-contract system more complex.

Mr President, Commissioner de Palacio, a great deal has been said and, frankly, I would like to ask all the Members a question. We are talking as if, by adopting the compromise text before us, 
we are running the risk of plunging from paradise to purgatory, if not even to hell, where port services are concerned. Frankly, without the directive that we are about to vote on, there would be nothing stopping the individual Member States – as has been the case thus far – from adopting national legislative measures to open up the market in port services without any legal framework. I am one of those that have fought hard and I remain convinced that authorisation should have been made compulsory. We did not succeed in obtaining this, but we do have a directive that refers to subsidiarity, to what the Member States could have done, however, and that lays down reference criteria for authorisation which fully protect social, security and environment rules. Of course, this is true if an individual State wants to make authorisation compulsory. Without the directive, however, the Wild West would have been a lot wilder.
 We all know what the initial proposal was and how it was worked on. We all know the limits that were set for self-handling, 
the provisions that we abolished, those which provided for a type of Wild West without any regulations for new ports, for new sections of ports or for port sections not open to commercial services. These are the reasons why, for example, all the workers’ unions in my country, Italy – CGL, CISL, UIL – are asking us to adopt the compromise text. We are not going from paradise to purgatory. As regards what individual States could have done, I have the feeling that we have not yet reached paradise, but that we have probably climbed up from hell to purgatory.

Madam President, I do not need to emphasise the importance of the vote on this second railway package and, above all, the importance of guaranteeing that this package is also soon adopted by the Council. We all believe that we need to work to ensure that there is the necessary shift of demand for and burden on certain means of transport, road and air in particular, to avoid congestion and problems caused by excessive use, and subsequent overloading. It is, to some extent, a question of moving from intentions to facts and to specific proposals, guaranteeing competitive prices, safety, reliability and, above all, the provision of the infrastructure and the investment needed to optimise the available alternatives, beginning with the railways. Although it is necessary, I must honestly admit that I never thought that the opening up of the market and the processes of liberalisation would, in themselves, be the sole answer, a kind of a shortcut to a miracle. They have to be subject to certain conditions: if we remove ideological pretexts and inflexibility, then we must recognise that they can help and facilitate these processes. On certain conditions, of course: without a doubt, all aspects of safety, professionalism and the social protection that have to be provided for in the processes of opening up the markets and competition, are indispensable, precisely to avoid competition being achieved to the detriment of these factors and guarantees; in the same way, it is also necessary to increase the provision of universal services and services of public interest in order, once again, to prevent competition from concentrating investment and management interests solely in strong market areas where demand is high, disregarding the situations where the supply of services is crucial, rather, for encouraging and driving forward development processes, in other words to respond to what are actually inalienable needs for both freight and passenger transport services. Subject to these conditions, there must be fixed deadlines for liberalisation, although not too short, because it is only under these conditions that it is possible to guarantee private resources are contributed to infrastructure investment projects. Otherwise, they could be destined to be delayed because of the chronic difficulties that we have, as we know, in raising the necessary public funds to complete these processes. We need to guarantee the principle of reciprocity in this context, as stated in the amendments tabled before Parliament, because we believe that this will avoid distortion of the market, which has already occurred in other liberalisation processes. I hope that adequate solutions can be found which take into consideration these principles and choices in our negotiations with the Council too.

Mr President, as other Members have already done, I too would like to express my complete satisfaction that, at the conclusion of the Convention’s work on the new Constitutional Treaty for the European Union, it was confirmed that all the effects of the cohesion policies, in terms of identity and Community strategies, would be recognised in the Constitution. This means that we have to expect some difficulties and delays. They cannot, however, be a pretext for giving up, still less for renationalisation or even a mere resizing of these policies; that would be tantamount to trying to cure a headache by decapitation: I do not think that this is the route to take. More efficiency and certainly not fewer resources are, therefore, the way forward for effective simplification, Community added-value for all interventions, together with coordination with other policies, beginning with transport and research policies as well as the common agricultural policy, so that the right hand does not deny what the left is doing. The same should be true for the updated Objective 2, which cannot become a source of indiscriminate compensation, indiscriminately granted to all the regions because of the temptations that I have just mentioned. To conclude, a few observations regarding the two specific, additional problems that we are facing: as regards the statistical impact, on which much has already been said, I agree with the rapporteur’s proposals, but, regarding interventions in regions with structural territorial handicaps – islands and mountain regions – we should not forget that we are talking about structural handicaps. In this case, cohesion policies should have a definition and objective instruments that are permanent and ongoing, not one offs.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, further to the questions already raised by many of the Members in their speeches, starting with the Commissioner, the rapporteur and Mr Ojeda, I believe that this is a proposal for a directive which has technical content but cannot be reduced to just technical points. I would stress, and the reasons for this have already been emphasised, the importance of being able to recognise the qualifications of seafarers from third countries on the common bases of established qualifications, without fear of fraud; the need to simplify the procedures adopted thus far and turn to account the work of the Commission and the European Maritime Safety Agency, overcoming the difficulties and unilateral aspects of the procedures underway relating to individual certificates of capability. Against the backdrop of these factors and the solutions proposed, which we support – and in doing so pay tribute to the excellent work of the rapporteur and the conclusions which have, at last, been reached through consultation with the Council and the trialogues held – stands the essential need to reduce by some means the level of human error contributing to risks of disaster, of maritime accidents which, as we know, have taken place in the past. There is something else, however: we are dealing with the adoption of a proposal for a directive related to the opening up of the market in port services, for example, which is intended to regulate competition opportunities linked to this development too, while rigorously safeguarding the requirements of safety, environmental protection and social protection and, therefore, in this case too, the indispensable requirements of training and professional qualifications for crew members, requirements which must be taken as the basis for authorisation procedures and also for private supply and self-handling measures. For these reasons, it is of crucial importance to be able to depend on guaranteed minimum qualification requirements for crew members, whatever their country of origin. For the same reasons, I will make just one last point regarding the proposals that have been illustrated by the rapporteur. I refer to Amendment No 10, which gives crew members from third countries employed on ships flying the flag of the individual Member States equal conditions of access to qualifications and lifelong training processes. I believe that we must not waste this opportunity and that we must insist on a solution which I feel to be appropriate, which is that proposed by the Commission.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I do not agree with the view that Parliament has betrayed the voters in working on this directive. I endorse the proposal for a directive and the balance reached, thanks, not least, to Parliament’s work. I believe that opening up to the market could be positive, not least as regards access to port services, but only under the conditions specified and introduced by Parliament’s amendments: only provided that safety, professional qualifications, contractual and social rules and environmental protection are rigorously safeguarded where all the companies and all the kinds of services connected with aspects of the different port services are concerned. The same must apply to self-handling. I am not against self-handling in principle, but it must not become an excuse for promoting forms of social dumping and ways of economising on professional qualification or safety. This is transparent competition. This applies to new ports too, in order to ensure the availability of private investments. Direct control over services and providers must be possible – and is highly desirable – but with due regard for those conditions: professional qualification, contractual and social rules, environmental protection and safety. Unless these conditions are observed, we will be lumping together things which are so very different that they neither properly serve the interests we represent nor further progress towards the objectives we want to achieve with this directive. I hope that the balance achieved by Parliament can be preserved.

 Mr President, always supposing it is possible, I too would like to try and go back in time and start this debate again here in this Parliamentary Chamber, with rather a different tone from that which has characterised some of the speeches. Mr Lisi, who spoke just now, has already said that we would have expected more generosity, at least in the exercising of our function as Parliamentary representatives of the European peoples – and I repeat, the European peoples – because it is possible to address problems of whose cause we are all, all aware without being hijacked by the martyr-like, exploitative or resigned attitudes of national interests. We will make no progress at all for as long as we think that the sacrosanct protection of legitimate interests – the protection and preservation of the environment – can only be achieved by riding roughshod over and obliterating others. We will make no progress at all! I believe that the solution adopted, once again as a transitional measure, by the Caveri report is the best solution possible under the given circumstances. We are now attempting to increase what needs to be encouraged rather than what needs to be reduced: on the one hand the use of less-pollutant vehicles and, on the other, what can only be a positive process towards the definition of long-awaited pricing systems which will allow us to provide an organic response to the problem, towards the solution which can further our cause, adopting an approach certainly of recognising European priorities, which, however, presuppose the consistent shouldering of national responsibilities, those investments which, in the future, will make compatible the sacrosanct need for environmental protection and the free movement of goods, the rights, not least, of producer communities which live south of the Alps and could not be fobbed off with solutions which they considered to be merely uncalled-for restrictions. If we all decide to uphold responsibilities of this kind that the national governments have disregarded for too long and the committee’s related proposals, I believe that the next debate on this matter will be more worthy of the collective role we have to play.

 Mr President, I must first say that I find the proposal for a Commission directive highly positive. I think it could be improved, and I think it was partly improved and clarified by Parliament when it was voted on in committee; I hope it can be further improved tomorrow when the House votes on it. I do not wish to add much, or even anything, to the opinion already expressed in the debate by the Commissioner and so many other Members on the question of temporary work. Such work has made it possible to try out necessary and opportune kinds of flexible working, in some cases it has allowed workers to achieve their own plans in life, and it has provided greater opportunities to enter the labour market, which is essentially the main issue here. At this juncture, on the basis of the experience gained so far, we needed to raise the thresholds for certain minimum levels of compulsory protection and to uphold the principle of non-discrimination. I reject the argument put forward by some regarding the desire to impose a straitjacket on pay issues from above: no one can specify a Europe-wide level of pay that will be valid in all Member States. The principle to be upheld was that of non-discrimination, and that has been done, but even more can be done if, as I hope, certain proposed amendments are adopted by this House, without imposing a single model or, much less, denying the direct role of agencies in the three-way relationship that characterises this type of work. We do not want a one-dimensional Europe but rather a Europe that can retain features that give meaning to a Community model and a Community commitment, which, when necessary, stop us from throwing out the baby with the bath water or, worse still, from running the risk of throwing out the baby and keeping the bath water.

 Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the Commission and congratulating it on its initiative, as other Members have done. I would also like to thank the rapporteurs and the Parliamentary bodies and congratulate them on their work on this very complex subject, with regard to which I feel it is right to apply the principle of flexibility we cite so often. I must also thank the Commissioner and Commission Vice-President because, in this case, making a minimal, formal change to procedure, she has anticipated the line the Commission will take at the end of the debate on the amendments too. This has given us the opportunity, the subject being so complex, to specify some of the reasons for the importance we attach to the amendments and, precisely, to bring out crucial, sensitive points of the debate. The Single Sky initiative is positive, for the reasons already mentioned by all the speakers, which I will not go over again so as not to waste time or space. The guiding principles are safety, efficiency and punctuality, to quote the Commissioner herself. For this very reason, although we have chosen not to make an explicit, isolated reference to the economic side of things in some amendments, that does not mean that we do not realise its importance but that we want to avoid playing into the hands of those who have viewed this process in a negative light right from the very beginning. We often say that we must not throw the baby out with the bath water but, in this case, there are some people who have been trying, right from the beginning, to make the bath water dirty precisely so that the baby will then be thrown out, and we would like to avoid this. The same applies to the issue of cooperation between civil and military authorities. The solutions we are proposing will not resolve the problem but, if there is one way of ensuring that it is never resolved, it is not even to address the issue. The problem will arise again with regard to relations with Eurocontrol and respect for national sovereignty when we come to redefine functional airspaces too, and there are potential solutions which can enhance the positive work already achieved hitherto.

 Madam President, in my opinion, it is not surprising to see Parliament devoting such care and attention to the Commission's proposals in this report, given the role played by Trans-European networks generally in growth, competitiveness and employment policy. We welcome the harmony this first revision establishes with the White Paper guidelines, in an attempt to achieve vital consistency with strategic objectives and intervention priorities. In this respect, as has been pointed out by, inter alia
, the rapporteur, we would stress the appropriateness of an intervention that targets bottlenecks, that gives priority to actions that can deliver intermodal transport and restore balance between the different modes of transport. Road transport must not be penalised as long as no credible alternatives exist, but transport by rail and water must certainly be given a boost and we endorse action to this end. We are, of course, concerned that the list of projects does not enjoy adequate financial backing. When there is such a big discrepancy between the number of projects and funding, there is a risk that some projects will, in practice, be plundered to the benefit of others. This is why, along with our desire to see the north-south axis priority maintained, we would warn against repercussions such as the necessary intervention on the west-east axis north of the Alps on the Stuttgart-Vienna axis becoming an alternative to the Lyons-Trieste axis south of the Alps. I would conclude with a more general observation: we all eagerly await the 2004 review. This is why some of us have chosen not to have the list of Annex III interventions brought before Parliament, despite the fact that we do not endorse a method that has excluded Parliament. Next time we should have a proper preparatory inquiry that enhances the role of Parliament, which cannot run the risk of being downgraded to suit market demands, and unilateral management by the Commission and the Council is no guarantee of quality when selecting interventions.

 Mr President, with regard to the common position, I will just say that, like a number of the previous speakers, I endorse all that the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, said. I do not feel that this is a negative compromise, which, as such, would not content anybody, but a positive compromise, particularly in terms of the guarantees that it succeeds in providing: guarantees that liberalisation will be carried out gradually and in a responsible manner, without sacrificing the need for universal services in any way; clear guidelines for the processes of reorganising production and services too, aimed particularly at guaranteeing consumers high quality services at increasingly lower yet still competitive costs. I do feel, however, that the difficulty will now be preventing the Commission distorting the meaning of the text when it interprets and applies it, thus upsetting the balance reached and, worst of all, violating Parliament’s decision-making rights. This will be a particular problem when it comes to Community competition rules and the Commission departments which ensure that these rules are adhered to. The infringement procedures instigated against the Italian State and the Belgian postal service appear to disregard not just the precedence taken by special legislation over general legislation but also the base regulation, that this directive makes more explicit, banning the indiscriminate liberalisation of what are known as special or value added services, to which the specific price and weight limits introduced in the directive apply without variation. This also concerns the Commission’s attitude to terminal dues, as referred to in 
the 
Reims II agreement.
 It would also appear that the Commission is rather behind schedule in proposing to regulate access, pursuant to Article 11 of the old directive, and this delay must be made good without upsetting the balances achieved between operators on the basis of mutual commitments so that private individuals can enjoy the benefits without having to bear the burdens.
Cocilovo (PPE-DE

 Mr President, as other Members have already said, the full complexity and problematic nature of the work over which Mr Jarzembowski has presided, competently and doggedly, must be recognised, and we all hope that the final result will be positive in terms of providing the necessary safeguards for the different principles. We support the Commission’s proposal, particularly insofar as some of the amendments tabled by Parliament have helped to make opening up the port services market a viable possibility, and, although this does not in itself appear to be the most remarkable 
result, it is positive in terms of revamping services and of introducing elements of competition, provided, as some of the amendments advocate, that certain social clauses remain untouched, that certain 
requirements relating to environmental safety, professional standards and continuity of authorisations continue to be met. Parliament’s vote will make it possible to consolidate all this provided that, as far as the internal port services to be opened up to competition are concerned, there are no obscure 
exemption clauses 
which would render the scope of the directive meaningless. That applies to cargo handling and terminal services, and we feel that, in due respect not least for the principle of subsidiarity, certain services in which safety and professionalism are of paramount importance, such as pilotage, could be revitalised. Finally, subjects which do not fall within the scope of the directive must not be allowed to infiltrate it. The Commission will certainly have the opportunity to present a proposal on public financing for ports, and we look forward to it, but we must not now make the mistake of anticipating the proposal and bringing forward its introduction without a legal basis, creating unacceptable areas of discrimination between the port systems of the Member States, which differ too widely in this respect.

 Mr President, when the experiment of the Luxembourg procedure 
was set in motion in 1997 and guidelines for Member States’ employment policies adopted, it was in the conviction that a favourable climate of economic growth might not alone be sufficient to ensure automatic positive results in employment. Today, we are confirming this strategy, these undertakings and guidelines in an economic climate which we all know to be much less favourable, or, rather, full of risks, and we are therefore doing so, first and foremost, by duly recognising the need, already established at the Lisbon Summit, to bring the economic policy guidelines adopted at Community level and by the Member States into line with employment policy recommendations and guidelines. This does not diminish the specific role of the Luxembourg procedure and the economic policy guidelines in the context of what has been defined a coordination process, an open coordination process. We are aware that these alone are not enough; however, they are, or can be, decisive for maximising the effects or reducing the risks for employment, which are also linked to the economic trend. All this must be subject to certain conditions, focused on in both the Commission’s proposals, which we judged to be positive, and Parliament’s position. I will mention them very briefly: we feel that this is a process which warrants careful attention, controls and monitoring. It is not enough just to state the objectives which are then included under the principle of subsidiarity in national employment plans. There must also be consistency in terms of effectiveness and implementation: that is why we call for the adoption of auditable, reliable common indicators at Member State as well as Community level, in order to achieve national objectives without whose achievement it would subsequently be difficult to reach our common European and Community objectives. There must be consistency with budgetary policies at Member State level and at local and regional levels as well; there must be quality employment objectives seeking to combine flexibility, social dialogue, protection, rights and safety, but which also extend beyond that context to include lifelong training, integration policies and employment with a view to increasing the productivity of less elderly workers. Lastly, and most importantly, there must be equal opportunities policies and active employment policies. If these conditions are met, the contribution of the Luxembourg procedure will not be the only factor but it will certainly be decisive.

 Mr President, with only a few days before the introduction of the euro, I believe we should most of all avoid the risk of confirming a contradiction between convergence and stability policies on the one hand and, on the other, policies aiming at sustaining the processes of growth and lasting development, in accordance with the objectives of the Lisbon Summit. Bearing in mind the implementation of planned and existing automatic stabilisers, I think the objectives set in the Stability and Growth Pact should not be presented or seen as obstacles to growth or the need to respond – politically too – to the consequences of a downturn in the economic climate like the one we are now going through. Furthermore, I believe it would be just as wrong to present compliance with the Stability Pact objectives as being a sufficient or, worse still, the only possible reaction to a context with a clear risk of recession. I believe that in such circumstances there is once again a need especially to speed up progress towards two goals. The first is to specify and perfect tools of analysis and control, to ensure that public finances are used consistently and concomitantly in support of selective investment programmes that are strictly targeted and as such useful in an absolute sense – and even more necessary when compensating for the economic downturn. The second goal, confirming the positive nature of the Stability and Growth Pact, is to adapt and consolidate it so it remains in operation beyond the time when it should have reached its objectives, thus improving the conditions and strengthening the tools for an effective Community economic policy.

 Mr President, I do not know how convincing I can be in just four minutes. However, I shall at least try to make my position clear on some aspects of this report which have concerned Parliament in reaction to the Commission’s initiative and the commitments announced by the Council. Other Members have effectively summed up the most significant results of the Lisbon Summit already. The goal of full employment is once again proposed as the object of common attention and common commitment. We all know it will not be achieved tomorrow, but we declare it achievable under certain conditions. We have found a new determination to build the most open and competitive economic area in Europe based on the information and knowledge society, and updating the package of operational instruments which accompany that effort. But above all, we have asserted that these results can be achieved without adding a fourth process to the existing ones, through a solid combination of policies. There needs to be a complementary approach in economic policy, employment policy and social policy, and of course the policies being associated and combined to achieve the objectives must be compatible in terms of internal consistency. Finally, the special spring European Council provides a clear opportunity for everyone to take stock of progress made and of the effective implementation of the processes and decisions which have been taken, noting any successes and any delays, through the open method of coordination. I would like to talk about that for a moment, because open coordination is certainly different from superimposing Community policies and guidelines on the policies of the national states and societies that operate within that framework, but it is also something more than empty coordination. Open coordination cannot be a magic formula, nor can it be an empty declaration, and it should mobilise public opinion in support of a European project that guarantees transparency and effective opportunities for verification. It is not acceptable for the stability pact and convergence parameters to be backed by instruments and offices for checking, measuring and, where necessary, censure. They are backed by weapons and police forces, whereas economic policy choices consistent with the aims I referred to earlier, supporting competition and growth, active policies on employment, investment in human capital, investment in lifelong learning, equal opportunities and regaining regional structural advantages, are very often largely dependent on commitments that are so solemnly affirmed and proclaimed but so little verified or verifiable. That would disarm our advocacy, however prophetic, of the virtues of the European economic and social model. Instead, comparable data should be made available, together with a rigorous social glossary which would make it impossible to go on using the same words with different meanings, as has sometimes happened, but, most of all – which is worse – to go on using the same words and doing different things. Hence the importance of the proposal on indicators to stop us constantly changing policies to maintain the scientific phenomenon of perpetual motion, that strange experiment which keeps a process moving while at the same time preventing it from reaching any goal. (Applause)

 Mr President, I would like to add my voice to those who have expressed genuine congratulations to Mr Ferber on his work rather than merely going through the motions. His task was made difficult by the complexity of the subject and further complicated by the limits of the Commission's proposal and the delays it suffered. These limits and delays also contributed to a debate in which the ends are often confused with the means. We all agree on the fact that we need a high quality service with the lowest possible tariffs for the consumer. It appears that we all agree – and this is my personal opinion – that the lever of competition and of a progressive, gradual liberalisation is also useful for this purpose, but that it is not the end: it is the means to the end. If we think that we can put liberalisation forward as the solution to all the problems, then we are wrong, also because it would be a mistake in this sector not to recognise the need, which exists and which cannot be denied, for a universal service and for the guarantee that running the services will also provide the necessary means to cover the additional costs of the universal service. The questions that we should therefore be asking are rather: how great a monopoly is necessary in order to guarantee the provision of these means? We therefore need to have access to the studies and analyses, which differ from State to State and from country to country in order to guarantee the achievement of this objective. How can we make it possible for the services and industrial management, inside as well as outside the reserved area, to restore quality in order to reduce the reserved area necessary to guarantee those means? This will mean removing the definition of special services which, paradoxically, would prevent the operator of the reserved area from upgrading its services. I hope that, in future, the Commission will present to us studies and more comprehensive proposals as alternatives to those which have thus far constrained and limited our debate. I will back unconditionally not the compromise, but Mr Ferber's recommendations, for I feel that they are the only recommendations possible under the current conditions.

 Mr President, when drawing up this draft opinion for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Committee on Social Affairs fully appreciated the importance of this resolution, Parliament’s first resolution on economic policy guidelines since the Lisbon Summit. In particular, it stressed the importance of the connection between these two priorities and considered that the common elements of the broad guidelines of economic policy should be fully exploited and the various implementing processes adopted by the Councils over the years coordinated, and by this I am referring to the objectives of the Luxembourg, Cardiff and Cologne processes. In our opinion, the open method of coordination, which was introduced on an experimental basis in Lisbon, should allow for the full exploitation of the connection between growth and employment, which, we feel, cannot be ignored.  The subsidiarity principle needs to be steered in this direction with regard to the role both of the governments and of the decentralised institutions, without diminishing the decisive part played by greater synergy, greater coordination between the broad guidelines, and by placing greater focus on the European Community dimension with a view to developing an economic policy which can enhance the potential for development in Europe and allow us to effectively achieve the goals which we set ourselves with regard to full employment.  We have taken the chapters of the broad guidelines into account, in particular the aspects related to the introduction of flexibility and efficiency elements in the products market, the financial services market and the labour market, but we have also acknowledged the importance of the negotiations of the Social Partners and of social objectives.  A further consideration: we consider – and for the remainder we refer you to the text of the opinion – that Parliament’s role in this matter must be consolidated by formal institution of the procedure laying down a specific interinstitutional agreement on the participation of Parliament in formal consultations on the economic policy guidelines and on the monitoring of their effects.

 I will be very brief, Madam President. Moreover, I feel that this issue should be discussed in more detail, perhaps at a more convenient time.  I subscribe to the view that Parliament should work on Fridays. Solutions can, in all probability, be found by putting debates rather than voting sessions on the agenda, for we are all aware that Fridays are convenient for interaction with the Commission and, therefore, important in terms of our political work in the area of our function as MEPs representing our home territories. When we discuss this issue, it would, however, be preferable for Members to refrain, when considering the action to be taken, from laying themselves open to misrepresentative publicity regarding the nature of Parliament’s function. There are certain types of action which give our countries and our electorate the impression that, in actual fact, the European Parliament spends its time fooling around and doing no work. The effect of these actions is therefore damaging, whatever the motive behind them. I therefore hope that we will be responsible enough to reach a point at which the debate can brought to a definitive conclusion without going down a path which none of us want to take and without laying ourselves open to criticism.
Cocilovo (PPE-DE

 – (IT) Mr President, this debate has already revealed substantial convergence of all the positions around an awareness of the importance of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership’s development of the Barcelona Process in defining the very essence of Europe and its strategy at the dawn of the third millennium, in terms of peaceful coexistence in an atmosphere of stability and security for its peoples, and of a socio-economic development plan and project which is also based on total respect for fundamental human, civil and political rights. All this helps to shape the development of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership and give it direction.  Along with other Members who have spoken, I am convinced that, although there have been delays, these may not all be due to technical factors, but also to the basic intention – which I do not support – to reduce this process to the creation of a free trade area, and I am not denying the importance of a free trade area. The development of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership must mean more than this: there is no doubting the fact that it must also promote an infrastructure which is linked to the values of the civil societies, to cultural, social, tourist and sporting exchanges, and linked to the development of these contributions, which are not directly related to the creation of a free trade area but which complement it. We must not spoil the ship for a hap’orth of tar, as they say. Therefore, we need an active undertaking from the Commission and the Council, openly supported by Parliament, to make more resources available to sustain the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, a level of resources which is proportionate to the resources already used to sustain eastward enlargement. The Cannes European Council made a commitment of this kind, and it should not be forgotten. We must contribute to the development of a favourable climate for private investment, with technical assistance support which provides the same kind of support and aid for these third countries as that supplied to the CEE countries, the possibility of an interregional and transnational cooperation programme aimed at achieving complementarity and integration between the countries of the Mediterranean Basin through coordination between the MEDA and INTERREG programmes, and the possibility of a new generation of programmes to remedy the current fragmentation and inefficiency of a host of Community programmes for the Southern Mediterranean, which, at a rough count, already involve over seventeen different Directorates of the Commission and countless microprojects which, in all probability, do not fulfil this purpose.   My proposals have been specific as other Members have already covered the more strategic, political points.
Cocilovo (PPE-DE

 Mr President, I am taking the floor to speak about INTERREG, but I shall confine myself to a few criticisms, which will clearly also enable me to keep to my speaking time. We have all spoken favourably of this programme’s confirmation and of the extension of the sectors it covers to include the field of transnational and interregional cooperation, in addition to cross-border cooperation. However, this does not blind us to the fact that the majority of resources – 50-80% – will be reserved for cross-border cooperation, for INTERREG IIIA. Therefore, we still think the decision to consolidate the current areas of cooperation in this strand, regarding the selection of eligible regions, is wrong and contradictory. We hope that the Commission will want to look into this and acknowledge Parliament’s position in practical terms, and not just with a formal tribute. Cross-border cooperation continues almost exclusively to be an issue concerning landlocked areas and, where exceptions have been made for maritime areas, their selection is not transparent and they often suffer from compensation from other Community policies.  This discrimination is much more serious for islands that have a regional status that can only be linked to areas of an exclusively maritime nature. This is in line with ongoing discrimination, which ignores Article 158 of the Treaty on island regions with regard to cohesion policies. More serious still is the fact that this is occurring while ignoring the new situation associated with the approach that has been adopted towards the enlargement process for the inclusion of regions such as Malta. This has given rise to the proposals we are making to at least extend the regions eligible to include the NUTS III Sicilian provinces which have a frontier with Malta and to include all the regions of the Adriatic which share a frontier with Balkan regions.
Cocilovo (PPE

 Mr President, I too would like to voice my appreciation of the rapporteur’s excellent work carried out in difficult conditions on a difficult subject.  Two circumstances have shown us that this is a difficult matter: an almost unanimous joint agreement on the urgency and importance of adopting efficient policies to combat unemployment and for this to happen within a framework where the necessary support for a positive economic process will safeguard social cohesion and the European social model.  That the conditions are complicated is shown by the way our agreement on these objectives often runs the risk of collapsing when it comes to establishing the solutions and strategies for action. I will therefore concentrate on the things that I believe can be strengthened in the future and which can form one of the elements to be discussed in our debate. Firstly, I think that, as regards supply policies to boost employment, our intervention, the joint intervention of the Community institutions of the Member States, is important but it is not enough. I think there is insufficient coordination between the policies on labour, employment, and managing the job market and the policies which affect structural factors and in the macro-economic framework. There is an insufficient level of structuring and investment in efficient Community institutions capable of managing these processes where it is not enough just to respect the competences and the prerogatives of the national States. Regarding this matter, I would mention only one problem for the Members who, on the other hand, always show this sensitivity in particular. We consider unemployment to be an evil to combat, certainly not a circumstance to exploit even in the competition between countries’ economic systems and production systems for instrumental competition based on social dumping. I have never fully understood what is meant when reference is made to a job with a social content but, on the other hand, I definitely do know that a perspective of increasing employment by reducing the fundamental safeguards and fundamental objectives of social cohesion is not possible.  Finally, as regards active policies on the job market, training and retraining, all important guidelines, I think the level of consensus is insufficient, even on credible gauges of the effectiveness of these policies within national plans on employment, with regard to which the whole range of Community Institutions is, in any case, committed to assessing the successes and results. When we abandon compensatory policies and passive polices in favour of active policies, we cannot be satisfied by a casual use of words. What counts in gaining qualifications, training and retraining is action. When talking about the suffering of millions of people, statistics are often deceptive. We cannot allow them to be used as drunkards sometimes use lampposts – as support when they are unsteady, instead of to light up the way forwards.
